105,Great gin tasting,Spent a lovely afternoon doing the signature gin tasting experience. Viviane was great - very knowledgeable and lovely company. We Learnt lots about various guns and we really enjoyed the tasting. We would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a few g&ts.,5,2024,10,17
105,Our new go to home from home in London,"From the moment we approached the front entrance to the moment we loved every second of our short stay the Chesterfield Mayfair.
Our check-in at reception on arrival was the best check-in experience I've ever had in the UK and made us feel like we were their only guests that weekend. 
We had arrived about three hours before the designated check-in time, but our room was already ready, which was a great bonus.
There was no 'the lift is around the corner on your right', instead one of the doormen led us to the lift and called it for us.
Shortly after arriving in our bedroom, which was immaculate and luxurious, we received a call from reception to check that we were happy with our room and asking if there was anything we wanted.
After leaving our room to head downstairs for lunch we walked along a corridor where all the signs of the zodiac were embossed in very large gold discs surrounded by wood and tastefully framed and hung along the walls.
We had lunch in the Terrace Bar. As soon as we sat down one of the bar staff provided us with a plate with a bowl of olives, twiglets and popcorn along with a menu.
For lunch we ordered one Buttermilk Chicken Burger and one Steak Sandwich, both of which were delicious and the steak had been cooked exactly to order. This was accompanied by a delicious bottle of Campo dell Olio Gavi di Gavi.
The service in the Terrace Bar was superb from start to finish and every member of staff was working exceedingly hard, yet smiling and always looking around to see if any of the guests needed anything, or if anything needed to be cleared away.
After a brilliant Bruce Springsteen concert in Hyde Park, we returned to the Terrace Bar and sank into two leather Chesterfield wing backed armchairs for a G&T and a 'naughty' Chesterfield Club Sandwich, which is by far the best Club Sandwich I have had anywhere in the world. I then further indulged in an 'Old Fashioned' cocktail, which was perfectly made.
Again, despite the Terrace Bar being full with guests returning from the Bruce Springsteen concert, the bar staff never missed a beat and their service was excellent.
After an exceedingly comfortable night's sleep and a lovely shower, we ventured down to Butlers Restaurant for breakfast, where we were treated to a delicious Eggs Royale and Full English, accompanied by freshly squeezed orange juice and tea and coffee.
As with the Terrace Bar, the service in Butlers Restaurant was excellent and friendly.
Checking out at reception was as friendly as checking in.
The Chesterfield Mayfair will now be our go to hotel whenever we stay over in London.
Thank you to all at the Chesterfield Mayfair for making our Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen weekend even more memorable for all the right reasons.",5,2023,07,14
105,Better than Expected,"I just have to say that this hotel is everything it represents, Excelency, Service beyond expectations and a wonderfull atmosphere.

105,Wonderful afternoon tea,"We loved our afternoon tea here, we were made to feel so special and Jade was brilliant at looking after us. The cakes and and drinks were so cleverly made and tasted wonderful, and the very generous bag of pic n mix as we left finished the experience off so well!",5,2024,10,14
105,Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"My husband and I have just returned from a stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel and it was fabulous!  This was our first trip to London and we were celebrating my husband’s 60th birthday so it was a special trip.  The hotel definitely was a big part in making our trip really nice.  Our junior suite was absolutely beautiful! All of the amenities - from the coffee’s and tea’s and bottled waters and snacks - made coming back to our room something we looked forward to.  The hotel itself was outstanding!  We enjoyed cocktails and a club sandwich in the Terrace Bar, breakfast every morning in the Butler’s restaurant as well as our High Tea experience.  The best part of our whole experience was the staff.  Everyone and we mean everyone was pleasant and attentive to all of our needs!  We travel quite a bit and the customer service of this hotel was exceptional!  We would like to give a special shout out to Josevz who greeted us when we first checked in and made sure we were comfortable until our room was ready and gave us great instructions on how to get to our destinations and always with a smile.  Please let him know his friendly hospitality was much appreciated!
 
Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2024,10,12
105,We love the Chesterfield!,"My sister and I hate to leave the Chesterfield Mayfair tomorrow.  The staff has made our stay in London so memorable. Joseph, Jake,, Ellen,, Vy, Louis, Musfasta,  and Jane catered to our every need and made us feel trike the only guests in the hotel.  This is such a posh hotel but not at all snooty.  We will be back!",5,2024,10,11
105,Afternoon Tea Delish!,"This was my second time coming here for afternoon tea. I stayed here in the past and loved it but this review is for the restaurant for afternoon tea. The service is spot on, five star! They are friendly, hospitable and just really nice! I was there with my daughter, my mom, my niece and a friend, we all loved it. The food was fresh and tasty. They give you so much food too, plus a takeaway box for whatever you don't finish. Then at the end, you get to fill a bag with CANDY!! Soooo fun!!
What I love about this place is that it really is English style but not stuffy.",5,2024,10,10
105,Wonderful experience!,"We have just spent four nights at the Chesterfield for our Golden Wedding Anniversary. From the moment we stepped through the door, everything went so smoothly. The staff were all friendly and helpful - couldn't do enough for us. A complementary chocolate mousse cake was delivered to our room after about an hour with a card. We didn't eat in the restaurant for dinner as we had a full itinerary planned including trying several other London restaurants, but we did have breakfast there, and it was the best hotel breakfast we have ever had. Eggs were perfectly cooked, both the scrambled and poached, the buttermilk pancakes were so soft and tender and every other item was delicious. Our room was quite small, but the bathroom had a bath, which for me is essential as I do love a bath in the evening! The hotel is only a few minutes walk away from Green Park tube station which made travelling around easy, although the staff could whistle up a taxi in no time if needed!We would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,10,09
105,A great getaway to luxury,Great service from top to bottom. Loris did a great job coordinating travel too and from the airport.  Our waiter for dinner last night in the restaurant was amazing as was the doorstaff.   A shining experience from top to bottom.  The food in the bar and the restaurant was great and the gin and tonic selection was an exciting surprise.,5,2024,10,08
105,Afternoon tea,Had an amazing experience when we had our afternoon tea there with my sister. Jade was an amazing host and helped us through the afternoon tea. We had a very nice experience and would definitely recommend it. And one of the best things is that they offer halal sandwiches which was a dealbreaker for us. The scones was the best thing:),5,2024,10,08
105,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at the chesterfield was amazing.  An old fashioned sweetie theme certainly took us all back to our childhood likes.  We opted for the rose champagne just to make it all the more special.  Waited on by Jade who couldn’t do enough for us.  She was friendly, knowledgable and very attentive.",5,2024,10,07
105,Private Club Atmospherics,The Chesterfield has the atmospherics of a private club in St. James's.  It transports you back in tradition and forward in excellence.  I will come back again time after time. Perfect in every way imaginable.  The restaurant is first rate and the bar alluring.,5,2024,10,05
105,The most amazing experience ,"I cannot say enough about my experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I was practically treated like a Queen.  The staff members are extremely polite,  professional and courteous. I will definitely stay here on my next visit to  London.  The hotel room was very cozy and comfortable.  Very reasonable pricing. Again, my main appreciation and gratitude is towards the staff here at this hotel.  ",5,2024,10,05
105,A wonderful hotel experience,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and it was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had.

The hotel is ideally located in Mayfair, a relatively quiet enclave within London, and is close to many clubs, restaurants, shops and several peaceful parks. The property is beautiful, extremely well maintained and has an intimate feeling of a London townhouse rather than a large hotel. 

The staff reinforces that quality, and could not be more attentive and obliging. Everyone gives off the sense of belonging to a family, and they made us feel part of that.

We had breakfast every morning in the hotel dining room and several casual dinners in the bar. All meals were delicious, the service was excellent and the ambiance lovely.

Particularly helpful to us during our stay were Ellen, the Reception Manager, the breakfast team of Liliya, Jade and Joselito, the Concierge Loris, Sam at the reception desk and Francisco at the bar. There were many other outstanding staff members whose names I didn’t get or cannot recall.

We plan to return to London next year and, based on our recent experience, we cannot think of staying anywhere else in the City.",5,2024,10,01
105,Wonderful Experience,"My husband and I stayed here 4 nights and had the most wonderful experience! The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed having our nightly turn down service. 

We had the pleasure of visiting the Butlers restaurant, as well as the afternoon tea. 
In both restaurants we were waited on by Jade who was friendly and had amazing customer service. She truly made our dinning experience so much more enjoyable! 

The location of the hotel allowed us to easily walk to near by attractions. The hotel itself was clean and very charming. We will certainly be back the next time we visit London.",5,2024,10,01
105,"Jade, the cherry on top of a great experience","It is a safe and warm cocoon that makes you forget that you are in the middle of Mayfair. The staff is super friendly and the service is top notch. I want to give extra credit and praises to Jade who served us at breakfast. Wonderful, warm and a true professional. Million of thanks to Jade!",5,2024,10,01
105,"Perfect Location, Attentive Service, Comfortable Rooms","Second time visiting The Chesterfield Mayfair and both times the reception and experience were consistently exceptional: lovely decor, attentive staff, and comfortable rooms that are expertly appointed. The location cannot be beat - you are within walking distance of London's best attractions. Opted for their yummy breakfast each day and met one of their superstars named Jade who works in the restaurant - she brightened every customer's day with her bubbly and welcoming manner. Well done, all around!",4,2024,09,30
105,"Wonderful , old world type hotel","One of the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff is amazing ,  especially Jade who was our server for both days at breakfast.   The location of course is perfect,  but the whole ambiance was more than Expected! I highly recommend and also the Terrace restaurant for dinner!",5,2024,09,29
105,Top Flight Service at Chesterfield Mayfair,"My wife and I stayed at the Chestefield Mayfair in September 2024.  We have traveled extensively to London and other major cities throughout Europe.  I must say that the best service I have ever experienced at any hotel was the service rendered by this hotel. The entire staff went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed every experience at the hotel.  The room was comfortable in every way and the food - daily breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner were all outstanding.  This is wonderful boutique hotel in London.",5,2024,09,28
105,The Terrace Bar @ The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Been to visiting The Terrace Bar last 3 weeks for an evening drink. Nice ambience, good pianist playing amazing tunes. Decent public all nights.

A big thanks to the Bar Team: Francisco G. / Elias R. / Enrique T. and specially Gemma S. who as definitely made us feel at home in a bar. Apologies if i missed one of the team member. The whole team went all ears to us.

105,"Perfect stay, like always !","Like always for many years now, more than a very pleasant experience! Even if going for business, I always enjoy staying in Chesterfield. Quiet and very well placed, service is either at the right or even above expected level, employees are very serviceable, breakfast is really good, you can enjoy pleasant piano ambiance at the bar. 🌟Special thanks to Istvan Mustafa 🌟this morning in helping to find a taxi in this really raining morning👍
Restaurant is really quiet and menu offering enough options for many different dinning experiences.
I’m used to come every month or so and will continue. Do not wait last minute to book or you’re going to cry to find another so good compromise place. it’s success is self explanatory 👏",5,2024,09,27
105,Would recommend to others.,"Wonderful 5 days spent in London while staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The entire staff at the Chesterfield were very attentive and professional.  Our server, Jade, was very pleasant for each morning's breakfast and Enrique, in the bar, took great care of us.  Thank you to all.",5,2024,09,26
105,A Fine Week in London - Chesterfield Mayfair,"We stayed here for 7 nights Sept 17-24. 2024.  I think this may be the most attentive, helpful, friendly facility and staff I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  Starting with reservation process, clear concise room descriptions with pricing that was accurate without hidden charges so prevalent in the industry today.  
Rooms are spotless with top quality linens and bedding, plenty of charging spots for all the devices we now carry, very efficient design to maximize storage of clothing and accessories.
Staff, oh the staff, are so engaging and want to assist in anything you need.  No averting their eyes when they see you coming their way.  You are greeted with a smile and a ""May I help you?""
To begin with there were the concierges.  We had a small emergency.  My girlfriend had a dental bridge become unattached at about 4:30 one afternoon.  She went to the concierge on duty, DARREN, and asked him if he could help get her a dentist to take a look.  Long story short, he made her an appointment with an oral surgeon that night at 8:00 pm and by 10:00 pm we were walking out of Baker St Dental Clinic with her smile intact.
There was a similar experience our friends had with JAKE.  I will not bore you with details, he got her into a physician's office in less than two hours and well taken care of the same day.
Both JAKE and DARREN were most helpful advising us on when and how to visit sights, securing tickets when necessary while we were out enjoying our time in the city.  Excellent recommendations for dining choices, we ate 5 different cuisines over five nights all within walking distance and woderful food and ambience.
Doorman VITALI was most helpful and a joy to talk with as he helped with handling bags, offering an umbrella when rain was threatening and getting taxis or giving directions to close by shops.
The restaurant has exquisite service and the quality of the food and menu were excellent.  We only had one dinner there since we wanted to avail ourselves of the variety of cuisines from around the world in this city known for the diversity of its population.  Be that as it may, the dinner we had our first night there was excellent.
I had most experience with the breakfast service, so I can name names of most but not all of the excellent severs and attendants.  I had breakfast in the hotel with my girlfriend and our friends 7 straight mornings.  Food quality, preparation, the look of the tables were terrific.  The table settings were so perfectly laid.  I watched as SLAVENA who I assume was a manager showed a new waiter, GENE, how to set the table with perfect placement.  Moving the cup and saucer, the folded napkin, the cutlery inches until they were set to the standard the dining room demands.
Service was prompt and I was always met with a smile.  I want to mention the other members of the serving staff, JADE, JOSELITO, MARILENE?  Not sure I got that last name correct and that is not the whole list.  Some of the great staff in the restaurant and at the front reception desk were exceptional. 
These are only the people whose names I asked for when I had time to write them down.
Lastly, the location in Mayfair section of London is full of fine restaurants, pubs, bars and cafes, beautiful streets, upscale neighborhood with Rolls, Bentley, Ferrari, Porsche, Aston and Lotus on the streets and in the dealers showrooms.  I'm a car guy so I was in heaven.
Don't miss it.",5,2024,09,25
105,Loved our stay here,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Located on a quiet street in posh Mayfair, the hotel is within walking distance of virtually everything in Central London, from Hyde Park, Harrod's, Piccadilly Circus, Shepherd Market, and virtually every high end name brand shop imaginable. Tons of restaurants to choose from, an excellent wine shop (Hedonism Wines) nearby. The hotel itself is a class act. Prompt friendly service. The high tea service is fun. We enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast on our last morning. Our room was smallish but the bed was comfy, and we had the best room service we've ever had! Definitely recommend.",5,2024,09,24
105,We really felt welcome at the Chesterfield Mayfair.,"My wife and I (from California) capped off two weeks in Wales and England with four nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Brilliant way to end a vacation.  Perfect location in central London.  The staff was amazing, in particular Ellen O'Neill (Front Desk Manager), who really took care of us and made the stay even better.  Can't say enough about the breakfast from the service to the food.",5,2024,09,23
105,"WHEN IN LONDON, STAY HERE!","Great hotel.  Rooms, dining, bar, cleanliness, and service was excellent.  Kudos to everyone Including Jake, the head concierge and his staff:  Darren, Mustafa, Jozeph, Jade, Loris, and Sam; also to Jade in the dining room. We felt like family.",5,2024,09,23
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair is EXCEPTIONAL,"I cannot recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair highly enough! My wife and I spent a week at this wonderful property to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and could not have had a better experience. The staff made us feel like VIP's with every interaction. Jake even walked us to a restaurant in Shepherd Square after we asked him for a recommendation! The bed was wonderfully comfortable, and the property could not have been cleaner! The next time we are in London we will stay here again.",5,2024,09,23
105,Celebrating Our 25th Wedding Anniversary.,"My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary recently at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.The team immediately made us feel welcome.When we arrived we were greeted by Vitali.Joseph kindly brought our luggage to be stored.Ellen and Jake met us with a welcome glass of champagne.Our check in with Yanky was effortless.As our room wasn't quite ready,we being very early,so we relaxed in the bar where Francisco and Gemma ensured we had everything we needed.Later that evening we enjoyed a lovely dinner in the restaurant served by Sakib and Clemont.Robert arranged a celebratorycheesecake for us.(I believe it was Mrs.Tollmans own recipe).During our stay Christine and her team took great care of our room.Darren the concierge gave us some great recommendations about the area and even helped us to arrange reservations.Our checkout with Vy was super efficient.Mustafa arranged a taxi to get us on our way.Overall great experience,will be back soon.",5,2024,09,22
105,London hospitality at its finest!,"The hotel was beautiful and in a perfect location! The staff were all very friendly, courteous and knowledgeable.  We ate in the hotel restaurant, Butler's the night of our arrival and Clement and staff were excellent,as was the food!  The Bar was a welcome respite from the hectic outside world with terrific crafted drinks!  The Concierge staff arranged for our airport transfers and we had it put on our hotel bill for convenience.  The room, a junior suite, The Berkerly, was lovely and comfortable.  When we return to London, the Chesterfield will be our first choice and we recommend it highly!  Cheers!",5,2024,09,22
105,First time in London,"From the moment we arrived until our departure, this place was exceptional. The location was perfect and central to many of London’s attractions. The food was delicious and presentation was remarkable. Every single employee that we encountered with was courteous and welcoming. We absolutely loved our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Jade and Francisco and Maina were the three individuals that stood out. We apologize for not getting every single individual’s name because truly everyone was amazing. Thank you for making our stay so memorable and we can’t wait to come back someday soon. 

Our sincere thanks and appreciation, 
Craig and Anita Drysdale",5,2024,09,22
105,10 Star Hotel,"Amazing hotel! It's beautiful, the breakfast is great and it's in a convenient location. The service is phenomenal. We had an issue checking in and Ellen, the manager, went above and beyond to help (and also solved the problem). I've stayed at some of the top hotels in London and I prefer the Chesterfield.",5,2024,09,21
105,Nice hotel but where are the drawers?,"A lovely hotel. The food at the gorgeous restaurant is excellent. REALLY REALLY good. The renovated rooms are nice. Our was sufficiently large (but one wouldn't call it large) but Rich and El had quite a small room. All the employees are lovely and helpful. Service was great. A few room service glitches, Concierge quite helpful. Very professional. We loved our stay there. And very well located.

The room suffers from the recent hotel trend of having no drawers. None. This is unacceptable and a ridiculous, non-customer centric trend. We had to ask for a second luggage rack so we could use suitcases as drawers. While our room was large enough to manage this our family’s smaller room was not. Very inconvenient. I am not sure what the expectation is--Not all clothing is hangable--underwear, for example-- and living out of suitcases is difficult, at best. We have seen this increasingly in hotels and for a long stay it really is unacceptable. A deal breaker for us.

I think it would be wise to make sure there are drawers or plenty of shelves in a long stay hotel. If a small cruise ship can do it, a hotel can do it.

 Also our room seemed to be near a staff gathering place  for housekeeper instruction and they conversed in normal tones and made other disruptive noises fairly early in the morning and all throughout the day, disturbing our peace.

We would stay here again if not for the lack of drawers.",4,2024,09,21
105,Perfect for us!,"Perhaps it was the passion of the staff, the personal service, the opulent lobby, restaurant and rooms…it was my favorite of all of our 2 1/2 week vacation. We were treated like royalty. The linens were sumptuous, great turndown service, punctual pick up for the airport…fabulous!",5,2024,09,21
105,"Our ""Home"" in London","The Chesterfield is our go to place whenever we are in London.  We love the neighborhood of course, but it is the service and attention to detail that makes this one of our favorite hotels.
 
The ambience of the lobby enveloped us upon arrival – impeccable staff and décor. Likewise, our rooms were lovey with elegant appointments. We enjoy a nightcap in the piano bar too.
 
This last trip we were especially impressed by the attentive personal service bestowed upon us by concierge, Loris Lucchini.  He is a consummate professional.  He graciously made recommendations for dinners, museum collections, as well as our train travel.  He was thoughtful, charming, and sincere in providing us with everything we could possibly need.  In fact, each morning he would send us off with a cheery encounter then greet us so warmly upon our return at days end.  He made it feel like we were indeed returning to “home”.  
 
The Chesterfield really is our ‘home’ in London and this past trip Mr. Lucchini made it even more personal.  We observed him interacting with many guests – he has a unique gift for connecting to people. He is a treasure.  
 
Our thanks to you for running such an elegant establishment.  Mr. Lucchini is exceptional; we eagerly await seeing him again soon.",5,2024,09,20
105,Spectacular hotel & fantastic staffing!,"Firstly I would like to publicly thank all of the staff at The Chesterfield Mayfair for their superb professionalism, efficiency and support with making our event run so smoothly. 

I can’t recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair enough. We booked 3 spaces at the hotel for a fashion show and the event was spectacular, from their back of house team assisting us with the removal of tables and chairs where necessary, to the front of house team with greeting our guests and directing them to the locations that they needed to be in. 

The staff were all so polite and very helpful. The show ran beautifully and we will definitely be more than happy to hire spaces at The Chesterfield again in the future! 

Thank you!",5,2024,09,20
105,Chic and Luxurious Hotel,"We could not have had a better experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair!

105,"The Chesterfield Mayfair...Comfort, Courtesy, Civility and Great in a Crisis","The first time we stepped out of our London black cab at the Chesterfield Mayfair, I saw a top-hatted liveried doorman smiling at me; (down the rabbit hole I went). We were ushered into a well furnished lobby and our bags quickly followed. Jake, the consierge, offered us refreshments while we checked it. We weary travellers gratefully accepted hot tea and a cold coca cola.

Our room felt ""jolly old England"" with prints of English gentlemen all about and an excellent tea tray, refreshed daily, found within the TV cabinet. I made french press coffee each morning complete with real bottled milk and tasty packaged biscuits. Chamomile tea before bed with, you guessed it, more biscuits!
If you like more room, a larger suite might be best but we were snug and comfortable. An interesting aside, the walls are covered with padded fabric which added to the quiet for sleeping.

The first day my husband had a sudden shock. We'd only been abroad 12 hours and he'd lost his cell phone!  When exiting the airport transfer car, he'd laid it down to unlock the door and ""poof!"" It was gone.

Jake came to our rescue, calling the car service who then contacted the driver who'd already headed home. We were so relieved to have it returned the next day. Tragedy remedied by the Chesterfield.

The dining room at the Chesterfield Mayfair is elegant and so very English. Heavy linen tablecloths, flowers, toast racks, paintings, and excellent service from all staff the minute you arrive. 

We want to especially thank Jake, Darren, Loris, Sam, Jade, Joseph, Robert, Mustafa and Vitali for making our first stay in London so memorable. ""Cheers, mates!""",5,2024,09,18
105,"Bravo, A Hotel at The Top of Its Game","I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair during late August and early September 2024.  I have family who owns a hotel in England outside of London.  I know a good hotel and restaurant when I see one.  This hotel ticks all the boxes for location, quiet neighborhood off of Berkeley Square, experienced staff, clean and well-appointed rooms, and a service ethic that is genuine by all levels of staff.  Bravo to Mr. Lake, the General Manager, and a ""shout-out"" to Yankey, Front Desk; Jade, the Restaurant; Josef, Front of House, and Mr. Biago Sarubbi, Deputy Gen. Mgr.

105,Amazing Tea Party,"I recently arranged a tea party for a group of 23 people for my friend's Hen party, and we were given the beautiful Charles Suite due to our group size. From start to finish, the experience was flawless. The room was beautiful, the display on arrival ensured that all guests knew exactly where to go, setting a warm and welcoming tone.

The communication from the events manager was outstanding—every single detail was discussed and delivered exactly as we had envisioned. We were greeted with Prosecco upon arrival, and tea was served shortly after, perfectly timed for when the guests had settled in.

The tea itself was absolutely delicious, with every guest thoroughly enjoying the selection. They also went above and beyond to accommodate specific dietary needs, including allergies. The service was exceptional, attentive, and friendly throughout the event.

We had such a wonderful time that we forgot to take as many pictures as we should have! A special thank you to Roberta for her incredible support in organising such a memorable afternoon.",5,2024,09,12

105,Great Customer Service,"I would highly recommend this boutique hotel to anyone wanting the most amazing customer service!  Location is amazing, and very close to the tube.  A  short walk to Buckingham Palace and other areas in Mayfair.    Every night we would go to the bar (where live music is playing) and wind down with one of their wonderful cocktails.  In the morning we would go there for coffee.   Every single person working at The Chesterfield is wonderful.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,09,09
105,Exceptional and Luxurious,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for two nights whilst we attended a wedding. We received excellent treatment and service, the rooms are very well appointed and every member of staff was attentive and welcoming. On the Sunday morning we were privileged to be served by Jade who was personable, friendly and truly an asset to the hotel.",5,2024,09,08
105,AWESOME Experience,"We recently stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair.  

As someone who travels very frequently, I have to say that this is the best service I have ever received globally (specifically Mustafa). 

The location is all-time and the attentiveness at the Temple Bar (Lobbade our stay feel extremely comfortable. 

Will definitely be staying here on our next trip to London.",5,2024,09,08
105,Lovely stay!,"Thank you for a wonderful stay! We had a fantastic time here. The room was cosy with British charm, accessible to a lot of places you’d want to visit in London. The dinner was sensational In particular the Dover sole which was expertly deboned by Tun. The staff here as so attentive and really make your stay here special. From the doormen to the breakfast staff there was such a high standard upheld. Would definitely recommend visiting the bar, particularly when John is playing the piano. It adds such a relaxing atmosphere to the place, even better when enjoying one of the fab cocktails they have on offer!",5,2024,09,06
105,"Great hotel, fantastic location.","Fantastic experience from entering reception.
Faultless stay.
The staff were brilliant, nice room, great location and excellent bar.
Struck up a rapport with the cocktail waiter who was born on our favourite island of Madeira, his old fashioned was brilliant.
What more can you ask for,
Will definitely stay again.",5,2024,09,04
105,"Exceptional service, charming property","Professional and warm staff, ideal location in a beautiful and charming neighborhood within walking distance of restaurants, parks, tube and shops. The hotel’s own restaurant and bar are exceptionally good as well. Excellent cocktails! We stayed for 4 nights in the Philippe Suite and really enjoyed the extra space of the suite. It had a lovely sitting room with a full table where we ate room service breakfast each morning. There is also a coffee pot and kettle in the room. We also enjoyed the lovely soaking tub. We will absolutely return!",5,2024,09,04
105,You have Friends at the Chesterfield!,"From the Doorman to the Bar Staff the service was nothing less than spectacular!! We were there three nights and every night was outstanding! We ate dinner at the Bar and chatted with the staff like we were old friends, that was the feeling throughout our stay. Our friend is about to celebrate his 50th Birthday and we were asked to do videos for the occasion. I asked the front desk staff to participate and they rounded up staff from different departments to join in, a classy move! 
We highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair, your experience will be one you will always remember, just as we will!!

Mile and Carol B",5,2024,09,03
105,First class service and accommodations,"The staff is excellent; concierge, baggage handlers, housekeeping, front desk. I’ve never encountered such excellence including the Ritz.  The bed and pillows were the best!  When we visit again we will stay there!!!  The only thing was we arrived at 9:00 am and we couldn’t check in until 2.",5,2024,09,03
105,Aussie Travellers,"Absolutely fantastic location, a quintessential English Hotel. Servicing the room was an extra charge on top of already highish prices, the only downside. The front desk manager and concierge men were Absolutely Amazing, in particular Jake, Ivor, Darren, Gyorgy, Sam, Istvan! I do hope I haven’t missed anyone, we would stay again just to be greeted by these men, feeling thankful.",4,2024,09,03
105,Lovely hotel....,"The Chesterfield is a wonderful old hotel situated in a quiet area of Mayfair, just a couple of minutes walk from Shepherd market.
The inside of the hotel is lovely, very plush and traditional, a really nice place to be. 

My single room was comfortable and clean, and included a double bed, large TV and nice bathroom with good quality towels. The only slight drawback for me was the lack of a mini fridge in the room. 
I can highly recommend this hotel and would definitely like to stay here again.",5,2024,09,03
105,Truly Excellent Stay made even better by all the wonderful staff,"From the moment you arrive you a made very special by all members of staff absolutely exceptional service provided throughout our weekend stay. There are far to many positives I would like to list for this review, Just visit and enjoy your stay.",5,2024,09,02
105,One of the best hotels I have ever had the privilege of staying at,"I went on a solo trip to London from Canada so there were a few criteria I needed to find a hotel. 1) I have a chronic pain condition so need to have either a memory foam mattress or a mattress topper that wont cause pain. The housekeeping staff put a feather bed mattress topper and I had the best sleep in years on that bed. No discomfort or pain to ruin my vacation. 2) I had to feel safe in my hotel and I felt perfectly safe both in the hotel and the surrounding Mayfair area of London 3) I wanted to be near restaurants, take out places, a drug store and small grocery store and they were all there. within a short walking distance 4) My husband and I prefer small privately owned or small chain boutique hotels with old world luxury details. The Chesterfield Mayfair fit the bill. One of my friends came to visit and said that the hotel and my room felt so comfortable and inviting. 5) The staff at a hotel can make or break your visit. All the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair were professional, warm and welcoming and I would highly recommend this hotel just on the staff alone 6) An inclusive breakfast is always a nice added bonus so I added breakfast to my reservation. The choices were fantastic, pretty well anything you could want, delicious, fresh and great portions. Again the staff were amazing. 7) The number of London tourist attractions were within a decent walking distance. I never had to take the tube, or a bus or a train. I was able to walk everywhere. 8) On rainy days the front desk loaned me a roomy black umbrella! 9) The hotel bar was fantastic - it felt so cozy and inviting and the classy outdoor patio was a great added bonus! I highly recommend this hotel and if I head back to London again in the future I would choose to stay at this hotel again. After a lot of research It was the best decision I ever made!",5,2024,08,31
105,Warm welcome at The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair was fabulous! It's location is perfect for walking to all the famous landmarks. We love walking, but occasionally, we resorted to the tube, a bus, or a cab for return trips. All were within easy distance of the hotel. Arriving and leaving the hotel on our jaunts, we were always met with smiles and recommendations, which were very much appreciated. We can't say enough wonderful things about the staff! The hotel itself is very British, and quiet! We slept very well. The restaurant is great - food and service. It has a lovely dining room, garden room and the bar was a welcome place to relax in after a day out, with piano music and drinks.
     While it was our first time in London, it won't be our last and we will certainly stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair again.",5,2024,08,31
105,Was made to feel like a queen,"Nothing was too much. Jake the converge ,even got us last minute tickets for two of the hottest shows in town 
The whole team - Ispvan, Gyorgy and Darren were welcoming. Nothing was too hard and the nightly turn down service and chocolates on our pillows was a lovely touch.",5,2024,08,30
105,Great London Hotel with Exceptional Service,"Wonderful hotel that really made my first trip out of America and my time in London so great! Jake, the concierge who checked me in, was so very kind and helpful; he gave me recommendations on what to (and not to see to avoid all the tourist traps), and even walked me to a great Indian restaurant around the corner and got me a table!

The room and service were overall excellent. Everything you could expect from fantastic British hospitality!",5,2024,08,30
105,A wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.,"The Chesterfield is our favorite hotel in the UK, and we go here every time we're in London. (I'm sure the other Red Carnation properties are at equally high standard based on our experience at Hotel d'Angleterre in Geneva). We come every year or so and are joined by our UK friends at our meeting place. The accommodations are beautiful, the location is perfect - near Green Park and Shepherd Market, and the service is exquisite: friendly, attentive to detail, the highest quality imaginable. We will come here again next time in London",5,2024,08,29
105,Perfect stay,We’ve stayed here many times before and always had a memorable experience. This stay was no different. The staff are exemplary with several we consider friends now. This is not a fault and I have mentioned it before but I do feel it would be nice to have some sort of rewards system in place for regular visitors. It would be nice to be recognised for our loyalty.,5,2024,08,29
105,Lovely hotel in a prime location,"My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful 1 night stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair, celebrating a significant anniversary. The staff were all so welcoming, and the extra little touches they arranged (knowing we were celebrating) were the icing on the cake. The room was very spacious, the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was spotlessly clean - everything you need, and expect from a hotel like this. The hotel also benefits from a prime location - just a few minutes walk from the Royal Parks and the shops and restaurants of the West End. Overall a brilliant stay!",5,2024,08,29
105,Most Magical Experience,"Thank you to the entire team for a magical stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair! I travelled solo to London from Canada for the Taylor Swift concert and the entire staff was so enthusiastic, fun, supportive, and helpful. Thank you especially to the wonderful doorman Gyrogy (apologies for my mispelling), Sam the amazing concierge for not only being so awesome and lovely but literally sending up a Taylor Swift goodie bag to my room with treats, glow sticks, a card with lyrics, and confetti, and to Gemma for being so kind and fun! There were so many staff who made my experience incredible, from the kind cleaning staff who greeted me with a smile in the halls and provided incredible service, to the many wonderful servers, concierges (even one kind gentlemen who literally walked me to a fantastic Italian restaurant on my last night!), and door staff whose names elude me! Thank you for making my first ever trip to the UK so special- I felt like royalty the entire time and my heart is full. You rock!",5,2024,08,28
105,sumptuous,"The Chesterfield is for choice the ONLY place I would stay in London. It doesn't always work out that way though. From the minute I am greeted at the door by a lovely Doorman, the internal staff taking my luggage to my room and the fabulous reception staff, Sam in particular, it is an indulgence. The Courtyard bar is a joy of a lovely warm day as is the internal bar. Who doesn't love getting olives and twiglets as your drink snacks!
As for the rooms, have stayed in a few different configurations and have to say it is hard to leave the room to attend to my social engagements. 
I cannot rate it highly enough. Small, boutique, personal and simply sumptuous. I hope to visit again soon.",5,2024,08,27
105,An incredible place that really want you to have the best time!,"A wonderful hotel that simply cannot do enough for you. The room qasnt quite ready when we came to check in so they kindly offered us a free drink whilst we waited, I am heavily pregnant and asked for a fan for the room and when we got in our room a fan was there and a gift to congratulate me on my pregnancy. Every member of staff we encountered were so lovely and kind and couldn't do enough for you, apologies that we didnt take names of everyone who made our stay enjoyable but big shout out to Yanky! My husband even got a slice of cheesecake for his birthday which was another nice touch. Its the first time we stayed here and with the quality of the rooms, the luxury and the hospitality given to us we will definitely be back! ",5,2024,08,26
105,We are returned guests!! Stayed Six Nights and Had a Wonderful Birthday Celebration!!,"We had a wonderful birthday celebration!!
I have stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel since the mid 1980s.
The hotel has consistently made improvements over the years, and the hotel staff has gotten better all the time!!

Excellent services from Jake and Darrent, the Concierges!!
Istvan, Malina, Vy and Yavky of the Front Desk!!
Great Dinning and Bar Staff too!!

The hotel's excellent location in Mayfair offered us easy visits to many wonderful London Landmarks!!

We were there six nights, and all six of us had a wonderful experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel!!",5,2024,08,23
105,Wonderful decor with staff service to match,"Having just completed 30hrs flying from New Zealand the hotel could not have been more welcoming. Unfortunately my wife picked up a stomach bug on route and was confined to our room for the duration of the stay but the silver lining was she was able to appreciate the wonderful decor of our room (Garden Room). Staff were all very accommodating and very ready to provide adequate fluid replacement when required. We slept very soundly allowing for the jet lag we were still getting over.
This is definitely a place to return when we are next back in London",5,2024,08,22
105,A great stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield is a lovely hotel in a posh neighborhood and close to everything. We had connecting rooms, which is always great for our family of four and not easy to find in London. The bar is beautiful, quaint and offered live evening piano music. Breakfast was delicious too! The staff is warm and attentive!",5,2024,08,19
105,Excellent Hotel Experience,"We had a wonderful experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The location was terrific. The rooms were both beautiful and  charming. The bar room was also lovely and it was a nice place to enjoy a pint.  The staff was very nice, and the food was great. I definitely recommend!",5,2024,08,19
105,Afternoon tea delights,"We visited the hotel with family for their afternoon tea which had been recommended and it didn't disappoint. Set in the beautiful dining room and everyone was lovely, courteous and couldn't do more for us. The food was delicious and you can have more and more if you wish....what a treat! The sweetie bags at the end were an extra special treat taking us back a few years to childhood. Alfie was very kind and welcoming and very attentive when it came to whether we would like more of anything. How are you expected to eat all of this food.....it's wonderful. Thank you for a memorable afternoon in London",5,2024,08,17
105,The Chesterfield's suites are first class,"My wife and I were returning (following a three year absence) to The Chesterfield to celebrate a couple of milestones in our lives. This was our seventh stay.

We stayed for three nights in the Dormer Suite - one of the best hotel rooms we have stayed in. All staff were service orientated and 2-3 were exceptional - truly personal service.

The Courtyard is a great addition in summer and the newly decorated Terrace bar has been updated in classic style, thus retaining its ambience and appeal.

It was also lovely to be back in this part of Mayfair, which is in touching distance of so much that we want to do in London. It is also one of the best areas for walking, away from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping areas. 

A most enjoyable stay!",5,2024,08,16
105,Mayfair’s little gem,"Just a charming Victorian hotel affording a warm welcome friendly staff and a willingness to attend your every wish .great quality food and beverages pretty location set in the heart of Mayfair London close
 to Berkeley square and totally dog friendly.well done",5,2024,08,15
105,Would absolutely stay again,Lovely hotel in Mayfair. All the staff attentive to every need but most of all always friendly and smiling. Enjoyed the breakfast service and especially the Sweetshop afternoon tea. Our family of 7 had a wonderful time and would definitely return.,5,2024,08,14
105,What a lovely hotel,"From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted with friendly welcoming staff from the doorman to reception staff and it continued everywhere throughout the hotel.

The hotel is exceptionally clean from public areas to the bedrooms. We had a superior king room. They are not the biggest rooms in the world but the storage was great for a city hotel.

We had meal in the courtyard on Friday, lovely food.
Drinks again exceptional, best cocktails we have both had.

Bed linen is beautiful and the best pillows ever!!

Myself and my husband cannot wait teturn. This was my second visit and I was not disappointed.

A big thank you to everyone and thanks for arranging a return of a left bag with house keys!!!!",5,2024,08,12
105,Fantastic!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair was the last stop on our 2 week honeymoon across Ireland and England.  We can't say enough about this hotel.  The building, rooms, food and most of all the service was fantastic!  Special recognition to the amazing bartenders!  
If we find ourselves in London again we would definitely return here.  Highly recommended!",5,2024,08,12
105,25th anniversary celebration,We stayed for 3 nights celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The staff was  extremely accomodating and friendly making sure our every need was met. We had an anniversary cake waiting for us in our room uppn arrival. We had a tour we needed to get up early for one day and staff packed a box of pasties and gave us coffee to go. Jade in the restaurant was especially friendly and attentive. She talked with us at tea time and breakfast and had a special anniversary desert prepared for us. Hotel is in a quiet nice neighborhood located close to the underground and within a short walk to Buckingham Palace. Thank you for a wonderful stay!,5,2024,08,12
105,London in August,The room was super comfortable and quiet. The staff helped us with anything we needed. Great customer service. For being in the middle of London it was so quiet. Great sleep. Restaurant and room service was excellent. I will stay here again.,5,2024,08,07
105,Wonderful Old Fashioned service hotel,"This was a really wonderful experience.  The hotel itself is lovely, very British.  The rooms are wonderful - classic architecture but updated with top of the line linens and very new bathrooms.  Our room was a junior suite.  It was spacious and comfortable.  The hotel adds a service fee to your nightly rate, which is a bit odd at first - but the result is the best service you have had in a very long time with no worries about digging in your wallet to find tips.  Yeah.  Breakfast was included and it was a lovely service each day.  All in all this is my new go-to hotel in London.",5,2024,08,07
105,Quiet location,"We spent a lot of time debating where to stay in London and settled on the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The location is in a very quiet area and we were able to take longish walks to get to some of the museums we visited.  The area directly around the hotel is very quiet and unbusy with limited close by restaurants.  We very much enjoyed strolling through the nearby Hyde Park.  The room and bathroom were small and we had a view of the small courtyard below (there were some events in that space during our stay but we were unbothered by any evening noise).   The decor was well thought out and matched the nature of the hotel. We enjoyed the welcome and departure treats.  We enjoyed our breakfasts and very much enjoyed our dinner at the hotel. The plating was lovely and we appreciated the complimentary petit fours.  Overall, this is a great option if you are looking for a quiet part of London.",4,2024,08,07
105,Perfect,"I can express enough how lovely our stay was. The staff is beyond amazing.  Super nice, welcoming and helpful.  The rooms are nice and big enough, the breakfast is great and has large variety. The location is perfect! Overall it's a 10! We will definitely be back",5,2024,08,07
105,Terrace Bar for drinks (didn't stay at hotel),"The hotel is just a stunning place to be, and I loved the bar where I popped in for a couple of the famous cocktails. Gorgeous chesterfields and walls covered in victorian paintings. It's like a cross between Rules and the Milestone hotel. Definitely will recommend a stay here to visiting family and friends.",5,2024,08,05
105,Home from home,"This was our first visit to The Chesterfield.  We were immediately struck by the welcome and friendliness of the staff (Maina on reception among others) which continued throughout our stay without exception.  The room was well equipped, the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent (thank you Jade for looking after us so well).

We thoroughly recommend.",5,2024,08,05
105,Memorable Stay,"What a wonderful experience we had at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  It was clean, comfortable, and welcoming, and the food was AMAZING!  Waking up to a wonderful warm late was a wonderful special treat to the day! If and when we return to London, we will be back.  THANK YOU, Mayfair for making our trip so special.  And thank you for honoring my son with such a special graduation trip celebration.  He will remember how special you made him feel for the rest of his life.  Chesterfield Mayfair made his top 5 list for London experiences.",5,2024,08,04
105,A gem in Mayfair,"We just had the pleasure of another wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The location is perfect: walking distance to the West End theatres, great shopping, Buckingham Palace, the Green Park Underground station, etc.  Given the location and elegance of the hotel the room rates are very reasonable. However, it is the Chesterfield's staff that ensures a memorable experience. Jake, Loris, Mustafa, Josef, and all their colleagues epitomize the friendliness, knowledge and professionalism so essential in the hospitality industry.  The Chesterfield Mayfair remains our home away from home in London. We think you will agree.

Dennis and Cindy Gray",5,2024,08,02
105,"Superb staff, great location","The room was very comfortable and immaculate.  The staff are all a great asset to the hotel; they are very friendly, and welcoming and did their best to make our stay enjoyable.   The food in the restaurant is of a good standard but the wine list is excellent and reasonably priced.  The bar has a good atmosphere and is the perfect place to unwind for the evening after a meal.",5,2024,07,30
105,Excellent Brittish Hotel,"This is a great traditional hotel with old-fashioned service. We feel welcomed by all the staff and our needs very charmingly met. The room was as requested and special extras were no problem to arrange. Very comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms.We enjoyed the bar dining and piano entertainment most nights. We did not visit the restaurant this year. We would have preferred the bar menu to also be available on the terrace, so you could just enjoy a lighter style lunch like a sandwich if desired. All staff were excellent. Great location near our favourite spots.",5,2024,07,30
105,Very very good,"We had two rooms booked for two nights.  Primarily to watch Springsteen but also to see London after that.  Last year we had stayed in the Marriott Grosvenoron park lane so that was our benchmark.  
I would say the Marriott has more bling but the chesterfield more heart and character 
  Such a warm welcome at the chesterfield.   Very clean.  Perfect location.  Very quiet.  Most impressive was that Shilom not only clocked when we said we were here for Bruce but that night when we got in left us a personalised Bruce card and sweets.  Personal touch was incredible.  We felt well looked after.  Turn down service great.  Terrace bar lovely.  We didn’t eat here this time but would in future.  We would definitely stay here again",5,2024,07,27
105,Dinner at the Chesterfiy,"I had dinner in the terrace & ate one of the finest meals I’ve had in a long time. The Chef prepared Fresh Oysters, scallop carpaccio & the Best Steak Tartare I have ever tasted. 
The service & choice of wine was excellent too. 

A 5* Experience for my visit",5,2024,07,27
105,Very disappointed sadly will make this our last time here.,"Louise Christie
3/5
just now on  Google
We’ve stayed here a few times because the beds are very comfortable, it’s a fantastic location and the staff are lovely. However, the rooms are small (we were upgraded 🤷‍♀️) the bathroom is so tiny you can’t turn around in it. There is no fan, the mirror steams up, the door has to be pushed with force to open and it needs painting.
The thing I found the most surprising in this day and age is, there is no fridge in the room! I mentioned this on the day we arrived ( I needed one for a medical reason)I wasn’t told one could be put in until the afternoon of the day before we leave, and that was because the tv stopped working and I’d had enough, so all the things that were wrong came tumbling out! When you are only away for a few days you don’t want to spend it complaining and moving around (even if that was an option!).
So disappointing. Sadly, wewon’t stay here again after this experience.",3,2024,07,25
105,A jewel in Mayfair,"I have stayed at the Chesterfield many times, the latest stay was just a week ago. The reason I always choose the Chesterfield is primarily the staff. From the gentleman who meets your taxi as you arrive, to the reception staff, to the restaurant and bar staff, to the cleaning staff, everyone extends a warm welcome. In fact, I have come to consider the Chesterfield my “home away from home”.  The Chesterfield is not a large hotel which means that the staff can get to know their clients and quickly learn their likes and dislikes. I heartily recommend the Chesterfield to anyone looking for a lovely hotel in a superb location!",5,2024,07,25
105,Perfection!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair really is the most charming hotel.  Beautifully traditional with a unique style, we felt at home from the minute we arrived.  

The whole team at the hotel are wonderful, efficient but lovely, ensuring that our stay was effortless and delightful.

It is the perfect hotel in a superb position, and we can’t wait to return!",5,2024,07,24
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair. Simply splendid!,"My sons and I recently visited London and had the privilege of staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair. This hotel far exceeded our expectations. From the location, to the wonderful staff,  to the rich beauty of this magnificent hotel, it was perfect. We will not choose any other hotel while in London. There is simply no need. The Chesterfield Mayfair was amazing!!!!",5,2024,07,23
105,Great hotel and experience,"This was our first visit to The Chesterfield Mayfair and it was a very positive experience. The booking process was clear and easy. We chose the hotel due to its excellent location, being a 5 min walk to Green Park tube station. (Visitors can also walk to The Green Park and pass Buckingham Palace and surrounding tourist areas if they want to.)
The hotel itself is well cared for, all of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable and well equipped. Everything you needed was provided and refreshed regularly, it was a nice, relaxing space to come back to each day of our trip. 
The breakfast experience was also very high quality. The food was tasty and there were plenty of options to choose from. We sampled having breakfast down in the main dining area, as well as being brought up to the room on the last day of our stay, and service was consistently good throughout. 
Both the check in and check out processes were smooth and explained clearly, by a cordial member of reception staff each time (thank you to Ellen and Maina respectively).
Overall a lovely stay at The Chesterfield and we would definitely book there again in the future and recommend this hotel to other travellers. It was exactly what we needed for our trip.",5,2024,07,22
105,absolutely perfect,"Staff and service was fantastic. the decor and comfort level of in room amenities almost perfect.
The location is second to none. Within walking distance to all major sites.

we would for sure return and recommend to all our family and friends.",5,2024,07,22
105,Amazing,The most amazing experience!! Everyone was so kind and professional. Gemma and Adam in the bar were so helpful! All the doormen were ready to meet any and every need. Rooms were lovely!! We will definitely be back next year. Love the piano in the bar!,5,2024,07,19
105,A+ Staff!,The staff at this hotel is the true difference maker. They make you feel like family from the moment you cross the threshold. Most impressive is the concierge and doorman staff. Jake the concierge did more for us than I can even enumerate. One small example - he walked us to two neighborhood restaurants where he had made us a reservation. That is a first for me and endeared him to us forever. The sheets and beds are comfy too!,5,2024,07,19
105,Amazing staff at The Chesterfield Mayfair,A beautiful hotel where everyone who worked there was so helpful and polite. A wonderful experience. The location was perfect with a lovely comfortable room. The cocktails were stunning in the lovely bar. Thank you everyone at The Chesterfield super highly recommended.,5,2024,07,16
105,Everything we needed and more!,"We came to attend Wimbledon and see the sights of London. Having never been there before we did not go as prepared as we should have. It didn’t matter because the Chesterfield Mayfair provided what we needed… everywhere everything from umbrellas when we went out on a rainy day to water if we came in thirsty to a full bar, including a special drink for Wimbledon.! They made reservations for us , gave us referrals for special places to go to eat, arranged to have cabs whenever we needed them. From the doorman to the concierge to the front desk, everyone was so helpful.",5,2024,07,14
105,"Beautiful, charming hotel in lovely, peaceful neighborhood.","I chose this hotel because of the ratings, and location- close to many sights, but away from the hubbub, as I can’t stand noise and crowds. Friendliest bellmen ever, greeted me upon arrival. I do think hotels need to include a healthy service charge for any and all employees that get tips. When traveling- we are disoriented, exhausted, jet lagged, often flustered and overwhelmed- people forget to tip, or they don’t carry cash or local currency. Then there is the interruption of fumbling around in purses or pockets- everything falling on the ground, or lost in the crevices of the back seats of cars. This is why people like Uber- no fumbling in the dark for cash or cards that takes precious time, and get lost in the process. The hotel is pretty, charming, comfortable- with a lovely lobby, a cozy bar, and a first rate, elegant restaurant. Everything is super clean. My room was just beautiful. Small, like NYC hotel rooms, but perfectly appointed, and lots of natural light. The staff were all lovely, super helpful and friendly. My only issue was the low lip on the shower- I felt water would overflow every second. I think if the drain was super fast, the problem would be eliminated? Honestly, I wanted to just stay in my beautiful room and enjoy it- but instead, I flew out to J Sheekey- which I loved in the past- but my scallops still had the impossibly chewy muscle attached, and my salad was just huge leaves, jammed into a tiny bowl- really odd! I wished I’d stayed at the relaxing hotel! Then I rushed out again, to see a play- traffic is so slow because of the new 25 mile per hour speed limit- total insanity- no one can get anywhere, and froze, as my Uber driver cancelled ten minutes after my order, leaving me stranded and freezing. Finally back to the hotel, wonderful night’s sleep- lovely breakfast. I totally recommend this beautiful hotel 100%.
I wish I had just stayed out and enjoyed its comfort, peace and tranquility!",5,2024,07,14
105,My new go to hotel,"Stayed here for one night as was going to an event in Hyde Park, it was my first time staying here and we were not disappointed. The stand out is the staff, really attentive and great customer service. The hotel is exceptionally clean, comfy beds and good food and drink. When we arrived we told the receptionist we were going to an event and when we got back in the evening she had left us a note and a goody bag of treats in our room, a really nice touch and totally unexpected. Thank you Sam. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,07,14
105,Chesterfield Mayfair staff amazing,"We spent four nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair in June 2024 and loved it. The staff was unbelievably attentive and helpful. Jake, the concierge, and his fellow staff members at the front desk went over and above our every request.  They arranged taxis, restaurant reservations, and provided helpful advice.  Jake even walked us to a restaurant he had recommended. The rooms were comfortable and extraordinarily clean. Would highly recommend the breakfast which was fantastic. We closed out each evening in the cozy bar with staff that were friendly and accommodating. Would stay then again in a minute.",5,2024,07,12
105,Excellent Visit,"Having read the positive reviews regarding this hotel, my husband and I booked it as we wished to stay in Mayfair and were attending the Wimbledon Tennis. The staff are exemplary in their service, friendliness and overall delivery. They were genuine about the service they delivered and are a credit to the hotel.
The hotel breakfast was very good although we never had dinner there due to other plans.
The hotel was very clean and very traditional in style think “traditional English” . We recommend and would definitely stay again !",5,2024,07,12
105,"FANTASTIC HOTEL, AMAZING SERVICE","This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed at over the years.  The property is very well maintained and the staff (from the doorman to the restaurant help, was extremely courteous, accommodating and friendly. I couldn't praise this hotel more.",5,2024,07,11
105,A Great Place to Stay While in London,"My wife/I finished up a 12 day cruise by staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 days.

We were given room 207 overlooking the courtyard of the restaurant next door.  They had an event going on, which made the room very noisy. 

We were to rise the next morning at 3:30 am to catch the first Euro train to Paris at 6 am.  I called the front desk and explained our situation and was told that they didn't know what time the party would end.

Within 10 minutes, Ellen called from the front desk and asked if I could meet her to check out an alternative room.

She took me to room 308 and it was perfect.  She made a potentially difficult situation right and did what a good manager does...find an acceptable solution.

They even gave us a courtesy wake-up call to ensure we were up and arranged for a cab to pick us up and deliver us to St Pancras Station. 

Georgie was very accommodating in making sure our bags were taken to the room and collected for our trip to Heathrow.

The entire hotel staff from the doorman to the housekeeper were very pleasant, professional, and overall, top-notch.

The room was spotless, as was the bathroom. 

The hotel is located in a safe neighborhood and approximately a five minute walk to the Green Park Tube Station, which will get you anywhere in London.

The hotel is half a mile from Buckingham Palace as well as many attractions in London.

Baker Street is a block away where you can find restaurants,groceries, and shopping within a mile walk.

This place, although it was a little expensive, is worth every penny.",5,2024,07,10
105,A Hidden gym,"This hotel had been referred to us by a very good friend. I was traveling for the first time to London and knew it would be an established safe site for four nights. I was highly impressed and was not disappointed; although a petite hotel this hotel goes out of its way to show professionalism along with being very personable and attending to all of your needs.  The accommodations were very comfortable and they went out of their way to make sure we had transportation when needed,  snacks for early morning tours, and treats at night all along with our accommodations I would recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair to anyone traveling in that area  of London. As far as attention to detail,  this establishment can compete with the best of them, including the Four seasons, the Fairmont or Ritz Carlton establishments.",5,2024,07,10
105,Excellent property and reasonably priced for Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair met or exceeded every expectation we had. It is in a great location and the room was a decent size for a European property. The staff is what made this hotel so exceptional for us. Everyone from the front desk to doormen, concierge, bar and dining service and room attendant were very good. Biagio, the Asst General Manager, was very helpful and pleasant. The lady doing our housekeeping (Anna) stood out for us. She was prompt, never intrusive and the room was very clean and tidy and she always had a nice smile and Hello for us. We will definitely be back in the future if we return to London.",5,2024,07,10
105,Right in the Heart of Mayfair,"A cozy hotel in Mayfair.  The staff are very nice and helpful.  The room was comfortable and the bed was heavenly.  The breakfast was always delicious and the wait staff always helpful.  I do agree with other comments that the rooms need updating.  There is complimentary water provided everyday and there is also tea and coffee and hot chocolate provided.  There was a beautiful floral arrangement in the room.  Be aware that there is a courtyard and if your room overlooks it, you will hear everything, including the DJ music from a bat mitzvah one Saturday night that we were there. The Chesterfield is within walking distance to the tube and many parks in Mayfair.",4,2024,07,09
105,Great Staff and Perfect Location,"We arrived on July 4th and were surprised to find to cupcakes in our room with a note saying Happy Independence Day! It was a nice touch! We were also celebrating our anniversary and the next day there was a beautiful little cake with a note in our room. The service from the bell men, housekeeping, front desk, and servers in the restaurant at breakfast and the bar was exceptional! We felt welcome and cared for. The breakfast each morning was wonderful and had lots of choice. We enjoyed G & T's at the bar while listening to music. The room was fully equipped with cozy bedding, tea and coffee making supplies and nice robes. My only critique would be that the room needs some updating, the bathroom mirrors were difficult to see in, etc.  However, this would not deter me from booking again when we come back to London.",5,2024,07,09
105,A very Special Hotel and Amazing staff!,"Wonderful! Amazing! Perfect! 
Room: Very nice and clean! Restaurant: Very Nice! Location: Excellent! 
Staff: Amazing! 
The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is lovely! Online reservations are very helpful! The hotel staff are all professional, caring, very helpful and go above and beyond to assist in any way they can! I highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel!",5,2024,07,09
105,When we’re in London we never want to stay anywhere else.,"We’ve been staying at The Chesterfield for many years and our recent visit was as good as ever. It’s in the perfect location for all the things that we like to do and the staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming. 

They do a really good, proper breakfast which we usually enjoy after a walk in nearby Hyde Park, although getting out of such a comfortable bed is a challenge in itself. Starting a night out with a glass of champagne in the Terrace Bar is a firm favourite, especially if John is at the piano!

I anticipate that we will be staying at The Chesterfield for many years to come and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for being consistently excellent.",5,2024,07,09
105,Magical,"The staff is wonderful all throughout. When you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of London, the hotel bar is a wonderful place to grab a proper meal, dessert, or a night cap. Pro Tip: when you leave the hotel to go to the Airport, ask the front desk to call a taxi…MUCH cheaper",5,2024,07,08
105,Wonderful stay,"From the minute you step in to the Chesterfield Mayfair, and through the entire stay you are pampered with attention, kindness, elegance, perfect proper service, smiles, accommodations. The rooms kept cleaned every day, the food was  fresh and delicious no matter if you ate there for breakfast or dinner. 
We really enjoyed English hospitality. Also, this is one of the last hotels in London that is privately owned. Strongly recommend 
Jake, loris, Alina, Peter, Andrea- they are the best!",5,2024,07,06
105,Typically British & Typically Mayfair. A hidden gem,"I had the pleasure of staying with you last Friday until Sunday.
 
A little business, mostly pleasure though sadly far too short.
 
After living in Kensington & Notting for 12.5 years & frequenting Mayfair since I have been a child, I was sad to see that some areas & many of my old haunts had changed & / or become watered down to suit the masses.
 
It was superb to see that this wasn’t the case with your establishment.
 
Service & stay was absolutely top notch & exactly what I was looking for. Typically British & Mayfair in all it’s wonderful ways.
 
It really felt nostalgic & home from home.
 
Thank you to all of your wonderful staff & their professionalism.
 
I will certainly be back.
 
Keep up the good work!
 
Best wishes,
 
Michael Palmer",5,2024,07,04
105,Best hotel staff in London!,The service & hospitality in this hotel is superb. The staff is friendly and welcoming! It is a testament to how great service and a friendly attitude makes such a difference. This is our second stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair and we will be coming back. We also love the location.,5,2024,06,30
105,Loved our experience.,"Our time at the chesterfield Mayfair was really fantastic. Two staff members in particular, Sam and Ellie, really gave us outstanding care. Ellie made a great suggestion for us to grab takeaway lunch at Harrods and eat in the sunshine at Hyde Park and that was a lovely afternoon. Sam overheard us say that we were seeing Mamma Mia! On Wednesday night so on Tuesday he left us a goodie bag in our room with facts about the musical and candy and drink vouchers! So thoughtful and generous. All of the staff, from the bar staff learning about the art on the walls to the helpful tea and breakfast staff, really treated us so kindly. The details of the place, small features like the turndown service and the live piano every night, made it feel like hotel hospitality from another era. We loved our stay and would definitely come back!",5,2024,06,30
105,Wonderful Stay Great Staff,"What a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield.  From being welcomed at the door, checking in, and room service everyone was so lovely, helpful and polite.  I went with 2 friends to celebrate our 60th birthdays and thought we would treat ourselves and The Chesterfield was our choice of stay and we were not disappointed.  

We were all able to share the same room and upon our arrival there was a bottle of champagne on ice with treats.  The room was spotless and so nice to have your bed turned down and your room prepared for a night of sleep.  The beds were very comfortable.  

Breakfast was excellent and the coffee very nice.  

The location was great for the tube (Green Park) which was around 5 mins away.  If you like a walk St James Park, Covent Garden, Saville Row, Leicester Square and the Embankment are well within walking distance.

We were advised to go to The Ivy as that was near the Theatre to see Hamilton and the food and service was excellent as well as the cocktails of course.",5,2024,06,30
105,Friends Visit to the Terrace Bar,"A number of us went for drinks in the terrace area. Fantastically accommodating staff, great drinks, lovely surroundings. Our lead host Rafal was exemplary and helped make the whole experience very special. All staff were hospitable, helpful andd pleasant. Would recommend highly.",5,2024,06,29
105,Great spot for first trip into London!,"The location, the staff, the food all excellent!  The room was very clean.  This hotel was a lovely choice for our first adventure to London.  We are very pleased with the cheers and assistance that each staff member provided!  While I don't remember all, Shiham was one of the special young people at the front dest who was always helpful!",5,2024,06,28
105,The food was delicious and my experience awesome!!!,"Jake, Sam , and Vy were outstanding also other staff from the greeters to cleaning person were awesome. 5 stars is not quite enough to rank my stay in such fantastic hotel . I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.I look forward to booking again in the near future way to go Chesterfield Mayfair!!!",5,2024,06,28
105,A delightful hotel,"This hotel is a gem. It is gorgeous and in a quiet part of town. The room was nice and the bathtub was delightful especially after a long day of walking. The staff was very nice and housekeeping did a great job. Alejandro and Adam in the bar are great, especially if you have questions about the Euros 😆 or want a delicious martini. I like that this is a smaller hotel so the staff is able to give each guest their attention. Check in and check out were very easy. It’s close to the tube without all the hustle and bustle. Would definitely recommend for a nice getaway.",5,2024,06,26
105,Excellent!!,"Our experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair was top notch.  Beautiful, large room with everything we needed.  The staff was EXCELLENT…they were very welcoming and took care of our every need.  We looked forward to breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning.  The wait staff was wonderful.  Highly recommend…the loveliest hotel that I’ve ever stayed in.",5,2024,06,25
105,Best Hotel in London,"Simply the best place to stay in London. A superb location with an old English comfy feel to it. The service is what makes this place so great, they could not do enough for us and accommodated all requests. Next time I'm in London I know exactly where to go back to and I've been trying to find a hotel that would return again for a while...this is it!",5,2024,06,24
105,Best hotel experience!!,"From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by such friendly staff. We came from NYC to London for the Girls Aloud concert. 

The hotel was beautiful, and so clean. The room was wonderful and the cleaning crew did above and beyond each day to make our room feel as tidy as possible. The cleaning staff is greatly appreciated. 

Sam and Jake specifically were just so kind and friendly during our stay. Their warm smiles and their motivation to make sure we were all settled okay and if we needed anything. They couldn’t do enough for us! 

Also thank you to Sam for the kindest gesture. He knew we were headed to Girls Aloud concert on Sunday night and he sent over the sweetest note and some concert snacks. It was the nicest thing to do. 

Thank you to Sam, Jake and also I believe her name was Helen or Ellen (I’m sorry I don’t remember) but she was also so helpful with directions and anything we needed. 

The hotel is situated in the perfect area. Everything was walking distance!! Buckingham, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Bond St, etc… so many beautiful parks around. You do not need any tour buses around here. 

Overall I had the best experience and i will definitely stay here and recommend the Chesterfield to anyone. 

Thank you for wonderful memories to take back home!!!",5,2024,06,24
105,How to make a special weekend even more memorable…,"The Chesterfield. 

Here is a love letter to you.

Thank you for making what was already an extraordinarily memorable weekend so much more special. To every member of staff that we saw and spoke too, from the door staff, reception, bar staff, cleaners and everyone at breakfast, you made us feel so welcome and appreciated. Thank you. 

We arrived before check in time, and that wasn’t an issue. You took my details, took our bags and invited us into the bar for a drink. 

Being that we were at Wembley both Saturday and Sunday night for Era’s Tour, our return on Saturday was to be late. When we did return, our keys were waiting for us at reception, and in the room was our luggage, our turned down bed, the air con on cold, the water we so desperately needed and the softest most welcoming bed! 

Sunday meant an early start and breakfast was sensational! 

To round off our fly-by trip, we can only thank you for the gift bag and personalised Taylor Swift note. 

Thank you for adding the sparkle to our weekend! 

Reece & Lucy",5,2024,06,24
105,A great experience,I can’t imagine having better service anywhere and the location was perfect. Very clean and comfortable. The hotel restaurants and bar were very good as well. The concierge also arranged our airport pick up and drop off which was a nice experience.,5,2024,06,22
105,Excellent Customer Service,I had an important meeting at The Chesterfield and needed the right space and ambience.  Although they had several events on at that time I received excellent customer service by Biagio who found the perfect place.  As a result I will definitely be returning more frequently. Thank you for making our experience such an enjoyable one :-),5,2024,06,22
105,Mayfair at it's authentic best!,"Terrific experience - a warm welcome, friendly professional staff, gorgeous clean room, food was superb [better than the Michelin-starred restaurant we visited] and drank in a nice cosy bar. This hotel is an absolute gem and we've already committed to return next year! Our only regret is that it won't be sooner.",5,2024,06,22
105,A stay to remember,"My wife and I spent our wedding weekend at the Chesterfield and had a very special time. We are not showy people and did not make a big deal about the fact that we were getting married but the staff provided special treats in our room and really went above and beyond to make us feel special - not least in helping us to get our luggage into a taxi in the rain when we left!
We loved the atmosphere of the bar and the breakfast was great. Would recommend for a special occasion.",5,2024,06,21
105,excellent service,"I had exemplary service at the Chesterfield. All the staff were courteous and helpful, in particular Mr Sarubbi who met any concern I had with care and professionalism. I have been staying at hotels for over fifty years and have seldom encountered such consideration.",5,2024,06,20
105,Nice but not fabulous,"We chose to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair mainly due to its location. Reception was okay but no one explained any of the facilities or offered to take our luggage to the room - the lift was pointed out to us and we made our own way. The room was small but cosy and the bathroom tiny and spotless. We found the coffee making facilities after a call to reception - they were hidden away in a box on the top shelf  in the closet - caution required when retrieving it if you’re petite!! The bed was very comfortable. I was looking forward to reading the newspapers in the ‘Library’ in the morning but was stopped en route because it was closed due to an event - no alternative was suggested. I guess that was why business men and tourists alike were congregated on the sofas in the entrance hall. Altogether, I feel our experience was slightly at odds with some previous reviewers -  it was nice enough but somewhat missed the mark.",4,2024,06,19
105,Chesterfield does it again! 😁,"Another fantastic stay at the Chesterfield! Nothing is too much trouble for Adam and his team, friendly, attentive staff everywhere make this place a home from home! From catching up with Mustafa at the door who remembered our football chat from February to Sam’s wonderful touches in the room after we’d said we were off to see P!nk - this place is a really special hotel and I would highly recommend recommend it to anyone! Breakfast incredible as always! We love the personal touches you do that make us feel special - hope to see you all again very soon!",5,2024,06,18
105,Will definitely return,"Returned to the Chesterfield for the 4th / 5th time and will definitely be back.
Faultless with superb very friendly and helpful  staff..
Last year we had an issue with the room size, however this time all resolved.
Excellent breakfast and very comfortable bar all set in an excellent location",5,2024,06,16
105,Lovely hotel,My wife stayed for 1 night. We were in town for the Barry manilow concert at the palladium.on arrival the staff were on point. Very professional. My wife uses an electric mobility scooter to get around. They were very helpful and courteous at all times. Slept very well . Comfortable beds . Breakfast was lovely. Lots of choice. Definitely would return.,5,2024,06,12
105,A rewarding London experience!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair provided us with the luxury and hospitality of a true London experience.  The superior friendliness of the staff combined with the comfort of the rooms truly made our London excursion an absolute delight.  All of the staff were accommodating from the front desk team to the concierge/doormen.  In particular, we enjoyed the attentiveness of Biagio, Marlene, Adam, Elias, and Alejandro.  The cozy bar (complete with piano player), breakfast room, and the newly added terrace dining complemented our stay immensely.  Great job!!  We will certainly book another stay on our next London trip!",5,2024,06,11
105,Afternoon tea 10/10,"Definitely the place to be for an amazing afternoon tea experience! We came to celebrate a birthday and we had such a lovely day. The staff and service were fantastic. A big thank you to Roberta, very elegant and professional guide but also super friendly. Another thank you to Maurizia for her warm welcome, who also greeted us with candy and treats! I will come back for sure!",5,2024,06,07
105,Like Being Welcomed Home,"Our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was very enjoyable. The staff are very professional in every respect. They also were personable and engaging, which made us feel like friends being welcomed home. Our room was very comfortable, and was kept spotless during our stay. We look forward staying there the next time we visit London.",5,2024,06,06
105,Beautiful Classic Boutique Hotel,"Last year my Sister and I decided to take a Downton Abbey-ish themed trip. While searching for a hotel to fit that criteria we found the Chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel was classically furnished but at the same time it had modern amenities. This included beautiful drapes and wallpaper, plush robes and slippers, a tea station with teas, biscuits and bottled milk daily, a flat screen TV with Internet and air conditioning. The service was impeccable. I forgot to mention that we got there so early our room wasn’t ready yet but they took us to the bar which was so comfortable and cozy that we didn’t mind the wait. We were there all of two minutes when one of the staff came to tell us that my daughter was on the phone because she was worried about us. She forgot about the five hour time difference from New York.  The hotel also has a beautiful sunlit dining room where you can have afternoon tea. The neighborhood is so beautiful and full of character with all of the classic architecture. Some days I just walked around soaking up the atmosphere. It’s even walking distance to Piccadilly St. which is where Fortnum & Mason and the Burlington Arcade Mall, amongst other great places, are located. I’ve decided to make the Chesterfield Mayfair my London home away from home.",5,2024,06,02
105,Great service made our trip magnificent!!,"Exceptional friendliness and kindness.  Every hotel staff member that we spoke with was very professional and pleasant.

All special requests were handled quickly and professionally .  Our room was clean and the bed/pillows were very comfortable.

Breakfast menu was extensive and the foods were delicious.  We enjoyed the pub and the pub menu had many selections.  I love the caricatures artwork in the pub & the High Tea Salon.  I wish I could have purchased a booklet of them to take home.",5,2024,06,02
105,Excellent customer service.,Very nice boutique style hotel. Comfortable clean and great service. I especially want to thank Andrea for her outstanding help in gettin us settled after a glitch through Expedia. She went above and beyond. The hotel should be thrilled to have a person of her caliber.,5,2024,06,01
105,Another wonderful stay,"My Husband and I enjoyed another wonderful stay at the Chesterfield over the bank holiday weekend.  We’ve been visiting the hotel for the past few years now and is our ‘go to’ hotel in London, a real hidden gem and perfectly located right in the heart of Mayfair.

Upon check-in we were thrilled to have been given Room 426 The Study, a fabulous room full of character.  We stayed in this room on a previous visit and is definitely one of our favourites!  All the rooms at the Chesterfield are decorated differently, each with their own individual charm.

The service at the hotel is second to none, all of the staff go above and beyond to make your stay as memorable as possible.

We were sitting at the bar in the afternoon, Alejandro the Bar Manager and one of his colleagues welcomed us back by name, even remembering our drinks choice from our last visit at Christmas.  These are the little personal touches that we love about the Chesterfield and one of the main reasons we keep returning.

We had bubbles in the bar to start off our evening whilst listening to the pianist and cocktails when we returned from dinner.  The bar snacks and complimentary bite size cheese on toast were delicious! 

The Terrace Bar has a great cocktail and bar food menu, the sausage rolls are a must!

Breakfast the following morning was excellent as always, the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs are highly recommended.

Looking forward to our next stay.

Beverley and Martin",5,2024,05,30
105,You won’t be disappointed.,"The Chesterfield made my first visit to London the best possible experience. The service from every staff member was AAA+. Friendly, knowledgeable and high touch at every stage of my stay at The Chesterfield from the front desk to the dining staff. Jozsef was so helpful that he deserves a special mention. I recommend partaking in the afternoon tea.  It’s a must and a great experience. The cherry love heart cheesecake was my favourite. You won’t be disappointed.",5,2024,05,29
105,Gem in Mayfair,Everyone was very nice at this hotel. The service was excellent from the front door to the bar and restaurant. Our room was cozy and clean as a whistle. The bed was exceptional and the hotel is quiet. There are numerous places to eat or have a drink within walking distance. I felt the staff appreciated us being there and when we left we hugged many of them because they seemed like friends.,5,2024,05,29
105,Terrace Bar,"We were looking for a place to have a drink and listen to live piano music and I think we stumbled across the best place in London. The Terrace Bar was elegant without being pretentious. It is beautifully decorated in dark green and wood trim. Chairs were wonderfully comfortable!

 The staff, especially Adam, made the evening feel upscale but was still friendly and extremely attentive. (We were dressed casually after a day of sightseeing and no one looked down on us.) 

The highlight was John at the piano. He played many songs we were familiar with and chatted with us about music between numbers. His selection was lovely for a bit of singing along to familiar pieces, but he also chose some  beautiful less familiar numbers…a great mix. 60’s to today-he covered it all! 
  
The hubs had a burger which he said was delicious, and I filled up on the bar snacks. My G and T was perfect, and the hubs had the house cider, which was excellent. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening there and hope to return soon!",5,2024,05,28
105,Love the Chesterfield Mayfair.,We were treated like royalty!  Wonderful staff.  Personal service. A gem in a busy city. It was a good place to return to after a long day of touring.  Taxi driver told us that you don’t find many hotels like this in London anymore.  Best part of London was our stay at the Chesterfield.,5,2024,05,28
105,Great Property - in a Great District,"My family and I (4 adults) visited the Mayfair in late May and had a wonderful experience.  Some highlights:

1) Wonderful doorman and front desk staff (including concierge) - very helpful, friendly, and remembered us each time we came in the door.
2) Great bar - open 24 / 7 for snacks, food and libations.  This was nice, as the Mayfair district bars / restaurants close around 11:00 each night - so it was nice to come back for a nightcap each evening (and when we were there, live music).
3) Very, Very comfortable rooms.  Unfortunately, our adult children's room had an A/C issue on day one,  but they quickly remediated it with a room change.  
4) Great location - Walking distance to Buckingham Palace - and a lot of other areas.

I will definitely be back to the Chesterfield!  Thanks",5,2024,05,28
105,Another charming stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair!,A repeat visit to this charming hotel. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful for our entire stay. We sincerely appreciate the early check in as we arrived from overseas. It made our day (first day in London) restful and enjoyable.,5,2024,05,28
105,"Wonderful, already booked to go back next May","We think of the Chesterfield as our home away from home.  We’ve been going to the hotel for years.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  I would like to commend in particular Jake, Nicole, Martina, Vilala Joseph, Mustafi, Gyorgy, Lorus, and all of our friends that serve us breakfast.",5,2024,05,25
105,Warm and friendly staff!,We stayed at the Chesterfield over Easter.  It was so festive and the people who worked there (especially Mustafa and Josef) were friendly and welcoming.  I left a very special silk blouse in the wardrobe and emailed the manager.  He promptly sent it back to me in Sweden!  Very impressed and will stay there again and again!!,5,2024,05,24
105,Outstanding boutique hotel for 1st time visit to London,"Excellent quality rooms, staff and services on quiet street in Mayfair. Very close to lots of restaurants, Tube stations and must-see sites for 1st time visitors to London. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was outstanding. Room was reasonable size, well-furnished and very clean. Quick, informative responses to pre-visit email messages that helped planning our itinerary.
Highly recommend the Chesterfield.",5,2024,05,22
105,Disappointed,"We used to live in London and come back regularly to visit. We decided to treat ourselves to a more expensive hotel this time as it was my husband’s birthday. We chose the Chesterfield based on the many positive reviews but unfortunately it was a bit of a disappointment. I am all in favour of heritage properties with character and generally prefer them over bland chains. But this place really is in need of some upgrading. It’s in good condition but some of the fixtures look straight out of the 1970s and are very passé such as the tasseled curtains in our room and the ceiling in the dining room. Old is fine if it looks nice but I found a lot of the decor to be very unattractive and had expected it to be more elegant The guest demographic was distinctly on the elderly side and seemed mainly American. Maybe this is what they expect British hotels to be like. It was a bit of a time warp but not in a good way…

The room was fairly small and didn’t feel that luxurious. After thinking there were no tea/coffee facilities I eventually found them in a box in the top of the wardrobe which was strange. The shower was hard to control the temperature and the water pressure was low. It felt like a lower quality hotel than they aim to be. Breakfast was ok but nothing special although we did appreciate it was a la carte rather than a buffet. 

We booked afternoon tea which had good reviews. That was also disappointing and probably the worst one I’ve had in London having tried many hotel teas over the years. Scones were thin and very sweet. The ‘sweetshop’ cakes were very much style over substance as they looked very pretty but didn’t taste nice. The macaron was a joke as it was dry and hard like a crust.  Totally inedible. 

Service was a bit hit and miss during our stay. We were kept waiting quite a bit in a way you don’t expect in a high quality establishment such as to sit down for breakfast where the staff is spending ages typing orders into a computer while there’s a queue of guests waiting to get a table. At tea they mixed up the different tea types and served the wrong one to the wrong person then didn’t really understand they needed the replace everything as we’d already poured them and added milk to the wrong one. Something a bit bizarre was that after we’d paid the bill and were leaving they told me they had a birthday cake with a candle for my husband. He’d already left the hotel and I had to call him to come back. It was strange why they didn’t serve it while we were at the table and they had plenty of notice we were leaving as we’d asked for and then paid the bill. 

Our key didn’t work when going back into the room and necessitated three trips to reception. In the end a cleaner opened the door. 

Both the hotel stay and afternoon tea were not worth the money paid. I guess you are mainly paying for the location but the quality does not live up.",3,2024,05,21
105,"Lovely staff, great location","The Chesterfield Mayfair was a lovely stay. The hotel is cozy, with the decor  feeling a little quirky and screaming “British”. 

The staff were all amazing, soooo friendly, kind and helpful when checking in/out and just daily with the doormen and house keeping. They would touch base in the evenings to see if we needed anything else. 

We ordered room service just one night and it was great, but besides that didn’t dine in the restaurant or do their high tea. 

Mayfair is a great location. In Westminster, it’s very close to Green & Hyde park, Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Soho, etc. 

We took the Piccadilly line from Heathrow and got off at the Green Park tube station and walked about 5 minutes to the hotel. 

The Green Park station is close by, but a 10 minute walk up there is the Elizabeth Line Bond Street station. Both of these stations make it easy to get around to the rest of London! 

We will be back the next time we are in London!",5,2024,05,21
105,The best customer service I have ever received at a U.K. hotel,"100/100 - the hotel could not have done more. As I was driving I called the hotel few hours before arrival to ask about parking. There is nothing on-site, but they will valet park the car and no issues with that. (£65 for 24 hours) I don’t think that is too bad in central London. I think his name was Jake, but I might be wrong, on the front desk, was very accommodating and helped us find a restaurant for lunch. 

We were attending a black tie event in the evening and the mannerisms of all the staff were great, they would ask how you were if they passed you in the corridor and felt like they genuinely were pleased to have you at the hotel. This is the best customer service I have ever experienced at a hotel in the U.K! 

In the morning I forgot my charger so got a wake up call, which I did ignore at 9am as I was feeling a little tired possibly due the 24/7 bar I may have attended at 2am… I then received a knock on the door to make sure I was up, which I did appreciate it, although I might not have sounded like I did. 

Breakfast was incredible, I am not coeliac but my partner is, so I always ask and they said most of the menu can be made to accommodate, so that was good! Jade who served us at breakfast was so polite, positive and I even interrupted her to tell her how great her customer service is. 

Actually 95/100. I am 2m tall and didn’t fit under the shower but I think if I had gotten a different room I would have been okay…",5,2024,05,17
105,British Charm,"Classic British Charm characterises The Chesterfield some of that comes from the building itself but much of the warmth and friendliness comes from Adam Lake and his team who always have the time to care about people.  From the doormen to the front desk, at the  Conservatory or the Terrace Bar everyone is warm and friendly. 
Other bonuses are that the hotel is dog loving and close to a hidden gem known as Shepherd Market a place that captures the essence of a bygone era taking me back full circle to ""British Charm"" - that is my experience at The Chesterfield in a nutshell. 
go there, you will never forget the feeling!",5,2024,05,15
105,The staff is the best!,Amazing service! From the moment we walked in the staff was incredible. Perfect location. Easy to jump on tube. 10 mini walk to Buckingham palace. Easy walk or tube to Westminster area. We loved our stay. We will definitely return. Ask Lorius to book your dinner reservations. He knows his stuff. He sent us to the best Indian restaurant right around the corner for an incredible dinner.,5,2024,05,14
105,Hidden gem,"The Chesterfield Hotel is a hidden gem in Mayfair providing sophisticated, discreet and elegant hotel facilities. We used the library as a private dining venue for a special 90th birthday celebration for afternoon tea and the staff provided impeccable service and gracious care of our esteemed guests and the whimsical afternoon tea experience created a lighthearted and fun backdrop to this unique celebration.",5,2024,05,14
105,"Comfortable, Convenient, and a Wonderful Staff","The hotel is located in a very convenient area  close to Green Park, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus, and many restaurants and pubs. The room, a junior suite was very comfortable and well appointed. Most of all, the staff was very friendly, professional and helpful, especially Ellen, Loris and Josef at the fron desk, the people who cleaned and tended to our room, and the restaurant servers. Highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.",5,2024,05,13
105,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location","This past April my wife and I made our 13th trip to London.   Every time we have travelled there, we have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff treats everyone like royalty.   It is located in the Mayfair area of London close to many of the spots one would want to visit while visiting London, e.g. Kensington Palace, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Piccadilly Square, Shepards Market, Parliament, and on and on.   The food at the hotel is excellent and we especially like the breakfast.   I cannot say enough to do justice for the staff.  As I said above, the folks treat everyone like royalty.  There is always a smile and a kind word from everyone.  If you ever travel to London, please give the Chesterfield Mayfair a chance, you won't be disappointed....thks.",5,2024,05,13
105,Six Lovely Super Cozy Nights,"My husband and I spent six lovely nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair. Staff was courteous, knowledgable and very friendly. Our room was well-appointed with a  comfortable bed and great pillows. The black-out drapes made the room super cozy –– perfect for sleeping after five nights of theatre-going and listening to the talented piano player in the welcoming bar. Two thumbs way up!",5,2024,05,13
105,Great old fashioned elegance,"A part of the Red Carnation hotels the Chesterfield did not disappoint. 
Brings me back to a visit to Ashford Castle.  Same great staff and excellent service.  Both lunch and breakfast were attractively presented and delicious. 
Only complaint would be to put a shower head in tub. We Americans love a shower!",5,2024,05,12
105,Magnificent!!,"My family absolutely love the Chesterfield Hotel. My wife and I held our wedding reception there some thirty years ago, we have returned to stay at the hotel every year since our wedding in 1993. Our most recent stay was in March of this year 2024 to celebrate my birthday.
From the very moment we enter into the welcoming entrance of the Chesterfield Hotel  our moods are lifted.  All the noise and angst of our capital city are left outside, and we are transported into an environment that cocoons us with comfort, kindness and indulgence.
It truly is our happy place, a sanctuary that provides us with the opportunity to totally relax and reconnect with each other.  
The Butlers Restaurant located on the ground floor of the hotel serves up beautifully cooked food, and also the cooked breakfast is also excellent.
Over more than three decades this hotel has managed to maintain the same very high standard it always had, in fact the warmth and attentive service from the entire team of staff is what adds to our stay always being so special.  

It's close to impossible to leave a special mention to certain staff that stood out, as the pleasing reality is that they're united in their efforts to ensure we're comfortable and fully catered for, however the staff members that I would like to recall are Samantha Langaas, who never fails to organise for us a cossetting room or suite for our all too brief stays, and put in place whatever other requests we may have, along with Mari, Alejandro and Helios in the Terrace Bar, the long serving courtesy of Loris, Claire on reception, and finally Hannah, Jade and Israel for making us feel so special.
We shall be retuning again this summer for a short stay, I very much hope that whoever reads this review enjoys an equally magical stay as we do, and like us becomes part of the Chesterfield family of returning friends.
Best,
Andrew Campbell, London.",5,2024,05,11
105,"Our fourth stay, and we’ll come back again!","We enjoyed a 5 night stay here at the end of our 5 week European holiday.
Having stayed here before, we knew the  standard room was going to be small. Interestingly, after staying in many other hotels recently, we found our “small “ room here particularly well laid out, with enough hooks, drawers and luggage racks to be comfortable for our stay.
All staff here are extremely professional.
We ate a couple of times in their downstairs bar (excellent)
Perfect location for us for walking around Mayfair, or jumping onto the underground if we needed to.
Just one thing to note is the shower being over a bath. They do supply a rubber mat if you feel you need it. I also understand that they have a couple of shower only bathrooms. Something to keep in mind if this is important to you.
We can’t recommend this place highly enough!",5,2024,05,11
105,Lovely boutique hotel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a lovely, elegant boutique hotel in Mayfair. The common areas are beautiful and well-appointed.  The breakfast menu is quite varied, and everything we tried was delicious.  Our room, while small, was very comfortable.   The staff is extremely attentive and helpful.  Ellen in reception gladly arranged take away breakfast one morning when we had to leave for a day trip before breakfast was served in the dining room. Loris, the concierge, helped us obtain tickets to a football match on the evening we arrived with only about two hours notice.   Jozsef, one of the bellmen, was extremely helpful every day with everything we needed.   We definitely will return on our next trip to London.",5,2024,05,10
105,A great hotel experience,"It was the best hotel experience that I have ever had. The hotel itself was beautiful. But is was the staff that made it wonderful. The concierge, bellmen, doormen and housekeeping were all engaging. Everyone looked you in the eye as they said hello. Not a quick glance as you entered or walked by. The neighborhood was great. Lots of restaurants, bars and a coffee shop nearby. Berkely Square Park was down the block. The room was immaculate and comfortable. Definitely a place I would stay at again.",5,2024,05,07
105,Thank you,"Celebration weekend and the excellent staff welcomed us and did all they could to make our stay enjoyable. Excellent location, lovely food, good bar with pianist, but it’s the staff that make it memorable. It’s London so rooms are not large and prices are not low, but it’s worth every penny",5,2024,05,06
105,Great service and whiskey experience,"Me and my partner had an amazing time at the bar, and really enjoyed the whiskey tasting from Vivian. She made us feel so welcomed, and really knew her stuff. Her old fashioneds were perfect.

105,Top notch!,"First class in every detail.  The staff were amazing, from the front desk to the doorman.  Each and every staff member was professional, courteous and super helpful.  The concierge went above and beyond to help my father ship a piece of artwork that wouldn't fit in his luggage.  The hotel is in a quiet area but a short two block walk to Shepard's Market where there are several pubs and restaurants.  The hotel is very clean and comfortable.  I highly recommend staying here.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2024,05,02
105,WONDERFUL!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of the best hotels my husband and I have ever stayed in! Everything from beginning to end was perfect! The staff is phenomenal! I cannot begin to tell you how friendly, helpful and amazing they ALL are. Bellman Jozseph and Doorman Mustafa went out of their way to make us feel so welcome and took such good care of us! 
The hotel is immaculate. So clean. 
The location is wonderful. It is centrally located very easy to get to all the attractions. The street it’s located on is peaceful and serene, yet just one block away are many incredible restaurants. 
The beds are super comfortable and the rooms are lovely. 
We had such perfect stay, we will surely be back! Thank you, Chesterfield Mayfair for helping to make our trip to London, so unforgettable!",5,2024,05,01
105,Fabulous Retro Sweet Tea,"We visited The Chesterfield for their 'Sweetshop Afternoon Tea' for my Dad's 70th, and it did not disappoint! What a truly fabulous hotel and afternoon tea! 
It started with a fabulous mocktail on dry ice which was super fun, and then onto an array of delicious sandwiches, scones and cakes.  It was all very delicious and different to any other afternoon tea - if you used to love an old fashioned sweet shop, you will love this. They even have a sweet cart where you can select your favourite retro sweets to take home!
The staff were amazing; very attentive. The whole afternoon was so friendly and relaxed, lots of fun, and with great service.
I highly recommend!",5,2024,05,01
105,Amazing stay at the chesterfield,"I can’t say enough about the Chesterfield. This is my second stay here and my first with my three children. This is my husband’s go to for work and he stays here several times a year. The hotel has just been updated and we stayed in lovely adjoining rooms. While the rooms are small, they are newly updated and comfortable. The main reason to stay here is for the British charm. The hotel staff goes above and beyond in providing recommendations. During our stay Andrea was so lovely with my children - even sending them off with a custom quiz on their favorite football teams. Jake and Josef were super friendly as well as the staff at the delicious breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel both for pleasure as well as for business.",5,2024,04,29
105,A truly wonderful experience!,"This lovely establishment played a huge part in making our first trip to London exceedingly memorable. The balance between old-world decor and modern convenience was superb and the friendly and helpful staff were right there at every turn. Vy, Hannah, Jake, George, and Josef made us feel as if we were the only guests in the hotel! (I am sorry to say that I cannot remember everyone's name, but trust me when I say that they were all outstanding!) The on-site restaurant was top notch and the service was attentive and prompt. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and friendly and I found myself looking forward to beginning the day in their company! I would not hesitate to revisit the Chesterfield and heartily recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their London travel experience. Warmest regards, Jim and Tina Swanson.

105,Your mileage may vary but...,"I had read such great reviews which was why I booked this hotel. I walked from the Tube and was glancing around trying to find the entrance, I had approached on the side street. The doorman was not outside or even facing the door so someone on the street opened the door so that I could enter with my bags. The doorman and the woman at reception were chatting away and failed to greet me, which is how he missed a guest trying to enter. When I checked in, I asked the woman who was helping me how far Goodman's restaurant was. She said she had never heard of it. I told her that it was quite well know steak restaurant in Mayfair. Nope. She searched online and couldn't find it. Of course, as soon as I got to my room I got the directions myself, much as how I opened the door. That was pretty much my experience staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair. No service. Given some of the other reviews, seems YMMV with this place.",2,2024,04,28

105,Weekend stay,"From arrival to leaving the service from every member of the Chesterfield team was absolutely faultless. 
Room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast menu offered something for everyone and the nice touch was the waiter serving us used our name which gave a very personal touch. 
The hotel is well situated and only a short drive from London Victoria train station.",5,2024,04,19
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair is wonderful and amazing!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a fabulous chic hotel in Mayfair. The staff is amazing, kind and helpful for any and every need you could think of while staying there! The staff went over the top when I accidentally left some personal items in my room. The room was lovely and wonderful accommodations. Would give it 5 stars ++++ and definitely stay there again when visiting London. Centrally located and easy walking distance to many fun shops and restaurants . Super easy to catch a cab if that is your need too.",5,2024,04,17
105,Amazing experience o,"Our stay was excellent. 
We were welcomed by Nicole and Clare the check in who show us the hotel before accompanying us to the room. 
We had the chance to dining at the restaurant and be served by Raffa and Alfi ( tried the Dover Sole ) totally worth ed , with Robert as managers on the shift. 
I had the chance to meet one of the evening mades Riza who left sweet treats in the room.
I will definitely come back !!",5,2024,04,17
105,Best room I've stayed in within the last decade,"On a lark, selected this hotel from just a remote web search. I knew it was nice, but I thought it was a bit kitschy. When I arrived the lobby just looked opulent and luxurious. The doorman was exceptional (even recommended a superb coffee shop) and the check in was impressive. Even upgraded us from a Junior Suite to an Executive Suite that was beyond belief. Instead of being over the top, we just felt like royalty. A dining area, a work nook, sitting area, bedroom and bathroom made it larger than my first apartment! Each space was a bit small, but together it was magnificent and huge. Loved all the quirky light switches and CAUTION with the shower. Three unlabeled dials made it hilarious when the cold water jetted straight at me while standing outside of the shower and iceberg cold. Eventually I figured it out and it was one of the best showers EVER: instant heat and fire hose above my head (I'm tall) when dialed up. The bed was just about perfect. Maybe even too large if something like that can exist. Overall this is one of the best rooms/suites that I've stayed in across many past years.",5,2024,04,17
105,"Classic, Charming and Attentive Staff","It doesn’t get better than this! Classic, cozy, charming and in an excellent location. The service is refreshingly excellent as is the food and amenities.

We will definitely return to this hotel and look forward to our next trip to London!",5,2024,04,15
105,Wonderful Chesterfield Mayfair,This was the most incredible experience.  All the staff were lovely and so helpful.  I have been to other european cities but this was by far the best experience I have had in Europe.  I would never go to any other hotel in London.  English Tea was wonderful.  The piano bar at night was so pleasurable.  The restaurant was also quite good.  The room was also spectacular (executive suite).  The service and hospitality were outstanding.,5,2024,04,14
105,East Coast visitors love Chesterfield Mayfair,"Absolutely wonderful stay for 8 nights. Fabulous staff could not do enough for us. Front desk, doorman, bellman, and lounge staff were so attentive to every need. Breakfast staff each day were so very friendly and knew you by name. Classy British care without being pretentious. Afternoon Tea and dinner were both terrific. Highly recommend. Would definitely stay again upon return visit to London.",5,2024,04,13
105,British Charm with excellent service in great location.,"This hotel has quite the British charm. We stayed twice in one week. We had originally planned to stay a week in London, which we stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for that week, but then we decided to go to Paris for a few days then head back to London for one night so that we can catch our flight back to the States from Heathrow. 

This hotel is great and does not disappoint. The restaurant and bar are fabulous, the Dover Sole is fantastic, and finally the staff is what really makes this hotel. Every employee of this hotel makes it appoint to ensure your satisfaction. Most nights we were not in our room for turn down services, but there were 2 nights where we were in ghetto room for turn down services and when we declined turned down services, the housekeeping staff was very sincere in asking if we needed anything and we asked for more bottled water (still and sparkling) and also more “snacks” and the provided both.

There is a 15% service charge each night (optional) and you can ask to have it removed, but I chose to leave it because that money goes to the staff (housekeeping, concierge, doorman, and other staff, which were exceptional and I felt the 15% is appropriate whilst not having to tip daily or per each time assisted.

Will definitely stay at this hotel again if I return to London as it is centrally located and can get to most must see places in London when accessing the underground.",5,2024,04,13
105,Outstanding!,"Exceptional experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair.

105,Amazing serving,"Alejandro and Elias have been wonderful. They have offered us amazing drinks and the service has been more than friendly. I will recommend it 100% to my friends. 
Also the piano player has done an amazing job. We could ask him for the songs that we wanted to listen",5,2024,04,11
105,A lovely boutique hotel experience!,"We only book boutique style hotels, because they offer personalized service,  give one a feeling of being amongst friends and provide a happy upbeat atmosphere.   We got to know the gentleman from Serbia who worked in the restaurant and a server from Sardinia.  We enjoyed dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed conversation with them both.   Their manner was exceptional.  Andrea helped by persevering in getting us set up on our phones with a new SIM card!  So grateful for that.  John the pianist was exceptional!  As a professionally trained musician I appreciated his nuanced, controlled and expressive piano technique.  Playing in a bar requires the musician not to overwhelm the room, but provide relaxing music for both those who want to enjoy the music and for those who want the 'atmosphere' of it.  This is a difficult balance to achieve. So kudos to John for achieving that.  I do suggest though that the piano should be tuned regularly as the sour notes at times were a bit jarring.  Gyorgy was a delight showing us where restaurants were and showing us a beautiful garden nearby.  He was fun, too. Jake helped us with numerous concierge items and was always patient and pleasant.  In the restaurant one server Hashmir?, was delightful in making breakfast just right for me, as I am very particular about 'hot' coffee!  He had a delightful sense of humour as well.  Mustafa with his top hat just added so much to our experience with a doorman!",5,2024,04,10
105,Quiet Gem that Exceeded Expectations,"Great place to stay in London.  We were surprised at the high level of quality in every aspect of guest services.  A special ""well done"" to the staff that is the first point of guest contact at any hotel: Doormen, bellhops, and registration.  Outstanding job by Ellen, Nicole, Joseph, Gyorgy, and Mustafa.  Our week-long stay could not have been better.  Our ""superior"" room equaled any top-of-the-line room at other similarly priced hotels elsewhere.  Definitely the place to stay on our next visit.",5,2024,04,09
105,Great team at the Chesterfield Mayfair,Jake and his team at the Chesterfield Mayfair made our visit so special.

105,Our Home In London,"The Chesterfield is our home whenever we come to London, which is usually once a year.  The hotel has a warm, charming feeling which is reinforced by the staff.  Prior to our arrival I had a good deal of contact with Jake, one of the concierges and he was incredibly helpful.  When we checked into the hotel and I met Jake, it was like meeting an old friend.  All of the staff we interacted with were warm, friendly and very helpful.  This year we brought friends of ours who had only been to London once, a number of years ago.  They now know (and agree) why my wife and I always rave about the Chesterfield, Mayfair.  I'm already looking forward to my next stay.",5,2024,04,06
105,Thank you Chesterfield - you are the best,"This is my favourite hotel in London, the staff are amazing and it feels like a home away from home.

My family also stay and we are the staff always go the extra mile.  Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair, you are the best.",5,2024,04,03
105,The honest truth from a 9 year old,"A review from my 9 year old son:

""My favourite part was a man called Rafal. He let me tell him what I would change to make it better. I said I'd really like a fizzy chocolate mousse with dry ice as an exit drink. Then he gave me a selection of jams to take home. He was super kind. I rate the food 1 trillion out of one. The menu was amazing and I love what you can order, it's so delicious. The welcome drink is my favourite but I really love the jam, chocolate spread and ham sandwiches and the plain scones with jam on them. I would like to go back immediately. I would recommend if you were an adult reading this, you should take your son or daughter to this wonderful place in London and they will tell you it was the best day of their lives.""

I couldn't have said it better myself! Always a lovely treat to come to the Chesterfield and we look forward to coming back soon. Thank you so much to all the lovely staff (but especially Rafal).",5,2024,04,03
105,Perfect location. Perfect for families. BEST service.,This was such a surprise of an amazing hotel. We traveled as a family with two kids and two adults and the room was perfect.

105,"Outstanding customer service, beautiful accommodations","Stayed here for my wedding anniversary and I was very impressed, not only by the accommodations but the quality of service. The staff at this hotel goes above and beyond. I was a particularly troublesome guest with many requests, but all were answered immediately with a smile to my satisfaction. 

Aside from the quality of accommodations and client service, the hotel is ideally situated in Mayfair, a short walk or tube ride to just about anywhere in London.",5,2024,04,02
105,Quintessental British,"Stayed here with my daughter while we were in London. The Chesterfield Mayfair is centrally located to the major attractions with the exception of St. Paul's Cathedral. It's in a residential neighborhood so it's very quiet. There are not many restaurants around it. 

The staff is superb. Anything you need, they have it. We had forgotten adapters and they were able to provide two adapters for the remainder of our trip. Room is spacious and bed is extremely comfortable. Would definitely return again!",5,2024,04,01
105,"Great hotel, handy location.","Excellent attentive service from the moment we arrived until checking out. The bar area is very comfortable with a great cocktail menu. 
We didn't eat our evening meal with the hotel but the breakfast was delicious and again, the service was excellent.

105,Perfect hotel in London Mayfair,"I have recently returned from a 6 night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my adult daughter. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by staff, and were able to enjoy the first of our daily breakfasts in the lovely dining room. The dining staff were so friendly, and the breakfast options were plentiful and delicious. When shown to our room, we were pleased to embrace the lovely decor and well appointed room. The old world European elegance is evident in all the details of both the room and public areas of the hotel.
The Chesterfield Mayfair is located in a perfect section of London, well positioned for walking, sightseeing, and taking public transit. Despite being very central, the hotel is extremely quiet at night, in a lovely Mayfair neighborhood. We couldn't have asked for a better location!
Lastly, the staff at all levels of service were truly exceptional; from the front desk, to the concierge, to door staff, to room upkeep and the dining room and bar staff. Clearly the Chesterfield Mayfair places a high value on professionalism and superior service. 
We hope to return to London again, and now know that we can book the Chesterfield Mayfair with confidence for an exception stay!",5,2024,03,30
105,Paula and John C. February 2024,"We booked this hotel through Costco Travel on a whim, to visit our son while he was studying abroad this past February 2024. It was our first time to London too. The hotel staff couldn't be more friendlier and very helpful. They always greeted us with a warm and welcoming smile like you were the only guest there. They continually ask us how we were doing. They directed us and gave us good advise any time we needed. The food was delicious. We ate in the restaurant  several nights. The servers were delightful and friendly while explaining the menu. You can tell everyone there like their jobs. Our breakfast was complimentary off the menu, not buffet style. The tables were beautifully set and the food was alway hot and delicious.  The bar was vey comfortable and inviting with a piano bar. The bartenders all knew their craft and made delicious drinks. The menu at the bar was just as delicious and fresh as well.
I think if we ever visit London again we would choose to stay there again for all the above reasons. They treated us like old friends. I would Highly recommend staying at this hotel.

105,London / Chesterfield,"Have stayed at the Chesterfield several times in the past as its close walking to Shepards Market and Buckingham. Always found accommodations and staff to be ""formal/friendly/accommodating"".  Breakfast, dinner and lounge/bar food always without compromise. Staff makes the visit enjoyable like you are both welcomed and a family member. Shout out to Jake, Mustapha and Namrata...make you feel like part of the Chesterfield family in Mayfair.  Housekeeping must get 5 stars also!!",5,2024,03,24
105,Great Stay!,"Great stay! Top notch customer service. The entire staff was amazing! The moment you walk in you feel the warmth from everyone that greets you. The room was nice, bed was comfortable. They had a little cake waiting for us in the room because it was our anniversary.We had breakfast every morning at their restaurant. Hashim was our waiter. He was wonderful! The breakfast was great and he was so nice and helpful. When I return, this will be where we will be staying!",5,2024,03,24
105,5 Star Service From Staff. Amazing Hotel.,"What can i say about this hotel other than amazing.

Second time I have had the pleasure of staying here and what makes it such a fantastic hotel is the staff. 

My Wife and I have recently found out we are expecting twins. One of the staff members overhead me talking with a family member who we’re meeting and asked him if it was ok to send something to our room to congratulate us. I have attached a picture and we were overwhelmed. 

The atmosphere at the hotel and especially the bar area is amazing. Again all thanks to the staff. 

The club sandwich is still the best sandwich i’ve ever tasted and so much.

Amazing time again at the Chesterfield we can’t thank you enough.",5,2024,03,23
105,Absolutely perfect in every way!,"I am a ""hotel snob"" and am pretty fussy about where I stay because being in a peaceful, clean and quiet environment can make all the difference to how my day rolls out. This hotel exceeded my expectations! The kindness and helpfulness of every single staff member was much appreciated, especially after being up all night on the plane. I felt welcomed from the minute I stepped through the door. There is an old world charm about this lovely hotel and I felt immediately comfortable. My room was peaceful and quiet, the bed a dream, and everything was clean and tidy. The restaurant was excellent and I enjoyed dinner and a wonderful full English Breakfast. Thank you to Jade for introducing me to Brown Sauce! Also thank you to George for being so helpful with my suitcases. Everyone goes the extra mile here, to make sure guests are happy and they genuinely care about their guests and work well as a team. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! The location is wonderful too!",5,2024,03,21
105,I will be back!,"Lovely stay! The staff was extraordinary. We were welcomed and treated like old friends. Every day we were met by various staff people who offered helpful hints, suggestions, and aided us in our travels. It’s been a very long time of staying in nice hotels since I have been so comfortable and relaxed. The food in the restaurant is over the moon. Although we never had the breakfast there, there are many petri and places to eat immediately around the corner. Room was comfortable and quiet. Everything was clean and had an unbelievably beautiful English charm. From the managers to the maids extraordinary.!",5,2024,03,21
105,Fantastic stay,"We just came back from a wonderful one-night stay with dinner and afternoon tea. The team were exceptional and went over and above to make my birthday / our anniversary special. They even served afternoon tea later for us so that it was in line with our Ramadan timings.

Big thank you to everyone at front of house and at the restaurant!",5,2024,03,18
105,Upscale English Boutique Hotel in ideal location,"I was looking for something with English charm, a restaurant, front desk, not a twin bed. This had all the amenities in an amazing location. It was easy to get out and explore all the parts of London I wanted to see. I was going to be alone for half my stay so I wanted to make sure I stayed somewhere with door staff. All the staff was supremely helpful. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to write this so I could list them by name! On one of my solo nights I had dinner in the bar and they took fantastic care. The bathroom was all marble and beautiful. I was so happy with my choice to stay here. I looked at many many hotels before choosing the Chesterfield and I was very pleased with my decision. I talked to another American traveler who said she has stayed with them multiple times for all the same reasons.",5,2024,03,16
105,Wonderful Hotel in a fabulous location.,"It's been quite sometime since we last stayed at the Chesterfield, this trip was for my wife's birthday and also retirement from being a nurse for the NHS. We chose this hotel simply as it's a cozy little spot and it's very well located, we love Shepherds Market which is just around the corner.

We were giving a great room on floor 6, bed was large and incredibly comfy, the room itself is well furnished, and had a turn down every evening, where bottles of water and a sweet treat was left.

All the staff are really lovely, and I really have to thank them all for making our stay extra special, I won't say what it was in case people try being chancers for the same thing, but it was very much appreciated.",5,2024,03,15
105,Third stay at this well-located gem,"This was our third stay as we had enjoyed our previous visits. The hotel is in the Red Carnation group and having stayed at several of their hotels we would not hesitate to recommend any of them.
We arrived by car and were greeted by a member of staff who came out and took our bags, then offered to park the car for me.  
The location is central( just off Berkley Square) with many of London's attractions and restaurants within walking distance but our room was lovely and quiet. Without question all of the staff are friendly, helpful and appear to be very happy in their work. 
The bar has a quality look and feel and we were given nibbles with our drinks as well as a pleasant surprise of a piece of cheese on toast!
The bedrooms have every amenity you could wish for including a plate of cookies and a piece of fudge. 
Breakfast provides a great choice with quality ingredients used-good to see black pudding on the menu ( though no fried bread-a particular favourite treat of mine!). The service was great at breakfast with newspapers provided too. We stayed 3 nights Wednesday to Saturday and breakfast was considerably busier on the Saturday morning but service did not seem to suffer. 
I recommend this quality gem of a hotel very highly indeed and we will be back soon.",5,2024,03,14
105,Fantastic hospitality,"Fantastic service. Great food. Very helpful and willing to always help when needed. Would highly recommmed! Will recommmed to many friends and family this hotel! Loved the morning breakfast, cappuccino, English breakfasts, porridge, and more!",5,2024,03,11
105,Birthday Visit,"Myself and my wife booked the Mayfair to celebrate my 60th birthday. Unfortunately I wasn't 100% with a sore throat and cough. This was noted by Giada, who checked us in. Later in the day she knoocked at our door, with all the ingredients for hot toddy, which was most welcome. 
I would recommend The Chesterfield, as the location is excellent, the staff are very attentive, (especially Giada), the room was very comfortable, and the breakfast was wonderful.",5,2024,03,11
105,Great Experiences,"Oh my god, did we hit gold with this hotel.  From the moment we walked in to when we left, the service was impeccable!. When we enter our first room, it turned that the hotel was doing renovation above our room, so we were upgrade to a junior suite.  Thank you!

The restaurant was excellent for breakfasts and dinners.  Around the corner, there are a few pubs.

Definitely going back there the next time we're in London

To be completely honest, there is a little con with this hotel.  It's about 10 minutes walk from the Green Park Station.  It was a nice walk and completely safe",5,2024,03,10
105,Above and Beyond!,"From the start the service was incredible.  Unfortunately my 17yo daughter was sick the first day and didn’t leave the room, Andrea sent up chamomile tea and bath salts.  Such a nice gesture when we were far from home. That evening I had a wonderful meal in the bar with lovely piano music so I could stay close.  Once we were able to explore Joseph and Jake were so kind with directions, advice, hailing us a taxi, and directing us to a local gem for coffee etc!  
The location was brilliant - on a quiet street but walking distance to many of the main tourist destinations. I would not hesitate to stay here again!",5,2024,03,10
105,Short break in London,"Fabulous 4 night stay at the Chesterfield. Great location for getting to the sites (easy tube connection at Green Park and many bus routes nearby). In our short stay we managed to get to sites such as the British Museum, Natural History Museum, and a trip to the Lyceum, all easy journeys from the hotel. The noise level in the rooms was very low, making the stay pleasant. Great breakfast with a wide selection, the fruit was very fresh and tasty and my wife loved the decafe flat white with oatmilk. We also had a couple of evening meals in the restaurant, again very enjoyable.
The staff were very friendly and extremely attentive, those whose names we can remember are Andre (very warm welcoming personality and great conversation), Jade, Isreal, Nanmrata and Hashim (not sure of the spelling) in the restaurant and Anna at reception. There was also a very friendly staff member at the entrance from Venice who welcomed us. The housekeeping staff were also very friendly and efficient.
I think we will return to this hotel in the future in our next trip to London.",5,2024,03,07
105,Wonderful,"What a wonderful stay at your beautiful hotel, firstly all the hotel staff went above and beyond especially Jake and the gentleman who’s office was at the door, such a wonderful person, so helpful and kind, the hotel was explicably clean, so we would like to thank our house keeping lady, she did a great job, Great bar with fabulous choice of cocktails. One last thing the breakfast we could not fault it
We will be back 10/10",5,2024,03,06
105,SIMPLY THE BEST!!,"Simply ""The Best""!! The hotel, the standards, the food, the bar, AND more importantly the best staff we have ever been 'looked after' by!!
From the moment you arrive at The Chesterfield every member of the amazing team ""fall over backwards"" to make your stay brilliant. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for any of them!!! Thank you.",5,2024,03,04
105,Friendly service with a smile,"Always service with a smile and the staff are ready to help answer any questions. I really enjoy this hotel for its family friendly feel and also for its location. It’s minutes away from many London sites yet still close to 3 parks: Green Park, St James and Hyde Park.",5,2024,03,03
105,Best Place in London,"The perfect place to stay in London. A GREAT staff, very polite, elegant with great education! The bar with Piano is magnifient and the food great! It will defenetely be my second home when i will go to back to London. The location is just perfect, close by the best areas of the city!",5,2024,03,03
105,Fantastic stay in a beautiful part of london,"The guest experience has been amazing, the staff from reception to breakfast and house keeping have all been so welcoming and attentive.

The room is beautiful and well laid out, love the finer touches including tea cup, fresh smelling toiletries and ample towels. 

We had drinks in the bar, it was relaxed and comfortable and we even had a singer start up!

Breakfast was delicious, and served quickly and hot. Great selection of food to choose from.

Having a later than normal check out time was an unexpected treat too!",5,2024,03,03
105,A beautiful hotel with great service,"My wife and I stayed overnight at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel on our recent visit to London. The hotel and our room were both excellent with a really good shower and bathroom. The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive which made our stay a genuine pleasure. We shall be back!",5,2024,03,02
105,Personalized Experience,"Excellent experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair for staying two nights, hosting multiple meetings in their meeting rooms, drinks at the bar, room service and the restaurant. The staff made all of these experiences top notch and personalized. I hope to be back either for business or maybe a quiet couples dinner.",5,2024,03,02
105,Great Experience in London at The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel,"The location, staff, accomodations, food, housekeeping, piano bar, high tea were all excellent. British Airways lost my baggage on the flight to London and the people at the front desk were very helpful in directing me to stores, asking me if I needed anything, and making sure I was as comfortable as possible. The concierge, Jake, was particularly attentive, and spent considerable time each day trying to contact someone at BA and making calls on my behalf. I cannot say enough about him. He is a true professional!
My friends and I had a great London experience. The tour package through Costco was great. And the Hotel was wonderful.",5,2024,02,29
105,Great experience,"Nice hotel in an excellent location with comfortable rooms and nice restaurant. Very nice and charming staff always ready to help. 
Special acknowledgement to the barman Alejandro. Great predisposition to help, professional and charm.",5,2024,02,29
105,Wonderful Hotel in Mayfair,This hotel was top notch. The rooms were well appointed and fairly nicely sized for Europe. Nice bath products and linens. The restaurant was fantastic and their formal tea is a can’t miss. Treat yourself to Dover Sole for dinner one night too. The staff throughout the hotel were lovely and made us feel welcome at all times. The only recommendation I would give is when it is time for the next refresh that some outlets with USB ports are added. Look forward to staying there again!,5,2024,02,28
105,Excellent Customer Experience at this top London Hotel,"What a fabulous weekend break staying at The Chesterfield in London. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming . Ellen on reception and Daniela in the restaurant were exceptional, professional and helpful. Our room was very clean and had everything you need. The bed super comfy and the best bit soft pillows! The restaurant was lovely decor wise and breakfast superb. Location for us was perfect. Easy walk through to Trafalgar Square/Covent Garden.  The Customer Service from the whole team was excellent.",5,2024,02,26
105,Candy extravaganza at afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea at The Chesterfield Mayfair was a great experience! Their candy themed afternoon tea is a treat for all the senses. Beautiful little cakes with twists on candy classics like peanut butter cup, drumsticks and love hearts. The finger sandwiches were also delicious. Fun for both kids and parents. The attentive service was the icing on the cake, and our server Carmen made the experience extra special. Highly recommended.",5,2024,02,22
105,"Wonderful staff, great location","We have stayed here before and enjoyed the experience hence our return. The staff are unfailingly helpful, cheerful and polite which makes a real difference. Nicole on reception was wonderful and Jade in the restauarant were the two standouts but everyone else was very helpful. Our room was clean and well presented although the shower could have been a bit more powerful. Also at our age getting in and out of a bath to shower is getting harder but it was a minor issue. The hotel was very quiet with no noise disturbances. The food at breakfast was excellent and people couldn't be more helpful. Will definitely return again.",5,2024,02,19
105,Down to earth hospitality with great class,"As long-term residents of Mayfair, and having been customers and admirers of the Chesterfield Hotel’s Terrace Bar, a very cosy, iconic space with an elegant feel, we have to thank the management and staff for a great evening recently when we hosted some friends for drinks and canapés. Biagio Sarubbi, the deputy manager, went above and beyond to accommodate us, and truly made us feel welcome and at home. All of our friends loved being there in this truly special boutique hotel, and we could not have been better looked after by Fiachra and Marilene. One immediately feels swept away in a vibrant, ordered, well-mannered and pampered environment, where nothing is too much bother, and the end result is always that everybody has a pleasant and memorable time. Thank you all for making our celebration such, and we cannot recommend this wonderful hospitality enough. We will be back to enjoy this wonderful environment.",5,2024,02,14
105,Amazing hotel and staff in the heart of central London,"I was hosting a baby shower and from the beginning of the process Amanda and all the amazing staff made the occasion absolutely superb for us all. 
The afternoon tea was delicious and all the help and the attention to detail,  made sure everyone felt special. 
The feedback from everyone in attendance was overwhelmingly positive and they were so impressed with the hotel, staff, location, food and overall service.
Without doubt would highly recommend this venue and hiring the private room!",5,2024,02,14
105,Brilliant English Hotel,"Stayed here for a couples holiday in London.  The hotel was absolutely brilliant.  A wonderfully quintessential English experience.  The top notch British service was evident in all that they did.  Beautifully appointed rooms in British decor, tea service, restaurant, nightly turn down service and all around hospitality was felt all week long.
The front desk staff were there to provide any information or last minute items(converters) that we needed.
Additionally the location in Mayfair was superb.  Within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants, Sheperds market, Picadilly, and Buckingham Palace, Parliament, and Big Ben!  We even walked to London Eye.  
I will be coming back on business and will stay there again.  Why stay at a major hotel chain when you can have a truly immersed English Experience!  Well worth it.",5,2024,02,13
105,A Gem in Mayfair,"We had a truly delightful stay at this charming boutique hotel in Mayfair.  The staff - and in particular Jake the concierge and the entire wait staff at Butler’s restaurant - really went above and beyond.  The food was wonderful, and afternoon tea was a great experience.  The location is very convenient to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, Westminster Abbey and Parliament.  The hotel doesn’t have a gym to speak of, but guests can work out (or swim) at The Lansdowne Club which is a short walk. All in all, we were very pleased with the accommodations.",5,2024,02,13
105,Simply a Great Hotel and we cannot wait to return,"Our stay at The Mayfield Chesterfield was as good as it gets. What a beautiful and lovely hotel only made better by the most considerate and charming and knowledgeable staff. We spent 8 nights here and the hotel is in the Mayfair area of London which allowed us to walk almost everywhere we wanted to visit. We are New Yorkers so we love to walk. We started our days enjoying the absolute best breakfasts which included eggs that were cooked to perfection. Our servers were so kind and fun. Carmen knew what I loved and when I had a slight cold and cough she served me a tea that made me feel better within 24 hours. She was a delight but then I have to give a shout out to Jade. Jade could lift your mood with her vivacious personality and magical energy. We had so much fun chatting with her. The entire staff seemed to love what they do and that only makes guests feel more welcomed. Also Jozef gave us some nice restaurant recommendations and took great care of us.
The bar is fantastic. Every night we did a ""debrief"" with beautifully created cocktails in very comfortable seating areas. Again, the ladies who served us were fabulous.
Our room with a king bed was immaculate and the sheets were crisp and clean. Each night we got a treat and a large bottle of water. This is the second time visiting the Chesterfield Mayfair and no doubt there will be a third, hopefully sooner rather than later.",5,2024,02,12
105,A memorable experience from start to finish.,"From the second we entered the building we were met with outstanding hospitality from the lovely lady at the front desk and the others around us. Also, they had amazing communication before arrival in ensuring that everything would be set up to perfection.

We received assistance with luggage as soon as we entered and this was taken right to our room. The room we stayed in was beautiful and uniquely decorated and even came with two bathrooms, which is a great feature for a couple. 

The room was equipped with everything you need. We then enjoyed the best fish and chips ever in their cosy restaurant whilst receiving great service throughout. It was my partners birthday and they went above and beyond through each part of our stay. The waiter even aided in preparing a surprise slice of cake for my partner, which had happy birthday written in chocolate.

Once we had finished dinner we went back to the room which was romantically decorated and just perfect. The room was so inviting we decided to stay in all evening. 

The stay was one to remember.",5,2024,02,06
105,Sweet afternoon tea,"Was the best afternoon tea I’ve had in a long time. The food was lovely especially the pizza flavour sandwich. And the sweet flavour cakes was such a fun idea. The staff really made the experience tho, shoutout to jade who was our waitress for the tea. Her recommendations were amazing especially the fruit salad tea. In general all staff were friendly and knowledgable. Definately would recommend. The best bit also, you get to take home pick and mix sweets at the end.",5,2024,02,06
105,Wonderful hotel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is just as described, a wonderful traditional hotel with very friendly service, everybody knows your name the moment you enter. I had special requests about a quiet room and hopefully with a view and all my requests were met. Nothing about the usual 'we are fully booked and can't do anything' -mantra, but a genuine effort to meet customer's requests. Thank you for that.

The area is of course very nice and easy connections anywhere in London.",5,2024,02,05
105,Top quality professional and friendly hotel. Staff are excellent and no request is too much trouble.,"Excellent hotel in terms of location, value, and most importantly friendly and helpful staff. We were made extremely welcome and looked after incredibly well. Our suite was perfect for our needs and the central location meant we could walk to most of our destinations.",5,2024,01,29
105,great Hotel,"When in London do the best and this is one of the best hotels i ever stayed in.The staff could not have been more helpful from getting taxis to giving us directions.The rooms were just so good and clean with lots of hot water.We hhad to leave early for our flight and they gave us coffee and buns to go,what a nice touch.If im ever back in London I know where im staying",5,2024,01,28
105,Best hotel we have stayed in!,"My wife and I stayed at this exceptional hotel for three nights this month. We were given an upgrade to a junior suite due to the non arrival of our pre booked Mercedes at the station. A beautiful, clean, quiet room with two bathrooms! Delicious breakfasts were served by lovely attentive staff. We used the terrace bar each day, and the cob salad and club sandwich we ate on day two were superb. We were also given two free cocktails to accompany them.

 All the staff we encountered - receptionists, concierges, waiting on staff, bartenders, housekeeping - were so kind, friendly, and professional. We look forward to staying again this autumn. Thank you for such a  great stay, and thanks to DM Biagio Sarubbi, who was so helpful.

",5,2024,01,27
105,An elegant hotel with a welcoming staff,"A wonderful one week stay ! Great location in Mayfair. Lovely decor throughout the hotel . But more importantly, an excellent and very helpful staff- especially Ellen. This was my 2nd stay here and I can’t imagine being at another hotel in London.",5,2024,01,26
105,Whisky Tasting Experience,"Viviane took us through the whisky experience v well, thoroughly enjoyable and a good laugh! She was friendly and knowledgeable on the subject, intertwining her own experiences with whisky. Taken around the world in whiskies, the comparisons were clear and the whole experience felt educational!",5,2024,01,25
105,Door staff wonderful above and beyond made our stay,One of the nicest experiences ever the staff above and beyond.  The doormen are wonderful and charming and cannot do more for you helped with luggage getting taxis unloading and loading cars in fact they made the stay worth it.  Unfortunately late in the night there was unexpected noise from loud music blaring from the hire biles that play very loud music.   Perhaps there is something that after midnight the owners of the bikes are told to turn the music off in charles street  but lovely experience,5,2024,01,23
105,Excellent whiskey tour,The whiskey tasting with Viviane was exceptional. She was so friendly knowledgeable and fun. A definite must experience.if you’re in the area and looking for an unexpected experience I recommended booking this. Lovely way to spend the afternoon with an above average guide.,5,2024,01,23
105,Mayfair Magic,"My wife and spent 7 nights in the Chesterfield arriving on the 11/1/24 and departing on the 18/1/24.
This was our eighth stay and quite simply we would not stay any where else.The incredible location of the Hotel coupled with the friendly and highly efficient service from all staff members never ceases to impress.The quality of the breakfast is consistently excellent and the beds are a dream to sleep in.Darren the Head Concierge together with his assistant Jake really go out of their way to assist in all arrangements/queries wether challenging or minor.
Highly recommended",5,2024,01,21
105,The best experience of true London luxury hotels,"Amazing stay at The Chesterfield, it was my husband's birthday and the staff pulled out the stops. We got a complimentary upgrade to our room which kicked off the celebrations perfectly. I could not fault the staff, from the personal touches in the room to the general service everything was 5*. They took particular care to the fact I am heavily pregnant and made sure everything was taken care of. 

We'll for sure be back to this hidden gem of luxury in Mayfair

Thank you all so much again for a memorable stay",5,2024,01,18
105,A fabulous gem in the heart of Mayfair,"What a fabulous experience to be couched in the lap of luxury at this Mayfair hotel. 

Sadly, I only had one night as I could have stayed for weeks! The experience began when I was greeted with a smile by the delightful Mustafa and then checked in by Ellen at the front desk. First impressions mean a great deal and the reception I received was a taste of things to come. 

My room was a haven of comfort, warmth, and tranquillity on a cold January night. An enormous bed wrapped me in delicously crisp linens and the softest pillows possible, and it was clear that the management pays attention to every detail - from the compact coffee and milk assortment to the luscious bathroom amenities to the swivel-screen television to the large bathtub and  a button that closes the blinds on the windows.

Since it was freezing out, I dined in Butlers restaurant and was very impressed by the quality of the food and the attention from the staff (Alfie and Sakib had the perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism).  I particularly enjoyed the trio of salt along with a tiny mortar and pestle on the table, and every bite of the meal was memorable: gorgeously creamy and delectable Scottish king scallops followed by a squash and ricotta ravioli with sage and cranberries that was perfectly cooked and presented. Along with the meal was an excellent selection of wines - I chose the Walker Bay Sauvignon Blanc, which was delicious. 
 
Before departing the next day, I had a light breakfast of granola and yogurt (all I could manage after the previous night's indulgence) and once again was greeted with a smile and a warm welcome (farewell?) by Slavena & Vanilda.

Overall a simply delightful experience from a team who clearly know what it means to run a quality establishment.",5,2024,01,17
105,Exceptional,"I can't put in words how good this hotel is! 

Came for my birthday and the service and attention to detail have been exceptional. 

The restaurant- exceptional, all food- exceptional,the bar- exceptional, the drinks- exceptional, the piano player- exceptional, all staff- exceptional! 

You can tell that everyone working there cares about what they do and offer. 

Checking in offered a drink immediately I have never experienced this before. Got a free room upgrade for my birthday there was cake in the room when we got up. 

If you are thinking about booking this hotel do it!! I only wish I could stay longer.

Went to J Sheeky one evening is was garage in comparison to everything at the Chesterfield. My one regret is leaving that hotel to eat anywhere else.  

Thank you Chesterfield!",5,2024,01,15
105,"A Wonderful, Welcoming Stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair","This is a lovely old British hotel, classically decorated and wonderfully located in the Mayfair neighborhood of London, which makes it very easy to walk to many attractions and some of the best high-end shopping in London. We spent a week here -- my husband, our 22-year-old son, and I -- in early January, and next to the hotel's location, its biggest asset is its staff. From the doorman, to the front desk, to the concierge, to the restaurant, the staff was always extremely pleasant, welcoming, and helpful. 

Istvan, the doorman, greeted us with a broad smile and welcoming words when we arrived, followed by Ellen at the front desk, who happily answered several initial questions for us. A few days later, another front desk attendant, Shiham, helped me find a store where my son could get some spray paints so he could add to the art at the Leake Street Arches graffiti tunnel (a must see!), where graffiti art is encouraged. Shiham and the concierge, Loris, also turned us on to a hidden enclave of great restaurants and pubs called Shepherd's Market that was just a couple of blocks from the hotel (be sure to try Misto if you like Italian -- amazing pastas and the best tiramisu!. The restaurant at the hotel is also very good and offers delicious breakfasts (available included) and wonderful dinners, and our servers there, Carmen and Joselito, were always pleasant and attentive. Live piano music every night in hotel bar -- which is open 24-hours -- is another treat. 
The hotel also has a great high tea built around a candy shop that's especially perfect for young ones. The only disappointment was no gym on site, but there are ones close by that the hotel can send you to. 

Overall, we had a delightful, weeklong stay and would definitely return here on a future trip to London. Shout outs to bellmen Mustafa and Georgie, who helped us with our 4 large suitcases, multiple backpacks, and snowboard when we were checking out. 

Finally, don't miss the Mayfair Mercato, a wonderful collection of bars and eateries in a former church that's near the hotel, and the Mayfair Chippy restaurant right next door to the Mercato, which has excellent fish and chips!",5,2024,01,13
105,Our new London Hotel,"Brilliant hotel in a brilliant location with brilliant staff service. Our first time and wont be our last. Had a 3 for 2 discount deal so upgraded ourselves to a small suite (larger room). The staff also placed a small christmas tree in the room - how nice was this. The room however #528 does not have any drawers to unpack into. I also wish more hotels would have hooks for coats at winter time. We enjoyed a very good breakfast on one morning with super friendly staff, restaurant very busy. Now for the bar that we enjoyed each night of our stay with darn good bartenders and cocktials. A mean snowball, but not so sure about the truffle negroni. Really just a superb stay before christmas.",5,2024,01,10
105,Simply Put- The Chesterfield Mayfair Is Where You Need To Stay!,"Please read this thoroughly before you book you next stay in London. We have been going to London every Christmas for the last several years, and have visited and stay in London a total of about 12 times, (roughly), and at other locations. The Chesterfield Mayfair IS THE place to stay. Starting with the location, you are only minutes away to Green Park or Bond Street stations, so the access is quite easy and to find it is quite easy. Centrally located to all things London, this makes the location in even better for walking all over as well. The rooms are very clean, spacious by London standards, the food at the restaurant, room service, and in the bar are superb. The afternoon tea is a must do while in London as well. BUT, let me tell you the real star of the show. It's incredible staff. They say you come as friend, leave as friends but come back as family. That is so true!! After staying several years at a high end hotel also in Mayfair, we noticed they didn't care about our loyalty, and more so, when we had a room leak two days in a row they really didn't do much to help us. At that point we had spent over 80 nights between us and friends over a number of years and thought they don't really care about us, let's look around for our next visit. When doing our 2022 trip we decided to stay at The Chesterfield and never looked back. We stayed there again this trip, December 2023/2024 and went back as family, and was treated that way. The staff, several of them, remembered us from the previous year!! Namrata remembered my love of their cosmos in the bar, down to me liking an orange peel in it! She is so sweet! Alejandro makes a mean smokey old fashioned, (the process is also quite impressive). He also remembered us from last year. Mufasta, the door man is a whole next level of impressive. Not only is he extremely kind, puts a warm smile to your heart, he is helpful. I had an ear infection from water and he told me let me get some olive oil and cotton for you, that will do the trick. I couldn't believe my ears and doubted him and asked where the nearest pharmacy was, (he directed me to just a block away and said they have a dr there as well if you really need one, which is also super helpful as we did for another reason). What did the pharmacy give me, olive oil! He is smart and just simply amazing. Shiham and Akira are brothers and are so helpful and professional. We had the good fortune of being in the bar area one night and their parents were there to celebrate their dad's birthday, Jose I believe. We wanted to thank the parents for how wonderful their sons were that we bought all of them and us a round of shots. Finally, the nightly entertainment is great. There is an older gentleman who is there, (sorry I forget his name), and Guy a singer/player that is there as well. Both are fantastic!! Guy was even on The Voice, a talent show aired in several countries, and the NYE 3 piece live band was also impressive. All of these people I name, and the unnamed all make you feel so welcomed and comfortable. We stayed 11 nights as well as our friend and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it! Every night we yearned to get back to the hotel for a cocktail or two, live music, and the warmth of all of these people, you should desire to stay here and come back as family. You can tell the management at this location knows how to run a tight ship and they all seem to love each other, you can feel that love as a guest. ",5,2024,01,08
105,Fantastic Stay!,"We are just on our way home from a
truly wonderful stay at this gorgeous hotel. We stayed here once for my birthday 2 years ago and it was just like coming home…we loved it.
Shiham on reception was an absolute star and took great care of us from the moment we checked in….he’s a real credit to this hotel. We popped out for dinner and then spent the evening in the lovely bar and the singer was superb. We will definitely be back for another birthday and thanks again to Shiham, we had a great time!",5,2024,01,07
105,Family Holiday at The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield, situated in a fun and accessible part of the city, was beautifully decorated for the holiday season. Its staff members were attentive and engaged and seemed to genuinely enjoy their work. We felt like we were part of the incredible history of the hotel and of Mayfair!",5,2024,01,06
105,Christmas Event,Fantastic Rotary Club Christmas event. Excellent event room. Best Christmas meal that I  had over the period - very good value. Food and service was excellent as always. Christmas Pudding was the best that I have ever had. ,5,2024,01,05
105,First Time Staying at The Chesterfield Hotel,"Very friendly staff, great drinks at the bar with an amazing piano player, great location (although a bit loud with all the construction and located behind a lot of some sort that seems quite loud). The room was stained a lot on the carpet flooring and wallpaper. Other than that it was a nice stay. ",4,2024,01,05
105,Amazing yet again! ,"We love staying at The Chesterfield when we're in London. The beds are so comfy, and the rooms are very quiet. The staff are exceptional - so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Mayfair is also very walkable and you can either walk, or jump on the Tube to anywhere you need to go. ",5,2024,01,04
105,"London's Finest for Accommodation, Service and Going Above and Beyond","We have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair many times over the past 20 years and have always found their accommodations and service to be top notch.  It is our favourite place to stay in London.  The staff are always happy to help with special requests to make one's stay more comfortable.
During my husband's and my visit in early December, I had an accident and was hospitalized for over a week, requiring us to extend our stay in London for an additional 11 days.  The hotel staff could not have been more kind or accommodating.  They extended our room reservation at a very busy time of year, allowing us to keep our room and adding accessibility equipment to the room to make it easier for me on my return from hospital.  When they heard of my accident, a get well card with messages from the staff, a book and chocolates were given to my husband for me to cheer me up.  They took my husband under their wing and supported him during his stay and visits to me in hospital  When I returned to the hotel, I was made to feel very special with support and concern from the staff.  At the end of our visit, I had asked if I could purchase a special bread made at the hotel to bring back to Canada.  Lo and behold that evening a freshly-baked loaf was delivered to our room with a hotel cookbook and holiday greetings.  
The Chesterfield Mayfair team added a huge silver lining to the cloud of my accident and recovery.  They deserve every praise and thanks.",5,2024,01,02

105,Best hotel stay!,"I can’t say enough great things about our stay at The Chesterfield. The staff and accommodation were all the absolute best. This was our first trip to London and we will be back and will stay at The Chesterfield again. Greta at the front desk was so helpful and honestly felt like talking to a friend you’ve known for years. Ever single staff we encountered made us feel welcomed. We also had a quick bite and drinks at the bar, had our first afternoon tea there, and a great band was playing. Beds were comfortable and bathroom had everything we needed. I will be back!",5,2023,12,24
105,Winter Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"As a second time guest of their afternoon tea, this is one of the highlights we have when visiting London.  The hotel is beautiful.  The staff are welcoming and friendly.  The tea experience is delightful for teenagers and adult.  We first took our son at age 9 and he enjoyed it.  Again at age 14 he enjoyed it.  The food is delicious and there are a number of teas to choose from.  Don't be put off by the price as the experience and food are worth it. ",5,2023,12,23

105,Afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea at the Butlers restaurant. The service was fantastic, especially our server, Jade, who made the whole experience absolutely magical for our 7 year old. The food was delicious and we ended up taking all our desserts home as we were too full to finish them! A nice touch was the sweet trolley which we could pick 3 different sweets each from. Absolutely delightful and thoroughly recommended. ",5,2023,12,20
105,Absolute Perfection!!,"Absolute perfection, better than ever! I have stayed at this establishment a handful of times and it’s always been great. This time however, they truly outdid themselves. We were a group of 8 and they accommodated our every need and went above and beyond for us. 

The staff is unparalleled and delivered excellent care. Greta at Checkin was an absolute delight. Jade in the restaurant was helpful and cheery. But Loris really made my trip, he made me smile every single time I saw him and welcomed me with gingerbread man cookies that made my heart happy. 

The rooms are exquisite, with all the finest amenities. The beds are ok, ask for a pillow topper and they will accommodate. The food at the restaurant is delicious and has a wide variety, may I suggest to get the breakfast included in your rate. The location could not be more convenient, quaint and quiet. 

I highly recommend this hotel, it feels like family and I will stay here every time I’m in London.",5,2023,12,20
105,Great stay,"This hotel was a wonderful stay for 3 December days in London. The staff worked hard on every request, the room was well appointed and the location was superb. The bar and restaurant staff in particular were stand outs.  Would be happy to give this our highest recommendation.

Also- the afternoon tea was top notch.",5,2023,12,19
105,Outstanding Traditional London Hotel with Excellent and Warm Service,"My wife and I stayed four nights in mid-December on a return visit to London to enjoy the Christmas lights, shopping and theater. This was our first stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair. The traditional architecture and decorations of the hotel were exactly what we wanted. We booked a Junior suite with two bathrooms. The warm, friendly service of the entire staff was outstanding. Head Concierge Darren Briggs was a particular standout. Darren arranged airport transportation for us that worked out perfectively. But he really excelled at procuring two tickets for my wife and I to the Charles Dickens Christmas Carol performance, even though the show was sold out. Thanks to Darren’s tenacity, we were left with a great memory. Amazing! The morning breakfast from the extensive menu was delicious. We also enjoyed the Christmas themed afternoon tea. The Chesterfield Mayfair is in an ideal central location for walking to nearby parks, Buckingham Palace, shopping on Regent Street, as well as an abundance of restaurants. This is a great choice, if you want a hotel with traditional old world London ambiance, as well as outstanding, warm and friendly service.",5,2023,12,18
105,Perfect ,Perfect for a trip with the girls. The rooms were beyond expectations. Comfortable beds and very spacious. We booked in to the afternoon tea and were so glad we did everything was perfect. Definitely be returning. ,5,2023,12,16
105,Marvellous Mayfair Experience,"We absolutely loved our stay at the 
Chesterfield - I have no hesitation in returning and recommending it to anyone that is seeking a boutique and intimate property in a prime location in Mayfair. From the start of the Reservation process. Leah and Frederica were “on it” - efficient, polite and solutions focused. The pre arrival emails from Alberto were a great touch. And on property, the team excelled. Special shout outs to Darren, Emma and Ellen who continuously went above and beyond. Ellen went the extra mile finding time to talk to our 8 year old son Saxon. Discovered that we were travelling to Lapland - and proceeded to curate a special comic focused around our pre Christmas holiday. This also included a turndown letter to myself and Saxon. World class hospitality! Bravo and thank you.",5,2023,12,15
105,Outstanding Chesterfield Hotel,"From the moment we stepped out of the taxi and were greeted by the doorman we felt like we were home. This is our third stay at this wonderful hotel and we were not to be disappointed. We were greeted on reception by Greeta, who was friendly and very professional, as we had arrived before our room was ready we were offered drinks whilst we waited and were given regular updates on how things were progressing. This initial service was more than echoed throughout our stay. My husband had the cheese and beer pairing which was given by the bar manager Alexandro, hope l have got your name correct, apologies if not, which he found very enjoyable and informative. All the staff are so friendly, our room was lovely and l must say the food in the restaurant and bar was excellent. If there was one suggestion l could make, from my own personal point of view, the food could be hotter, l can’t stand eating just warm food it has to be hot hot hot not warm. This is just a personal point of view not the view of my husband. That said this is a wonderful hotel, friendly top class service and we have already booked for our Christmas treat to ourselves for next year.",5,2023,12,13
105,Fabulous Gem,"This is our second time to stay at Chesterfield and couldn’t be happier with our experience.  We enjoyed our anniversary trip here in London. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely doorman and the house manager welcomed us asking if we needed anything and gave us his business card. Food, room, and atmosphere were  perfect. On departure we opted for a driver to bring us to the airport. All went smoothly thanks to concierge, Darren Briggs. Our flight was canceled and he was more than helpful to update our transport to the airport. Checkout was a breeze with the help from Heather. We recommended this hotel and we’ll be back next year!",5,2023,12,11
105,"Stylish, tastefull and ""a piece of art""","Stop everything!
We celebrated my mother in laws 70th birthday with one of the most brilliant afternoon tea experiences I've ever been to!
The variety of sandwiches, pastries and....champagne was, how can I make this right, a piece of art.
Loved the staff, environment and/or ambiance if you will.",5,2023,12,08
105,A Mayfair Retreat in the Heart of London,"From the moment you enter the elegant, comfortable lobby of the Chesterfield Mayfair and are greeted by the gracious, friendly and professional staff, you think ""Ahhhh, I'm really in London now"".  This gem of a hotel on a picturesque corner of quiet Mayfair is elegant, classic London, immaculate, warm and inviting, with a serene location surrounded by impressive buildings and cityscapes - walkable to many London iconic places and restaurants. Rooms are very clean and well equipped with the best tub soak ever after a long day of touring the city. Housekeeping is well run, efficient and neat.  Beds and bedding offer a really comfortable night's sleep.  On-site amenities such as the classic bar area with live entertainment (music, singing) nightly, as well as the restaurant are excellent in terms of ambience, service, cuisine and beverages.

105,Classic English Hotel,Wonderful hotel that makes you feel like you are in a classic English residence.   The service at every level was outstanding.

105,Amazing Afternoon Tea,We visted the Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate my brother's Graduation! The service and attention to detail was simply out of this world! We have never been made to feel more special or well taken care of before. The staff were incredibly attentive. Special shout out to Carmen who was such a bubbly personality and made the experience all the more enjoyable! The kitchen spoiled my brother with a special celebratory cake which was appreciated! Overall well done to the entire team! ,5,2023,12,04
105,A big hit with us,"We had a great 4-night stay in this lovely place. The (superior) room was pleasant and well-presented, and we really enjoyed the fine bedlinen and comfy mattress. The decor throughout was kind of old-school but in keeping with the venue and generally well executed.
We only ate in at breakfast, which was a big hit, great quality - and quantity - and servers Jade and Carmen were an absolute delight, making our mornings really memorable, thank you girls! 
The smoked salmon and breads were delicious and the coffee very good too. And I loved the ample quantities of complementary newspapers, very welcome.
Manager Adam was very helpful and responsive, in fact the whole team was great. 
All in all, a great stay, stylish without being stuffy. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2023,12,01
105,Unparalleled service in a beautiful traditional English setting ,"I don't even know where to begin to express how incredible this hotel is. We traveled to London over Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate my son's 15th birthday, and thanks in large part to the Chesterfield, it was a dream vacation. 

The meticulous and warm service begins from the moment you book. I reached out to the hotel with a question (we had booked a junior suite and I wanted to be sure they had a cot). I also mentioned my son's birthday and asked if they could leave a note in the room, and requested early check in if possible. They responded promptly that they had all requests noted. 

We walked to the hotel from the Bond Street station after arriving at Heathrow on Thanksgiving Day and were warmly greeted by Gregory (I believe this was his name) a doorman/bellhop. We were welcomed to London, the hotel, and he escorted us to the front desk. 

Clare checked us in and let us know that although our room was not ready, we had been upgraded to an executive suite. They took our bags and let us know they'd call when the room was ready. They also let us know that our bags would be in our room when we came back. 

Clare did call, but we missed it, and the room was available before 3pm. We arrived back at the hotel around 5, and received our keys from Greta. Again, we were so warmly welcomed, one would have thought we were dignitaries! Gregory walked us over to the elevator and directed us to our room - the Duchess Suite!

We were astonished by the room. It was absolutely beautiful. My son's room was larger than his NYC apartment bedroom. The two rooms were connected by a spacious foyer, and our room was enormous with a very comfy king sized bed. The bathroom was equally luxurious, and the scent of the shampoo, conditioner, and soap provided was incredible (and I'm trying to find some to have at home!).

There was a note welcoming us, a happy birthday sign and birthday cake for my son, and a Happy Thanksgiving note with some treats. What an incredibly thoughtful and special gesture!

We all settled in for the night and had excellent sleep. Coming from NYC, we were excited to stay in a quiet area. Charles street, although steps away from ""the action"" is tucked away on a beautiful, quiet street. I loved watching the sunrise from our window!

In the morning, I woke up around 6 and went downstairs to get coffee at the bar. The person who made the coffee also helped me carry it back to our room, which was just above and beyond. We had breakfast (included in our rate). Jade was the most incredible server. And the maître'd  was lovely as well. Jade mentioned that it was my son's birthday and wanted to know when we'd celebrate. We told her we'd do this on Saturday, as we weren't sure if we'd be able to have breakfast on Sunday (when we were departing). We had a delicious breakfast, and there were many options, and headed out for the day. 

When we came back in the evening, our beds were turned down with chocolates, and we found a note that we missed the canapes but to call them if we would like room service. We also missed the canapes on Saturday night. 

We checked out on Sunday morning and I got teary when Yanky asked me how our stay was. I am deeply thankful to each and every member of the Chesterfield team for making this stay better than I ever could have imagined. I will never stay anywhere else when traveling to London. 

To the Chesterfield team, words can't express the depth of our gratitude. To all whose name I forgot or did not mention, please know this extends to all of you, too, and I apologize that my jet-lagged brain could not retain this information. Keep up the incredible work. You all hold a special place in our hearts! ",5,2023,11,30
105,Lovely experience.,"We stayed 6 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair and it was a wonderful experience.  The room and bed were comfortable and clean. Everyone was friendly, helpful and went out of their way to assist us. They had fantastic recommendations for dinner and helped us map out a trip to Hampton Court Palace when the trains were on strike. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,11,29
105,One of the best hotels we have stayed in because of the wonderful staff,"Wow what a beautiful hotel to stay in whilst in London.

105,The Best Afternoon Tea in London!,"We had an absolutely fantastic afternoon tea experience at The Chesterfield on Sunday. They had a wonderful selection of teas, which we could change through our meal. I really enjoyed season’s special Christmas blend. All sandwiches and cakes were beautifully presented and the waited explained that we could ask for more of any type, as they just don’t want to overload the tea stand. Everything was very delicious, every part of the meal. Also, I’ve never seen before chocolate scones! Such a great idea and something different to the traditional afternoon tea. Our servers were very attentive and had a wonderful sense of humour, made us smile and set a great tone to our experience. A very nice touch at the end was a bag of sweets which we could select ourselves to take home. I thought it was a very nice touch. The whole experience was wonderful, set us into Christmas mode and created a fantastic memory :). Will definitely come back. ",5,2023,11,23
105,Best Hotel in London!,"We have just returned from our second stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair and we were not disappointed. 
The location is perfect in a quiet street in the heart of  Mayfair and is within walking distance to Bond Street, Regents Street, Piccadilly and Green Park tube station is just a few minutes walk away.

The attention to detail in the hotel is second to none and nothing is too much trouble. 

Breakfasts is wonderful with a great selection of hot and cold food available, the staff are so attentive and always very polite and welcoming.

After returning to you room in the evening, you are greeted by a turndown service where fresh water is placed on the bedside table and a small sweet favour left for you, and your curtains are closed.

All these little touches make a difference when choosing a hotel.

 This was our second year at The Chesterfield Mayfair and we are now booking again for our trip next year as this hotel is perfect!",5,2023,11,22
105,Great location. Good breakfast,"This is a very nice hotel. The location is perfect. 
Mayfare is a peaceful part of London, yet it is very near everything you would like to see. It is within walking distance of SoHo and Westminister. Green Park tube station is nearby. 
The breakfast is wonderful, make sure it is included in your booking. The staff in the breakfast restaurant is very nice, and makes you feel welcome and at home. 
The only thing to be aware of, is that £15 per day will be added to your bill. This is for service, which is well worth it. 
Rooms are spacious and nice, bathrooms a little bit small and old fashioned.",5,2023,11,22
105,"Lovely accommodations, excellent staff","We felt warmly welcomed from the moment we stepped in the door. Each porter is kind and intentional. We enjoyed superb meals in the Butler's Restaurant and received the utmost attention. The suites we stayed in were beautiful. Our family celebrated a birthday while at the Mayfair, and the entire staff went above and beyond to make the celebration a memorable one. We appreciated each and every gesture! Rafal, Andrej, and Daniela went out of their way to bring delight to our stay. We will not soon forget our time here, and hope to return soon.",5,2023,11,21

105,Great customer experience and service,"The hotel staff in all areas could not be more helpful and excel at really making a customer experience, nothing is too much trouble, they are helpful, polite and courteous and an asset to the hotel.  It may not be the most modern decor, but that adds a certain charm to your stay, but the rooms are comfortable, large by London standards and it was a delight to stay in, would be a pleasure to visit again.",5,2023,11,21
105,Fancy Tea at Chesterfield Mayfair was a Great Experience! ,"This review is specifically for the afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair. My waiter, Sakib, was very sweet and attentive. I loved eating all the desserts and trying the unlimited teas. He even gave me advice on which teas I might like and advised that the chocolate tea would taste better with some milk. Another waiter also took some great photos of me having proper British tea. ",5,2023,11,19
105,A lovely traditional Engish hotel in central London.,Helpful staff. Beautiful furnishings. Only 30 minute walk to Oxford Street and 10 from the tube from Euston. Central and traditional.

As a team, nothing is too much trouble and they are all amiable and personable. The extra little touches, not requested but offered only as a way to make the experience more memorable, were gratefully received and appreciated. 

Only there for a couple of nights but will ensure we go back to enjoy a more prolonged stay. 

Thanks to all from us both. ",5,2023,11,14

105,A must stay when in London,"The staff at the Chesterfield go above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable and your every need is met with a smile and courteous staff.

I will definitely will be back. ",5,2023,11,10
105,True Mayfair luxury,"The thickest toweling I've ever experienced.  Pure British luxury.  Small room and pricey, but it's in Mayfair.  Hot water, good pressure and a tub too.  Nice bar.  Open 24/7 for latte at 4am, should you need it.  Did not try restaurant but the menu was good and they serve high tea too.  Good location and quiet.  Lots of dining nearby although much of it was high end.  Staff was outstanding!!!  ",4,2023,11,09
105,Fabulous Chesterfield Mayfair!,"We booked this wonderful London hotel through Costco Travel Services. For my wife and I it was a fantastic way to wrap up our 25-day trip to Europe/UK. We were pampered and treated like we were part of the Royal Family. 
Spent 6 nights and wished we could’ve stayed 6 more.",5,2023,11,08
105,Stay of one week,I would like to thank particulary Greta & Jake as concierge. Carmen and Jade were always nice for the breakfast. You contributed to give a nice birthday to a little girl. The room was confortable and we had a nice dinner.,5,2023,11,08
105,I highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"It is a warm, inviting place to stay located within walking distance to Buckingham Palace.  The accommodations are first rate with a 24 hour tavern.  We enjoyed an English style breakfast.  High tea is offered, too.  I plan to return in the future!",5,2023,11,07
105,Exceptional hospitality,"We had a one-week stay in late October 2023.  We prefer Mayfair, and the hotel's location near the Green Park underground station was perfect for our plans.  There were restaurants, pubs and coffee spots all within a couple of blocks...  The hotel's decor was exactly what we wanted, classic, traditional and not the bland-modern or ubiquitous chain hotel style that could be anywhere...  Our Classic Double room and bathroom were a little on the small size which was not surprising for London, but the room (esp. the bed) was very comfortable and blessedly quiet, both room-to-room and from outside.  I appreciated the generous closet space, blackout drapes and the ability to open the window for fresh air.  Lighting was exceptionally good and nicely zoned to accommodate a late-night reader.  The tub/shower was tight in shower mode but great for a post-sightseeing soak in the tub...  The breakfast (included in our rate) was wonderful and definitely brought the rate within reach for us.  The menu included almost anything we could think of, and the food was very good...  We had light dinners in the bar a couple of nights.  It was a particularly enjoyable atmosphere because of the musical entertainment (jazz night, standards, pop) and interesting and eclectic menu options...  But above all, the service from everyone at every level was exceptional.  We didn't need assistance with our plans, but the staff was quick to offer any help.  We celebrated our anniversary while there, and the hotel left a lovely card and dessert in our room.  Nice touch! ",5,2023,11,07
105,Exceptional Hotel and Staff,"From the minute the doorman welcomed us into the hotel we were truly treated like royalty. Immediately we were welcomed by Jake the concierge and he assisted us with check-in.  The hotel is nicely decorated in traditional British design with old school charm. Our room, a superior king was large enough and the bed very comfortable. The dining there was very good. The bar area was very cozy, busy and the live music via piano was great. Everyone at the hotel provided excellent service! Never a missed step. Location is excellent. Gyorgy provided us with a great itinerary to best utilize our time in London. Will definitely return.",5,2023,11,06

With the room, already booked at the Chesterfield Mayfair later in the week, we showed up on announced, and we’re surprisingly accommodated. Concierge, Jake, and the rest of the team all went out of their way to settle us in then presented alternative ways we could get to Edinburgh. While we were at the Chesterfield mayfair room was excellent. The beds were most comfortable. The shower had plenty of hot water. Breakfast in their dining room was excellent.

105,Top Notch,"First class experience during our 2 stays at this wonderful hotel in October. Staff quietly attentive, with a true team approach. Each of our rooms on our two different stays was a cut above other hotel accommodations we have experienced in the UK and the States. The location is ideal to all sight seeing activities in London. If you want to treat yourself to a little pampering then The Chesterfield is the place to stay.
",5,2023,10,27
105,Wonderful hotel!!,"The attention to detail and the quality of service are top notch.  This hotel is a throwback to times when elegance, friendliness and attentiveness very much mattered.  The employees are wonderful and always have a smile on their face. 

The location was perfect.  Close to the underground, great restaurants and shopping. 

I would recommend to anyone!  ",5,2023,10,27
105,Excellent service,"I and a colleague stayed at the Chesterfield and were both impressed with the fabulous service from the staff, the fantastic location and the hotel's 'classic feel'.  Clearly very well run, lovely restaurant and so much nicer than the soulless larger hotels nearby.  ",5,2023,10,26
105,A fantastic hotel with an even more amazing staff,"We stayed at Chesterfield Mayfair at the start of our honeymoon and couldn't have had a better experience. The room was fantastic, but the service made a last impression on my wife and I. All of the little details, the turndown service, afternoon canapes, breakfast and tea gave us an experience that will be very hard to beat.  Hope to stay again in the future!",5,2023,10,26
105,Perfection in Excellent Location,"The title says it all. My sister and I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for seven nights in September 2023. We loved every moment of our stay! The Chesterfield Mayfair is a sophisticated, unique boutique hotel. It was fabulous staying in a building built in the 1660s with a mix of traditional design and contemporary facilities, and we felt it was comparable with the best five-star London hotels. The bed was amazingly comfortable, with luxurious linens, as I imagine sleeping on a cloud would feel like. London is a dynamic, crowded, and loud city in the best of ways. The Chesterfield Mayfair is located on a secluded street we found convenient to everywhere in the city. The location was perfect for walking to restaurants, shopping, Hyde Park, Green Park, and museums. All the staff members were friendly and professional, going beyond what one would expect to ensure our comfort, making the experience fun and interesting. Chesterfield Mayfair is so special we are returning in the Spring of 2024. Among the many hotels in London, this is the only one we want to stay in again and again.",5,2023,10,24
105,Highly recommend the Mayfield Chesterfield,We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfield with a group of 9 friends and family. The hotel was lovely and the staff outstanding. We stayed for three nights and were very happy with our visit. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were wonderful. They provided evening turn down service and the concierge provided exceptional advice and service throughout our stay. We had the included breakfast and they provided excellent options. The staff was friendly and efficient. Would highly recommend this hotel for a future stay.  We enjoyed the hotel bar and evening music. Thank you for a great stay!,5,2023,10,22
105,"The perfect hotel does exist, and it's this one!","Our stay was perfect! Everyone was very welcoming from our first step into the hotel until our departure. My wife and I were celebrating our 9 years together, and the staff was full of little attentions toward us. A big thank you to Greta for her professional and warm welcome and for managing to find answers to our questions. The umbrella shop you recommended allowed me to find exactly what I was looking for!
The hotel itself is beautiful, tastefully decorated, and very clean. The room was sumptuous! I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to stay there again!",5,2023,10,22
105,"A perfect hotel, you must stay here.","We stayed here on the 17th of October for the Madonna concert at the O2 Arena. The hotel is amazing, walking into the lobby is like stepping back in time with its beautiful flooring, decor and paintings. Our room was lovely and very clean. The fabric covered walls and cornicing around the ceiling were a nice touch. There was also plenty of drinks options including coffee, tea, fruit tea, hot chocolate and a cafetiere for a pressed coffee. The TV also included the full Sky range of channels but we did not use this much as we were out in the evening at the concert.

The staff at the hotel are exceptional and went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. Greta on reception was a particular stand out as she even left us a gift and card in our room for when we returned from the concert. We've never had service like this before from any hotel we've stayed in previously and will remember our stay here for years to come.

This is a 10/10 hotel and I will not only happily stay again but would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London.",5,2023,10,21
105,Gin experience with Malina,"My family and I had the pleasure of participating in the Gin experience led by Malina. An amazing taste experience supported by the great knowledge of the host. We felt comfortable, taken care of and were treated with great commitment and professionalism. Malina is a wonderful, beautiful person created to work with people. Thank you very much and best regards to the entire amazing team!",5,2023,10,20
105,Amazing,I don’t write many reviews but I feel the chesterfield and its staff deserve one.  My mother booked to stay for the weekend and from start to finish the experience was unparalleled.  I’m so grateful to the management and all the staff for making it a weekend to remember.,5,2023,10,19
105,Good but not perfect,"4 stars reflects the fact we had (overall) a very enjoyable stay, firstly a summary of the positives/main strengths (as we saw it):

1. Staff - fabulous, anything we were served and/or wanted all you have to do is ask and they oblige. The staff are the main strength of this place closely followed by.....

2. Location. Perfect for everything we wanted to do and/or where we needed to be, couldn't have been better.

3. We didn't eat in the evening or avail ourselves of room service etc so we can't comment there. We did however have breakfast every morning which was very nice (with one exception).

Secondly.....

Unfortunately we did experience some specific service issues and we also had to feedback on some aspects of the room we were staying in that were quite obviously less than satisfactory for a hotel of this price and location category.

The issues we had were all reported to the hotel during our visit (in quite specific detail) and i hope (and trust) they will be acted on as needed. Some reparations were made to our bill, gesture appreciated, but we can't give 5 stars with the issues we had. We would have much preferred to pay the full amount and given it 5 stars but that's not where we ended up.

That said, it was a very pleasant stay overall and we really enjoyed ourselves. We thought the bar (and the team who work in there) in the evening was a really nice part of the hotel, the live music certainly helps to give it a very relaxing vibe.

105,AWESOME !!!!!!!,"If there is  a definition for awesome hotel experience it is the Chesterfield Mayfair. The entire staff was incredible. From the time we arrived with the Bellman to the bar and restaurant staff, desk staff and Concierge it was service at the highest level.Highest recommendation!!!!",5,2023,10,16
105,Lana Raz,"I first discovered the Chesterfield Mayfair about 10 years ago while looking for a boutique hotel for a London stay. I have a hospitality background and have traveled extensively so tend to seek out places that are not chains and that offer an experience unique to their location. From the minute I walked into the hotel and was greeted by a jewel box of a lobby staffed by a crackerjack reception staff I fell in love and I wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else. Each room is different, featuring fabric walls, individually chosen furniture, and luxurious linens and towels. The food service is lovely no matter the meal, including room service, an amazing afternoon tea, and the 24 hour bar off of the lobby. And the housekeeping staff is unobtrusive in keeping rooms and public spaces sparkling. Overall though  I think the  service in the Chesterfield is what really elevates its status. The staff cannot do enough for you and are accommodating and unflappable. They are all very good at what they do and it makes staying there an oasis of calm. Everyone is well trained and customer-focused  The location in Mayfair is convenient to getting easily around the city and close to tube and bus services. I adore this hotel and can unequivocally recommend it as a wonderful place to stay.",5,2023,10,15
105,Just ask & feel appreciated,"There was a fundamental difference from the moment we arrived, about 8:25 a.m., direct off a flight from Orlando, Florida. No one said ""check in isn't until ...""  Instead we were warmly greeted by the desk staff & the doormen & they immediately presented us with hot coffee with the fixings, in china cups. This set a tone for the remainder of the week we were there. Fantastic, quality linens, breakfast that was beyond our expectations, our constant ""tourist"" type questions answered confidently. We loved the location, extremely kind staff, & the consistent top-of-the-line treatment we felt during our stay.",5,2023,10,15
105,Beautiful and elegant hotel and warm/competent staff,"My husband and I started our European vaccation at the Chesterfield. The hotel, restaurant/bar, and our room were beautiful, elegant and immaculate. We shared our one concern with a supervisor; that the room was smaller than we expected. She listened, validated our feelings and tried to show us an alternative that was bit larger. We came to the realization that our American expectations were coloring our perception of the size of the room and ended up being very comfortable in our room. The supervisor was patient and helpful and even compted us cocktails in their beautiful bar - with a wonderful pianist. We loved our stay at the Chesterfield and felt taken care of by the staff. ",5,2023,10,13
105,Do not miss the London hotel,"      The hotel and staff win highest praises from us,  As we traveled around London, taxi drivers and others we encountered that asked us where we were staying would immediately say,"" Oh the staff there is wonderful.  They are all so friendly.  That is a wonderful hotel.""
     Breakfast each morning had the feel you were an elite hotel resident with servers answering questions to help with the day""s tourist activities.

105,Charming Hotel with great location,"I booked the hotel for the location and the pictures online were charming.  Very pleased with my stay here.   I booked a Classic Double and it was plenty of space for me.  The bathroom was large with a tub and a rainfall shower head. 
The staff was very attentive and helpful.  They arranged taxis for me and helped with my luggage.  It was my birthday on the first day and they brought me a small cake to celebrate. 
I enjoyed my meal at the Terrace Bar.  The lobster roll was very good! I had included breakfast with my room and that was a great addition.",5,2023,10,09
105,Wonderful Stay,"The staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair is outstanding!  Everyone was friendly and professional.  We felt welcome the moment that we arrived.

105,We’ll be back!,Our first stay. Excellent location for sightseeing in a quiet neighborhood. Cannot say enough about the staff. They were outstanding and exceptionally pleasant and helpful. The rooms were warmly decorated and comfortable. Butler’s Restaurant on premises had a menu for everyone and excellent food and service. Would most definitely stay here again!,5,2023,10,06
105,AMAZING HOTEL & STAFF,This hotel was by far the best hotel in comfort and hospitality that I have ever stayed at. The decor was very pretty hotel was very clean. I would come back. Thank you to the bell Captain Josef and the concierge Lore,5,2023,10,05
105,Superb hotel with outstanding service ,Excellent Mayfair experience with attentive but unobtrusive service. The afternoon tea was superb as was the breakfast. The hotel exudes calm elegance and we felt very comfortable there. There were also lots of thoughtful touches such as bringing my husband a little birthday cake when we arrived. We enjoyed every moment of our weekend stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a centrally located hotel with outstanding service.,5,2023,10,03
105,The Perfect London Retreat!,"Our stay at the Chesterfield was the perfect ending to you trip to the United Kingdom. From the greeting on the sidewalk, the pleasantly friendly efficient faces in reception, the comfortable formality of the public spaces, the familiar but trendy menus, to the comfortable details of the guest room, the attention to detail in every space of this facility was wonderful to experience. 
 
All members of the Chesterfield staff are to be commended for their professionalism. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, courteous and efficient. Everyone seemed happy to do their jobs, no grumpy faces, no snooty attitudes, no obnoxious demeanors, just wonderfully pleasant people enjoying the work they do.
 
We so enjoyed our first dinner in Butler’s, that we ate all of our dinners there. The staff provided great service without being obtrusive. Tables are placed to allow for comfortable spacing that doesn’t exist in many places today. We especially appreciated that aspect of the restaurant. We found numerous items on the menu that we wanted to try and enjoyed each of them.
 
Our travel agent chose the right place to end our journey and the people of the Chesterfield made it even more special.",5,2023,10,02

105,Highly Recommend This Lovely Hotel,"This is a really lovely hotel in a great location. It’s in a quiet neighborhood but with easy access to restaurants and points of interest throughout London. The concierge staff were first rate. Prior to our arrival, they fielded my many questions and booked tickets for our top tourist attractions. It was stress-free for us and nice knowing we had tickets in hand for our high-priority sites prior to our arrival. The concierge also recommended and booked reservations at restaurants for us and we were thrilled with their recommendations. This level of service is indicative of all the staff hotel! Everyone was helpful; truly first-rate service.
The hotel bar is delightful. Our first night we were all tired so enjoyed a light dinner in the bar and were thrilled to be entertained by the music of a quartet playing, as my brother said, “some great old chestnuts!” It was a perfect first night in London and a great preview of our extremely pleasant experience in this hotel. ",5,2023,09,30
105,Great Stay - Great Location,"We booked this stay through Costco Travel and could not have been more pleased. Our package included a lovely dinner and afternoon tea (which had great food). The people at the front desk were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is located near almost everything we wanted to see. We did take a bus tour, but we were otherwise able to walk or use the ""tube"" for everything else.",5,2023,09,29
105,Very Special Hotel,"The hotel is in an excellent location.  The staff is wonderful, very eager to make sure your stay is perfect.  They went out of their way to make sure we had the best experience possible. We were celebrating our anniversary and they surprised us with several special treats.",5,2023,09,28
105,Cozy Comfortable Luxury,"The two of us shared a twin-bedded room at the Chesterfield Hotel in early Sept/2023.  Our room was very cozy, beds were amazingly comfortable and all the nice touches were there.  Breakfast in the dining room was really delicious with a superb choice of dishes and great service from the attentive but friendly staff.  The location is good with some cafes nearby and it's a short walk down to Green Park, etc.",5,2023,09,26
105,A memorable and very enjoyable stay  ,The staff were warm and welcoming and couldn’t do enough to help. The breakfast was wonderful and the beds comfy.

105,A true sense of London,What a perfect place to stay while in London.  The area is perfect with food options and ease of travel.  We were able to walk to Westminster and the Underground was around the corner. The Hotel itself is quintessentially British with a 24 hour bar that serves up the best old fashions and negroni's and the restaurant is great. Jake the Concierge and Mustapha the doorman were the best.  Thanks for the great stay.   ,5,2023,09,25
105,Grand Hotel,"Exceptional service, fine dining, great ambience and service with a smile. My wife and I were both very impressed by this hotel.

The hotel also has a piano bar with nightly entertainment. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. We will definitely go back. ",5,2023,09,25
105,Perfect location,"Well - we couldn’t have picked a better location to stay in London. The Chesterfield is close to it all and an easy walking distance to many of the main attractions.

The hotel staff are outstanding and very helpful with finding locations and making suggestions. The restaurant serves delicious breakfasts with a wide array of choices. The lounge is comfortable and has live entertainment many nights each week.

We’d definitely look at the chesterfield for any future visits to London.",5,2023,09,25
105,Quintessential English Hotel,"Leaving the hustle and bustle of Mayfair you enter a relaxed zone of peace and zen..

I was early but they had a room ready, my friend joined me for drinks in the bar which were served with nibbles.

Coming back to my room, turn down service and curtains closed..

My room was small (its London) but was delightful furnished .. no street noise. The bed linen was crisp and the mattress was like sleeping on a cloud.

Breakfast is served fresh and not Buffett, they take pride in their ingredients.

The staff are very attentive and can do enough for you.",5,2023,09,25
105,excellent,"This is a lovely hotel.  Small-ish.  Old world.  Elegant.  Very friendly and helpful doormen and lobby personnel. Our room was lovely and sophisticatedly appointed.  Nice size for a European hotel.  Bathroom was also a good size. While I say ""old world"", everything was in wonderful, updated condition.  We had dinner one night in the Butler restaurant, which was also very nice.  Lovely servers, so polite and accommodating. Great location between Greens Park (Buckingham Palace) and Hyde Park so very easy walk to these areas, plus Shepherd's Market, which I'd not visited before and has lots of quaint shops and small restaurants.  The hotel is kind of located on the back side of the street, so it was very quiet. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,09,22
105,Lovely Hotel with Great Customer Service,"We visited London for 3 days in Sept, 2023 and stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.  This is an older hotel with all the English charm.  The staff was particularly wonderful.  We had a minor issue with the room which they quickly resolved.  In addition, they surprised us with a small cake in our room and a gracious note as we were celebrating our 35th anniversary.  The hotel is in a great part of London with easy access to the Tube (Green Park stop).  One minor downside is that our room was a bit dated, but not overly so. Overall, we loved this hotel and look forward to our next visit to London and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair. ",5,2023,09,22
105,Chesterfield Excellence ,Outstanding hotel. Lived up to all high expectations. Great staff. Excellent location in the southern end of Mayfair. 5 minute walk to Green Park tube.

105,VERY GOOD,"Excellent location.
Staff are all very attentive.
We got a room upgrade and it was really lovely. Very Comfortable with everything you need.
Breakfast was excellent.
I do feel the hotel needs a little attention, especially the room corridors.
Doors and skirting boards are very marked and carpet felt very worn, we just feel it needs a little TLC.
Room was well maintained , and reception and bar areas were fine.
Thats just our opinion but I would highly recommend.",4,2023,09,20
105,Intimate Wedding in the heart of Mayfair,"We don't know where to start with our amazing experience of getting married at this exceptional hotel.

We got married here with a wedding party of 21 people and the staff of the hotel all went above and beyond to make our day magical.

From the planning process with Sam (someone who is so knowledgable about the area, process and local suppliers , that planning meetings turned into drinks  in the bar to have a chat and a catch up - something that we will continue as friends now!) up to the day itself, the staff were completely flawless, impeccably professional, and warm and genuine.

Anyone looking for an intimate wedding or social event - look no further - get in touch with Sam and her team for an unforgettable experience.

As well as an incredible venue, The Chesterfield is a stunning hotel.
The hotel and rooms are classically decorated finished off with plenty of consideration to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

The food - from breakfast, to snacks at the bar, to a three course meal, was outstanding and continued the high standards of the other aspects of the hotel.

We will be returning to the Chesterfield very soon to catch up with the special team here, who became part of out family on the day

A huge thank you in particular to Robert, Rafka, Rafal, Peter, Biaggio.. and of course Sam. For everything.

If you're still unsure about visiting , step through the door and escape busy London for a few hours and have a drink in the bar - you will see what we mean, and definitely be back.

105,Exceptional! Will stay again!,We had a wonderful experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We stayed four nights. The staff was exceptional and the accommodations were lovely. All of the food was amazing and we loved the large luxurious towels. This hotel does have AC which was important to us as well! We loved the breakfast and enjoyed an evening in the bar with a quartet and drinks. Several nice pubs in the area and walking distance to Buckingham Palace. Once again I want to put emphasis on the staff including the restaurant staff who went above and beyond to make our experience perfect.  We hated to leave and hope to return!,5,2023,09,18
105,Unique memories for a lifetime!,"From the moment we arrived the team at Chesterfied Mayfair went above and beyond every expectation. Amy at the front desk simply overheard us sharing we had just gotten engaged in Paris and we were pleasantly surprised to be brought a glass of celebratory bubbles while they finished preparing our room. Before the bubbles were gone, our bags had been whisked to our room. We stepped out for a light snack and came back to a lovely chocolate flight and cake to celebrate us again! All of this happened within moments of being told about our engagement. The magic never stopped. The lovely hostess in the dining room took incredible care today remember not just our drink order from the prior day, but also details we shared in passing about prior day activities or upcoming plans. It really made our stay exceptional. Not only will we be back, but we will be sending friends and family your way as well! I wish I could remember the team member from the dining room’s name because I we can’t wait to be back to visit and catch up with her!",5,2023,09,15
105,Fantastic stay - extremely family friendly.,"We stayed at the Chesterfield recently as we were attending a friends wedding and I’m so glad we did. 

Myself and my husband stayed along with our 18 month old daughter where on arrival staff were able to give us access to our room a little earlier so we were able to get ready for the wedding. 

We had also requested a cot in the room for our little one, where within there was her very own little robe, slipper and Child’s Farm cleaning products. This was a lovely touch. 

During the wedding I cannot thank the staff enough and commend them on their patience and thoughtfulness when dealing with my little one. One staff member in particular (apologies I can’t remember his name- young Asian male) was fantastic, ran after her all night, entertaining her and supplying her with lots of treats. She was one happy little girl. Staff throughout our stay were extremely polite and courteous, always offering up assistance. 

The room it’s self was lovely, full of personality and cozy. On arrival back from the wedding our room has been prepared for nighttime for us, curtains closed and even a wee biscuit and water next to our bed. Again, a lovely touch. 

We ordered breakfast to our room the following morning for quickness which was delivered exactly on time and was delicious. 

Would certainly come back and stay again and highly recommend to couples and families. ",5,2023,09,14
105,August wedding visit,"We had a fantastic experience at the wedding of a very special couple- the venue was perfect, the food and service was first class

105,Fairytale family wedding,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for five nights while attending a family wedding which was held in the hotel. It was a brilliant experience from start to finish. Each and every member of staff went out their way to make our stay special. A special mention must be made of Sam, the wedding planner who ensured that Daniel and Katie had a wonderful day with their family and friends. We hope to stay again soon!!!",5,2023,09,14
105,Wonderful Three Night Stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel for three nights and had a fantastic stay. The hotel is grand and beautiful and the service is impeccable. Our every need was attended to from the moment we walked in the door. All staff members greeted us at every opportunity and insured we were happy at the hotel. 

We especially enjoyed our private gin tasting experience with Viviane! She  was set up for us when we arrived and gave us a great history lesson on gin making. We tasted three different gins and three different tonics and had fun describing the botanicals we tasted in each gin and how the tonics changed the flavors when mixed as a gin and tonic and garnishes were added. Viviane is a professional bartender who knows her business. We recommend doing the gin tasting and asking for Viviane to lead it!  

We have decided that this hotel will be “our” London hotel every time we visit the city. Thank you.",5,2023,09,11
105,Elegant Mayfair gem,"Old world elegance and wonderful service! We stayed at the Chesterfield last year and were so pleased to return this year. The Chesterfield is on a quiet street in lovely Mayfair, which is a perfect London location. They truly care about their patrons and the hotel is booked year round.",5,2023,09,10
105,It's all about the service!,"We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were there to see London. We had breakfast every morning in the restaurant; very good! We did have dinner one night in Butcher's. Fantastic! The attendants were attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and the wines and willing to go the extra bit to make the experience unforgettable. The room was cozy but, again, we didn't spend much time in it. The bed was comfy and the AC was much appreciated. Must mention the heated bathroom floors. Absolutely wonderful!
 What makes this hotel stand out is the service! From the always happy to welcome you back concierge to the greeters at the restaurant to the room attendants, every one is simply warm, friendly and genuinely glad to see you! We worked with one particular concierge a couple time during our trip.  I wish we had gotten his name! He was so helpful with directions and recommendations on where to eat and how to get there and how to access and ride the tube. He always had a welcoming smile on his face when we saw him. He is the epitome of outstanding service!
I loved the turn down service at night! The little biscuit on the pillows were a perfect treat before bed. We really appreciated the card left in our room on the first night with some lovely macaroons greeting and welcoming us to the hotel. Very nice touch! 
Location is perfect! We walked to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, The  Eye and several other places. It's not far at all from a several tube stops and Green Park is a beautiful walk!

105,Excellent stay!,"Truly loved our short (2-day) stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair!  Despite coming in on a red-eye flight and arriving very early in the morning, they were accommodating and held our luggage and even had our room ready within a very short period of time.  Service was exemplary from initial conversation down to the last.  There was always several people waiting to help you in the reception area, and housekeeping checked in on us nightly.  They provided robes and slippers for our stay which I greatly appreciated and also gave us a cake to celebrate our anniversary (what a nice unexpected touch!).    Unfortunately our short stay didn't allow us to try any of the food/bar offerings at the hotel as we were out and about too much.  Location was absolutely perfect and allowed for us to see so much just by walking.  Will definitely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair when we are next in London. ",5,2023,09,06
105,Location Location Location,"Great service at every level from the doormen to the front desk to the dining/cocktail staff to the maid service.  And the location was hard to beat.  Green Park and Bond St stations are a short walk from this heart of Mayfair location. (We took a cab in from LHR but took the tube when we departed and it was very easy.)  Hyde Park, Buckingham, and London's top shopping are all an easy walk away.  The only minor drawback was the mattress on our bed was a bit on the firm side.  With that said, we will stay at the Chesterfield again.",4,2023,09,05
105,5 star customer service by brilliant staff.,"The staff at the Chesterfield understand and deliver 5 star customer service. We stayed with our adult children and their spouses to celebrate my 70th Birthday. The friendly but professional service was second to none. The decor in the bedrooms was a little dated and the bedroom a little smaller than I would have liked but this was made up for by the excellent breakfast, superb cocktail bar, the attentive staff and the little extras. (A cake was waiting for me with a Happy Birthday message and complimentary champagne). The hotel was spotless, the housekeeping, complete with turn down service, was efficient and thoughtful. I would definitely recommend and will return next time we are in London.",5,2023,09,04
105,The Icing On The Cake,"Bells, whistles, hooray, and parades for the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel!
We had the pleasure to staying in this amazing, historic hotel with our friends after a long cruise.  London was just suppose to be a ""stop"" to catch the plane back to the States.
What we found was a fabulous, historical hotel in the Mayfair District of London, with the best service on every level that we could imagine.  What other hotel's concierge, Jake in this case, would make a reservation for you at the first Indian restaurant to earn a Michelin star, and walk you to its front door where the hotel had it's own table!! Superb!
Superb in every way, from front desk to maid service, from restaurant to valet, we could not have asked for anything more.  The rooms were spacious, quiet and complete (including ironing boards) with all the amenities you would expect and more. 
Chesterfield's Mayfair's location was wonderful with the tube less than a 10 minute walk or the hotel's valet hailing cabs in less than two minutes.  The area was quiet, safe, and the neighborhood offered a variety of small retail shops, restaurants, bakeries and coffee shops where you could feast on freshly-baked scones, croissant and Pantone. 
And, back to our delightful concierge, Jake knew at least 125 pubs in London including the one we had not visited in 57 years!
All in all, you can expect to be hosted by a staff that shows great camaraderie and leaves you with a genuine feeling that you will be welcomed back.",5,2023,09,04
105,Unforgettable moment of afternoon tea,"It was fantastic!  Lovely receptionist Ellen and saffron welcomed us and show us the way to afternoon tea.                    Then Andrej gives us a warm welcome and lead us to the table.he is very professional and also sweet. Restaurant is so beautiful and elegant, food are 10/10. Chocolate tea definitely is worthy to try, I never heard it anywhere else. Michael explained every food to us it’s clear and she is very good. Archie is also very nice , she always makes sure we have a good time. It’s a very good afternoon tea and definitely will come back! ",5,2023,09,02
105,Mayfair is the place to stay.,"Stayed here for 4 nights for my 60th birthday, and what a treat. The staff are marvellous, on arrival the welcome was wonderful. The room was beautiful with lots of extras, a turn down service and a chocolate left on the pillow. I was left a cake and a card on my birthday. We experienced the sweet shop afternoon tea and it was sublime. Breakfast was an experience in itself, so much choice.  Can’t wait to visit again. ",5,2023,09,02
105,An Exceptional Hotel,"We've just had a wonderful 3 night stay at The Chesterfield Hotel. From the minute you step into this fabulous hotel you are looked after with such warmth by every member of staff, who are a real credit to the hotel.  The food is divine and the exceptional pianist/singer in the bar area brought the evenings to life with great atmosphere and such a pleasure to listen to. We'll be back! ",5,2023,08,29
105,Great experience,"Very friendly and helpful.  The bed the first night was a bit uncomfortable.  However, we mentioned this to the concierge and it was fixed by the time we returned in the evening.  Restaurant and bar were excellent.  Fantastic breakfast.",5,2023,08,27
105,Easiest 5* I've ever given,"We had such a fantastic experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair this week. The service was outstanding and nothing was too much to ask. The staff were so attentive, friendly, polite and most importantly, absolutely wonderful with the child in our group. Afternoon tea is always something we have avoided with our children which is why we chose this ""child friendly"" one. It was thoroughly enjoyed by both children and adults alike! The food was delicious, obviously suits anyone with a sweet tooth. The cakes were so well themed! We are already planning our next visit!",5,2023,08,27
105,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"We came here for the Sweetie Afternoon Tea and not only was the food excellent the service was absolutely incredible, they were so warm and friendly, accommodating and patient! They made it a really special experience! I highly recommend it ",5,2023,08,24
105,A wonderful experience like no other.  Worth every penny!,"Wonderful hotel, which made our trip to London truly special.  We went all over Europe but our 8 yr old says our 3 nights in London were his favorite because of this hotel.  The staff are truly wonderful.  I in particular want to call out Rafal (polish waiter) at the restaurant for his kindness.  My little boy lost a toy, he spent time looking for it and then bought him a replacement toy at his own expense,  A truly special man!  Highly recommend the hotel. ",5,2023,08,22
105,Wonderful London Hotel,"We just completed a 6 night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Nice boutique hotel in the middle of Mayfair. Very warm greeting and great service from the staff. Room was nice and clean, with comfortable bed and pillows. You are within walking distance to Soho, and Covent Garden, as well as Green park and Hyde park. Plenty of wonderful restaurants close by in Shephards market. Would strongly recommend!",5,2023,08,21
105,Fantastic hotel with excellent staff who go above and beyond - super dog friendly. An absolute dream stay!,"We want to thank all the fantastic staff at the Chesterfield for an incredible stay. We enjoyed our time so very much! 

Thank you especially to Saffron and Claire who took really good care of our greyhound Trevor. 

Everyone was so friendly, caring and went above and beyond to make our time at your hotel a really memorable one. Your attention to detail really shone through. 

Thank you so much, a birthday I won’t  ever forget!

105,Memorable 80th birthday for Mum,"It was Mum's 80th birthday and my brother and I brought her here for 2 nights. On arrival we were greeted by doorman and concierge, given drinks of water while we waited for rooms as we were a bit early. After putting luggage in rooms we went out for a walk to explore the area,  on return there was an amazing birthday cake left for Mum, what a lovely surprise and personal touch. The location was perfect,  walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the Ritz,  rooms were luxurious and comfortable,  staff were very friendly and helpful,  nothing was too much trouble,  special shout out to the doorman Mustafa who was always cheery, chatty and helpful, even providing us with umbrellas when it started raining. We felt very welcome here and would highly recommend this Hotel.  Perhaps return next year for my 60th birthday if anyone wants to treat me ",5,2023,08,19
105,Best customer service,"Amazing customer service. From the time we arrived, all of the staff made sure we were comfortable and taken care of.

Everyone was very kind and attentive. 
Rafal made our tea time very special and Heather was very helpful.",5,2023,08,18
105,Well worth staying,"The hotel was gorgeous. The beds were very comfortable and rooms set out well. The shower took a while to get warm but it wasn’t a problem.
Staff very friendly and helpful and location was really convenient. The breakfast had a variety of choices and dinner was delicious.",5,2023,08,14
105,A wonderfully charming and comfortable hotel in a great location.,The Chesterfield is a wonderfully charming hotel with an old English “feel” that fits perfectly with its great location in historic Mayfair. We were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to visit and always looked forward to returning to the comfort and excellent service of the hotel whenever we needed a rest from our outings. The sumptuous breakfast offerings were a great way to start the day as well. We’ll stay there again whenever the opportunity to return to London arises.,5,2023,08,13
105,Quintessential London Luxury,"We just finished our first vacation to the UK and stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair while we were in london.  The staff was exceptional.  They were professional, friendly and made our vacation an incredible experience.  We booked through Costco so didn’t know anything about the hotel prior to this trip.  I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler looking for the quintessential “Luxury London” hotel.  Especially recommend their afternoon tea.  Well done!",5,2023,08,10
105,Outstanding Customer Service!,"Riyad Bank London celebrated its Summer Staff Event at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel and we could not have asked for a better evening.  From start to finish the customer service we received was second to none.  We were looked after by Sam and the wonderful team and they helped us create a fabulous event in the stunning Terrace bar. Every request we made was fulfilled with enthusiasm.  The food, wine and venue were just superb and we shall definitely be returning soon and look forward to the team hosting us.  Thanks guys.",5,2023,08,09
105,"Great Location, Lovely Hotel.","Lovely Traditional hotel.
Excellent service from all personnel. 
Doorman are phenomenal. 

Breakfasts plentiful and many options. 

Rooms a bit tired looking but kept spotless. 

Appreciated the recognition of my husbands Birthday with a cute mini cheesecake. 

Location great. Walkable to many areas and attractions. 

Only negative: shower pressure was great but water was always consistently lukewarm , never ever hot. 
Lack of a handheld shower is an issue for me as I don’t want to stand under a rain shower everyday and get my hair all wet. Had to use a shower cap but still with the dreary London weather it would have been nice to take a comfortable hot shower. 

Also no offer of breakfast to go even though we advised the young lady on check in that we would be getting a 530am Pick up. 
She also made a point to advise me that breakfast day of ( early arrival) was not included , despite knowing we would be leaving before breakfast on our last day. 

Young lady who first checked us in , seemed to be having a slow start to her day as it was quite early but Vy later on who handed us our keys was really personable. 

Not a big deal but enough to differentiate a gold hotel from a great one. 

Would recommend. 
",4,2023,08,08
105,Fantastic stay!,"During our family vacation to London, we were lucky enough to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The lobby and bar were gorgeous and welcoming. The restaurant comfortable and delicious. Our rooms were spotless and luxurious. 

On the trip one of my brothers broke his arm at the hotel while arm wrestling and Peter the night manager was so incredibly helpful during that not ideal time. Once we got back every single member of the staff went above and beyond to make the rest of our stay as comfortable and as lovely as possible despite the situation. We will 100% recommend the Chesterfield to anyone staying in London and we will be back! I cannot say enough about how fantastic this hotel is.",5,2023,08,07
105,Best hotel ever!,"This hotel was wonderful, the bed was so comfortable and the staff were fantastic, from check in to check out everyone was more help with everything we could ask for. Breakfast was the best I’ve ever had while overseas as it was cooked fresh from ordering which always ensured it was hot which is a huge positive  as I hate Luke warm buffet food. I would definitely recommend this hotel and thank all the staff there for a wonderful 4 night stay! ",5,2023,08,07
105,Gin & Tonic Experience - A+,"I booked the Gin & Tonic experience at the Chesterfield, and ended up with a one on one exploration of 3 gins, and 3 tonics...paired to bring out the complexity and flavor profiles of each.  Alejandro was very educational on explaining the nuances of dry, London dry, and gin while also walking through Indian tonic to Mediterranean tonics.  I had a great time asking questions, imbibing, and learning along the way.  Thanks Alejandro for a wonderful experience...no hesitations in recommending to others!!  As a matter of fact, I ended up buying my new favorite ingredients for Gin & Tonics once I got home to Chicago.  The Chesterfield saloon area is quaint and quite a vibe in and of itself...worth a visit!!  Sorry for the late review, but I didn't forget!  ",5,2023,08,06
105,Excellent afternoon tea experience ,We took our two children for afternoon tea and we all had a wonderful time. The children’s afternoon tea was particularly very special and the service was exceptional. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone.,5,2023,08,04
105,Elegant hotel in Mayfair with Awesome Staff,"Amazing, elegant hotel! Kind and super helpful staff. Room was cozy and very comfortable. The hotel is situated in a great area of town, with lots to do - easily walk to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, V&A museum, etc etc. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,08,04
105,If you like construction noise,The room was fine it was what we expected. What we didn’t expect was full on construction noise each day.  We stayed for five nights and management didn’t offer us any option to change rooms. They should definitely post something to their website about their continued renovation/construction,2,2023,08,03
105,Still home for us in London,"Thank you to The Chesterfield once gain for a lovely stay to celebrate a birthday, always great. We have been visiting for years and love everything about it except the price of cocktails! We hope we can continue to visit but it seems to be getting very expensive even for London, perhaps one night instead of two will have to be the norm. I cannot imagine ever staying anywhere else.",5,2023,08,02
105,Perfection,"I stayed here with family as a treat for my 80 birthday. Rooms were just perfect a d most comfortable bed. After we  checked I  we went out to explore and on our return  there was a  birthday card and  cake in the room. It was delicious.  Staff were very helpful and friendly . We were made to feel most welcome. We were even given a  brolly by Mustafa who went out of his way to assist  us and chat to us.  
Loved my visit . Lovely area and  central.",5,2023,08,01
105,Wonderful hotel and great staff,"My wife and I like to remember our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, we were very statisfied. All staff members we met were lovely and very friendly, patient and helpful, but we would like to highlight the concierge Mustafa down at the main door: everyday in a good mood and with a smile. A special Thank You is due to him.

Best regards from Switzerland and looking forward to our next stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair

",5,2023,07,31
105,Great Staff and Location,"My wife and I just another marvelous two week stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. While all hotels have beds and bathrooms there are two variables that critically impact your experience at a hotel: location and the property's staff.  The Chesterfield is located on a quiet street in Mayfair, within walking distance of superb shopping, West End theatres and the Green Park Underground station. The hotel's personnel is wonderful, courteous, helpful and exceedingly friendly.  If you're looking for old world charm in a ""home away from home"" in London the Chesterfield is a gem.
",5,2023,07,26
105,Exceptional Service,"Exceptional service!    Deryn  was able to find us rooms when the rail strike changed our travel plans.  Amy at the front desk reached out in so many ways, including loaning us her own guidebook to the British Museum. Bartender Ayub made a ""killer"" Manhattan, and even quizzed us on our preference in flavors. Great piano bar, luxurious linens, the perfect Mayfair location and a great value.  We will be back!  ",5,2023,07,26
105,A wonderful hotel to stay when visiting London,"What a charming and beautifully appointed hotel in a wonderful setting, easy walking distance to many of London’s top attractions. This was my third stay at The Chesterfield and I will definitely be back. The staff are friendly and attentive, the rooms while not large (but you are in a very sought after area of London so probably to be expected) have everything you need, the beds are very comfortable and the pillows sumptuous, high levels of cleanliness throughout, the food is excellent and generally it all adds up to an excellent stay. This visit was the second visit with my sister and she loves it too. We would definitely recommend this hotel. My husband used to work in the area and his Company regularly used The Chesterfield for visiting Executives who also loved it.",5,2023,07,26
105,London Vacation,"what can I say this hotel was absolutely amazing…the stay far exceeded our expectations. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace/Big Ben/London Eye
and Picadilly Circus. 
The host gentleman out front Mustafa was a wonderful addition to the hotel. He help my wife and I tremendously with answers to our questions of what and where to go. Only drawback for me was tub quite small there is glass partition but half of the tub which made showering the challenge.
1 thing I like to  recommend is a small mini fridge in the rooms and ice machines nearby 
late at night had no cold drinks. 
Not sure when i’ll get to London again but I’ll tell anyone that coming over from the US 
please choose this hotel.

105,All good,"Really comfortable beds, breakfast was amazing, also great locatio, close to subway and comercial areas. All the staff is kind and helpful.
Unfortunately one of the elevators wetnoutnof order and stood that way for a week...
Would definitively return",4,2023,07,25
105,"First class, friendly luxury with great location to see London","First class in every way. The staff is very courteous and efficient and classy. The highlight of the staff is Namrata, a server/bartender in the bar/restaurant. She is classy, friendly, funny, efficient, welcoming, personal but not intrusive. She made our group of 5 couples feel at home every night in the bar. Great ambiance/live music/food and drink. All of the doormen were very helpful with directions and recommendations for local restaurants/attraction/transportation etc. The breakfast is order off the menu(recommend getting the breakfast included in room rate , if you plan on eating breakfast). The breakfast restaurant is great atmosphere/service/food, well worth it.
The rooms are first class with warmth and character. Clean, roomy, well appointed. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Quiet.
  Location close/walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Train/tube/bus , Hyde Park, Grosvenor Square, and much more. Very nice part of London with many Pubs, restaurants/shopping venues close by. 
Highest recommendation. ",5,2023,07,21
105,Mayfair Gem,"Our favorite place to stay — attentive and pleasant staff, great room, perfect neighborhood, close to cafes, Green Park and the Underground. We received special treatment and that’s their culture. The room amenities are super. Having a bar with piano music off the lobby added to the atmosphere. It was old world charm and elegance with modern updates!",5,2023,07,20
105,A great stay!,"All the staff were incredibly helpful.  Breakfasts were excellent, as was the dinner we had in the restaurant.  The bar scene with music every evening was also a great experience.  The beds were very comfortable.  The hotel is well located to walking to historic destinations.  ",5,2023,07,19

105,"If you want to be spoiled in a great location, this is the place!","We chose The Chesterfield Mayfair initially for the location and because we knew we would need a ""soft place to land"" for the end of our trip.  Little did we know that they would spoil us during our stay.  The hotel is not only in a great location for exploring the area around Buckingham Palace and further afield, but it is luxurious and caters to your every need.  We were truly spoiled, which was much needed after a great but exhausting 10 days exploring Scotland.  We arrived tired and from the front sidewalk to our rooms to the bar where we gathered and ate, the service was exactly what we needed.  Namrata took great care of us in the bar each night, made us laugh and relax, and made sure we had everything we needed.  She answered our questions and checked in with us if we got too quiet. The piano music in the bar was perfect. We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and the service and food were exceptional.  We had one extremely small glitch in a request and reception and management made sure it was taken care of and we were surprised that that everyone was informed and made sure that everything went smoothly going forward.  It was truly a small thing, but The Chesterfield's service recovery was above anything we have experienced anywhere else. We would love to go back and stay and hope, one day, to make that happen.  Thank you for taking care of 10 tired and needy travelers! ",5,2023,07,18
105,Fabulous staff!,"I had two wonderful visits in June and July to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel made all the more enjoyable by a delicious breakfast each morning. My thanks to the catering staff, who are fantastic, as is everyone at the Hotel. So helpful whether escorting me to an Uber or a taxi. A wonderful stay! ",5,2023,07,18
105,A wonderful hotel with amazing staff,What a fabulous hotel! The staff are wonderful…very professional but so friendly too. They were very welcoming and went out of their way to make our stay memorable. The breakfast menu was extensive and dinner in the restaurant was delicious. The room was luxurious and the bed and pillows were the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. I can’t wait to return and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious London break in a hotel that offers excellent value for money.,5,2023,07,18
105,Quintessential British Boutique Hotel,"Quintessential British Boutique Hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Staff went above and beyond from check in to check out. Personalized turn down service (we got Bruce Springsteen chocolates!) Full breakfast to start the day was perfect. Staff in all areas was attentive, friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend the Gin Experience with Alejandro! We left with an entirely new appreciation for the intricacies of this spirit. His knowledge and personality made this one of the highlights of our trip to London!",5,2023,07,17
105,"Look No Further, Run to the Chesterfield Mayfair! ","My sister and I wanted to celebrate our recent graduations with a week long trip to London. We read about how centrally located Mayfair was in the city and this is what brought us to find the Chesterfield Mayfair. I read some great reviews but went in like any traveler a little wary about how great it could actually be. Turns out I was proven wrong and then some! This is truly a class example of customer service and personal touches just going above and beyond expectation to turn a trip into a once in a lifetime experience. We not only felt like we were in the middle of the city with access to the best attractions like Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and shopping (Harrods),  but we were also super close to all of the tour coach terminals around the city and out to the country. We took two full day tours through Trip Advisor and were never more than a 5 minute taxi to our coach pick up at Victoria station from the hotel. After we got past the amazing location the Chesterfield has we fell even more in love with the staff and accommodations. From the moment we arrived they knew our name and got to know us a little more each day. They wrote us personal cards thanking us for coming on the fourth of July even because they knew where we were from! They helped us arrange taxis, day excursions, and dinner reservations. The staff was so knowledgeable and consistently the nicest people we saw at the start and end of our day. The rooms were immaculate as well. They are large by European room standards and they are so well decorated with classic British touches. It was a retreat to come back to the room each night. In the morning we picked the option to have breakfast at the hotel and I would recommend all to do the same. All the breakfast options were big portions to help kickstart the day and tasted amazing. The only regret we have was that we did not do more at the hotel because we were so busy running around to the sites. At the last day we heard all about how the hotel has its own winery and they have a wine cellar for guests to peruse and do taste tests. They have amazing afternoon tea we heard about too that people come in for who aren't even staying at the hotel. All in all my sister and I absolutely loved the city of London but we were able to have the trip of a lifetime because of the Chesterfield Mayfair. We honestly cannot wait to go back!! Look no further, run, do not walk, to the Chesterfield Mayfair. ",5,2023,07,14
105,A Wonderful Hotel Experience in London,"We enjoyed a wonderful 5 night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London, and we heartily recommend it to you! It is a graceful and elegant facility, without pretense or ostentatiousness, with a friendly & knowledgeable staff who seem to really enjoy themselves at work. A special shoutout to Concierge Jake, who went above & beyond in helping us maximize our enjoyment of the hotel and London. His knowledge was encyclopedic, and his demeanor friendly & pleasant. Jake got us reservations at wonderful restaurants, counseled us on navigating the Underground, and was otherwise indispensable to us. He is a true professional, and a credit to the Red Carnation brand. (See his photo, attached to this review.) The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks off of Piccadilly, and a 5 minute walk to the Green Park stop on the Piccadilly Line. You can access all of London on the Underground, and we found it very easy to get around. We were in town to attend Wimbledon, and it was a simple one transfer trip to get to Southfields, which is a 17 minute walk from the All England Club. We were surprised on July 4 with a lovely tray of strawberries dipped in red, white & blue, and a pleasant note recognizing that we were away from our home country on an important holiday. A very nice touch!
We had chosen a Superior King Room (Room 305), with a King Size bed, and the room was typically smaller than American rooms, but with sufficient space for two large suitcases.  The mattress was excellent. There were 2 generous sized closets, and a safe. Two sitting chairs and a desk with USB and electrical plugs completed the room. The bathroom had a single sink, with a shower/tub with a robust rain shower head. Bathroom amenities were appropriate. The television station options were the best choices we received during our entire trip, and we could actually access NBC News from America, albeit a day late, at least in the morning.
Breakfast and dinner were served in the Dining Room. We had Breakfast Included in our room, and the choices were varied enough so that there was something for everyone, with starters including granola, porridge, fruit and toast, and mains including several eggs benedict, omelets, pancakes, and the classic Full English Breakfast. Service was excellent, and the food was delicious and well-prepared. We had a late night dinner in the Dining Room after one day at Wimbledon, and the menu was functional and fairly priced. We both had salads: Catherine had a Caesar, and I had a Cobb (which turned out to be signature dishes). Mine was deconstructed, and it was one of the most delightful Cobb salads I have enjoyed. We ate in the Lounge on the other night after getting back late from Wimbledon, and a similar menu was available. We shared a Steak Sandwich and a Lobster/Crab roll, French Fries included, and both were excellent. We spent a fair amount of time in the Lounge, as we typically do, and the staff was friendly & professional, always remembering our favorite beverages and other requests. We did not take advantage of Afternoon Tea, so I cannot comment on that, but I am confident it would be a winning experience.

We will definitely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel if we return to London, and we give it our highest recommendation. It is deserving of its 4 Star status, and its employees work hard to prove it every day. If you visit, make sure to ask for Jake, and tell him that Moray Johnny sent you!

105,Jake is the best concierge,"Great Staff  at this hotel.   Jake the concierge was excellent, very helpful and friendly.  The room was good size and clean.   Great location in the heart of Mayfair.  The breakfast was very good and is included.  I had the full English and is was so tasty.   Jake made reservations for us at a local restaurant and he was spot on with the recommendation.  Overall a great stay for our first time in London.  Piano bar was also fun with a great bartender.",5,2023,07,11
105,Lovely little hotel in Mayfair,"We spent a night here after seeing Billy Joel at Hyde Park. The location is perfect, only about ten minutes walk from British Summer Time. The front desk staff were excellent. We had a nice vegan burger when we arrived. Our room was very small but spotlessly clean no and very well kitted out. After the concert we had a drink in the bar where there was a pianist playing. The following morning breakfast was lovely and the staff were excellent. It is an old fashioned hotel, quintessentially English, with lovely staff. We would definitely return.",5,2023,07,09

Upon Check-in we couldn't have been greeted any nicer, The front desk was absolutely splendid.
Getting to the room was a breeze, But I just wanted to admire the Lobby, it is stunning.
The room looked like something out of a christmas postcard, I have never seen a more beautiful room, everything was spotless. 
The bed was so comfortable, The bathroom amenities was more then could ever dreamed of...A coffee and Tea pot hidden in a tall desk was perfect, with all the great teas...
The one complaint I had was that I was leaving. As I left I just knew I will return...",5,2023,07,06

We attended the Mr Simms sweet shop afternoon tea, we have been to many and this is definitely one of our favourites. The treats, the drinks, the food and setting were all incredible and beyond our expectations. Lots of teas to choose from and as many extra sandwiches and cakes as you like! Our waiter was Joselito who was clearly proud to work there and added to our experience. We will definitely be returning.",5,2023,07,05

The Chesterfield Mayfair really knows how to make you feel both like royalty and like you're relaxing at home. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,07,04
105,Lovely Hotel,"First time in London and quite happy we chose The Chesterfield. Hotel was very nice and the service was outstanding. All
staff members were friendly and very helpful. We followed their recommendations and they absolutely did not disappoint.",5,2023,07,02
105,The Mayfair Experience,"A wonderful experience and so grateful to all the team members who took a little time to make our stay fantastic. The valet car service was helpful with the car ready to go outside in the morning. From the first step in to our exit, everyone made a great effort with us and we really appreciated you all. We attended a concert at Hyde Park, a short walk away and perfect location. On return in the evening we loved the pianist in the bar who even slipped in some guns n roses songs much to the delight of the other people who’d attended the concert with us. When we returned to the room we found a very sweet personal note and chocolates hoping we had enjoyed the concert. The hotel is classically and beautifully fitted with everything you need for a special Mayfair experience",5,2023,07,01
105,Memorable stay,"Our family recently spent 6 nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair. The accommodations, restaurant, and service were top notch. The staff members engaging and helpful and took a special interest in our children (6 and 4 years old), which made the experience extra special for them. Two members of the staff in particular, Jozsef and Mustafa, made our time at The Chesterfield Mayfair memorable. They warmly greeted us upon coming and going and paid special attention to what the kids were interested in that day. We loved breakfast each morning and the afternoon tea. We hope to come back someday! ",5,2023,06,30
105,Superb staff and location,Fantastic staff - lovely hotel and great location. From the moment we arrived the staff were exceptionally helpful & friendly. The valet parking was a massive bonus and prompt when we needed to retrieve it. The Maitre De in the Butlers Restaurant (Robert) was exceptional; loved every moment of our stay,5,2023,06,29
105,Great Hotel,"Great location, comfortable beds and all of the staff were very helpful - Ellen at the front desk was great.  Her recommendations were wonderful.  The bar was a fun atmosphere with good food.  We had a great time while we were there",5,2023,06,29
105,Just Perfect!,"The best hotel we have ever stayed in in London. The staff were amazing. They were so attentive particularly to my 88-year-old mum. Although all the staff were exemplary a special mention must go to Carly at breakfast who made my mum feel like a queen! Also Jake and Jozef concierge at reception made sure all I needs were met.
Oh, and the best bed I have ever slept in! 
Can’t wait to go back",5,2023,06,29
105,Birthday dinner,"Went to the restaurant, great value food, excellent service in beautiful surroundings. You get greeted at the door, the dining area is really grand and the pies were delicious. The staff really made it a special experience for my daughter's 30th birthday.",5,2023,06,28
105,Perfect place for a family trip to London,My teenage children and I had an amazing experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The location is close to all the major attractions in central London. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Very clean rooms and excellent restaurants on site. I would highly recommend this hotel to any parent traveling alone with children in London!,5,2023,06,28
105,The Only Place to Stay,"We had the most wonderful experience!! The room was amazing. Perfect temperature and it was always well kept. The service was perfect from the made beds, to the doors always being opened for you, all the staff were so kind and understanding. They anticipated your every need, and were always excited to fulfill it. Every meal was delicious and the service was impeccable.  The Chesterfield Mayfair is definitely the place to stay",5,2023,06,27
105,A hotel where travellers return again and again,"The moment the doorman opened the door for us, we stepped into the welcoming haven of a first class hotel. The Chesterfield is truly a gem of a place where travellers return time and time again. All the staff we encountered made our stay wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. The receptionist was very helpful as well as having a friendly personality. We especially liked how the porter not only took up our luggage, but took the time to explain how everything in the room worked. This included the air-conditioning control, which can be a puzzle at times.
The room was great and spotlessly clean. Most importantly, the bed was comfortable. The bar area was enjoyable, again with lovely staff.
Breakfast was more than substantial. Plus, it was served not a buffet.
All in all, we felt cherished and will happily return for another visit.",5,2023,06,27
105,Off the charts great!,"I cannot say enough good about this hotel and the staff. Beautiful smaller hotel that was always very clean and kept. Jake may be the best concierge I have ever met and experienced. We became friends within a day and he even took the time to write me a personal note when I took ill on our final day in London.  Jozseph was another amazing concierge with an infectious smile. Mustafa was the kindest, most professional ""doorman"" ever. The location is perfect for access to wonderful nearby restaurants, shopping, and pubs. Food at the hotel was wonderful as was the coffee that was brewed by the cup for me in the beautiful lounge each morning. When we return to London we will absolutely be staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair!!! ",5,2023,06,27
105,Classy - and not just because it’s Mayfair. ,"I booked a stay at The Chesterfield for myself and a friend as we were going to watch P!nk at Hyde Park. I initially chose The Chesterfield due to its proximity, but also because I wanted something to stay somewhere a little special. 
Unfortunately my friend was unable to attend, and whilst I was a little nervous travelling on my own the staff at The Chesterfield made every effort to make my stay a memorable one! I was able to check in early which was a huge bonus after being up early to travel. When I came back to my room I found they had left me a little surprise - a print out of a picture of P!nk along with some chocolates along with a lovely message from Saffron saying they hoped I enjoyed the concert - I was incredibly touched, thank you so much Saffron!
My room was lovely and the air conditioning a welcome bonus. I had breakfast in Butlers Restaurant which has a lovely touch of class to it without being stuffy. The breakfast menu was  extensive. The fruit platter and full english (with a choice of not only type of eggs but how I wanted them cooked) were amongst the best I’ve had, served with plenty of coffee and fruit juice. 
Nothing was too much for the staff, and the lovely ladies on reception were genuinely interested, friendly, and engaging - to be honest everyone I came across was. 
This is a classy hotel - and not just because it’s in Mayfair. It’s the little things they do that add to the overall experience. I know where I’ll be staying the next time I come to London. ",5,2023,06,26
105,4 nights in London,"The Chesterfield must be one of the finest London hotels. We were there last September and again in June, 2023 for 4 nights. Quite delightful.The staff are exceptionally well trained. So helpful and accommodating , from the from desk and reception area, to the bar and dining room.
We would like to recommend Alfie in the restaurant and the young lady serving drinks in the bar area ( can’t remember her name ) for their friendliness and helpfulness. We’ll certainly be back soon.",5,2023,06,24
105,Best stay in London for a true English experience!,"Wow -  what a wonderful hotel with so much English flair and decor!  My 17 year old daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights following an Airbnb stay in Paris for 5 days.  Everything about this hotel was first class and so luxurious with such warm hospitality.  I booked thru Costco Travel which included daily breakfast - which was great start to our day.  The food at their restaurant is amazing - everything we tried was delicious!  We also had dinner one night at the hotel and loved the evening menu.  Last the most fun experience was the afternoon tea which was such a fun and delightful experience in their sunlit garden dining area.  We just loved it and I never knew what the afternoon tea was all about!  Last, the location just in the heart of the best area in London - felt safe walking around everywhere!  Berkeley square just a few steps away and Picadilly street just a few more.  My daughter went to the gym daily which the concierge would set up before she walked over to the complimentary gym use in Berkeley square also.  Lots of bars, restaurants and shops near!  Loved the Green Park also near and quick cut thru to buckingham palace.  I would come back here again for sure as I feel I know this whole area now and everything about this hotel is 5 star!",5,2023,06,24
105,Extraordinary Hotel experience ,"The staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair were exceptional, the service was the best I've experienced in my travels.  The  Doormen, front desk, bellmen and Conceige went above and beyond to provide great service.  I would highly recommend this property.  In addition, the location is close to Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace.",5,2023,06,23
105,Our home away from home,"We returned to our favorite hotel for the Coronation, and yet again, the Chesterfield Mayfair did not disappoint.  Despite the fact that the hotel and city were busy due to the Coronation, the customer service did not dwindle a bit.  The staff worked extra hard to ensure our stay was up to the usual standard of excellence.  We stayed on the sixth floor with the amazing heated floors, and our room was clean, comfortable, and the linens were comparable to home.  The breakfast was brimming with options, the bar served consistently good drinks, and the staff made us feel like family.  We have stayed at this boutique hotel 7-8 times with a return trip scheduled for the Fall (we wouldnt stay anywhere else), confident that the customer service on all fronts will be as wonderful as ever.  With the tube being only a 5 minute walk away, a taxi available in 1-2 minutes, and restaurants in walking distance, there is nothing lacking.  Yet it is the customer service that we most remember. It is impressive that as busy as they are, the staff remembers us as well.  This is our home away from home.",5,2023,06,14
105,What a birthday treat!,"We had a wonderful stay. All the staff were friendly without being familiar. The air-conditioning in our room for the first night was on occasions so loud that it woke me (5 times in 7 hours). However, our room was changed for the second night with very little inconvenience to us. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful. Basically, nothing was too much trouble. This was a special occasion visit to London and the hotel made it very special indeed!",5,2023,06,14
105,Incredible experience,"Had the most fantastic experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair. I took my family for afternoon tea to celebrate my daughters 5th birthday and the staff, atmosphere and food were incredible. 

We were met outside by the Joseph and Gyorgy who greeted us with genuine warmth and treated my daughter like a princess from the moment they found out it was her birthday. This continued through the reception area with Darren, the head concierge, ensuring we were looked after and guiding us through to the restaurant where Fiachra and Rafal then took care of us so well, attending to our every need and spoiling my daughter rotten. 

The restaurant was beautiful and the atmosphere was great, lots of people clearly enjoying the experience and the food was delicious. The sweet flavour combinations were so clever and sandwiches were delicious. We’re not big tea drinkers, but the champagne went down a treat instead.

I would highly recommend, my family loved it and were so well looked after. 

Matt W and family",5,2023,06,14
105,Old school charm and service,"Charming, well appointed hotel with professional, courteous and friendly staff.  The location within the Mayfair section of London is convenient to all that London has to offer and if staying at the Chesterfield, dinner at its restaurant is not to be missed",5,2023,06,14
105,Lovely hotel in the heart of shopping and dining ,"The hotel is in a great location, lots to do.  The staff is friendly and the rooms are comfortable.  It was the London experience I wanted.  Some restaurant charges are still being questioned, hope it's resolved quickly, which is the reason I didn't rate 5 stars.  
We were surprised with a beautiful cake to celebrate our anniversary as soon as we arrived.  It was delicious and so generous!",4,2023,06,13
105,A charming hotel with superb service,"The Chesterfield was a wonderful hotel full of London charm. The staff went out of their way at every point to make our stay memorable. We had a late arrival and reservation issue fixed with a smile,we had a departure issue and they held our bags all day even after we checked out. The doorman, the wait staff,the front desk the housekeeping superb. The rooms were a good size for London and beautiful. The location ideal for walking anywhere in London along with pubs and restaurants. We loved it!",5,2023,06,13
105,Lovely hotel experience,"The service was excellent, the room quite nice, but a bit small. Breakfast is included, which was lovely. The location is excellent, right in the middle of Mayfair near lots of fun things. The bar is fun at night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London.",4,2023,06,11
105,Relaxed Luxury annd Fantastic Staff,"We were lucky enough to stay at The Chesterfield for a relaxing birthday long weekend.  This is our second visit, it won't be our last.  The hotel is situated in a quiet corner of Mayfair, away from the hustle and bustle.  The hotel is luxurious, spotlessly clean and has all the facilities you would require.  While the atmosphere is understated luxury, it is also entirely without pretensions.  What really makes this hotel special are the staff.  Every member of staff that we met, whatever their job, was friendly, polite and could not do enough to help.  We shall definitely return.",5,2023,06,09
105,Brilliant hotel and superb staff.,Fantastic hotel and staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect and I would recommended this hotel to anyone. We have stayed at numerous top London hotels but the service and the quality at the Mayfair matched these.,5,2023,06,09
105,Excellent Gin Tasting Experience,"My Girlfriend and I went to The Chesterfield Mayfair in May 2023 to have the Gin tasting experience. It was presented by two lovely members of the team Alexandro and Viviana. I learned so much about the origin of Gin and how different types are made, what spices are used, also learned about the best tonic match to certain type of gins. They made it so interesting and engaging, furthermore any questions were asked by us they responded in a really friendly way with excitement to pass on the knowledge they had. If anyone is interested in learning about from the process of gin making to tasting it I highly recommend doing this experience! 

Big thank you to the guys!
Gabor Koncz",5,2023,06,07
105,We loved the Chesterfield,"The Chesterfield has an excellent location, close to many attractions. Food and service were excellent, In particular we want to mention concierge Jake who was proactively helpful on several occasions. Overall, this place is a gem.

105,Terrace Bar,"Viviane is AMAZING! She is so kind and welcoming. You can tell she truly loves her job. We are so glad that she was able to serve us. Viviane is very kind and friendly, the perfect person to serve you! We can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,06,06
105,This Place is the Best of London!,"This hotel is just the best!  Everyone is very nice and helpful.  From a bottle of water to a ride to the Beyoncé concert, we felt taken care of.  We were so impressed with the kindness, helpfulness, comforts, and safety that we felt at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  I wish that I could call out individuals who helped us, but truly everyone was wonderful!❤️",5,2023,06,02
105,Hidden gem,The Chesterfield is a classic and cosy hotel in an excellent quiet location. We love the bar. We got back from a concert at the O2 after 11pm and the bar welcomed us and offered food. Staff are welcoming and friendly.  This is regular hotel for nights out in London. ,5,2023,06,02
105,You're making the other hotels look bad... ,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield for our 2 year anniversary in May 2023. We have been to the Chesterfield a few times before, and have always been delighted by the service we've experienced. It therefore made sense to go and stay again for a special occasion. Where better that a hotel that actively describes itself as ""Your House?"" A perfect home away from home in the heart of London. 

I'll be candid, we've been visiting the Chesterfield for the last two years on and off, whether to stay for the odd special occasion, or to go for drinks on a Saturday when we used to live a little closer, and we are familiar with the smiling faces of the team who work there. There have been a few changes recently, some which a lot of establishments would struggle with: the Bar Manager leaving for example, but credit where credit is due, if it wasn't for the fact that we knew the individuals, we wouldn't have known. The service never faltered, even when they were managing the period of change, and you could only see smiling and satisfied customers in all areas of the hotel. They took it in their stride and handled it like the true pros that they are. Alessandro stepped up to the plate and made things move as smoothly as always. I was delighted to hear he had been made bar manager at our most recent visit. So well deserved! Anyway, I digress. 

There aren't really words to describe our most recent stay. I've always waxed lyrical about the Chesterfield, it is my absolute favourite hotel of all time, but this visit outshone the last few. I didn't even know it was possible, how do you improve on perfection? Well, they managed it and some! 

We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the doorman who swiftly took our bags before I'd even set my feet on the pavement. As we entered, we were welcomed back warmly by all the team who happened to be in the vicinity and were swiftly presented with champagne on the house in honour of our anniversary... this is all before I'd even started the conversation about checking in. Upon speaking with the reception team, Amy, who I happen to know was new, not through skill but because I know the team, smiled and effortlessly took us through the checking in process ,informing us that we'd been upgraded and ensuring we had help with our bags if we needed it. She made it so seamless and easy, while at the same time making us feel so valued and special. The reception team, including concierges, reception staff and doorpeople at the Chesterfield are just second to none. I could go there, having had the worst day to that point, and be instantly made to forget it just by the way they welcome you to the hotel. 

We were told that if we'd like a drink that the library was available for drinks until the bar was ready later that afternoon. Reason being? They are slowly refurbishing the bar but in such a way that guests have minimal disruption to their usual stay. As they told us this, the bar doors opened and their comment was moot. This just stands testament to how much they concern themselves with their guests' comfort. They are refurbing the bar, bit by bit, so that they only have to close it for short periods so that guests can continue to use all the rooms and facilities. When I got married at a high end hotel, elsewhere in Mayfair, I wasn't able to use half the rooms that were usually available for my wedding, because they were point blank closed for refurbishment... This is not a usual consideration of a hotel, but the Chesterfield Team, and their General Manager, go that extra mile. Talk about having the end user in mind! I think they live and breathe the end user!

Our room was fantastic. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the Philipe Suite (if you haven't and if you can - stay there... but not when I want to) and it is really a thing of beauty. A four posted bed, surrounded by soft wall material that is a gorgeous white and blue design. If we hadn't already been made to feel like royalty, this would certainly have done the trick! There were flowers in a vase, freshly prepared by a local florist which is, as I understand it, common practice for the suites, and a card from the team wishing us a pleasant stay and Happy Anniversary. And before I move on, let's just take a moment to talk about the pillows. I am not ashamed to admit that I have emailed the team since our visit and asked where I can get some. They are absolutely perfect, and even my husband agrees. Considering we both like very different pillows, that says it all really! Everything about our room was perfect, I'm always incredibly sad to leave. 

I feel like I'm visiting family when I go to the Chesterfield. That's not because we have visited before, or because we know the team now. I remember the first time I went, just for a drink, and recognising that the team made extra effort to make you feel at home. They remembered us from that one visit 3 years later when we started to visit more frequently. Where else do you get that level of care and effort? You don't. It's astounding to me how they can consistently get every single detail right... and every single time!
",5,2023,05,31
105,Love the Chesterfield!,"This about the 7th time I have stayed at the Chesterfield, in Mayfair. .  Not only in a great location (Green Park tu be stop) but the best staff ever! Particularly Darren, one of the concierges. He got the cars arranged for the theaters we went to, etc.

They have really old school service-when it goes wrong, they fix it. I had a  massive nose bleed  and all  they cared about was that I got a new pillow when I was worried about the linens! They wanted to send a doc to me, but I knew I'd be fine, so declined.

There are many eating options near by. All the meals in the hotel are good, but pricey. Room service is sky high!

There is an M &S simply food at the tube stop. Good  selection!

This is NOT an inexpensive hotel! You need to work the 4 for 3 deal, 4 nights for the price of 3. Book directly with the hotel.  With this deal, it runs about 350 US a night, but worth it.

They have a great bar and will always give me a BUCKET of ice when I ask for it. No fridge in rooms. Each room is individual.  The MUSIC ROOM has the most sensational bathroom.  Be sure and specify what kind of bed you want.All I've slept in are very comfy.

There are many hotels to choose from in London. But I will keep going back to the Chesterfield! ( I go at least once a year).

105,Proper high service hotel with truly excellent Staff and service,Super hotel - great staff.   Came to experience high quality luxury hotel service -- The Chesterfield really delivered.    all the staff were super with that fabulous blend of both high professionalism and personal friendly touch.  Reception and front desk reception team - great.  Restaurant and bar staff -- excellent too. (food absolutely perfect at every meal)  F & B team very attentive and first class,5,2023,05,30
105,A great hotel to stay while in London,"There are a ton of hotels in London but the Chesterfield is a nice small and quaint hotel that provides the British field and is close to the tube, park, and Buckingham Palace.  My adult daughter and I just stayed and enjoyed the entire staff, did the afternoon tea, and dinner.  Ate late night in the bar as well.  Everything was spot on and we could not have asked for better.  ",5,2023,05,29
105,Great Experience,"With so many choices in London this turned out to be great choice.  Has charm of an English hotel and smaller than top chains in same area.   Was excellent central location, clean rooms, great ambience, friendly and helpful staff.  Enjoy the tea room or live music in lounge in the evening.  Plenty of different plug types in room which is convenient.  Made us feel very special for our 35 year anniversary.   Wow, nice touch, thanks.  Only small ask is to make it easier to plug phone in to charge at night next to bed.  But could get to behind nightstand so really an issue.   Thanks! ",5,2023,05,29
105,Such a wonderful moment,The Gin & Tonic experience that we have done at the Chesterfield Mayfair Bar was incredible! Viviana explained everything super clean and we learnt so much from her. Alexandro and Marilene have been super nice as well. Such a memorable moment there!  Many thanks for your  professional customer service. ,5,2023,05,27
105,"My favorite London hotel, but service deteriorating","I’ve stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair 6 or 7 times now and I keep returning because of the location, great atmosphere and decor, friendly service, and excellent breakfast. I was there for one week, checking out just a couple days before the coronation. Thought most room types were sold out, the lobby and other areas of the hotel were never crowded (besides breakfast, where there was sometimes a 15-20 minute wait). 

I normally stay in a Classic Double, but reserved a Classic Single (Room 714) because other rooms options were unavailable at the time of booking. Though well designed and with a nice view facing the front of the hotel, there was very little space. I was unable to store my suitcases away, and there were no drawers or any space for storage besides a tiny closet. The “writing desk” also had very minimal space, no space to actually write if using a computer. Also, not that it would have fit, but there was no iron and ironing board as described on the website. This was actually needed during my stay but I had to do without (and couldn't have requested on because it wouldn't have fit in the room). Also, the “complimentary high-speed wi-fi” was far from high speed. It was so slow that I was literally unable to use my computer in the room my entire stay. Lastly, the bed was worn and clearly old. With a deep indentation, I could feel the wires and springs underneath. This is not something I’ve experienced during my previous stays and needs to be addressed. Reserve a Classic Single if you're staying a night or two. For longer stays, get a Classic Double or larger room type. 

Unfortunately, the service during my stay was far below what I’ve experienced on my previous stays here. It all started when my card key didn’t work and I had to haul all my luggage back to the front desk for a new key. Then the following day, the newspaper I requested did not arrive. Then there were several housekeeping issues including: the coffee tea, sugar, and milk not being replaced for 3 days (even though it was mentioned twice to turn-down service staff in the evenings), tissue also not replaced, returning to the room mid-afternoon only to find it was being cleaned (this happened on two occasions) even though a request was placed on the doorknob at 8:00 am, and my newspaper disappearing from the desk even though older newspapers were placed in the trash bin. Also, in all of my previous stays I would receive a nice farewell message and dessert on my final night but did not on this particular stay. Though it’s definitely not a big drawback, it was slightly disappointing, as it was a kind gesture that I became accustomed to. 

I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair for those wanting a traditional feel in a central location. And you absolutely need to include breakfast with your stay. It is amazing. The service issues I experienced were definitely not a deterrent (and definitely not the norm), and I will no doubt be returning next year (hopefully these issues will be resolved by then and a larger room type will be available).",4,2023,05,23
105,Stay Away from the Second Floor,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a beautiful older hotel. Our room was on the second floor. During our stay the hotel’s hairdryer would trip a breaker rendering the hairdryer useless. The front desk swapped out our hairdryer for another. It worked for a few minutes and then out it went. Unfortunately it happened 30 minutes before we were to attend our niece’s wedding. My wife worked on her hair whilst it air dried. The front desk person said they’d bring another hairdryer. It never arrived. The next day I told them we still had the problem and gave me a third hairdryer. And, they said a maintenance person would come to discuss the situation. Our discussion revealed that the second floor of the hotel had very old electrical and that was the root of the problem. Other international travelers have become used to having USB plugs in the room for charging their devices. None in our room!  Perhaps in the future they will upgrade this. 
The bedding and towels were very nice and the room was very clean. The location is perfect for walking to shops, restaurants and pubs. 
So, the hotel is perfect in the old historic sense but avoid a room on the second floor!",4,2023,05,21
105,Awesome experience,"We went to the hotel for the Gin&tonic experience. It was really amazing, we know now how was the process in the past and how many types of gin we can have around the world,  Alejandro prepared for us amazing drinks, and explain us everything for more than 1hour and half, the hotel, installation and the workers was really awesome, very nice and British vibe. We want to back again next month for another one experience. Thanks Namrata and Glenda too for your attention. good bless   ",5,2023,05,20
105,Exceptional Culture,"We were instant family when we stepped into the foyer of the Chesterfield. However, it was Mustafa with his friendly welcome and care that brightened our day as we stepped from our taxi.  Into the reception we sailed where Ellen and Heather were wonderfully efficient and affable. Giorgi kindly whisked our luggage to our room — we were delighted with the ambience and the comely decor. Every little item of comfort was enjoyed from our extensive tea/coffee service to our bathroom robes and nightly turn down with chocolates. The Chesterfield ensured our comfort and made our stay in London effortless. A delightful experience! An excellent culture!",5,2023,05,20
105,Loved staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair!,"Chesterfield Mayfair was terrific! 1st class hospitality. All staff were very friendly and helpful. It’s hard to single any one staff member out- check in counter and concierge were particularly helpful. The location was great as well. Very close to pubs and restaurants. Within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Churchill War Museum, Westminster Abbey, etc.",5,2023,05,20
105,Feels like home!,"Absolutely amazing stay. The service was impeccable and I plan to be back. Jozef in the lobby is so friendly and helpful. Rafal (and another lady I forget her name) in the Butler Restaurant treated us like royalty for dinner (dinner was also delicious!) The housekeepers were also very helpful and kind, eagerly asking us if we needed anything. 

One of the days we had to leave early for a day long tour. Since we needed to leave before breakfast service started, we asked if we could get anything beforehand. The concierge was very helpful, and had two boxes of pastries and fruits ready for us that morning. After coming back that day (12+ hours later), we came back to the room exhausted but delighted to see turn down service and my weighted blanket (I am a very picky sleeper so I always pack this) properly laid out under the comforter (amazing!). Then we went downstairs for dinner at The Butler Restaurant which was an amazing experience. This is just an example of one of our days staying at Chesterfield Mayfair. 

The hotel itself feels a little bit small and outdated, and the breakfast service is a bit slow. However, the overall service beyond makes up for these. Each day there was a little treat or surprise waiting us in our room. The location is also great: close walk to SoHo and subway stations but away from the loud hustle and bustle so we can easily relax.

Overall, the staff really makes you feel like you’re home, which is something I never experienced to this level before at other hotels. ",5,2023,05,19
105,Nice Quaint hotel in the heart of London,"My daughter and I spent two days at this hotel at the end of our 2 week stay in the UK.  The hotel is very elegant and the staff is so friendly and very helpful. They go out of their way to be of service and treat you like you belong at the hotel, not like other hotels on this scale that would at you like you don't belong. The front staff the concierge desk and the doormen were so friendly and very accommodating when helping us navigate the city. The bar staff were also friendly and spent time talking with you, if they weren't busy. This is a very quaint hotel that reminds me of the old Waldorf Astoria in NYC. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2023,05,18
105,Great hotel with even better staff!,An excellent property & the staff are top notch.  Everyone is welcoming and helpful with a wealth of knowledge about the city.  Rooms are well appointed with all the amenities and very clean.  Location is great too.  A special thanks to Saffron at the front desk and Josef & the concierge/bell staff!,5,2023,05,18
105,Jake,"Both the room and the experience were absolutely wonderful. The most memorable part of our trip? The Concierge, Jake. This is man who does not simply direct you to restaurants, he actually walks you to them! I have never experienced that kind of customer service, and I can't imagine anyone, anyone at all, would not have much the same experience with Jake and the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was a phenomenal place, highlighted by a phenomenal staff.

105,A first class hotel in the midst of Mayfair,"We have stayed at The Chesterfield numerous times over the last few years, and have always experienced first class service, extremely friendly staff and excellent food.  The bar offers a knowledgeable drinks service, a good choice of bar snacks and live music - we love going to sit in there and enjoy the experience.  Bedrooms are lovely and we always try to book a king size room as the classic rooms are limited in size.  The breakfast offers a large choice, and vegetarians and vegans are catered for with no problems.  As mentioned, we have always received first class service from all staff at The Chesterfield, and they are willing to go over and above what is required to help you.  We could not speak highly enough of them.  The hotel is situated in an excellent part of Mayfair,  Berkeley Square and Green Park being only a few minutes walk away.  We could not recommend The Chesterfield highly enough.",5,2023,05,17
105,Fantastic hotel in the heart of London,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a real gem that will give travelers a taste of real British charm. The staff were more than gracious. The rooms, restaurant, bar and lobby are beautifully decorated. We enjoyed the cozy and welcoming bar after long days of visiting the many attractions London has to offer. The bartenders can always make you a drink that is different and delicious. We also had a wonderful dinner and breakfast daily in the  restaurant. The food was very good. We suggest having at least one dinner in the hotel to enjoyed the stellar service and top-notch cuisine. The service was excellent and the staff were more than accommodating. My husband and I also loved the location. The hotel is on a quiet street in Mayfair, close to many great restaurants, pubs and shopping. The Green Park tube station is also very close, giving access to many attractions around London. If you are looking for a traditional English experience with modern amenities, this is a great place to stay. ",5,2023,05,16
105,Thinking of staying here? Do it. You won't be disappointed.,"Going to London has been on my bucket list for years. I booked this trip for myself and my daughter when she turned 18 — it was a combo birthday, Christmas, and high school graduation gift. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, these vacation plans were canceled three times. 

However, we finally made it 2 1/2 years later, coincidentally landing in London on the day of King Charles' coronation. This was a package booked through Costco Travel, and my best friend suggested we stay here, based on the online reviews. 

Boy, I'm so glad she steered us this way. 

The experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair was nothing but top-notch. The place itself was beautiful, the architecture, décor, and structure itself so intricate. It was so charming and lovely, as was the staff. I can't commend them enough. Everyone we interacted with was so pleasant, and they clearly want their guests to have the best experience possible. I loved the heated bathroom floor, too! The food was fabulous in the restaurant, as well as room service. We loved the afternoon tea! So delicious. Plus, I had casually mentioned to our waiter, Rafal, at afternoon tea that this trip was a long overdue gift that had been canceled three times before. He didn't let us slip out the door without presenting my daughter with a birthday cupcake and singing to her. 

Every staff member we interacted with was pleasant and accommodating, from the porters to reception to housekeeping and more. I wish I had taken down all their names. I even enjoyed the live music played in the bar. (I don't drink, but I had a couple of non-alcoholic beverages there and just loved the vibe.) 

When I travel, I typically like to stay at different hotels when visiting a location I've been to before. However, if I ever come back to London, I would definitely stay here again. Because I know what I'm getting -- and it's amazing. I hope to come back in the next couple of years with my husband and son, and I will certainly try to book at the Chesterfield Mayfair again. Thank you for providing my daughter and me with a spectacular experience for this very special trip.  ",5,2023,05,15
105,Wonderful Hotel!!,"Just got back from a week At the Chesterfield Mayfair in London.  LOVED IT!  The best part was the staff.  Everyone made you feel like you were at home.  I know a lot of places say they do this but honestly this was how I felt the whole time I was there.  Thank you for making our trip so special and great.

Location was very good. Rooms spotless.  Food great!  ",5,2023,05,15
105,A great stay in a lovely Hotel,"A great stay, our second and hopefully not our last. The Hotel is very well managed, traditional, and homely.  We love it and the staff.  They are exceptional, they obviously love their job and we were really surprised to be recognised after our visit last year. They are natural, friendly and enjoy talking to you, they enjoy making your stay a special one. Location is great, just a few minutes from the tube and Green Park.   Mustn't forget the wonderful linen on the bed, or the bed itself!  Very comfortable.  The dinner we had in the hotel was really excellent, service to match. ",5,2023,05,14
105,Wonderful customer service,"Incredible afternoon tea. The service from savolta was amazing. It made my celebration so special.  Food was beautiful and such a wonderful array of teas. The ambiance was relaxed, not rushed and a very personalised level of service. ",5,2023,05,14
105,A Mayfair Gen,"The Chesterfield is our home away from home when we're in London because the staff always go above and beyond to make our stay magical from the welcome note to remembering which tea & biscuit flavors we prefer in our room.   The location is also convenient - a short walk to multiple Tube lines, Buckingham Palace, Green Park and shopping (Bond Street & Oxford Street).  Butler's Restaurant (in the hotel) is also a treat -  the staff is attentive and the food is wonderful - the fish & chips are our favorite!  ",5,2023,05,12
105,Great stay in London,The hotel was in a perfect location. The room was well appointed and the staff was very courteous. Would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting London. It situated away from the crowds but in a great neighborhood with good amenities! ,5,2023,05,12
105,Love the Chesterfield!,What a wonderful hotel experience! The most amazing staff from front door to housekeeping! They have a fabulous piano player on the weekends - we had a BLAST! Try out the lavender cocktail and the espresso martini. The afternoon tea is delicious! Location is just 8 minute walk from Green Park station Underground and so close to many fantastic restaurants! We would recomment and would stay there again. We went for the coronation and just had a wonderful time.,5,2023,05,11
105,Brilliant Hotel as per the Perspective of an Industry Veteran,"Dear Travellers, I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in early May--Coronation week.  My family is in the hotel business in the UK.  I am reasonably familiar with the inner workings of what makes a hotel ""tick.""  This hotel ticks all the boxes:  location, cleanliness, excellent food, well-appointed rooms, value for money, and the ""secret sauce,"" staff who really give a ""damn"" for the customer.  I used the mild expletive because staff concern for hotel guests isn't always genuine.  Shout outs to:  Evelina and Cyan in the Dining Room;  Saffron and Amy at the Front Desk; and my behind-the-scenes friend, Christina.  Can't wait to return in the Fall.  Bravo.",5,2023,05,10
105,A new favourite hotel in SW1!,"What a treat! We stayed just one night to be close to the  Coronation celebrations. From the moment we arrived, all of the front office and concierge team were super friendly and very helpful - nothing too much! The bed was like a cloud of comfort, lovely size and some very much appreciated personal touches. The box of teas, coffees and treats were of great quality. the bathroom and fluffy towels with fab Floris toiletries were a treat. Umbrellas to borrow so we didn't get wet (again!) and a lovely lunch in between festivities. Finally, it's the best neighbourhood to stay in - so central yet quiet. All round great. We will be back!",5,2023,05,09
105,Perfect for you first visit and everyone there after!,The staff is top rate and respond to your every need and the breakfast served daily was fantastic.  The hotel location is walk-able to almost everything you want to see when visiting London. On our next trio back we will again be staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair,5,2023,05,01
105,"Lovely hotel, great position, friendly staff.","This is a lovely small hotel in an excellent location, our superior twin rooms was a good size for London with comfortable bed and luxurious bedding. We encountered a few members of staff from the friendly doorman to the reception and bar staff. Our room wasn't ready on time due a problem with the linens but the offer of a complimentary drink and canapes in the bar while we waited was most welcome and more than made up for it. 
We didn't have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on that but we really enjoyed our stay. ",5,2023,05,01
105,Better than the Best,"The friendliest staff of any hotel that I have stayed in.  The rooms are a bit small, but everything else about the hotel more than makes up for it.  Breakfast is a feast, the staff are amazing, the location is perfect and the ambience is superb.   It’s a four star hotel that casts a long shadow over many of the five star hotels.  Strongly recommended.",5,2023,05,01
105,Afternoon Tea,"Booked the sweet themed afternoon tea as something a little different and enjoyed every minute.  Situated in the conservatory, the room was lovely and the food absolutely delicious.   A range of real delights including the incredible selection of teas. Service was not perfect but the fact that the staff were fantastic meant it didn't have a negative impact on our visit. Every single one of them was approachable,  smiley, willing to interact and just a pleasure to deal with so thank you for making our treat so special ",5,2023,04,29
105,"Great location in Mayfair, lovely staff and public areas, cramped private rooms","Great location, very friendly staff, good and ample breakfast (included in our room fee), attractive public rooms and restaurant. We had two rooms for two adults and two teens. Our rooms were clean but a bit tired, dark, cramped and didn't have good views.  We only stayed one night and had come from a super-modern, light and bright hotel in another city, so when we return we might try the Chesterfield Mayfair again for a longer stay to give it another try. For our 20-hour stay that included two rooms and breakfast we paid approximately £850. ",4,2023,04,28
105,Top notch!,"The hotel is charming, the food is wonderful and the staff are top notch. Thank you for a wonderful visit!  The Chesterfield  is in a central location. London was a delight and did not disappoint on the weather either. ",5,2023,04,28
105,Birthday fun!,"From the moment you enter this beautiful space you are treated with care.  Salvatore and Josef are simply perfection.  They make it their mission to help in any way they can.  Their professionalism is unmatched!  All of the staff that we encountered throughout the Chesterfield were kind, polite and ever so helpful.  The room is clean, well appointed and the bed is very comfortable.  We had a great stay and highly recommend the Chesterfield.",5,2023,04,28

105,Rafal chesterfield  Mayfair,Had the best time having the cream tea.Willy Wonka style. Was treated like like royalty by Rafal. As my wife and I  were celebrating our 25th  anniversary the waiting staff pulled out all the stops. All the staff were fantastic especially Rafal. We will definitely be back. All the staff in the hotel were professional from reception to catering. Thank you all for the good memories. ,5,2023,04,25
105,Great Lodging in the Mayfair Area,"My hubby and I were in London for 9 days and spent 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. This is my review.
Pro- 
• Location is great. The station is Green Park, so three lines go through there (Victoria, Jubilee and Piccadilly). Very convenient. The hotel is located about 8 minutes away from the station, a quiet neighborhood, so I really like it how when you go to sleep, it is quiet.  
• Staff is friendly and helpful. There is just no complaining about their outstanding services.
• Housekeeping puts a cookie on your pillow each time they service your room! And we appreciate the bottled water too (though we just drink tap water and boil the tap water for hot beverages).  By the way, I appreciate so much about the creamer from glass bottles, not the little plastic ones.

Con - a little outdated interior, and the plumbing would make a little more noise inside the bathroom at night for some reason. The shower hot water knob was not working too well (not the bath one), but just be a little patient and it eventually would sync with shower.",4,2023,04,24
105,Fantastic hotel!,"I recently brought my mom to London to celebrate her 65th birthday, and our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was absolutely perfect! The staff were so friendly & helpful. The decor is beautiful. The room was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The location was perfect for sightseeing, exploring, eating, & shows. We were able to walk to Buckingham, Westminster, Soho, and the West End, and the hotel was just a short walk from the tube or bud for everything else. The hotel bar was excellent - the bartenders were so personable & the pianist at night is a great touch. Everyone went out of their way to make my mom feel special on her birthday, and it was so memorable for her. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,04,24
105,One of my favorite London hotels!,"THis is one of my favorites in London.  Food is good, nice bar, clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff!  I go frequently with an art group and we always feel welcome.  Joseph and Amy were both great.",5,2023,04,23
105,Fabulous London trip!,"We had a fabulous stay here because all the staff were so incredibly friendly and helpful! In particular, Agnelo was incredibly helpful and our last day, he sent us off in a cab to the airport with cappuccinos to go and a few tasty pastries! Jake was also helpful with our dinner planning and Sam was always helpful with anything too. Our room was lovely and the breakfast was wonderful- we will definitely stay again and I highly recommend it as its in a great London location too!",5,2023,04,22
105,Successful Afternoon tea,My family and I went for afternoon tea for my daughters 6th Birthday. The ambiance was perfect. Staff were very helpful and friendly. As we entered Andrej was very welcoming and especially Ella and Caitlin who were very attentive. Would definitely revisit again,5,2023,04,22
105,Outstanding Service at the Chesterfield!,"Service was impeccable. The hotel staff was very helpful, courteous, and professional. They went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. Sam, in particular, assisted us far beyond the call of duty in making sure that our experience was first-rate. We couldn’t be happier with the hotel and will be returning soon. Thank you to all.",5,2023,04,19
105,Very special birthday cream tea ,"A wonderful afternoon tea with magical service in a great setting. Really amazing experience that you just cannot beat. We had 12 of us together aged from 9 to over 70 and we all loved it, especially the delicious cakes! ",5,2023,04,18
105,Perfect,"This was the best hotel stay I’ve ever had. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are lovely, breakfast is superb, location is great and the staff are polite, courteous, helpful and totally look after you. It was perfect. 10 out of 10 :) ",5,2023,04,17
105,Amazing afternoon tea experience.,My husband and I enjoyed an fantastic afternoon tea there to celebrate our Silver wedding anniversary. Our waiter Rafal treated us like royality. We came away with pick n mix and more cakes. 1st class,5,2023,04,17
105,Highly recommended G&T experience,"We did the Gin & Tonic Experience at the Chesterfield Hotel bar a couple of weeks ago, without having any expectations, it turned to be amazing. We had Ale, as the subject master expert, Ale did an extraordinary job throughout the tasting and made the experience even more special by sharing curious and useful information that we could easily implement at home. I would definitely come back and try some of the other tasting experience they have, it makes the perfect gift! ",5,2023,04,16
105,Beer and cheese tasting experience hosted by Alejandro,"We had a fantastic experience tasting beer and cheeses, hosted by Alejandro. Excellent atmosphere with a man playing piano, and is a beautiful place to visit with friends, date or even alone. Highly recommend it and I will definitely be coming back! ",5,2023,04,16
105,Superb stay,"Angelo, front desk, provided superb service and made us feel welcome during our stay.  He was very considerate, helpful and a pleasure to work.  

Andre, the first person we met in the restaurant , makes you feel like this is home.  He has that charm coupled with efficiency that makes him outstanding .

To both of these gentlemen and their colleagues we say MAHALO.   We come from a tourist based state and  outstanding service should always be rewarded.  

We also want to mention Sam, Alfi and Melina -thank you - and to those whose names I failed to remember 

We flew 15 hours to get here and would do it again just to see these wonderful people.  The hotel property is lovely; the people make the stay fantastic.  

A hui hou and Aloha!

105,"The Gin & Tonic Experience, you will love it!","Delighted. We had a Gin & Tonic Experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair and it was just amazing. The vibe is perfect for the occasion, the decoration, illumination and the sound of the live piano makes it special. Alejandro patiently and marvelously took us both through the world of Gin, explaining all in detail and ultimately making the experience memorable. What to say about the Gin itself? We tasted 4 top brands, which we absolutely loved. I can’t stop talking about it to my friends, I can definitely recommend it.",5,2023,04,13
105,Luxury in Mayfair,"We decided to treat ourselves for our wedding anniversary and booked this hotel after seeing the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. First impressions were very good. It’s tucked away in a quiet part of Mayfair but a short walk to all the main areas that surround it. We arrived about an hour before check in so decided to go for a walk in the sunshine. The receptionist said she would email us when the room was ready. We never received an email though which was not what we expected from a top end hotel. 

It never seemed busy in the hotel and it had a nice quiet calmness about it. The room was a fair size for a London hotel. The bathroom was a decent size but beware if you’re over 6 foot tall you won’t fit under the shower head in the bath! Breakfast was very nice although we were disappointed to be told to hurry up with our order as the kitchen was closing at 10.30 when we arrived for breakfast at 10.15. We were also disappointed that the tables around us were being cleaned and relaid for lunch whilst we had our breakfast. Not very relaxing!

On our first night returning to the hotel after a day out we thought we’d enjoy a nice drink in the bar. Whist the bar area is nice and intimate with good seating areas it was spoilt by the piano player. He was playing far too loud for the size of the bar and we could hardly hear ourselves speak. 

Overall, we enjoyed a nice weekend away, but I personally think there are one or two things that I feel could be improved upon for such a prestigious hotel.",4,2023,04,12
105,"Best place to stay in London, I guarantee","What an amazing hotel this is. I have been traveling all over the world, but I dare say that this has been the nicest, friendliest, most pleasant stay I have ever had. All staff, no exceptions, are extremely helpfull and nice. Breakfast and lunch were amazing, a drink in the bar is an abolsute pleasure. The room is a bit small but has everything you might need. I would go here every single visit I make to London. And also goot to mention: it is really quiet, even though it's in the middle of Mayfair. To all staff: thanks so very much!!",5,2023,04,11
105,Would recommend,"Expensive - but so worth it!

Room - I booked a solo room. It came with a double bed. Beautifully decorated comfortable bed. The room was small, but perfect for a solo traveler. Would be fine for two if you’re not spending much time in the room. There were little Easter eggs on my pillow! I was attending a wedding and left a glass of water from the bathroom glasses by my bed in readiness for my return, while I was out the room was straightened up and a fresh drinking glass and bottle of water was placed next to the glass I had filled. A small thoughtful touch!

Staff - amazing! Everyone was so friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Even insisting on bringing my late night Deliveroo up to the room rather than me waiting for it downstairs.

Breakfast - delicious! Worth the extra money to include it in the stay

Location - central and easy to get to. A short walk from green park station

Check out is 12, which is great. I didn’t feel rushed in the morning.

I had a lovely stay.",5,2023,04,09
105,Fantastic Hotel for a genuine british experience,"We always prefer to stay at The Chesterfield in London, especially during Christmas- you are guaranteed to leave with the best Christmas spirit. The service is fantastic. I only wished they had not changed the brand of the toiletries in the hotel rooms. ",5,2023,04,05
105,Superb Experience!,"We planned a trip to a London to celebrate  a special birthday for my husband. Between us, we had visited London nine times previously. After our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair, we will never stay any place else when in London. Prior to our arrival we received multiple emails from the hotel staff inquiring about what they could do to make our stay enjoyable. Since it was important that my husband had a wonderful birthday, I took them up on their offer. The concierge arranged a car for us from Heathrow to the hotel and dinner reservations. Giada, the Front Office coordinator, was superb about arranging special birthday surprises for my husband and scheduling us to enjoy the great “Gin and Tonic Experience” at the hotel bar. Marilène the bartender did an excellent job of  guiding us through gin distilling and tasting of various popular gins with a variety of tonics. We enjoyed the experience so much we returned to the  scene of the crime (The Chesterfield Bar) the next night to confirm our favorite  G&T combinations.
The hotel is lovely, every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful, the meals we enjoyed there were superb. An added bonus was location, location, location.  We were in easy walking distance to outstanding restaurants. We were also very close to the Green Line Tube station which gave us very easy access to a number of places in London when we didn’t want to taxi or walk. Simply put this is a wonderful place to nest in London!",5,2023,04,04
105,Coming Back for sure!,"Great hotel, perfect location, delicious breakfast and the most amazing staff!
Thanks Heather and kitchen staff, we will always remember the to go boxes for our tours leaving very early in the morning you guys were amazing! ",5,2023,04,03
105,Great return visit!,I first stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my husband in 2019 and was excited to return on a recent trip with my mom to London. The rooms are comfortable/clean and everyone on the staff is so friendly. My favorite area is the bar. So cozy and the drinks are amazing! It was nice to relax there after a busy day of sightseeing. This is a hotel I would definitely return to again and again.,5,2023,04,03
105,Great location - tiny rooms,"Wonderful location, pleasant staff but rooms are super small. If you had a queen size bed instead of a king maybe it would not feel as tight. Nowhere to store luggage!!! Hard pillows. The requested option of a yoga mat was laughable when saw size of room. Bathroom very nice, shower great. Fast elevators. Quiet. ",4,2023,04,01
105,Exceptional,The Chesterfield was highly recommended so we had very high expectations and we both agree that they were exceeded. From arrival the staff went out of their way to be helpful and to make us feel at home. All the staff were wonderful with our toddler who became particularly fond of Jozsef and Luigi. Giada on reception couldn’t do enough to make our birthday week extra special. This was our first stay at The Chesterfield and we are hoping it will be the first of many. Thank you chesterfield team,5,2023,04,01
105,Exceptional,"My husband and I had the best time ever in this stunning hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated so kindly from the outstanding and genuine staff. We had a very smooth check in, by Saffron, incredibly informative and very professional young lady, who really made our stay so memorable (( thank you Saffron))
The hotel throughout is absolutely spotless and every staff member greeted us with a smile and greeted us warmly. Our bedroom was faultless with a wonderful coffee machine and a luxurious bed…and like the rest of the hotel…spotlessly clean. The breakfast was also first class, with really kind and helpful staff, who were so willing to help and add to our incredibly enjoyable stay. Thank you so much The Mayfair Chesterfield Hotel, for an outstanding stay, with the best staff, we have already booked to come back!

105,Location and sleeping perfection in London,"My husband our European holiday at The Chesterfield Mayfair and couldn’t have been happier.  In particular, the bed was sublime! Like sleeping in a cloud and the towels were large and fluffy.  Perfect location for exploring London and can I just mention Tamarind Restaurant just around the corner for service and contemporary Indian food?",5,2023,03,28
105,Perfect place to stay!,The Chesterfield Mayfair is a lovely hotel in a perfect location.  My room was beautiful and the staff was outstanding!  Their bar was very cozy with a piano player every evening.  I would definitely stay their again.,5,2023,03,26
105,Incredible Service,"Absolutely amazing day of Afternoon Tea and the Gin Experience
Lilliana and Caitlin literally couldn’t do enough for us with the Afternoon Tea, we had many allergies to cater for, and the staff were incredible. 
Alejandro was on another level with the Gin Experience. His knowledge and background of Gin was fantastic and we learnt so amazing facts. We were running late and yet he still didn’t rush us. We were made to feel like a million dollars. 
We are already planning a return trip for more afternoon tea and the rum experience. 
Fantastic afternoon all around. 
Thank you to everyone who made our day so special",5,2023,03,25
105,Excellent stay for us and our dog ,"Enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield hotel in Mayfair , our small dog was well taken care of , a bed / bowls and treats for his arrival .
Our room was very comfortable , loved the fact that the toiletries were in large dispensers - very environmentally friendly . 
The tea / coffee set , the milk was in small milk bottles instead of the little cartons that our usually difficult to open .
The staff were very friendly and helpful .
The breakfast was superb and set us up for the day .
I agreed to £15 being added as a gratuity for front of house staff . Didn’t reliase until I got home that I had agreed to £15 each day £45 total . I will be aware the next time .
Loved the hospitality , thank you . ",5,2023,03,24
105,Nice enough but too many niggling issues to feel quite as special as we would expect from this brand,"Our first visit to a Red Carnation Hotel since COVID and, whilst the staff were professional and the service was good, the overall stay wasn’t without its disappointments on this occasion.

Pros 
Good location 
Decent room
Professional & helpful staff

Cons 
Errors on breakfast order on all three mornings
Food at both breakfast & dinner not served on hot plates & consequently never really hot enough
There is a new policy of adding a £15 a day service charge but this is in addition to a 12.5% service surcharge on all food & drinks - it is discretionary but the daily charge is not something we’ve come across elsewhere. 
Our main disappointment was the hotels approach to my wife’s mollusc allergy which we hadn’t anticipated would result in the hotel refusing to serve her any fish whatsoever unless she signed a disclaimer! She has had the allergy for almost 40 years but it has never previously been suggested by any other establishment - including several Red Carnation Hotels - that they are uncomfortable serving her any fish dish that doesn’t contain molluscs. We actually felt sorry for the Restaurant Manager as he had managed to upset the only two guests in the restaurant but I have to say he was very apologetic and professional. 
If this is a group wide policy it probably needs further consideration as we would be unlikely to stay again.",4,2023,03,22
105,Staff and breakfasts were tops!  ,"The staff members were most courteous and professional. Being from the States I had some old currency which one of the members readily exchanged from his personal wallet. 

The included breakfasts were fabulous! The very berry pancakes were absolutely delicious.  The location was superb.  

The pianist in the cozy bar lounge was an added treat.  ",5,2023,03,21
105,Wonderful Staff,"The staff at Chesterfield Mayfield were wonderful.  We were there with 3 kids (ages 5-11) and they were very kind and made the stay a great experience for all. They had a photo treasure hunt for the kids. Of course, the rooms were great as well.",5,2023,03,20
105,First class stay,"Just completed another 3 night stay and have to say everything was faultless as usual. I’ve the years we have become regular visitors quite honestly due to the sheer friendliness and professionalism of all staff. From the moment you check in, you are made to feel special and over the years we feel like part of the family. It’s difficult to single out any member of staff as all are fantastic, but maybe Namrata in the bar should be mentioned for her thoughtfulness and attention to detail. We’ll definitely be back!!",5,2023,03,20
105,Delightful afternoon tea,"I came to the Hotel with my family for afternoon tea to celebrate our mothers birthday.  It was such a wonderful experience the team were all very attentive displaying true hospitality.  

Our waiter was Rafal and he really was first class.  

My 12 year old daughter is already planning her next trip around her birthday in July!

We had to do a lot of walking around London after to increase our steps due to the second round of sandwiches we had to order as the food was delicious so hats off to the chef !

105,You rescued our vacation!,"We booked a week in Europe May 2022 on a whim after finding cheap flights.  Three days in Amsterdam followed by three days in London then back to Amsterdam and home.  I did my due diligence, but the first three days in Amsterdam were spent in a room that had spirits; well let's just say low.  We were a bit beaten down and bruised when we arrived at the Chesterfield Sunday March 12.  The minute we walked through the lobby we knew things had turned around.  The entire property just exhudes charm and class.  The staff were attentive and friendly.  The room was perfect and the location has got to be among the best in London.  I can't say enough about how grateful we are, not just for a wonderful stay but for also rescuing the vacation.  Within hours moods were lifted and we finally started doing what we came to do - relax and have fun.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Chesterfield to anybody going to London.  We will be forever grateful for the memories you helped make.  I still can't believe we didn't pay even more for such a unique experience.  Great job all around!",5,2023,03,17
105,Fabulous experience.  Great Staff. Very good location.,This hotel h as the most accommodating and wonderful staff.  It is a true British experience.

105,A WOW experience,"Fabulous, incredible or wow just wouldn't cover it!  The moment you arrive you are made to feel pampered.  The room, bar and restaurant amazing.  Regarding the bar, you must try the Gin tasting!  The staff, another WOW!  I wanted to bring them all home with us.  Saffron made our stay especially memorable.  She and Jake took customer service to the next level.  These folks have made it impossible for us to stay anywhere else next time we are in London.  Try them!",5,2023,03,15
105,Awesome,"Second time I stayed here and surely not the last one.
I really had an excellent stay, everyone is so helpful, friendly and professional.  They make everything to make you feel special.  I am certainly planning to come back later on the year to celebrate my 50th birthday in style.  

The rooms are comfortable, cocktails at the bar are divine, and I just loved the way the staff took care of me and my dietary needs (not always easy)  for a very special  breakfast.  They are awesome! ",5,2023,03,14

105,Gin tasting experience,"Alejandro was an excellent connoisseur, and taught us everything about gin and how to taste spirits along with some very fun facts. Recommend it for any one with time to spare. Had an excellent time! :)",5,2023,03,11
105,Best TLC,"After straining my back, I inquired if the front desk might have some ibuprofen.  While they were not allowed to dispense medication, Jasmine and the housekeeping staff sent up a tray with green tea (known for its anti-inflammatory properties) a bath bomb, and the cutest, most comforting hot water bottle I've ever seen.  Along with a very thoughtful note.  Above and beyond for sure!  I'll never forget the care and kindness I received from the staff at the Chesterton Mayfield.",5,2023,03,09
105,Our Perfect Wedding Anniversay Treat!,My husband and I have just returned home after spending a perfect Wedding Anniversary London break at The Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair. Heather and her team on Reception were so welcoming and offered us the Music Room for our stay..comfortable and quirky! The bed linen is of the finest quality and the towels are huge and fluffy...perfect. I'm sure those breakfast eggs were Burford Browns...large orange yolks cooked just so and the sausages and bacon of the finest quality! Keep up the good work guys!,5,2023,03,09
105,Wonderful London stay,"This lovely, comfortable hotel is in an excellent and quiet section of Mayfair. Minutes walk from shopping and dining.

Reception staff snd concierge very helpful and friendly",5,2023,03,06
105,Mayfair gem with simply wonderful service,"Had to write a review for the Chesterfield as it is an old school gem. The hotel has a feel of grandeur but in a way that seems effortless. The rooms are classy and immaculately clean. They also have everything you need in the room, iron, tea, coffee, dressing gowns. It really felt like someone had thought about the guests stay.
The service of the staff is the best I have ever experienced. They really seem to care, everything is done with a smile and speed. They say they are a family run hotel and that ethos permeated the hotel and its service. Live music in the bar, wonderful food in the restaurant and room service. The club sandwich was especially good.
I can't think of anything I didn't enjoy. Would highly recommend as it is yards from Berkeley Square and Green Park. Absolutely brilliant ",5,2023,03,03
105,Fantastic Experience ,The staff was AMAZING. they helped with taxis and gave drink tickets etc. VERY accommodating and so nice. The breakfast was delicious and the food at the bar was great too.

As soon as I entered I could see the attention to detail,  hotel is beautifully designed. The room was also nice and clean. 
 From the front desk, Jasmine and Nicole were amazing and made us feel comfortable straight away.
 
Service was impeccable, from alejandro in the bar (and his amazing cocktails) to Caitlyn and Roberto in the restaurant. 

Would definitly come back again!",5,2023,02,27
105,Perfect Getaway for Mom with Tween & Teen Daughters!,The gorgeous and luxurious junior suite was perfect for me and my 11yo & 14yo daughters. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They even helped me to celebrate my daughter's birthday! The location was perfect for safe & easy walks to shops and restaurants. An easy stroll to St James Park and Buckingham Palace.

105,Fabulous,"Lovely staff, with outstanding service, and its in a great location. Rooms are lovely and quiet and nicely decorated , we had a very comfortable stay. Would highly recommend and we will definitely book again ",5,2023,02,26
105,An easy choice every time.,"It’s personal !

I mean staff remembered last time we were here the kids were smaller and loved a particular candy served at afternoon tea - they had them ready in our room with a kind note. 

The breakfast staff are exceptional knowing exactly when to give you anything you want, and when to leave you to a snoozy breakfast. 

This place is quiet and exclusive - you get 5x the quality you pay for. 

I stayed the first time in 2003, then 2015, and when choosing where to stay for two weeks in 2023, this was an easy first choice.",5,2023,02,23
105,"Fantastic value, great location, can't fault it.","The staff were all incredibly friendly and welcoming with a warmth that felt true. The breakfast was one of the best we've had - superb sausages, black pudding, excellent hashbrowns and the scrambled eggs were phenomenally good, plus there was no issue with having an extra coffee or pastry, whatever you wanted, they provided.

The rooms were nicely decorated with a huge comfortable bed and two deep pillows. We didn't eat there, but in the evening they had an excellent pianist in the bar until midnight who was a joy to listen to whilst relaxing.  Would happily return in a moment.

The location too was fantastic with a taxi only a moment's wait at any time of day, or you could walk very easily - only 7 minutes to Leicester Square.",5,2023,02,22
105,Gem of a Hotel in Mayfair,"What a wonderful hotel. The staff was amazing down to the piano player in the bar. The doormen knew our names. The location is close (walking distance) to everything in central London. The rooms are small, but certainly large enough for a couple. Going to miss it.",5,2023,02,22
105,First Class Service,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for our First Wedding Anniversary and we’re blown away by all the little touches that made our stay memorable. 
Turning down of the beds

105,"Lovely hotel with outstandingly helpful, friendly staff","My new favourite hotel in London. The staff are exceptional, from the reservations team, to the front desk, to the bar staff, to the restaurant. I booked a room for a friend from out of town as part of her Christmas present. The room was on the small side but prettily furnished and full of thoughtful touches such as a night light in the bathroom. She also appreciated the 24-hour room service. She has complex dietary requirements and the restaurant staff at breakfast took fantastically good care of her. It's the service that really makes the Chesterfield stand out - all the staff we met were memorably warm, friendly and helpful. Many thanks to you all and looking forward to returning! ",5,2023,02,20
105,Everything was perfect,"What a gem in the heart of London! The location could not be better. Very chic and quite, but walking distance from major tourist attractions and shopping, as well as 5min from public transport. The room (jungle suite) was spacious and the treats in the afternoon was a very nice surprise. Breakfast was a la carte with very good selection and very tasty. We will definitely stay there again when back in the city.",5,2023,02,20
105,A home away from home...,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for 2 weeks, while having day-surgery. The luxurious double-room was beautiful and bigger than I expected. The food & amenities were of very high quality and the staff was of even higher quality, they are what makes this hotel's soul!  I especially wish to thank Andrej and his team of colleagues: Violeta, Wassim, Joseph, Musah, Mustafa, Jake, Paulo, Sarolta, Ellen, Istvan, Marion, Luigi & co for always walking that extra mile, to ensure that I had everything that I could possibly need and treating me like I was their personal guest. I hope of having the pleasure of staying at this amazing hotel again in the future...",5,2023,02,19
105,Stepping back in time,"THOROUGHLY enjoyed our three night stay at this wonderful, historic hotel.  I felt like I had stepped back into the 19th century with all the beautiful furnishings and ambiance.  The staff was amazing and very caring after a medical emergency derailed our plans.  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to London!",5,2023,02,19
105,Thank you,"This was our first visit to this hotel and although the room was decorated with far too many stripes the staff made up for this. From being welcomed at the door, reception, catering and the cleaning staff. They were all welcoming, attentive and friendly. Slavenia who was responsible for taking care of us at breakfast was a super star! Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2023,02,18
105,"Top notch service in a classy, convenient location","First time staying at this hotel, stayed 5 nights for work with my colleagues - lasting impression of top-notch service: from pre-arrival emails to arrange for custom requests, accommodation of our very early check-in request, post check-in room call, breakfast restaurant service, arranging fixed price black cab airport transfers on short notice and personalized post departure emails. Despite having a relatively small overall hotel size, the staffing strength feels robust and friendly throughout 24 hours of the day and night, across front door, front desk, restaurant and housekeeping. Sizeable rooms were stately yet had modern amenities including very comfortable bathrobes. Currently there is a tie up for complimentary usage of a nearby Fitness First gym. Excellent convenient location to multiple Tube lines, walking distance to many food & drink establishments but in a quiet stretch to allow for undisturbed rest. Only thing to note is that lifts are quite small sized so expect some time lag if multiple people are moving in/out with luggages. ",5,2023,02,18
105,Superb gem of a hotel in Mayfair,"From the moment we approached the Chesterfield we were greeted by the warm friendly smile of the door man, this continued as we checked in. I can honestly say  that every single member of the team was so courteous, helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. It would  be unfair to single any one person as a stand out member of the team, every one of them gets our highest praise.  The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, very traditional which we love and spotlessly clean, all the communal area are very warm and welcoming and in an ideal location.   We had a superior king room which was beautiful, the bed was probably the most comfiest hotel bed I've ever slept in and there have been a few. We loved all the extras - the well-stocked hospitality tray, sumptuous towels, dressing gowns and slippers.
Our stay was to belatedly celebrate our Golden Wedding anniversary and the hotel staff thoroughly spoilt us and made our stay so memorable. We  had breakfast, which was absolutely beautiful the choice was amazing, making choosing so difficult. No buffet breakfasts at the Chesterfield and such lovely personal service. It was our first visit but will certainly not be our last and I would highly recommend to all our friends and family. This hotel deserves 5*. Thank you so much Chesterfield team for making our stay so special.",5,2023,02,17
105,Perfect Valentines Treat,Absolutely fabulous experience and the staff couldnt do enough for us. Perfect for Valentines Day and any visit to London - will definitely be returning. Food and service in the restaurant was excellent too.,5,2023,02,17
105,Unforgettable  Afternoon tea experience,"What a wonderful visit! We were greeted by Jozef and Musah who were both very friendly and welcoming. Without Jozef help we would have missed our afternoon tea slot, as he went the extra mile and helped us find parking just in time. The afternoon tea was delicious and our children throughly enjoyed everything on the menu. Highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back again! The original Simms sweet cart at the end was a bonus and a big hit with the kids. Thanks once again to Jozef and the rest of the hotel staff for their warm welcome, wonderful food and unforgettable afternoon tea experience - we cannot wait to be back again!",5,2023,02,15
105,"Good hotel, great staff","Spent a night at the chesterfield Mayfair..
Room no 426 is beautiful (I just wish the books were real ) and bed is very comfy which is a problem because it makes you want to never leave the room…
I was celebrating an early birthday so the staff arranged a very lovely and thoughtful surprise for me in the room, as you can see in the pictures.
Breakfast was great with an attentive staff and a big range of options to choose from.
Very smooth check in and check out.
All in all a great experience.
Thank you Heather, Jasmine, Ellen, Joseph, Saffron and Glenda for your service.
Most of all a big thank you to Maya for making it all happen!
Will definitely recommend.",5,2023,02,15
105,"Classic, old school luxury boutique hotel","We arrived here the day after the Queen died.  We could hear the cannons firing the 96 gun salute in very nearby Hyde Park.  Our second time in this hotel.  Just outstanding. Their restaurant has good food, even though Britain isn't really known for that.  Terrific location.  Try the very gourmet Tamarind restaurant very convenient walk nearby.",5,2023,02,13
105,Absolutely wonderful!!,"What a wonderful hotel!! Our experience was 5 stars right from our arrival with the fabulous Musah greeting us and a hot pot of tea while we checked in with Maya who was a wealth of knowledge.  Rooms were just beautiful and the extra little touches like beautiful shortbread biscuits and nightly turn down service made for an exceptional stay. Every staff member we spoke with was truly wonderful, and their recommendations for dinner were top notch! We absolutely will be back!",5,2023,02,13
105,Wonderful Experience!,My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for the first leg of our honeymoon and we had a wonderful experience. The hotel is very quaint and cozy and we loved our stay. The staff was incredibly accommodating and made our stay all the more wonderful. Maya gave us some fantastic local bar recommendations and made our jet-lagged check in experience super smooth! Ellen was also a great help during our checkout! I cannot recommend this hotel enough if you’re looking for a place to stay in London!,5,2023,02,10
105,As wonderful as ever,"This was our first visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair since the pandemic.  We were very happy to find it as comfortable and beautiful as ever.  Our room, the Curzon Suite, was beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  The staff one usually encounters - the concierge, the front desk people, the porters and the dining room servers, were all friendly, efficient and helpful.  We also had the pleasure of interacting with Tony from the maintenance staff.  The wifi in our room was not working properly when we checked in.  It turned out that the solution was somewhat complicated, and Tony stuck with it until the wifi was perfect.  Like all of his colleagues he was friendly and efficient.  We look forward to our next visit to the Chesterfield.",5,2023,02,08
105,"Chesterfield Mayfair - small boutique hotel in Mayfair, central London","We had wonderful service from Cosmin who met us at the front door upon arrival. He was so very helpful with answering questions, taking care of our bags and just being so friendly! After a long flight over from the US it was so nice to be met by Cosmin!",5,2023,02,07
105,Even better,"We returned to our favorite London hotel after a pandemic hiatus to find it even better than before. We celebrated our 56th wedding anniversary among the wonderful staff of the Chesterfield from doorman,front desk, concierge, restaurant staff. Our junior suite was comfortable even having two bathrooms. And oh that location! It is a short block to Shepherds Market, very close to the Green Park underground. Mayfair, Bond St, Chelsea, Piccadilly, West End, Parliament all walking distance. Great stay",5,2023,02,06
105,Please visit,Nice extensive choices on menu & same goes with drinks selection. Portion can be a bit better considering the price but overall its delicious. Clean & spotless for a medium sized family will come again for sure in the future.,4,2023,02,06
105,Sweetie Joy!,"Came for the sweet afternoon tea. 

The service was exceptional at all points. 

We loved the fact that sandwiches were made fresh and we were able to have some items removed. We’ve been to many afternoon teas and so often the attitude is you’ll get what you’re given so this was a pleasant surprise.

The decor and layout was fun and the theme interesting. Sitting in the conservatory was a joy and it did not feel like you were too near neighbours even though the tables are close together. 

The welcome drink was quirky and the food plentiful - you could also ask for more of anything although note you originally get one of each item so splitting a macaroon is a little odd! 

I tried the fruit salad tea and it really did taste like fruit salad sweets. 

Scones were light and fluffy and fun to have a chocolate one. 

Provided box to bring things home as well so I enjoyed a slice of cake later in the week that was still fresh. 

Pick and mix for later was also fun! 

Overall, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is it is expensive really for sandwiches and cakes and there wasn’t really a stand out dessert. They were all perfectly pleasant but not outstanding which was a shame. Very very sweet and would not appeal to someone who was not very fond of sugar - even more than normal for an afternoon tea. 

Also, the price had gone up since booking / not by much and perfectly reasonable to do so, but the reminder email I received just before was the old price so I had expected that and it was c£5 more with service charge on the day. A small thing but still would be good to match automated emails to menus.",4,2023,02,03
105,Delightful find!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Our first time staying here but we have stayed in other hotels in London when we'd visit in November but our hotel we previously used had doubled their price for the exact same so we decided to look elsewhere. We chose The Chesterfield Mayfair as it was still in the same area and we got more for the same price and honestly, we're delighted that we stayed.
Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It's a warm welcome when you come in and for throughout your stay. 
Beds are comfy and rooms are just the size you need. Bathroom floors are heated as well as the bathroom mirror - shower pressure is fantastic.
While the street outside is very busy, there's little to no noise pollution in the room which is a massive plus!
Didn't get a chance to have dinner in the hotel restaurant but definitely plan to next time!
My ONLY this is that breakfast being served could be a little bit quicker but staff are very friendly and polite but that was the only thing.",5,2023,02,01

105,Amazing hotel and wonderful staff,We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful hotel in Mayfair. The staff were absolutely incredible we were made to feel so welcome. The added bonus being that we were able to bring our dog Alfred who was as spoilt (if not more so!) than us during the stay. The hotel is located in a quiet area but has great transport links. We will definitely be back to stay here again and will be recommending others to do so. Thank you so much for a magical stay. ,5,2023,01,25
105,Special weekend stay,I stayed here with my husband for two nights and our two children joined us for one night to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had such a lovely stay and were very well looked after. Breakfast each morning was delicious. We were able to reserve space in the beautiful bar on Sat eve for us and 6 friends to have pre dinner drinks which was fab! Our room was lovely and I had a hand written card with flowers waiting after our night out. Also a lovely guy (didn’t get his name) brought up a cake and sung to me in the doorway!! We will definitely stay here again - location is brilliant too! Thank you for making my 50th special!,5,2023,01,24
105,The beautiful Chesterfield!!,"We came for our 25th wedding anniversary and expected great things from the  Chesterfield.  They delivered!  It was pleasant from beginning to end with the staff always remembering our name and going out of their way to make things above par.  
 We particularly enjoyed Jake, the concierge.  He made sure we had a great time.  Made several bookings for us and even walked us 2 blocks to a restaurant to introduce us to the owners.  Above and beyond service!!
This is a smaller personal experience and well worth every penny!!",5,2023,01,24
105,An Unforgettable Birthday Stay!,"The staff was all friendly and welcoming and made you feel right at home and that nothing was too much trouble.

105,Amazing stay,"We were welcomed so warmly from all the staff at Chesterfield from the moment we walked in. We were greeted at the taxi, our bags were taken in with a smile. After a long flight, they made every effort to make us feel comfortable with tea and coffee while organising a room early. The building is beautiful, with original architecture and decor. The rooms are very clean and quiet, and the king bed very comfortable. We also enjoyed Breakfast, which was served in the resturant. The concierge was extremely helpful organising taxis and answering any questions we had about London. It is so rare to find service at such a high standard, thankyou for an amazing stay.",5,2023,01,23
105,Lovely experience ,"Lovely experience at the Chesterfield. Very helpful friendly staff. We wanted an old English, quaint style hotel to stay in for our anniversary rather than a modern contemporary one and that's exactly what we got. Perfect. ",5,2023,01,23

105,The best hotel in London with the BEST staff,"This was yet another amazing visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel! We received a very nice welcome from Mustafa who took our bags with a big smile leading us to the check in desk. Jasmine went to get us a welcome drink as soon as we mentioned our preference on check in, they work so well at making you feel like royalty.  Wasim came out to say hello and his warm demeanour was so lovely he knew us both by name. Slavena at breakfast: wow wow wow - she is beyond amazing my partner mentioned he liked marmite and she said she didn’t have any but was willing to go out of her way to go buy some- wow wow wow! The coffee at breakfast was so good, if you like your caffeine like me, you will be impressed with the coffee. We had dinner on butlers and said hello to Loris like he was an old friend - he looks exactly the same we last saw him years ago before the pandemic. Loris knows everything about wine and he is such a pleasure to converse with, what a lovely man - he took care of us as we enjoyed our evening meal. We had the fish & chips then the halibut. 
The room: we stayed in the African suite what as nice touch as I am from Africa, really well done beautifully decorated and housekeeping did an amazing job of cleaning our room during our stay. We felt like royalty it’s such a treat to stay here special thanks to Adam for assisting with making the booking so I could visit London to say goodbye to my niece before she heads to Australia.
This is probably the best hotel I have stayed in, we have stayed in many hotels around the world but this one takes the cup.",5,2023,01,19

105,Traditional British Hotel with Outstanding Hospitality,"I always stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair when traveling to London.  Though I hadn't been there a few years I was welcomed back as if I were family.  Everyone, from the bellmen, to the front desk, to the housekeeping staff treat you as if you are royalty.  I would especially like to mention the bellman Joszef, Ithan, Mousafa at the door, and Letitia at Reception for providing superior service.  The bar is lovely to sit in and safe and welcoming for women who travel alone and their drinks are superb.  Their afternoon tea is delightful.  I  happened to be there at Christmastime this year and it is so beautifully decorated for the holidays.  I look forward to when I can stay there next, hopefully soon!",5,2023,01,12
105,Worth visiting,"Very nice hotel , cozy a bit over priced however great location also the reception staff very helpful and nice and the people from room service and house keeping and cosmin and jasmine from the night shift all hard working people and very helpful :)",4,2023,01,10
105,"All the comforts of home, but just a tad more grand.","For me a hotel is not about location, but its hard too see how you could get better than this, its not about the building, even though this one is quite lovely and sumptuous, its about the people who run it on a daily basis.  In this category The Chesterfield scores very high indeed.  They were all so professional but personable and willing to engage in conversation with you.  Their personalities shone through.  I do hate it when a hotel instructs their staff to show professionalism by being a little distant and cold. 

We stayed from December 30th through to January 2nd and so saw the New Year in at the hotel.  The trio in the bar were fabulous, however the gentleman piano player on our last night was simply sublime.  Beautiful repertoire and delivered softly, which was just right for the space.

We ate in twice and each time the food was lovely and the service as you would wish it to be. 

If I was to make any negative comment and this is quite silly really, compared with Red Carnations Belgravia hotel, the Egerton House Hotel, the Christmas decorations were not as stunning, they lacked a little in the area of sparkle and glitz. 

Overall quite wonderful and will return.",5,2023,01,10
105,A 5* stay,"I recently enjoyed a fantastic one night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel and I would certainly recommended this hotel to anyone staying in London!

The location of the hotel is perfect for experiencing the very best of London as it's so close to the very best attractions, bars & restaurants. We visited both the bar and restaurant during our stay, enjoying great food, drink and service in both - I would strongly recommend ordering the Vineyard cocktail in the bar! My room, the 'Music Room' was comfortable with lots of space and amenities, whilst having the best bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel!

A special thank you to Nicole, Robert, Namrata & Heather for the wonderful and attentive service.",5,2023,01,09
105,"Excellent Hospitality, Detailed to Perfection","We stayed here for our 8th Anniversary and my partner and I agreed that this is the best hotel we’ve stayed so far, and that says a lot as we’ve been to many hotels around the world. The staff was excellent, food were great and the room we stayed in was beautiful. We spoke to a couple beside us in the restaurant and they called the hotel their home in London, and I clearly understand why, the friendliness, warmth and  attentiveness of the staff is incomparable! High respect for them! 🙌",5,2023,01,08
105,Always an enchanting experience,"We use to stay in this hotel every time we are in London( more or less once a year). Every time it’s an acknowledgment   of kindness of employees and waiters, of the wonderful and very tasty breakfast,of  the high quality of the pianists who play every evening . The hotel is located in one of the best neighbourhoods of the town, certainly the most useful for visiting museums, going shopping and walking in the parks.The rooms are comfortable and quiet. The only suggestion we would like to give is to pay more attention to the cleaning  of the rooms because it isn’t very accurate. Another little suggestion is to renew some of the furnitures and the lifts because they appear a little bit worn out by time.
Anyhow the hotel is highly recommended.",5,2023,01,08
105,Cheese and beer,Glenda was great and the experience  with cheese matching  beer was superb! It opened up a new “world” . It was like discovering beer and at the same time discovering cheese. The selection of different beers and the match with the suggested cheese was simply great. Thanks !!!,5,2023,01,06
105,Beer and Cheese,"Amazing experience! Cheese & Beer with Glenda, she was so entertaining and really, amazing selection of beer and cheese!
We also enjoyed delightful drinks with Alejandro and Carlos, definitely the best cocktails I have ever tried in my life",5,2023,01,06
105,Staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair was the best choice EVER!,"Heather was the key . . . she checked us in early on the morning of December 30th and advised that our room was ready, a superior twin!  Just lovely!  When we returned to our room on December 31st, she had place a sign in the room wishing us a ""Happy New Year!  And hoping that we were enjoying our Mother-Daughter trip and meeting up with my granddaughter"" (who's high school band was marching in the New Year's Day Parade).  How very thoughtful and special that was!  Also, the dining room made room for us on January 1st for a late dinner even though we didn't have reservations.  The nice young woman in the Terrace Bar came to check on us since the bar was full.  PLUS the central location of the hotel in the Mayfair neighborhood was perfect!   I am a retired Travel Agent and friends and family still ask me for recommendations when they travel.  Bravo! Chesterfield Mayfair, the best choice EVER!",5,2023,01,06
105,Just Keeps Getting Better and Better,"We stayed at our home away from home, this fabulous boutique hotel, over the holiday season.  This was our sixth or seventh stay, and the Chesterfield Mayfair continues to consistently deliver a standard of excellence for which it is known.  We were offered tea while we waited for our room, which was so welcome after a long international flight.  Welcome cookies, beautifully decorated and equally as delicious, arrived our first night.  The standard of cleanliness is second to none, the bedding was comfortable and luxurious, which made sleeping feel like we were in our own beds at home.  But what sets the Chesterfield apart is the staff and their attention to customer needs and wants. Letitia went out of her way to provide us with amenities perfectly suited to us and helped us book a stay during the Coronation.  The Chesterfield typically offers beer and gin tastings, but we wanted a wine and cheese tasting.  Loris exceeded our hopes.  He put together a well thought out cheese flight and wine flight, educated us on each item, and created a presentation that belonged in a magazine.  It truly was a memorable experience.  Each morning Catrin and her smile were there to greet us for breakfast seating, and she was warm, engaging, and set the tone for the day with her cheerful demeanor.  The people who worked the front door stood out in the rain to find us cabs, ensured our luggage was always where it needed to be, and they even stored a bag for us while we went to Paris for 3 days.  While we love London itself, it is staying at the Chesterfield that makes us keep coming back for more.  Totally fabulous in every way, evry time.",5,2023,01,04
105,I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London.,"What a wonderful hotel! I would never stay anywhere else in London. The staff are friendly, and the service superb. The hotel is small and the attention is personal. The dining room is lovely and the food is excellent. The rooms are well furnished and gracious.  The location is ideal for shopping, visiting museums, going to theatre and dining. In short, it’s just about perfect.",5,2023,01,02
105,Our booking was cancelled by the hotel so they could make more money!!,"On the 6th Oct 2022, I booked The Chesterfield Mayfair for 1 night (14th/15th Jan 2023) - 3 months before. For the price of £250.00 (1 night)

The terms of the booking (via Booking.com) was 

1) You'll pay when you stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.
2) You may cancel free of charge until 14 days before arrival. If you cancel in the 14 days before arrival, the cancellation fee will be the total price of the reservation. If you don’t show up, the no-show fee will be the total price of the reservation.

On the 28th of Dec 2022, I received a reminder email from Booking.com telling me, I have The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel booked for the 14th Jan 2022.

On the 29th Dec 2022 The Chesterfield Mayfair sent me an email saying ""Your reservation has been cancelled"" (I checked my inbox and between Oct and the Dec, there were no other emails from the The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel or Booking.com about this booking in Jan, just in case I missed something)

I was away on holiday in Dec, so only saw the ""cancellation"" email on the 1st of Jan 2023. After phoning the hotel and Booking.com, both said The Chesterfield Mayfair was not going to honour my booking or £250 price I booked at (back in Oct 2022)

So the only logical conclusion anyone can come to is, The Chesterfield Mayfair ""bumped"" my booking so they could make more money. The room now is £450.00 (80% markup)

Why offer the rooms at a price you are not going to honour?",1,2023,01,02
105,The Chesterfield: Superior Service and Accommodations,"Wonderfully elegant hotel with impeccable service. Jake the concierge was extremely attentive, with excellent follow-through. The food at the restaurant was superb. The doormen were also noteworthy for their friendliness and welcoming presence. The hotel’s emphasis on English manners and courtesy was much appreciated. Whimsical tea was very charming. Central location in a quaint area is very convenient. Overall, the Chesterfield was the perfect choice to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday in London. We certainly hope to return! ",5,2023,01,02
105,What a fabulous stay!,"We had a fabulous NYE stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  From arriving at the door of the hotel all the staff were friendly and welcoming and our receptionist Heather was particularly helpful.  Our room was comfortable, clean and quiet with everything we needed.  There was an excellent bar adjoining reception to relax in and enjoy the live music that evening. As we were going out with friends we weren’t able to enjoy the restaurant but will certainly stay at the hotel again so - next time!",5,2023,01,02
105,A Wonderful Visti,"The most comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on,  lots of fresh towels and fluffy bathrobes for myself and my teen grand daughter. Everyone on the staff was attentive to our needs and helpful. We loved it. Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair for a wonderful stay. ",5,2022,12,31
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair - Exceptional Stay,"We truly enjoyed our stat at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  From the moment we arrived, Jasmine took amazing care of us.  Offering us waters, and my 7 year old a hot chocolate and an activity.  
The breakfast that was included in our stay was amazing.  We also enjoyed a magical tea.  Specifically, Lucia and James (chef) were so helpful.  My mother has some eating restrictions and Lucia worked with her daily to write down things should could/could not eat and James was so amazing in preparing the food.

",5,2022,12,30
105,Would stay again,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and look forward to my next stay!
Pros
- Location - you can walk to most everything (especially if you enjoy shopping), and if you'd rather take the tube there are several lines easily accessible.  Very safe area.
- Rooms - very comfortable and clean!  My room was relatively quiet, but I am glad I brought my sound machine.  Tons of closet space, in-room temperature controls, robes, slippers, yoga mat (if you would like one), bottle of flat and sparkling water each day (and more if you ask).
- Bathroom - Large and well appointed.  Lovely toiletries (body wash, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, cotton pads, tissues).  
- Turn-down service was wonderful - I even got a stocking full of fun treats on Christmas Eve!  
- Restaurant and Bar - very good - food was lovely and drinks were quite good.  Room service also very fast.
- Service - This is where the chesterfield excels - service is absolutely amazing - from the lovely man at the front door, to the desk staff, to the waitors and waitresses.

Cons
- I asked for a taxi to the airport and there was a significant up-charge, I would find my own taxi in the future
- I asked for restaurant recommendations and did take one, which I wouldn't go to again.  I recognized several people from the hotel dining at the restaurant too.  
- No full length mirror, no usb ports

Pro/Con
- very traditional hotel, if this is not what you like, don't stay here
- beds are quite firm
- I didn't order included breakfast, and would recommend as it is just easier, coffee was excellent but took quite a long time and it was difficult to get more
- There is an optional 15 pound/day service charge - I prefer to tip cash so this was just different for me
- TV service went down a couple times during my stay, but nice selection of channels",5,2022,12,30
105,A memorable experience with the best staff in London.,"This is a charming, quintessentially British boutique hotel with an A+ staff. Perfectly located on a quiet street and within walking distance and/or Tube transport to most everything you would want to do in London. It’s an excellent value in the upscale Mayfair neighborhood. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our week-long stay here.",5,2022,12,30
105,Fabulous Christmas,"We checked in on Christmas Eve for three wonderful nights and Christmas Day in Mayfair. We brought our dog Elmo was us and he was treated liked royalty! It was so nice to stay somewhere truly dog friendly. The team looked after him on Christmas Eve whist we went to the Royal Albert Hall, and I have to say I was nervous about leaving him but I shouldn’t of worried as he was in great hands and all the team made such a fuss over him. They have a full pet menu for dinner and breakfast so we didn’t even need to bring food for him! It was so easy and fuss free and he was welcome in the bar and restaurant which made such a difference to us, to be able to share every moment with our puppy dog too. 
The hotel was styled so nicely for Christmas, the lobby had a hand made giant ginger bread house (a mini chesterfield hotel)along with a beautifully styled Christmas tree. And the restaurant and bar had beautiful natural looking garlands around it which was totally in keeping with the style of the hotel. The bar food and drinks were perfect and Christmas dinner was Devine and plenty of it! The whole Chesterfield team were so friendly and made the whole experience effortless. Like literally every member of the team we encountered were just so lovely and welcoming. Fabulous location, 5 min walk to regent street, Knightsbridge around the corner and Buckingham palace a stones throw away. But still feels really tucked away and peaceful at the same time. Thank you guys for the most magical Christmas!",5,2022,12,29
105,Lovely high tea experience,"There are many options to choose from. It was overwhelming. We picked Chesterfield Mayfair as it seemed the most family friendly and from two recommendations. 

Pro-
Slavena was very helpful. I have a dairy allergy and she helped me mix and match off the menu to get the best items. My little boy also got food on his sweater and she helped him get it off. Very king. 

The Vegan cakes were quite good. They offer a normal menu, Vegan, and Vegetarian. 

It is unlimited and we indulged in the smoked salmon sandwich. 

Lots of families here and for sure family friendly and welcomed the kids and did their best to make it fun

Thank you all.",5,2022,12,29
105,10/10 ,"An amazing family owned hotel, it was such a pleasure to spend time there with my kids. They made us feel absolutely at home and showered us with care and support… many many thanks to the whole team especially to Dearest Letitia… highly recommend it. The food was also absolutely delicious, the location is also the best of the best…🙏🏼🤍🤍🤍",5,2022,12,26
105,A return trip to Chesterfield Mayfair after far too long!,"This was our first return visit since pre-COVID, and we were absolutely delighted to be at the Chesterfield Mayfair again after such a long absence.. 

The experience was exemplary, as we have come to expect and enjoy. The service was friendly, professional and gracious as always, from the doormen to dining to housekeeping and everywhere else.  We enjoyed Butlers (the restaurant) and the Terrace Bar very much.

We very much enjoyed being at the Chesterfield Mayfair again, and look forward to returning to it in future trips to London.",5,2022,12,24
105,For those with money to burn,"Checked in at 3pm: all was courtesy and calm. Went to our room 206 which was in course housekeeping. Housekeeper happened to be nearby and intervened. We three went to reception and the same receptionist was all apologies: now room 203. Wife tearful. Considering the £850 cost, the room is smaller even than a Premier Inn. The Superior King room advertised on Trip Advisor shows bay window and larger room. Wife asked me how on earth can the prices be justified? She met with manager, obtained full refund, and we left. Oh, an upgrade was offered for which we were expected to pay.",1,2022,12,22
105,Best hotel in London!,"I have stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair on multiple occasions, and I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else! The location is ideal for walking or using public transport to get anywhere conveniently in London. The hotel is immaculate with rooms each decorated uniquely and so beautifully that I feel like I'm staying in a gorgeous home rather than a stuffy, generic hotel. Above all, the service is impeccable! Each time I stay there with my baby, the hotel has provided the most lovely cot with baby products and even an adorable dressing gown, slippers, and a stuffed animal for my infant. Every one of the staff members I've interacted with, from the doormen to reception personnel to dining room staff and housekeeping, has been beyond accommodating and eager to help. They seem genuinely happy and willing to do whatever is necessary to make my stay most comfortable. During my last stay, I also took advantage of the in-hotel breakfast, which was superb. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2022,12,21
105,Superb!,"We held our Dad's 100th birthday celebration at the Chesterfield Hotel.  Ninety people attended.  All the staff were magnificent, from preparation to the actual day.  Nothing was too much trouble and every detail was thought about, discussed and catered for.
On the day, everything ran like clockwork; the food was tasty and the service superb.  I am trying to find one criticism but I can't.
Thank you to the whole team for making our special occasion so memorable.
I would not hesitate in recommending this venue for the magnificent way it is managed.",5,2022,12,20
105,Another visit and it won't be our last,We really really like this hotel which is in a first class location. We haven't been back since before Covid so we were looking forward to our visit this week with friends. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the staff make you feel welcome and look after you so well. Special thanks to Maya on reception. The bar is a very comfortable place to have a drink with an excellent pianist to add to the ambiance. The breakfast was very good and it makes a change these days to be served rather than have a buffet service. We have already booked for our next stay in London.,5,2022,12,18
105,Pre Christmas visit,"Fantastic stay made extra special by jasmine,maya and Georgie.

Warm and welcoming throughout our stay, loved all the old English class the hotel offered and location was perfect! 
Will be returning for a stay in the future.
Level of standard as you would expect and more for a Mayfair hotel",5,2022,12,18
105,Such a disappointment,"The first room I was put in was above a bar/restaurant and the music sounded like I was in the bar/restaurant. The second room was much smaller, much dingier, and even noisier with all the air machinery at eye level with the room. Finally, I downgraded to a tiny room, which was quiet, but might as well have been at any Ibis. I found the manager extremely frustrating to communicate with on numerous levels. When a hotel markets itself as being luxurious and service oriented, guests should not be put in this position. Surely if I wanted to sleep above a noisy bar, it should have been pretty easy to find a room anywhere for 100 pounds. I would not stay at this hotel again but can't wait to get back to London. More
",2,2022,12,17
105,Wonderful place,"Fabulous place. I hosted an afternoon celebration for my wife's 50th and also to commemorate her surviving cancer (twice). They couldn't have done enough  to help us. The food was great, the room superb and it all went without any hitches which was lovely
Go, you won't regret it",5,2022,12,16
105,Boutique and grand at the same time. Wonderful staff.,"Boutique yet grand at the same time, the Chesterfield surprises you with a warm and inviting foyer, lots of character and charming staff. Every member of staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful and I can’t speak highly enough of them. The rooms are larger than your average UK hotel room and are very well appointed. The breakfast was fantastic - we went to the Wolseley one day for breakfast and the Chesterfield’s breakfast was far better. The Chesterfield terrace lounge was inviting and lovely for a hot chocolate after a long day with some of the best gingerbread I’ve ever had, sitting in comfortable winged lounge chairs listening to the piano player. It was a cosy place to return to after a cold winter walk through nearby Regent and Bond Street and you’re right on the doorstep to Soho with all its restaurants. Highly recommended. Have I mentioned how wonderful the staff were? From the doorman who greeted every day to the concierge who went out of his way to get us a restaurant booking, and the fabulous staff in the restaurant .. 5 Stars to all of you",5,2022,12,14
105,❤️ it,Everything was amazing.  The stuff was awesome the helpful and Cindy the breakfast was great we love it and . The room was good the bad was very comfortable and the size is great  .we are definitely come back  ,5,2022,12,14
105,"Quiet, efficient, polite and comfortable.  Fantastic!","This was our second stay at the Chesterfield and just as good, if not better than our previous stay earlier in the year.  The hotel was conveniently situated in a quiet area of Mayfair.  The staff are very friendly and polite and our room was very comfortable.",5,2022,12,14
105,Winter Wonderland Afternoon Tea @The Chesterfield,"We went to the winter version of the Chesterfield’s afternoon tea and we enjoyed it a lot! 

It felt very festive and warm from the decorations to the Christmas tea and champagne to the wonderful sandwiches, scones and pastries. Everything was truly delicious and my favourite was the Candied Orange and Mulled Wine slice, which simply melted in the mouth. Of course, we also picked up our sweets from Mr Simms’ Sweetshop before we left!

Thank you for a lovely and festive afternoon, Chesterfield Hotel.",5,2022,12,14
105,Excellent and highly recommended,"Excellent hotel - great location, excellent attentive staff and Luxurious throughout. 
We stayed for a couple of days and experienced both the restaurant for evening meal and breakfast which were delightful. The location of this hotel is perfect and the overall stay was exceptional",5,2022,12,14
105,Regal Visit 5*,"From the super smart, outgoing concierge upon arrival to the same happy smiley concierge at departure I had a wonderful stay at an exquisite Regal hotel. 

Check-in was smooth the room was beautiful, the decor, toiletries, bed, pillows etc…. And the food wow….was delicious absolutely gorgeous breakfast !  

We had beautiful cocktails great service lovely stuff really friendly …all wrapped up in a wonderful part of London would definitely recommend",5,2022,12,14
105,Fantastic hotel!,"My husband & I stayed here to celebrate my birthday. I did not disappoint. Fantastic hotel, ideally located.  The staff went above & beyond to make our stay special.  To receive an upgraded room & birthday cake made the whole experience perfect.  We will definitely return & thank you again!",5,2022,12,13
105,Chesterfield Winter Wonderland Afternoon Tea,We had a fabulous visit with our girls for the Winter Wonderland afternoon tea. With platefuls of food that you could refill as often as you liked and even some sweet treats to take home. Tanbir and Alfie are worth a particular mention- they were great with the girls and attentive throughout. Great customer service all round!,5,2022,12,12
105,WORST ROOM IN THE HOUSE,"WE WERE REALLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE CHESTERFIELD BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO PUT US IN A TINY ROOM (YOU COULD HARDLY WALK AROUND THE DOUBLE BED, AND HAD TO SQUEEZE BETWEEN THE SHOWER PARTITION AND THE WASH HAND BASIN TO GET INTO THE SHOWER/BATH TUB). BUT WORST OF ALL THE ROOM WAS SITUATED JUST ABOVE MAJOR VRV AIR HANDLING PALNT WHICH BUZZED AND HUMMED ALL NIGHT LONG. WE WERE THERE FOR ONE NIGHT. THEY DID GIVE US A 50% DISCOUNT BUT THATS NOT THE POINT IS IT ? WE WERE THERE FOR A COMFORABLE STAY.
THE STAFF WERE ALL VERY NICE THOIUGH AND BREAKFAST WAS GOOD.",2,2022,12,12
105,Great Experience,"Our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was great! From the moment you walk through the doors to check in you feel welcome. Nicole and Gyorgy were the first people we interacted with and they were so nice! We were in London for the first week of our Honeymoon and the staff went above and beyond to do special little things for us. It was my first time in London and one of the gifts that was left in our room next to some chocolates was a small guidebook to London. On another occasion they delivered some chocolate covered strawberries to the room. They were so thoughtful with each little thing they did for us. 

Our room was cozy and comfortable. The breakfast was really great and had a good amount of options. We made reservations during our stay for afternoon tea and dinner. The candy shop themed afternoon tea was cute, tea was good, and the desserts and scones were delicious. Dinner was actually one of our favorite meals in London. 

There were honestly so many great staff members that I should've taken notes on names because I cannot remember them all. Everyone we encountered in the Butlers restaurant to the bar to the reception desk was great! I do remember, Ellen was really nice when we were checking out and gave us a recommendation of a cool place to go in Edinburgh, where we were headed next. Overall we would definitely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again! ",5,2022,12,11
105,Excellent hotel. The best In London,"Excellent service from the moment we checked in until we checked out. We’ve stayed in a lot of hotels In London and this one is the best, Nicole at reception was a pleasure to deal with and the staff are all friendly and make you feel welcome. We will definitely come again.",5,2022,12,11
105,Chesterfield Mayfair is Amazing!,"WOW! This is the most amazing hotel. The staff is outstanding and go the extra mile for you. They love celebrating with you. The doormen were always willing to chat. Mufasa was a delight. Ellen, Jessica, and the rest of the front desk were wonderful. We enjoyed chatting with them. They went out of their way to make our stay so awesome. We traded American candy for British snacks with them! They helped celebrate my birthday with a small cake that was delicious. Breakfast was very good and the staff always made sure we had everything we needed. They have a nice tea service. Rooms were checked on and serviced twice daily. The location was nice~ quiet area but short walk to a tube station. Buckingham Place was a short wall away as well. We walked to Hyde Park to see the Winter Wonderland Christmas Market. I would not hesitate to book the hotel again!

",5,2022,12,11
105,Classic luxury hotel in Mayfair that sadly did not meat expectations.,"Classic, luxury hotel in Mayfair was what I was looking for and on first appearance it didn’t disappoint.  The Chesterfield has a lot of old school charm. We booked a suit due to there being 3 of us and the need for the extra bed in the room. The room had two bathrooms which when you are sharing with kids is ideal as they have there own bathrooms.  The room and in-fact the whole hotel were very clean.  the reception staff were very helpful when booking in was was quick, which was appreciated.

Our stay

Once we got to our room we noticed live music coming from somewhere close by, I assumed from a function. it was very noticeable in the room and if you were looking for an early night I would think a major problem for a guest. (When we got back latter the music had stopped)
 I also noticed there was only Decaf coffee capsules for our rooms coffee machine. I called down and they said this would be dealt with by housekeeping, I noticed later when we got back still no full caffeine capsules so asked at reception, eventually they had to admit they didn’t have any. They did offer to supply a coffee should I need one in the morning.
Going back to our evening we were heading out, but before hand at around 6pm my daughter and I went to the bar area, Unfortunately it was at full capacity with a number of tables saying reserved. It would have been helpful for the hotel to let us know we may have needed to or have the option to reserve a table in the bar? Because the bar was full we were told we could sit in the restaurant/conservatory, I asked what snacks were available but was then told we couldn’t order any snacks as you had to be in the bar area where they could look after you?? The bar looked a loverly area so it would have been nice as a guest to have been able to appreciate it and not be out sat elsewhere next to a large group and a couple having afternoon tea. We felt a little out of place. We then left to go into London.
On our return we did find a table in the bar later that evening and it was everything I expected, with live piano music and a great chilled atmosphere.
We went for breakfast at around 9.30 but were told the restaurant area was full and so we were put back in the same conservatory area. I ordered a espresso which seem to take along time to arrive as did the breakfast. (approx 25mins) while waiting for the breakfast to arrive another couple came and sat on the table next to us, but then about 5 minutes later one of the staff came over to them and said they were not happy that they had been sat out here so moved them into the restaurant area. that made us feel so special at that point??. This was meant to be a special treat for my daughter, getting to stay in London for the very first time in a fancy hotel as she put it. The sites of London at night at Christmas were a success. sadly the hotel did not manage deliver the same experience.",3,2022,12,11
105,Incredible stay,"WoW. After a long & complicated journey to London we arrived at The Chesterfield to be greeted as if we were distant friends! The reception from staff was warm & welcoming. In particular Jasmine, whom had helped with my booking, greeted us with a glass of champagne! The hotel reception is stunning with plenty of comfortable seating. Our bags were waiting in our room having dropped them before check in. 
The rooms are fresh, clean and the bed extremely comfortable. 24hr room service available. The Butlers Restaurant was exceptional with attentive staff and delicious food. The bar area, complete with pianist, was cosy and welcoming. Each morning we were greeted warmly with Mustapha (concierge extraordinaire) being attentive to our needs for taxis and suchlike. The small personal touches from the hand written note in our room to greeting us personally each day were wonderful. Location was perfect for sightseeing & shopping. 
This truly was an incredible memorable Christmas break and we will most definitely be back. 
5 stars all round",5,2022,12,10
105,Just Fabulous,"Absolutely lovely from start to finish. Room was quiet, clean and very comfortable. The staff were amazing. Great location. The food was  absolutely stunning. The bar was super cosy, and the drinks came with nibbles. The pianist was great. 
The only thing that could be improved was the menu prices on the website were not up to date. Overall, a real treat!",5,2022,12,09
105,Perfect Christmas Time Visit,"Our whole experience was over the top!  I was visiting from United States with my 3 adult daughters and the Chesterfield Mayfair made our Christmas trip extra special. It was my 3rd stay at this facility and  location is a definite plus .  Our rooms were clean and very comfortable. The on-site restaurant and cozy bar were perfect for us. The friendly, knowledgeable staff always went out of their way to help.   A wonderful visit.

105,Amazing hotel and incredible staff,"We stayed in the Philippe Suite which was absolutely amazing. Very spacious and comfortable. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were delighted to find a special note and cake waiting in our room.

Make sure you visit The Terrace Bar. The cocktails are delicious and the service is excellent.

The breakfast was also excellent, with a huge variety on the menu.

All the staff are very friendly and helpful especially on reception and the door.

Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2022,12,07
105,Lovely,"Our experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel was absolutely wonderful. The staff were very nice and pleasent. We also loved the hotel's design. The room is super nice and the bed very comfortable. The location is perfect; compared to other hotels we have stayed. We will definitely come back.

105,The Chesterfield Mayfair - personal service,"I am writing this review in a professional capacity as a Senior Director's assistant, praising the Hotel's staff for their efficieny and personal service.

I had couriered documents down to the Hotel for his arrival at the Hotel.  The Hotel had them in their possession ready to hand to him when he checked in. I emailed additional documents to Amy on Reception, and she printed them out and delivered them to his room personally.  
At all stages, Amy emailed to inform me of her actions to reassure me that everything was in order.  I emailed the Hotel's Manager Adam Lake to commend his staff for their professionalism and personal service.",5,2022,12,05
105,Great classic hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield mayfair hotel. The staff were very nice and pleasent. Always wanted to help. The hotel's design is very classic and the place has a good vibe. The breakfast was very good with great coffee! 
A special thank you to Maya from front desk.
We would love to come back. 
",5,2022,12,03
105,Outstanding warm friendly hotel,"A wonderful hotel.  We arrived early, and whilst we couldn't check in early (we didn't expect to) the front of house staff were super friendly and helpful.  Such a change from the normal business hotels that go to great lengths to tell you you are early and unwelcome!  We were given a nice coffee whilst our bags were stored. Our bags were in our room when we returned.  The rooms whilst smallish, had everything we needed - and a super comfortable bed and Sky tv!  After the theatre we had a lovey hot chocolate in the bar..very cosy and comfortable with a pianist playing.  Very atmospheric and almost homely.  Breakfast in the morning was really good - how nice to be served by friendly attentive staff and not chase round a buffet!  We couldn't select 'a single member of staff'...they were all outstanding.  My parents loved it and we will definitely return.  In the heart of Mayfair so a great location.  Thanks you!",5,2022,12,02
105,Top notch! Absolute best.,"This is how to stay in London. I am not sure what it is like to be royalty, but surely this is close. There isn’t a moment where we wanted for anything. The staff was polite, thoughtful, and ready for anything. Wake up from jet lag at an odd hour? They will get you a coffee. 
Find out your child is taking care of homework? They will send up some hot chocolate for “study fuel!” I can’t imagine a better experience at a hotel. I have been lucky enough to have wonderful experiences elsewhere, but those topped them all.  Thank you!",5,2022,12,02
105,Excellent staff and standards,"This hotel is in a great location in Mayfair, central London, close to shops and some nice restaurants. Staff are very welcoming and helpful, they go out of there way to help, a wheel broke off on my suitcase as it was being taken to the room, Tony from Maintenance appeared straightaway and took it to his workshop and fixed it back on, thats what I call service!",4,2022,11,29
105,Disappointing,"Our room was next to the lift and we had to endure a night of noise from a very poorly maintained lift. There was constant noise whenever the lift was used. Unfortunately that happened throughout the night! The response of the receptionist at our checkout was to inform us that she would make a note if it for our next stay to put us in a quiet room! Unbelievable, I was disgusted and appalled at her response! Hotel etiquette 101, the guests should get a good nights sleep! The Chesterfield failed miserably!",1,2022,11,29
105,Excellent hotel,We had a lovely stay on what was our second visit in this very central location. The hotel room was decorated in a timeless traditional style with a lovely bathroom that includes a bath which is a rarity these days in hotels. The breakfast was excellent with first class service. The hotel reception staff are extremely friendly and professional with a good concierge team. Housekeeping was thorough and most attentive. We definitely will stay here again.,5,2022,11,28
105,Where else to stay ?,"Our 5th visit. Never disappointed, always so happy to stay and so grateful to all the staff who make it home. Looking forward to our next visit.  Although my husband has his eye on the sunken table for the next big birthday ..we hope you all have a lovely Christmas and thank you.",5,2022,11,28
105,Beautiful hotel,Wonderful stay at this hotel! Would definitely stay again. Cosmin was super helpful in helping someone from out of the country navigate the city! Very sweet crew member! Loved the bar and restaurant as well! Great trip to London!,5,2022,11,27
105,"Magical, elegant, friendly!","My sister and I have been to London often and have stayed at some of the finest hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfield was a new experience for us, but we would definitely return. The hotel is elegant and cozy. The food — whether breakfast, dinner, bar fare, or room service — was delicious and varied. But the true beauty of our experience was interacting with the staff. What a team of fascinating professionals from all over the world! And when asked, generous in sharing their personal stories. We especially enjoyed our welcome from Luigi of Calabria who told us of meeting his Chinese wife at a pub near the hotel; Marlene from Brazil (and her beautiful hair and smile) caring for us in the bar; Venetian Loris who had the good taste to marry Polish princess Wioleta (with polylingual daughters Zosia and Ala); Jasmine with stories of Uganda and the Addis Ababa airport); Amy who was years in Dubai; the lovely Lucia who recalled every morning that I drink tea while my sister drinks coffee; and the young Romanian doorman practicing his presentation on career planning for his business and marketing class. So many others whose names we never learned. A hotel can be beautiful but cold and impersonal—it is the people who make the difference. We are “engagers” and loved that the wonderful people who staff the Chesterfield Mayfair were happy, when asked, to share their stories with us.  For the quintessential luxury experience, stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. For the opportunity to meet some fascinating people (who happen to work there) stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2022,11,27
105,Excellent cosy hotel with outstanding staff,We stay here regularly as the hotel staff are unrivalled in their professionalism and friendliness. I could like to mention Maya in reception and Namrata in the bar who always go the extra mile to make our stay special. But really all the staff without fail are outstanding,5,2022,11,27
105,Outstanding stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"I traveled to London for the first time in several years and researched hotels very carefully as I would be traveling solo.  I prefer smaller ""boutique"" properties and was especially attentive this time to a good, central location in a safe area.  It didn't take me long to focus on the Red Carnation hotel group, and then on the Chesterfield Mayfair.

Everything about the property was completely to my liking.  The room, while on the small side - as deliberately chosen by me - was immaculate and comfortable, including the well-appointed bathroom.  Service was uniformly and consistently excellent, personal, and caring across the board, from the front desk, to servers, housekeepers, doormen, etc.

One of the other reasons I chose this property was its full service restaurant and lounge. The meals I had at the hotel were very good - the standout was Dover Sole, for which they are known.  The lounge/bar was busy and fun - they have a piano player most evenings and he was excellent.  Wines by the glass offered a good selection and the bar offers all the classic cocktails and bar snacks to nibble.

The location also lived up to my expectations.  The Green Park tube station is about a five minutes walk away and many restaurants and shops are nearby, including at Shepherd Market which is literally around the corner, as well as Berkeley Square.  The neighborhood is charming, as one would expect for Mayfair, and I felt quite safe walking about. 

Five stars to the Chesterfield Mayfair!  Thanks to all there - I will be back!",5,2022,11,26
105,A fantastic stay,"Thanks so much to Chesterfield mayfair for a fantastic stay, all of the staff were lovely, especially Maya who checked us in and made our stay extra special. The room, food, drinks and service has been amazing and we can't wait to return.",5,2022,11,26
105,Comfortable Stay and a fantastic location,"We recently spent two weeks at the Chesterfield Hotel and have nothing but praise. 

The staff were all very inviting and welcoming. Heather was exceptional on our check in - making sure our room was speedily available and taking the time to give us a guide book to flip through as we waited in the comfortable bar after our long flight. 

Mustafa welcomed us every day with a smile and was ever helpful at catching a taxi for us. The central location made all theatres and restaurants a reasonable 10-15 pound trip away. 

The room was comfortable and fresh everyday. Bathroom was nice and roomy - not always a guarantee in London. The staff were also helpful in providing a fridge for us - very helpful for storing leftovers and drinks on a longer stay. 

The bar had a warm and intimate atmosphere - live piano each night was an excellent compliment to the great cocktails. 

Waking up one morning to find that the fresh Christmas decorations had been put out was especially beautiful. The fresh tree smelled amazing! 

Would definitely recommend. Excellent value for money, memorable staff and service, and a fantastic central location. ",5,2022,11,25
105,Fantastic Experience in Mayfair,"Not only is this a really nice hotel, the staff are all absolutely amazing. I've stayed in quite a few hotels and haven't come across people this enthusiastic, friendly and helpful. The rooms are decent but it's definitely the people that made this such a great stay. Thank you!",5,2022,11,24
105,Excellent hotel in the heart of Mayfair.,"This is an exceptional hotel in a wonderful location. Equally distanced between Bond Street and Green Park tube stations, it’s well positioned for theatres, restaurants and shopping! Breakfast is good , but it’s the staff that make it such a pleasant  to place to stay. Nothing is too much trouble and they’re all so friendly and helpful. Saffron and Jasmine were particularly helpful as was the wonderful doorman Mustafa. We can’t wait till our next visit!",5,2022,11,23
105,Amazing Hotel,"My best friend and I have a 4 nights stay London once a year so have stayed in many hotels in the city, The Chesterfield Mayfair is by far the best we have stayed in!

From the minute we arrived to our departure nothing was too much trouble, the staff are lovely and friendly and there was always a good morning/ afternoon, fresh milk for tea & coffee was delivered in a couple minutes and after 2 nights we had fresh bedding, which we have never had before. The beds  we super comfy and there was plenty of fresh towels in the bathroom  with robes & slippers. Breakfast in the morning was first class,all table service with everything cooked fresh to order and a wonderful selection. 

The hotel is in a fabulous local and is central to everything all within walking distance and Green Park tube just a 5 minute walk away, should you need it.

In all, this hotel made our trip all the more special this year and we will definitely be booking to stay again next year. 

Thank you.",5,2022,11,21
105,A treasure,"Had a wonderful stay at this charming, cosy and elegant hotel in the midst of Mayfair. It is so many details that makes it so special and superior. Entering The Chestrfield Mayfair, feels like walking into a beautiful scene in an old classic movie. The atmosphere is so good here, and the staff so attentive and friendly. We especially want to thank Heather for making our stay so special and memorable. Hope to be back:-)",5,2022,11,20
105,Cosy atmosphere and great staff. Great value too. ,We had a wonderful one night break. Everyone at the Chesterfield is so welcoming - from Mustafa on the door to Saffron on reception and Jasmine in the bar. Fabulous cocktails with complimentary snacks and great value breakfast. Our room was perfect for what we wanted. We will definitely be back. Many thanks to everyone for making us feel so at home and so welcome. ,5,2022,11,19
105,Perfect location - close to everything yet quiet,"If you are looking for a classic English style hotel close to Piccadilly, Oxford and Bond St and all kinds of fantastic restaurants, then you found it!
The staff is incredibly nice, from the cleaning staff to doormen to Jasmine at the reception we were constantly met with smiles and such helpful people. Will be back!",5,2022,11,16
105,Charming Chesterfield!!,"Where to start the praise? The Chesterfield is like 'coming home' for my husband and I!
Nothing is too much trouble in this beautiful hotel that never fails to give first class service in a lovely setting. The staff - all of them - are second to none! Letitia, Darren, the rest of the concierge team, the housekeeping team and the bar and catering teams are just brilliant.
They all go that extra mile to ensure that the entire stay at The Chesterfield is so very enjoyable.
The food is always very good. Breakfast is exceptional and served by lovely staff.
There is a real feeling of 'teamwork' here and it simply makes every stay really special.
Roll on our next visit.

Thank you all at The Chesterfield.",5,2022,11,15
105,Exceptional London hotel.,"My wife and I spent the weekend in London to attend the Remembrance Sunday memorial service, meeting up with old friends. 
The Chesterfield provided first class accommodation. We were upgraded to an Executive suite which proved to be probably the best hotel experience we have ever had. We have travelled extensively for business and pleasure and this hotel has the whole package. The staff are amazing, the room was immaculate with an incredibly large comfortable bed and the atmosphere in the place was comfortable and friendly. 
Central to most of what London has to offer this hotel will now be our go to place when visiting. 
Thankyou so much to everyone at the Chesterfield for making our stay so memorable. ",5,2022,11,15
105,The perfect birthday,"In which big chain hotel group do the staff personalise your stay based on your interests/ plans for London? The answer is none. This small boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair is perfection: I stayed in the beautiful Berkeley suite for my birthday celebrations/ to attend a concert - the towels were plush, linen was 1 million thread count, food was tasty and beautifully presented. What really stood out at The Chesterfield was the personal touches & family feeling throughout the hotel. The rooms are cosy and really beautifully maintained, each room is individually designed and everything is thought about. Went to a concert in Wembley only a few stops on the jubilee line meant an easy commute. A special thank you to Jasmine for the personalised card & cake based on the concert we were attending; this blew us away made my friends and i chuckle. Thank you so much.",5,2022,11,15
105,A home from home in the heart of London,"My wife and I have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel many times over the last ten years, but, because of the pandemic, we had not been been there for the last three.  On our recent stay at the beginning of November, we came as a family of five with our 20-month-old grandson, and occupied three rooms.  There have been changes because of the pandemic and a fair number of the staff are new, but the overall warm welcome is much the same, just as the founder Bea Tollman intended.  Anna Sebastian, the reception supervisor, was most helpful in resolving some of the questions we had regarding our rooms, and all those working at the front desk and in main lobby were very thoughtful and accommodating.  The challenges of staff shortages in the main dining room at breakfast were noticeable at the busiest times between 8 and 10, so, until these issues have been resolved, it is best to have breakfast before 8.  One of the things we really enjoyed in the past was the breakfast buffet, which has now been discontinued, no doubt because of the pandemic.  It would be very nice if this was re-introduced and could well help with the delays now experienced at breakfast.  The Chesterfield is very conveniently located in the heart of Mayfair, in easy reach of all the offerings of central London.  We recommend this hotel to all our friends.",4,2022,11,14
105,"Luxury, warmth and attention to detail!","I spent a lovely afternoon and evening at The Chesterfield. From the moment I walked in the door being greeted by Mustafa’s warm and welcoming smile I knew I was in for a 24 hour treat! Alberto checked us in and we headed up to our room where Jasmine had left birthday treats for my friend, the attention to detail was second to none! Popped down for the most delicious afternoon tea where Loris took such good care of and kept the smoked salmon and chicken mayonnaise sandwiches coming. Can’t recommend this slice of luxury in the middle of Mayfair more! Will definitely be back. ",5,2022,11,14
105,Incredible Stay!,"An unforgettable stay! The staff are so friendly and welcoming. I stayed for 3 nights and felt so at home in this beautiful and quaint hotel.
The room was likewise stunning and comfortable, with modern amenities. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great hotel in the heart of London.",5,2022,11,12
105,Beautiful hotel in wonderful part of the city,"The hotel was great, the staff was great, the food was great and the location was great. We really enjoyed our visit very much! Please be prepared for longer wait times in the restaurant than we are used to in the U.S. But the atmosphere was well worth it, and it just meant that we got up a little bit earlier for breakfast. Nice and relaxed. Will definitely return.",5,2022,11,10
105,Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"We booked the Chesterfield Mayfair for a five day London Celebration of our 30th anniversary after reading Trip Advisor reviews of dozens of London hotels. The CM fit our budget ($300-$400 USD per night) and averaged a rating of 4.5. We were not disappointed at all. While the hotel itself has a bit of a dated feel, it was clean, it was well-maintained, the room was plenty spacious for a downtown hotel, the shower pressure was strong, there were great food and bar options on-site, and the location was perfect for walking just about anywhere within 10-20 minutes  (Tube station, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, etc.). However, what made our stay most enjoyable was the fantastic staff. From the second we arrived at the front door to the moment we left, we were greeted by smiling, friendly staff who clearly took the customer-relations aspects of their jobs very seriously.  It is easy to overlook staff as an important part of a stay, but the CM staff absolutely made our trip special.  One small point of advice - the bed is rock-hard . . . which is apparently common in English hotels. Be sure to ask for a mattress cover if you prefer a softer sleep. We asked for one after the first night and slept like babies the rest of the trip. And if you love burgers and lobster, there is a great restaurant right around the corner called “Burgers and Lobster.”",5,2022,11,09
105,If You Want London Luxury...,"Stunning, from the moment you walk in. ""Luxury"" can be off-putting, but here it was very warm and welcoming, from the architecture and design to the very professional and friendly staff. We booked sight-unseen and without any recommendations to drawn from, and the place was literally better than we hoped for. The biggest surprise was the food. We knew it would be good, but this hotel makes it very difficult to explore London at dinner-time. We were a party of four, and I asked my waiter to order for me. We all had three courses, and everyone was thrilled. If you think, as I do, that Sole is usually the most boring thing on a menu, order the sole. Startling, how good it was. Very high marks also simply for the location. It was very easy to get anywhere from the Chesterfield. Do not expect ""fast"" food service at breakfast or at dinner. If you have a train to catch, leave yourself plenty of time for the meal. I don't consider this a criticism. This is just not a fast-food hotel. Likewise, don't expect huge rooms. This is old-school europe. Do expect all the little touches that make your stay special. For us, even the bed sheets became a topic of conversation. Everything was just fabulous. Can't wait to see London again, can't wait to stay at the Chesterfield again.",5,2022,11,09
105,My Chesterfield stay,"Thank you Letitia and your wonderful team.

On my tenth trip to the Chesterfield once again I was not disappointed. From the incredible staff and top class service they provide, to the little details that always make my stay feel special. I always love staying at the Chesterfield and I cannot wait to return.",5,2022,11,08
105,Weekend Stay,"We were both truly overwhelmed with the kindness and thoughtfulness you showed to my husband and I, after what has been a most horrific year. It was beyond truly heart-warming to see my husband relaxed and happy and to enjoy his birthday, which he seriously was not looking forward too without our daughter, this was made only possible by Nicole, Anna, Jasmine and the wonderful Mustafa, the happy doorman, but in essence everyone was amazing.

We have both, unanimously, agreed that we return to the Chesterfield in a heartbeat and hopefully soon.

 Keep doing what you all do so well 😊

Much love 

Annie & Ian Britton",5,2022,11,07
105,Luxury in Mayfair,"Wonderful location in upscale Mayfair. Close to the Tube and shopping. Lovely quiet street. Included in our reservation was dinner, afternoon tea, and daily breakfast.  All the meals we had were first rate. The Afternoon Tea was a highlight and very generous.  All staff were very accommodating and professional.  The only downside was the bed was a double and therefore a little too small for us. I would definitely stay here again, but opt for a bigger bed.",5,2022,11,05
105,Super Hotel,"We have stayed in lots of London hotels over the years and stumbled across this hotel last month. If you are looking for super and friendly service, where you are a guest and not a number then this is the hotel for you. It is well placed for the West End and if you book directly with the hotel I think you are likely to get a more recently decorated bedroom too. 
The piano bar is gorgeous and the pianist an absolute delight. 
Breakfast was great and the afternoon teas looked lovely.
A proper quaint small run ‘London’ hotel, could be in a movie.
We will be back.",5,2022,11,05
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair made our trip special!,"We have stayed at all the nicest Hotels around the world, but the The Chesterfield Mayfair stood out not only because of the beautiful hotel, but mostly because ALL of the staff was incredible nice.  From the doorman, to the bartenders in the pub to the maids.  Great location to many incredible restaurants, close to the Underground and right by Hyde Park and Green Park.  Highly recommend to anyone visiting London!",5,2022,11,04
105,Thoroughly enjoyed staying here,"Quaint, lovely hotel and thoroughly enjoyed all the English charm.  Nice area.  Did sit in the piano bar one evening but did not eat at the hotel.  Enjoyed the sherry in the lobby.  Quiet and comfortable but small rooms.  ",4,2022,11,04
105,Afternoon Tea,"Visited the property for Afternoon Tea with a friend. The service provided was immaculate. Felt like a proper English Afternoon tea. Tea selection was impressive as well. Tried the chocolate and fruit punch tea and got hooked on to the latter. The restaurant itself had that vintage look and was decorated very elegantly. Overall, a great experience. Will definitely visit again if I get the chance and opportunity to.",5,2022,11,04
105,Anniversary treat,We stayed in a suite as a treat for our anniversary which was absolutely beautiful. Everything was lovely and all the staff were very attentive and obliging. Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend.,5,2022,11,03
105,Afternoon Tea,"Came here for the Mr Simms Sweet Shop Afternoon Tea for my mums birthday. From the moment we walked in the staff were professional and friendly and the hotel had that ‘wow’ factor. The afternoon tea was delicious, plentiful and the options of unlimited tea (fruit salad tea was super tasty!) coffee, hot chocolate and even milkshakes were amazing. Food was brilliant quality and tasty, we could ask for more too should we want anything in addition to what we were originally served. The staff were brilliant, Rafal was superb. Even had a nice little birthday touch giving my mum a small teddy bear and candle in a muffin to blow out! We grabbed a bag of sweets on the way out too from a lovey selection of bon bons etc. Fantastic experience, would definitely do it again. One of the best afternoon teas we have experienced. Thank you!",5,2022,11,01
105,Unequalled service,"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so special at this beautiful old world boutique Hotel  in the heart of Mayfair. The staff throughout the hotel, including  the front of house, room services as well as the restaurant/bar area always made sure that we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. The quality of the food matched the service in the dining areas. The rooms were serviced and nothing was missed. A particular well done goes to Jozeph in the front for his friendliness, good humor and helpfulness.",5,2022,11,01
105,First visit,"Thank you for a wonderful stay. We stayed for just one night and were so impressed by the friendliness, attentiveness and professionalism of the staff. Our room was so comfortable and so clean. A beautiful hotel - we will definitely be back.",5,2022,10,30
105,Old School Charm,"We spend six wonderful nights at this classic British hotel in a junior suite that was just perfect for us!  The staff could not have been better, nor could have the accommodations!  Afternoon canapés were a nice touch!  Special mention to the evening pianist in the bar who was just superb as well as the doorman who always sent us off in the morning and greeted us back in the evenings with a smile! 5 Stars is not enough!!",5,2022,10,27
105,"Elegant lodging in Mayfair, London",Returning to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London after an enforced absence of three years felt like coming home to an elegant aristocrat's town house.  The rooms and the service have all been maintained to the highest standard.  Breakfast remains a highlight and we were pleased to see some of the same staff who even remembered us from prior visits.  We have to single out John Hudson's piano playing nightly in the Terrace Bar as an experience we enjoy over and over again.,5,2022,10,26
105,Excellent hotel.  I will be back.,"Excellent hotel. I will be back.  Great location, walking distance to Buckingham Palace.  Room was well-appointed and luxurious enough.  Breakfast is a-la-carte.  Afternoon tea is a nice experience.  Very nice experience.",5,2022,10,25
105,It's all about the customer service!,"This is my home away from home in London. It's a physically gorgeous little hotel, with tastefully appointed rooms and luxurious furnishings and linens. The food is excellent and the bar is open 24/7, along with room service, which is a wonderful thing for late arrivals. However, it's the customer service that truly sets it apart. From the front of house staff to the housekeepers, everyone is welcoming, good at their jobs and empowered to problem solve and address any request a guest might have. I have traveled extensively over the years and stayed in hundreds of properties and I can honestly say the Chesterfield Mayfair is my all time favorite. I have family in the UK an hour outside of London but I always make sure to end my trip with a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair before I head back to the US. ",5,2022,10,24
105,Well worth a visit,"Stayed Overnight, took in a show, the Hotel is underrated, everything was superb, the staff tendered to our every need, the room was spotless, but was getting ready for a bit of attention in certain areas, but don’t let this distract from the quality of the Hotel
Mr R Vaughan ",4,2022,10,24
105,Better than 5 Stars,"Wow I can honestly say my wife and I have stayed at many many hotels and can assure you the Chesterfield Mayfair is one of the best there is , it was our 30th wedding anniversary and from the moment we checked in until we checked out was absolutely 5 star service , I also have to mention one of the loveliest ladies I have had the pleasure of meeting and I will also write to the chesterfield Mayfair head office so they look after her because Letitia looked after us and made our stay so special went above and beyond to make sure that happened and it certainly was fantastic , thank you chesterfield Mayfair  and thank you Letitia we will be back very very soon x",5,2022,10,22
105,The best hotel,"I want to live here. As a cheapskate who also travels with her dog most of the time, my hotels tend to be a bit budget. Since I was solo in London for one night, I decided to splurge. It was so worth it.  The location is very convenient to restaurants, the underground, the parks and palaces. My room was small, but very comfortable and well appointed. The bed was great and I slept like a baby. However, it’s the staff that make this hotel. They are hands down the best I’ve ever encountered. They took care of every need (like my adapter issue) and were so kind and lovely. Special shout out to Maya at the front desk, all the doormen and the porters. I wish I lived closer as I’d stay again every time I need a little TLC. ",5,2022,10,19
105,Wonderful,"This hotel was an amazing into our European trip. The rooms and beds were comfortable, clean and well appointed. The location in Mayfair is quiet and also close walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The staff was helpful and courteous. The breakfast was delicious and offered many selections. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London.",5,2022,10,17
105,"Excellent service and beautiful, clean, well maintained hotel in the heart of London.","We stayed at the hotel for 10 days and had a fantastic experience there! The hotel was clean and beautiful. The service was wonderful.  The restaurant was excellent. The bar was amazing. Wonderful staff. Alejandro and Greta treated us with the best friendly service. We enjoyed getting to know them. The piano players were excellent. The concierge service was fabulous. Peter, Jake and Darren were so helpful getting us tickets, answering questions and helping us navigate this magnificent city. The bellmen and doormen were also so friendly and helped us find our way around with directions. We can’t say enough great things about this hotel experience. Very highly recommend this hotel and their staff!",5,2022,10,14
105,Amazing level of service and care,"This is a beautiful hotel in an amazing part of London. 

Every stay we have had there, the staff have made us feel like royalty and made sure we have everything we could possibly need or want.

The Head of events, Samantha, is a real shining light! She made sure our last stay was extra special with an upgrade to an unreal suite to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

I have stayed in lots of hotels around the world, but none have matched the Chesterfield and their staff...... If you didnt get it yet from this review... I HIGHLY recommend a stay.

We will be returning again very soon.

105,Wonderful ,"Amazing Hotel, wonderful stuff in the best spot in London. I would highly recommend this hotel, I was
very impressed with the rooms quality and the divine 
breakfast in the morning. I can’t wait to get back
this December, thank you so much. ",5,2022,10,12
105,I felt like Royalty!,"I felt like royalty!  Everything was perfect from the first minute.  The location is superbe, in Mayfair, one of the most exclusive areas of London.  I loved the easy access and the fact that you can walk to some of the best landmarks in London.  

The staff made us feel  really special, like if we were the most important guests in the Hotel.  Everything was taken care for.  

The room was very comfortable and all the little details added were just magnifique!

Breakfast was also great, not only for the menu and its fresh produce but also because of the detailed attention that everyone had towards us.

Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair and all the staff for making our stay so special !",5,2022,10,11

105,A very well appointed hotel in a great location,"We had a very easy stay at The Chesterfield London. With easy access to the Tube and walking distance to the sites of London - it is well located and represents very good value for money. A feature of the hotel for us was the cleanliness of the rooms and the cleanliness of the hotel in general.

105,A fantastic boutique hotel,"This beautiful hotel in the middle of a quiet neighborhood was perfect for our stay in London. The staff were amazingly attentive and the rooms were large and comfortable.  The hotel is close to the tube stop and in walking distance of shops and restaurants. We had a very early departure and the staff supplied us with wonderful pastries and coffee. In a time when customer service is often lacking, what a delight to experience this wonderful hotel! We will definitely stay here on our next trip to London.",5,2022,09,28
105,Afternoon tea,"We had a lovely afternoon at the chesterfield Mayfair in London. 
we had a free afternoon so decided, quite spontaneously, to treat ourselves to an afternoon tea at a posh hotel.
When ariving at the hotel we were greeted by the lovely gygorgy and jozsef  at the door and since we were early for our reservations, we were escorted to the cosy bar where we had some drinks and nibbles while waiting.
As for the afternoon tea, the afternoon tea at the chesterfield Mayfair is everything you'd expect from a proper afternoon tea in London. 
Settings and presentation are beautiful, cakes are colourful and unique in flavours, scones are fresh and warm, sandwiches  range from the ""simple""  cheese and cucumbers to the more sophisticated, very tasty, Roast chicken with grain mustard mayonnaise 
and nibbed almonds (our favourite!).
There is a huge variety of tea with options for other drinks such as hot chocolate and milkshakes AND you get to pick candy from the sweets cart to take home with you. Very nice touch :)

Lucia and Andrej were extremely friendly, professional and helpful and kept on checking on us, making sure we had everything we needed and then some. 
Thank you for a lovely afternoon. It was just perfect!

So, whether you are a tourist in London or you have guests you would like to impress or you're celebrating a birthday, I highly recommend the afternoon tea at the chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2022,09,28
105,A Gem in Mayfair!,"I am a obsessive reviewer and I make sure I choose the perfect place as I’m very particular about location, class, staff, etc.  
From my first communication with the staff on inquiries, I knew right away I made the right choice; friendly, responsive and had all the right answers.
The hotel is absolutely beautiful and classy.  The entire staff  are the most wonderful people with a smile each day.  Jonathan the doorman has the most infectious smile and genuinely a perfect gentleman!
Don’t hesitate as this is definitely the PERFECT PLACE!
Will certainly be back!",5,2022,09,25
105,Loved everything about it,"Fantastic ambiance matched with wonderful service from a professional, friendly and happy staff.
I couldn't have chosen a better place to stay in central London. My kids (young adults) first trip to the UK and they were just thrilled with the experience of staying at the Chesterfield. I will definitely stay there when next in London.",5,2022,09,22
105,Very posh and lovely,"Stunning entrance and welcoming staff who took care of our every need. We have come to London many times, this will now be our go to place to stay. We arrived well before check in, (came from US) but were able to get in our room early.  
When booking, highly recommend getting the option to have breakfast included. We didn't, but it was so good the first day, we gladly paid to eat there the second morning.",5,2022,09,21
105,"Great Experience - A place to feel safe, welcome and comfortable","First I would like to thank all the empolyées of this wonderful Hotel. For creating my first visit to London after 30years (I came here as a teenager last time with my mother and father both passed away in the meantime) unique and memorable. Feeling at home and welcome thank your presence. Thank you also for your understanding and helping with some questions and unclear things from myside. You managed perfectly and professional. 

I have a lot experience with 4 and 5 stars Hotels in Europe. Mostly Switzerland.
 I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair during the Queens funeral for 5 nights. The staff is extremly helpful and attentive.  I liked the possibility to be able to order high quality food for in room dining, which I finally didn't because of the many options of this wonderful city. The room that I had was very big and well furnished. Very comfortable beds, and I lovely pillows. Nice cottons and even a flower bouquet was placed in my room when I arrived. How thoughtful.

The Hotel lies in a quiet street, near all the pleasant atractions. I was by myself as a woman in my forties, and went a lot by foot, bus rarely underground, so that was ideal for me. For my last breakfast the employées succeded bringing me everything I wished efficiently to get to the airport on time
Even a taxi was waiting earlier than expectet. We had some misunderstandings, which the reception solved in a perfect way, as expected from a Hotel of this range.

This Hotel is unique, an older house with history and caracter. If you are seeking a place that is different from the big Hotels and has first class guests, as well as first class staff, tradition and values, this is the place I can recommend you to your heart. 
As I arrived at my real home back again today, I feel that I will return to the Chesterfield Mayfair. Next time with my husband and even our children.",4,2022,09,19

105,Excellent service,"From the front desk staff to the bellmen we felt welcomed and made comfortable. We were especially grateful for the doorman who arranged with a taxi driver to take us directly to Heathrow Airport on our departure. Although we only stayed for two days it started to feel like home when we saw the red awnings as we walked up the street.
Our corner room with twin beds was well decorated in a traditional style. The entire hotel was  traditionally styled but not fussy.
The bar was comfortable but rather expensive. My companion especially liked the Godfather drink.
The location is fantastic, so much within walking distance and yet quiet.",5,2022,09,19
105,Great location with Wonderful staff,We stayed in the Chesterfield to attend a wedding next door in the English Speaking Union.  The facilities were fine but the outstanding feature was the staff who to a person were friendly and genuinely helpful.  An excellent place to stay,5,2022,09,19

105,A True Gem: Comfort and Service Reign Supreme!,"If you are looking for a hotel experience that embraces all things British then I confidently recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair. Wow! I recently enjoyed a week long stay with my mother. It was incredible! Every staff member worked diligently to ensure a wonderful and memorable experience, executing their duties to the highest standard. All interactions were positive and helpful. We felt like we were among friends. From the decor to the food, this hotel embodies British culture. Their afternoon tea scones are hands down the best we ever had! Comfort reigns supreme here, making the Chesterfield name more than fitting. Its name though is a nod to its location and what an ideal spot it is -tucked beautifully in the heart of a bustling area with incredible attractions steps away. 
I recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel with absolute confidence! In all aspects, it is a gem!",5,2022,09,15
105,Fabulous stay,We stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a mini moon straight after our wedding. Great location and lovely hotel. Staff were excellent and very helpful.

105,Afternoon Tea,We attended the Mr. Sims afternoon tea at the Chesterfield.  It's in a gorgeous room - very garden like.  The theme of the tea was Mr Sims Sweetshop.  At the end of the tea you can pick three items for a candy bag at the Sweetshop cart.  It's so cute and the food was great.  Wonderful tea,5,2022,09,08

You get to choose some sweets at the end to what a lovely touch. Thank you for finishing off a great weekend in London.",5,2022,09,05
105,Wonderful hotel; great location.,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is an old style English hotel with all the fixings that you would expect to see in a movie;   Afternoon tea, piano bar, traditional furnishings.  But nothing is dated or worn out looking.  The rooms and bathroom are on the smallish size, but there’s plenty of counter space in the room and the bathroom. Also, the lighting in the bathroom is really good (a pet peeve I have with modern hotels that try to be fancy instead of useful).  Bed and bedding were comfortable; pillows were fluffy.   The best thing about this hotel is the staff:  lots of people on hand to answer every need, with friendly smiles and quiet but constant and quick availability.   Fantastic location for all the usual sightseeing.   We walked everywhere.   And when we needed a taxi, the staff arranged  for the pick-up.",5,2022,09,03
105,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"We always stay at the Chesterfield, it's our go to hotel in London and has been for over 10 years! Great location, quiet but right in the heart of Mayfair.   Beautifully presented rooms, fabulous piano bar, great breakfast and super restaurant. Amazing staff, great family feel. You must stay here if you get the chance.",5,2022,09,03
105,Afternoon Tea - birthday celebration,"A big thank you to the Chesterfield Hotel!! 

We went to celebrate my sister's 40th birthday and had a fantastic time!! (02/09/22).

The Team that served us were: smart, warm and welcoming, knowledgeable and patient; everything you would want from the experience. 

In the current climate, service with a smile is so appreciated. It's a joy to be served by people that are happy in their work.

Well done to: Day, Ben, Emmanuel, London, Lucy and Rafal.

Excellent manager also, Adam Lake for replying to my initial feedback so promptly and finding the staff from my description as I couldn't remember all their names. He obviously cares for his staff which again is another plus for the times we're in.

It was my first visit but be assured Chesterfield Hotel, I'll be back!!

Keep up the good work and see you all again in December for cousin's 60th!! 

Claudia & company2022",5,2022,09,03
105,The best London hotel experience!,"Highest quality - comfortable room and beds (shared the room with a friend), attentive and excellent service. I had a swollen ankle and needed ice packs every night, cheerfully provided by the bar staff. We were a group of 5 and we especially loved the breakfasts - unending pots of coffee patiently delivered and poured, and service staff that catered to our diverse needs. They even brought a birthday cupcake with candle to one member of our group and sang for her!  We had a great time.",5,2022,09,01
105,Amazing days at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is located in one of the best’s regions of the city! The breakfast is incredible, room amenities are also great, the staff (receptionists, people who work on the breakfast, the cleaning team) is very kind and gentle! I loved everything about the hotel!
One suggestion is for maybe in the future remove the carpets!

Anyway, everything was incredible and I hope to stay there again in the future!!
Thanks for everything!

105,Every detail was perfect!,"We just finished our stay here, and I could not recommend this hotel more! We came into town for a family wedding from the states, but had lots of time prior to enjoy our accommodations and the area- so we did a LOT. First, the staff is amazing. Every single one was friendly, helpful, smiling, and so professional. We got one of the suites that made us feel like royalty. We spent a lot of time down in the pub area where the staff was attentive and the atmosphere calm, chill and cozy. There is a pianist nightly and he’s so talented and plays so beautifully, that he made me tear up more than once.  Oh, and it’s open 24 hrs :) Helpful for those coming in from a different time zone! 

One afternoon we did high tea in the greenery (I think it was called?). Beautiful section of the restaurant large windows on the ceiling. The array of snacks, sweets and sandwiches were to die for… And of course, the tea! The area is great with plenty of places to walk to, Tesco nearby for any necessities, and close access to public transportation to go to pretty much anywhere your heart desires. We are already missing it and can’t wait to come back!",5,2022,08,30
105,A beautiful hotel with exceptional service,"We stayed at The Chesterfield for a night away together in London. It was amazing. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms were gorgeous, and well appointed and clean. The bar is lovely, with gorgeous live piano music on a Friday and Saturday. 

Most importantly, though, the staff are all amazing. We were served by the excellent Maya at reception and Ronan at the bar, and each of them were totally lovely, welcoming and friendly.

Very, very worth a stay! ",5,2022,08,30
105,First Class Boutique Hotel with Romantic Charm and Outstanding Service,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is everything you would want in a boutique hotel in London - unique charm, top notch accommodations, great service in the heart of the Mayfair neighborhood (which puts you within striking distance of shopping and sightseeing)

Special shout-out to Leticia who upgraded our room and made our anniversary visit so memorable.

Thank you to all the staff at The Chesterfield!",5,2022,08,27
105,Above & Beyond Service,"We visited celebrating 20yr Wedding Anniversary.. the hotel went above and beyond to make our evening special.  Upgraded room, drink on the house… on top of that our room overlooked the venue we were married in 20 yrs ago - thank you Chesterfield 💜",5,2022,08,26
105,"Classic Hotel in a Central, Quiet Location","The Chesterfield Mayfair is an elegant hotel with excellent service on a quiet street with lots of extras like flowers, appetizers, chocolates, and sparkling water left in your room. Our room, which was supposed to be a larger suite, was not particularly spacious, but was pleasant and well decorated. High Tea was very well done with a ""bottomless"" selection of teas and delicious sandwiches and scones, although the deserts were somewhat ""off the shelf."" The highlight of our stay was the morning breakfasts in a beautiful space overlooking the garden, with a wide range of hot menu items, fresh pastries and juices, and excellent specialty coffees, all served by an attentive, courteous, and friendly staff.",4,2022,08,24
105,6th Birthday treat,"We came to the Chesterfield Mayfair for the Traditional Sweetshop Afternoon Tea for my daughter's 6th birthday. It was just fabulous. The theming is wonderful, in lovely surroundings, but what really made the trip was our fantastic waiter Rafal. He really made such a fuss over my little girl & made. the experience very special for her. We will definitely return!",5,2022,08,23
105,"Great location, good service throughout our stay.","We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at the Chesterfield Hotel which we used as a base for our son's wedding at the nearby Connaught Hotel. The staff were incredibly helpful prior to our arrival answering a multitude of questions regarding a nearby hairdresser for my wife, availability of taxis during the recent strikes etc etc. Nothing was too much trouble for them. So friendly and so helpful. We managed to get a very competitive rate by booking some twelve months ahead of our arrival and this rate was honoured even though our room had almost doubled in price nearer to the date of our stay. The room we stayed in was a superior king and although somewhat smaller than we had anticipated it did manage to suit our needs. One slightly quirky aspect was having to ring reception for fresh milk whenever you wanted to make your own hot drink. This was only a minor inconvenience and no doubt resulted from not having in room fridges. Finally I would just say that the room was a little 'tired' I suspect in part due to its popularity and high occupation rates. Do not let this discourage you from booking. It's a great location and a great place to stay.",5,2022,08,22
105,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"We stayed for one night at this beautiful hotel in a Superior King Room.  On arrival we were greeted by friendly and efficient staff and check in was very smooth, we even managed to have our room a couple of hours early which meant we could leave our luggage and freshen up before heading out to the theatre matinee that we had booked.

Our room was spacious and tastefully decorated.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in when staying in a hotel and the pillows were beautifully soft.  My husband was thrilled to find out we had Sky TV and he could catch up with the  cricket while getting ready for our day out.  The bathroom was lovely and clean with a really hot, powerful shower.

The location is perfect for walking to sights such as Buckingham Palace or in to the theatre district, we didn’t need to use any public transport other than travelling from Euston on arrival, and that was only 3 stops away on the underground.

We had a lovely surprise on our return in the evening to find a birthday cake and voucher for cocktails in the bar, I mentioned during our chat on check in that we were treating ourselves to the trip as a belated birthday celebration for us both.  It was such a nice gesture and very much appreciated.

Breakfast was delicious, with plenty of choice, and again served by friendly, polite staff.  We were able to leave our luggage for the day on checkout which was really helpful.

We would definitely stay here again when visiting London and will be recommending to friends and family.",5,2022,08,21
105,Great stay in a super location,"We have stayed at the Chesterfield before as well as several other hotels in the Red Carnation chain. We chose the Chesterfield for this stay due to it's location in a quiet street in Mayfair, though with many sights within walking distance. 

On arrival a member of staff came straight out to greet us and take our bags-he also offered to park the car but I had already made my own arrangements. Our bags were taken straight to our room while we had our drinks.

Check in was  so quick and easy and we were soon through to the delightful bar for a drink. We also had a cooling drink here on our second evening after a hot day's sight-seeing!. You get a tray of nibbles with your drinks. There are also newspapers to read as you settle into the comfortable chairs-this was a real haven!

We were given a lovely, quiet king room kept cool by the efficient aircon with a nice outlook over a courtyard and beyond. The bed was very comfortable, mineral water was provided and the room was well-serviced twice a day.

Breakfast was a delight with such a large choice of high quality foods, much of which had named English producers on the menu-a particular favourite of mine was the black pudding! Service was very good and friendly in the lovely restaurant.

We highly recommend this quality hotel with it's lovely staff and will be back in the future.",5,2022,08,18
105,Sweetie afternoon tea,The food was delicious and the service impeccable. The sandwiches were great and the sweet treats unusual and very tasty. Faizah (one of our waiting staff) was fantastic and ensured that we had everything we needed. She was also a delight to talk to. Would thoroughly recommend as it was fantastic value. ,5,2022,08,17
105,Fantastic stay,"We usually like to stay at the The Chesterfield when we stay in London. We stopped over briefly at the weekend when meeting friends from Spain. The hotel was its usual high standard and the staff welcoming and professional, without being stuffy (something we have found at some other well known hotels). The food is exceptional and attention to detail first rate. 
We will continue to use this hotel and I am happy to recommend the Chesterfield to anyone.",5,2022,08,16
105,Mr simms afternoon tea sweet shop,"We had an amazing afternoon tea at mr simms sweet shop at the chesterfield hotel, our waitress Faizah was exceptional, she really did go above & beyond, 
We had a lovely afternoon for my sisters 50th birthday, which was made extra special with them bringing her a birthday cake out, 
Faizah made sure we had everything we needed (as it was one of the hottest days of the year) she kept our water & tea topped up, along side the amazing cakes, scones & sandwiches, all the staff were friendly, polite in a non invasive way & nothing was too much trouble 
We will definitely return",5,2022,08,14
105,"Excellent staff, location","Excellent staff, friendly and helpful. The breakfast is very good - many choices, served in the main dining room by attentive staff. The bar is a great place to wind down, with piano player on nights we were there. Bar staff were excellent.
Great location for Mayfair, Marylebone and Soho walks. 
A/C in room worked very well and was easy to adjust; modern bathroom - nice; superior room was a bit small but was very quiet. Newspaper at the door in the morning-nice.
On check-in we were surprised to be asked for a 15 pound per night supplement for the staff. This can be removed from bill at check out.",4,2022,08,13
105,Best location in the best hotel!,"Very friendly staff and extremely helpful. Our room was amazing, spacious and extremely comfortable.

Everything was so good at the Chesterfield. Breakfast was amazing, plenty of choices and the service was excellent. We loved our stay and would definitely return.",5,2022,08,13
105,Never Disappoints,"Over the past 15 years we have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair many times. The staff, rooms, restaurants and bars are top notch and we have never been disappointed.

105,Great Experience!!,"I booked an Afternoon Tea for my mom and myself to celebrate her birthday. Everyone at the restaurant was so kind and helpful. I had planned the Afternoon Tea and she was excited when we got to the hotel, the staff was very friendly and they sang happy birthday and gave her a chocolate cup cake which was very cute! Afterwards she kept telling me how friendly everyone was and that they made her day. We will definitely be back :)",5,2022,08,08
105,Exceptional caring,"London was the second leg of our trip and we had reservations at this hotel.  Tragically, the husband of the couple we were traveling with was killed in a horrific accident in Serengeti National Park on the first leg of the trip.  We obviously returned home to the US.    I just wanted to say that this hotel was exceptional in our tragedy.  They not only took care of the cancellation but also sent a personal, heartfelt message to us.  At that point we were still in Tanzania and it felt like love and support from home.  We hope to someday meet these people in person.
Thank you
Marcia",5,2022,08,08
105,Exceptional cannot wait to go back.,"We were at the hotel for three nights. The staff, especially Lisa were phenomenal.

105,Afternoon Tea,"AMAZING! Celebrated my 30th birthday here with my husband and it was outstanding. The service was 10/10. Staff all attentive, kind, chatty, friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. Me and my husband had the veggie option and all the sandwiches and cakes were delicious. Two of the lovely staff sang me happy birthday and gave me a chocolate cup cake with a candle in which was so cute! I truly had the best birthday, thanks to all the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We chose coffee instead of tea and this was no issue at all. You get a little sweet bag to take home at the end which was a lovely touch. Great value for money all in all! I will 100% be back with my mum as I know she would love it too! Thank you so much for a lovely experience ❤️",5,2022,08,07

Great choice of excellent food at breakfast, served by lovely and attentive staff.

This hotel is a short walk from Green Park station, and is handy for Buckingham Palace and The Ritz Hotel. Will certainly visit again.",5,2022,08,06
105,TEA for TWO!!  5 Stars!,"Bringing my 16 year to London I searched high and low for the PERFECT tea time experience.  We aren't huge tea drinkers but I still wanted an afternoon tea experience.  Chesterfield Mayfair delivered.  

Staff - the moment we walked din everyone was helpful.  In particular Day and Kira both took very goo care of us.  Day helped us select a tea (for the non tea drinker) and it was Dancing Dragon Tea, soo good!  It's now our favourite.  Day talked us through the experience and was incredibly attentive checking in on us.

Kira was so sweet and we struck up a wonderful chat with her.  she made sure we had everything we needed and kept the yummies coming. 

We had so much food!  We barely got through the bottom sandwich tier before our stomachs got full. We even took home an amazing take away bag of all the delicious treats we couldn't finish.  

Food - yum yum triple yum!  sandwiches yes!  scones, to die for! Jam, oh lord, yum! and them there is the treats. we barely got to hem we were so full but yum yum. Also it was so beautiful.  Exactly what I was looking for in an experience.  

Tea / Drinks - I knew they had hot chocolate since I wanted to make sure we had a back up in case we didn't like the tea.  It was hard to choose.  The hot chocolate was incredible!  Such a rich full flavour.  

Allergies - we did not need to worry about this but I do have. daughter with a nut allergy who didn't attend.  It was nice to know they could accommodate.  They ask right off the bat and are very upfront about it.  That's a huge plus for many families.  

If you are endlessly researching a tea place like I did, Chesterfield Mayfair was posh, delicious, friendly and beautiful!  You will not be sorry. 

Thank you Day and Kira for making this the highlight of these Bostonian's trip!",5,2022,08,06
105,"Stunning setting, great food and brilliant staff!","I've been here with my partner a few times and we've always had a fantastic meal and experience. This time we had a tailor-made beetroot mousse & the chicken and truffle pie which were both outstanding.

In particular, the staff were absolutely delightful to work with and helped me plan a special proposal. Massive thanks to Roberta, Maurizia and Malina for making it stress-free, memorable and special!

Will definitely be returning once again.",5,2022,08,02
105,Classic and Charming Stay in the heart of Mayfair,"From the moment we arrived the staff of The Chesterfield made us feel like royalty. Everyone was extremely helpful, attentive, warm and friendly. 

The suite we stayed in was really comfortable and relaxing. 

The cocktails are absolutely superb - classics and some creative twists. We enjoyed a pre-dinner drink while listening to the live pianist in the cocktail bar. There was a lovely atmosphere.

The location is excellent for exploring Mayfair and for quick access to other parts of London. 

Do not leave before you try the ham and cheese toastie on the bar menu! The best I have ever eaten and I will certainly drop by when I'm next passing to order another one... (and a champagne cocktail!).

Thank you to all of the Chesterfield staff for making our stay so special. It was a wonderful experience.",5,2022,08,01
105,its the people that count,"We stay at The Chesterfield often, our home away when in London. This time for my husbands birthday. It was again clear to me why we visit this lovely hotel, its the staff who are so friendly, helpful and always cheerful. Everyone wears a smile including the wonderful cleaning staff looking after us every day. A big thank you to the staff at breakfast for all the birthday treats (champagne, cake and a present!), way beyond our expectations. Thank you, we will be back soon.",5,2022,08,01
105,Lovely Staff,"The food was delicious and the staff were extremely polite. Ella, Sumairaa, Faizah, Kira, Malina, Rafa, Poalo, and Denisa were particularly kind and welcoming. I would love to come again. There was a range of foods to try from the afternoon tea, which were all outstanding.",5,2022,08,01
105,Amazing service!!,"The food was amazing but what really heightens the experience is the amazing service, the staff is almost like a family and it gives the restaurant/hotel a down to earth atmosphere. Faizah is an outstanding waitress who brings a good balance of personality and care to the customers. Would love to come back again.",5,2022,08,01
105,The Chesterfield Afternoon Tea,"I visited The Chesterfield today for Afternoon Tea. The place is lovely and very clean. The Afternoon Tea is excellent, especially the egg mayonnaise sandwiches. The sweets are fabulous. The staff are lovely and helpful. From Maurizia seating us, Faizah, Ella, Sumairaa and Eleonora, but Kira, who was our waitress was excellent. I will always remember her warm welcoming smile as she walked towards. Her knowledge and helpfulness was fantastic. The Chesterfield Afternoon Tea is expensive but worth it and if you get Kira as a waitress, you will have a lovely Afternoon Tea.",5,2022,07,31
105,Amazing staff. Amazing location. Amazing hotel,"Stayed at The Chesterfield for two nights. The staff are absolutely pheunomonal. We were greeted by a superb gentleman, called possibly Agnelo? As soon as he greeted us, we knew we made the right choice. Room service is delicious and we had Lychee Martinis made - Wow! Rooms are spacious, clean, unique and definitely comfy. This hotel location is amazing.. It is a 3 minute walk to Berkley square and about 10 mins to park lane. The hotel also smells beautiful as you walk in. Thank you to all the staff :-)",5,2022,07,31
105,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"Staff (Sumairaa, Faizah, Ella, Eleonora, Maurizia and Kira) were very polite and kind. Highly recommend going with family and/or friends. However, it can be quite pricey but still worth it. They have a variety of different tea and coffee that also comes with a variety of desserts!!",4,2022,07,31
105,Absolute gem!!!!,"Our family of 4 stayed here for a week. The rooms exceeded our expectations! Quiet area to retreat, perfect location, fabulous service, delicious breakfast—highly recommend. Would absolutely stay again! The front desk staff—especially Lisa and Gyorgi—went over and above to make our stay so wonderful. We loved being so close to the Underground and all the action, yet tucked around the corner on a magically quiet street. Excellent food and pubs were found 1-2 blocks away in every direction.",5,2022,07,31
105,OK,"A great hotel in a good location, but extremely tired, clearly needs a refurbishment. Furniture was too damaged, the curtain was stained, and the room was dusty. The service at the bar was amazing also the concierge team were very attentive.  The 1st time that we asked for toothpaste in a hotel  and this was not provided, after giving a tip of £20 at least I expected a certain level of service and perhaps purchase one externally. Overall it was ok.",3,2022,07,30
105,Great Hotel in great location with very friendly service,"We had a great experience. Everyone was 
Friendly and provided exceptional service.
The accommodations were very charming. 
Great location. We walked to pubs for dinner. 
Had a nice breakfast each morning.
 Lounge was very warm and pleasant for end of day cocktail 
Highly recommend this hotel.
This is our definite ‘Go to ‘ for our return visits to London!",5,2022,07,28
105,High Tea,"The high tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair was outstanding!  The service was second-to-none and very down to earth and not stuffy. Faizah, our server, made us feel welcome and made the experience special especially for our daughter’s first experience at high tea.  The food was excellent and the specialized menu for the children’s high tea was equally excellent but tailored to a simpler pallet.

I highly recommend it!",5,2022,07,27
105,Afternoon Tea,"We have really enjoyed afternoon tea. The food was delicious and service was exceptional.
We really enjoyed the theme!
Faizah was our host and looked after us very well.
Highly recommended, beautiful hotel and setting!",5,2022,07,27
105,Nice hotel in a great location,"I will start with the positives as there were definitely more!
Great location. Lovely old world charm. Warm friendly greeting at reception and quick check in. Very helpful friendly concierge. Room was nice and cool. Bed quite comfy. Plenty of amenities in the room. 
Lovely touch receiving a little cake in our room for our anniversary. Nice bar.

Couple of negatives, nothing major and wouldn’t prevent me staying again:
Room and bed was smaller than I expected for the price. I prefer a memory foam mattress and this was quite springy but admittedly was still comfy enough.
I thought breakfast was very mediocre. I got the double eggs Benedict, the eggs were very small, yokes slightly over and not much hollandaise. Presentation was poor. I expected better. Husband enjoyed his full English. Breakfast was included in our stay but I think had I paid the £17 listed on the menu for my eggs I would have complained.",4,2022,07,23
105,A great stay in a lovely traditional Hotel,"We had a great stay at The Chesterfield, the staff are second to none.  Didn’t matter which member of staff you spoke to they were all courteous, cheerful, positive, friendly and helpful and we did speak to a lot during our 4 night stay. 

Our room was great and the bed was amazing as was the bed linen.  We are generally not fans of air conditioning but the one here not only worked well but was very quiet.   As was our room, we didn’t hear anyone else and the hotel was totally full – no street noise either.  

A great stay and one which we intend to repeat.  Well done The Chesterfield.",5,2022,07,20
105,Simply the best.,The best staff. Beautiful hotel. Lovely beds and linen.  The whole experience can not be faulted.  We have been to a few hotels post-covid and the service has been shocking but the just fabulous attitude of their staff has restored our faith.  We will be back.,5,2022,07,18
105,Home away from home,"Me and my wife stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel a couple of months ago for two nights when we came to visit our daughter who lives in London. I’m not used to leave reviews and this is why it took me a while to write this, but I feel the urgency to share my experience. I chose the hotel for its key location in the vibrant heart of the city, but I didn’t expect to find such a lovely place! The interior design of the entire hotel and the room we stayed in is impeccable. Every detail is given the hugest attention and care. My wife has worked for many years in the upholstery sector and has appreciated the refinement of the curtains, the walls and the coordination of the fabrics used to furnish the room. However, the icing sugar of the hotel is the staff: they made us feel at home. The way they engaged with the us on every occasion was unique and we never experienced this before in any other hotel. From the doormen Joseph and Georgy that kindly opened the doors for us every time we entered and left the hotel, always welcoming us with a smile and showing genuine interest in our plans. Up to the reception team where Giada checked us in professionally but also friendly, kindly giving us the occasion to speak in Italian - which was a great relief for my wife who doesn’t speak any English and a great opportunity for engagement and to get to know the hotel and its surroundings a little bit better. We spend the first night at the Terrace bar where we experienced live music and an amazing selection of cocktails. The bar Manager Adrian was simply stunning, engaging and attentive to our needs. Our glasses were never empty! We had the fish and chips and was absolutely great, best compliments to the chefs! Breakfast is of the highest quality: the menu is entirely à la carte and the waiters and waitresses do their best to provide a fantastic service and be on top of every request. The food was exquisite, and undoubtedly freshly cooked, which is a plus. A special thanks to Malina and Slavena whose smile and positive attitude will be hardly forgotten. The second night we had dinner with our daughter at the Butlers restaurant. Andrej showed us to a lovely table and gave us some good recommendation about the menu, among which the Dover sole: definitely a great advice cause it was delicious! We had an amazing meal and a fantastic time made ever more special by the genuine and engaging interaction we had with Maurizia. She was so accommodating and attentive, and we created a real connection on a personal level. Every person who crossed our road left somehow an indelible print in our heart and memory. This is what we call a memorable experience: made up of little, relevant details that all together create an unforgettable time. We really can’t wait to go back to the Chesterfield Mayfair again, and will surely recommend it to every friend and family as a perfect destination for a trip to London if they are looking for a proper home from home. Thank you again everyone!",5,2022,07,17
105,Many nicer places to stay with rooms big enough to open a suitcase,Paid for a King Superior room and allocated a room so small we can only open one suitcase at a time and we face into the void of the hotel. We asked to change rooms only to be told all room had been allocated. Even offered to pay for an upgrade.  We previously stayed around the corner in Mayfair and through we should change things up a bit and stay somewhere different.  Telling us to contact our travel agent when it’s 2:30am local time is entirely unhelpful.,1,2022,07,14
105,Peace full,"Loved the rooms, cleanliness, specious and privacy. Staff was good and helped us with luggage. Well located and all amenities are there, we will be definitely returning back next year. Treated with special drink",5,2022,07,10
105,Another Fantastic Stay,"Just returned from my 2nd stay this year at the Chesterfield and again everything was 5 STAR.
The location, decor, staff, room, comfort, all night bar, great breakfast and personal service makes this the ONLY hotel I want to stay in when I get to London. The staff goes out of their way to welcome you and Adam, the manager is running a fine group of people. I love this hotel! Great location 2 blocks from the Green Park tube and a very close nice market to walk close by.",5,2022,07,10
105,Fabulous,I couldn't fault this hotel. The rooms were luxurious & the beds just SO comfortable & huge. The whole place was just old fashioned luxury even the flowers. The staff were helpful & delightful & nothing was too much trouble.Excellently situated in the heart of Mayfair.,5,2022,07,10
105,Three Nights Stay,"We stayed for three nights at The Chesterfield earlier this month. A good location close to Green Park tube station, shopping, sights and entertainment. The staff in most areas of the hotel were excellent, the room was comfortable and well maintained. We would have rated the hotel 5 stars except for the less than satisfactory breakfast arrangements. We couldn’t fathom why only one waiter (in the area of our table) was taking orders while the room had a relatively large number of waiting staff apparently under-employed. This solo order taking meant that the breakfast was slow to arrive and on the two mornings that we breakfasted we were served incorrect orders, although to be fair the quality and presentation of the food was very good. The staff in the dining room were very pleasant but seemed to be disempowered. We’ve stayed in other Red Carnation properties and the sister Uniworld river cruise company and never experienced this order taking arrangement previously . The cost of our stay, for Mayfair, was very competitive and we will stay at the hotel in the future.",4,2022,07,09
105,The epitome of luxury,"From the moment we arrived, the staff and hotel could not have been any better.   We were greeted by the doorman, and he gathered all of our luggage and directed us to the front desk.  We were a group of four, and had 2 rooms for 2 nights.   We were upgraded to a suite, which was over the top.   The concierge arranged for dinner reservations, and also for the hop on hop off bus tour....we know, touristy.  
The breakfast was outstanding, and the atmosphere of the hotel exuded luxury.
I would classify this hotel as one of the best, and would absolutely stay again.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2022,07,09
105,Lovely London Hotel,"This hotel is perfect for a visit to London.  The staff, restaurant, bar and decor are all superb. We were so pleased with every aspect of our stay here and will surely stay here again when next we visit lovely and lively London.

This hotel is a PERFECT location- elegant and quiet Mayfair but near parks and other attractions ! 

We just loved our experience there.",5,2022,07,08
105,Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"Finally got to take our mother/daughter trip, which like many got postponed for 2 years. Such an amazing trip 3 counties (Scotland, England and France). We booked the trip through Costco and were able to pick our of the hotels for each city. It was important to me the location was central to the activities and site we wanted to do and see. In London, we stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair and I was so happy we did. From the moment we arrived, the staff was so friendly and helpful. Any questions, directions, extra activities we wanted to do the staff was quick to assist. The wait staff in the restaurant, where we had breakfast every morning, were attentive and friendly. Our room was wonderful! We reserved a two twin bed room and they were so comfortable. It was hard to get up in the morning. Lol! The housekeeping staff kept us stocked with complimentary tea, biscuits, and waters which were nice to come back to after a long day and touring and walking. It made my daughter very happy. We were a little worried about getting around as the train strike was going on, but the concierge and front desk staff were very helpful and informative on what days were best to walk and when transportation would be busy. This helped us adjust our schedule and how we would get to our tours. When I come back to London, without a doubt, I will stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again and would recommend it to anyone. You will not be disappointed. Thank you CM staff! You helped make our stay in London fantastic!",5,2022,07,07
105,Excellent,"We went to the afternoon sweet shop tea . It was one of the best we've been to.  We All had a fantastic afternoon.  The sandwiches were delicious.   So were the scones.  I had unlimited coffee and cappuccino.  My daughter had a delicious milk shake.   
But the young lovely ladies that served us were so friendly and welcoming.  FAIZAN. and her team were amazing.  
Thank you for making lovely memories for my daughters birthday.",5,2022,07,05
105,Birthday celebration afternoon tea for our 6 year olds,"We are big fans of the Chesterfield hotel afternoon tea and have been many times over the last 10 years be it with friends or family. They have for the formula just right, relaxing and friendly atmosphere, lovely decor, warm down to earth staff and very family friendly. The food is delicious, the themes of the teas are innovative and fun, and the price is not astronomical. The best part is the ability for refills and to change your teas which some afternoon teas have stopped doing which is a big turn off for a lot of guests. 
We had such a fun time for our daughter’s 6th birthday, they loved the sweet shop tea, the milkshakes and the pick and mix goody bag to take home afterwards. It was the first time I introduced the Chesterfield hotel tea to our friends who we invited with us and they were also very impressed and will come again. Special shout outs to Ella, Lucy and Faizah at the afternoon tea service who made the experience super special for my daughter!",5,2022,07,04
105,Visit to m London,"We had a wonderful time at this hotel. Amazing staff. So helpful and friendly. Perfect stay, great location, great breakfast, very very clean, and best service I had encountered. Will definitely come back soon!",5,2022,07,02
105,Enjoyable Birthday Stay,Had a very nice stay to celebrate my partners big birthday in conjunction with a nice meal and tickets to Wicked. Hotel was smart clean and staff very friendly.  They even surprised her with a small birthday cake in our room which was a nice touch. The room was one of their more basic rooms but more than adequate for our needs. Would return again in the future.,5,2022,06,29
105,Old fashioned hospitality,First class from start to finish. Very friendly and welcoming check in. Every member of the hotel team were outstanding and so hard working. Hotel furnishings are old fashioned but this is by no means a negative as it was like going back in time. Spotlessly clean rooms with a comfy bed and luxurious pillows. All the little touches added to a fabulous stay. We will definitely stay again.,5,2022,06,29
105,Amazing Hotel,"Hands down the highlight of our trip! The hospitality was top notch and we absolutely loved our rooms. Staff was so helpful with everything. We were there during the transit strike and they helped us navigate the best way to get around the City those days. 

We enjoyed afternoon tea as well as breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. The location was perfect. It’s on a beautiful, quiet street that is central to everything.",5,2022,06,27
105,"A luxury stay that feels just like ""home""!","When it came to my return visit to London for the Platinum Jubilee, there was no other hotel that would do for me except the Chesterfield Mayfair.  My previous stay in 2019 was so great that I wondered...would it be just as good post-pandemic?  No worries! It was even better than I remembered.  Every single member of their team -- from Lisa, the Front House Manager, the cheery front desk reps, Derek and his concierge staff, the amazing restaurant team (thanks especially to Kira!), and those in the lounge, the doormen who do multiple tasks - wow!  They remembered my name, ran around corners to hail cabs from God knows where, jumped in to pull reservation favors, grabbed special Jubilee pubs, friendly greetings coming in and going out. And they were super genuine about it...it's clear that they liked being there and serving selflessly.  And if they were short-staffed at times, they worked extra to cover it. My stay was too short; money runs out, after all.  But, Lord willing, I'll earn some more. And I already know where I'll stay...back home with the Chesterfield family.",5,2022,06,20
105,Beautiful hotel in Mayfair,"Had a seven nights stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.
This hotel is located in the middle of the elegant Mayfair neighbourhood, few minutes walk from Piccadilly street and the green park tube station, with lots of cafe’s, restaurants and stores near by.
The hotel is very elegant and beautiful with a lovely theme of red carnations.
Staff is nice, pleasant and professional, always smiling and welcoming.
My room was on the 4th floor, very clean and quiet with a classy old England decor.
Bed was big and comfortable with a big working desk, shower room was also super clean and beautiful.
Breakfast was not part of my deal but I took it separately in few mornings. It was a little bit expensive but the full English breakfast is really a treat. I used the room service few times to dine in my room and the food was great.
I’ve also tried the bar one evening and had a lovely st. James cocktail with live piano playing on background.
I really recommend this hotel and hope to stay again in the future.",5,2022,06,20
105,Fantastic stay,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for both a work/leisure trip. 

I don't have much to say on this one as everything there is fantastic, the check in was speedy and easy, the location is brilliant, the staff are well trained, professional and cordial; the food is tasty no matter where you have it and the rooms are lovely too. 

I will say the only thing that weirded me out was the room decor, lots of people watching me sleep but the choice of pillows this place had meant I didn't mind so much. 

A wonderful and fantastic hotel and I would definitely come back.",5,2022,06,20
105,Brilliant sweetshop afternoon tea,"WOW- what a brilliant afternoon tea. The welcome was friendly and the service was impeccable. Both Faizah and Slavena  were lovely, they couldn’t do enough for us. They are an asset to the hotel. 
The food was delicious- and lots of it! They kept asking us if we wanted more too! The sweets themed cakes were yummy and the bag of sweets at the end was a nice touch. We had a fantastic time from beginning to end. Thank you to all the wonderful staff at The Chesterfield.",5,2022,06,18
105,Excellent venue,"Came here to watch a ticketed boxing event. The venue was nice and clean inside, getting a drink wasn’t too much of a hassle and the toilets were decent. The boxing wasn’t the best but the venue was decent and we all had a good night. I would definitely like to return",5,2022,06,17
105,2nd Time Back to the Chesterfield,Stayed once again at the Chesterfield and not disappointed by the welcome and professional staff. Great location with modern well appointed rooms. Hotel is well maintained with a great bar and menu. Would not hesitate to recommend and will return.,5,2022,06,17
105,"A charming, well located boutique hotel in Mayfair London","We are very familiar different sections of London. And for us, we love Mayfair as a place that gives us great restaurant options, easy access to shopping, theatres,  near wonderful parks, close to tube stops and all the Piccadilly has to offer.  We have stayed in many hotel in and around Mayfair. This was our first time at the Chesterfield Mayfair and what a lovely surprise!  A small, quaint, high-touch/service, boutique hotel with old-world charm (which is our preference). We booked a Superior King room. A member of the staff said that every room was designed differently.  The linens were wonderful, in-room tea/coffee set up, bathroom design, wall switch to indicate ""Do not disturb"" or ""Make up the room"", the large TV screen, various places to store luggage and bags were all appreciated. The room also had lovely period furniture, but all the modern amenities you want. The room was PERFECTLY QUIET, too!  The hotel is located on a quieter street, and the windows were double paned so little to no street noise. And we NEVER heard anyone above, below or on the sides of our room.  Not one noise!  The staff move quietly -- tapping gently if you order something to be delivered to your room. Service was high quality. The bar was fun -- great cocktails, wines and beers. As well as tasty bar food. We didn't do any of their special events (Gin Tasting, Afternoon Tea, or kids activities), but they sounded wonderful. We had a rate the included breakfast -- and the menu had great options. All food was perfectly prepared and delicious. Service from the minute we arrived to the moment we left was spectacular. The room rates were very, very reasonable for the area and represented a good value on top of all of the other benefits. We will definitely be back and the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2022,06,15
105,Romantic Getaway,"I don't know where to begin with this amazing hotel!
We arrived at St. Pancras, took the tube to Green Park, and walked to The Chesterfield Mayfair (that is how close it is to the tube/metro). 
One of the first things I noticed were the beautiful red carnations (this is because the hotel is part of the Red Carnation Hotel Collection). The hotel is beautifully decorated with red carnations and orchids. The doors were opened with a smile from the doorman and we were received by the welcoming receptionist. (Hi Giada!!)

Hotel Service: The service from the hotel was absolutely amazing, Giada was always the one there when I needed anything (really). Whenever we wanted more water bottles, extra towels, or even an earlier breakfast (since the restaurant wasn't opened yet), they always provided them. We were actually there to celebrate my husband's birthday and we were received with this adorable birthday cake. The room was serviced twice, once during the day, and prepared for the night. 

Room: The room was a Classic Double and was the perfect size for the two of us and our 4 bags. They provided multiple towels, a bathrobe, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and toiletries. 

Location: The location of this place is amazing. We were very close to everything and walked everywhere, but if you need access to the tube/metro, the Green Park Underground station is right there. We walked to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus, New Bond Street, Chinatown, Carnaby, Trafalgar Square, and so many other places.

Amenities: our room did not have a mini-fridge, HOWEVER, Giada was very accommodating and let us use their refrigerator to store our cheeses. Try Stilton cheese, by the way, it is amazing!

Restaurant: There is a bar and a restaurant and this hotel. We didn't go to the bar but we did have breakfast, afternoon tea, and dinner at their restaurant. The ingredients that they used for ALL their meals are high quality. The Scottish smoked salmon, eggs, English cheeses, and tea, are just a couple of my favorites, but everything is phenomenal. I was really excited about the afternoon tea since this is something you MUST do in London and it did not disappoint. You receive unlimited tea, sandwiches, scones, and desserts, PLUS a selection of candies on your way out. The dinner was fantastic as well, I would recommend the London Burrata, Dover Sole (which is a must), and their pies (we had the short rib pie, but I overheard another couple saying their chicken truffle pie is also amazing), and sticky toffee pudding. 

Restaurant Service: from the time you enter the restaurant until the time you leave, your experience is magnificent (Hi Loris!!). All the waiters and waitresses are friendly and will answer all your questions, including ""what is the proper way to eat a scone"". No judgment! Loris was always available to help you and answer all your questions about the ingredients, wine, or anything.

I could write more about this wonderful hotel, but I think this should be enough to convince you that there is nowhere better.

Cheers!",5,2022,06,13
105,A wonderful team,"We used the hotel’s Royal suite for a company event and would definitely return. Roberta was my contact and from the initial contact until after the event she remained a true professional whilst remaining friendly. 
The room is bright and airy, the canapés were delicious and able to accommodate all dietary requirements and the staff on the evening were wonderful, a fantastic team.
Thank you for a fantastic event.",5,2022,06,13
105,"Excellent Hotel, Good Location, Very Clean","Excellent hotel, great location,  excellent breakfast, staff friendly and helpful, really comfortable and quiet, very clean.  

We booked 12 months in advance for the Queens platinum jubilee weekend, so got a good deal for 4 nights, although still expensive compared to some other hotels, not sure I would pay the prices being displayed currently though.

If you are on a budget just be aware that the hotel add a £15 per night service charge at end of your stay on top of the original price (this is optional though)

Overall and excellent hotel and would absolutely stay again at the right price.",5,2022,06,11
105,Best Afternoon Tea in London,"Absolutely stunning Afternoon Tea as always.  Friendly staff, excellent quality food and drink, excellent Sweet Shop theme this time.  This is my favourite Afternoon Tea in London.  The food is really great quality and the staff are happy to replenish anything that you want a bit more of!   Nice location in the conservatory.  It’s really excellent value for money when you compare price and quality with others in the area.",5,2022,06,07
105,Jubilee weekend visit,"I have just returned from The Chesterfield and I have enjoyed every second of my stay.
The staff were all so welcoming and friendly.
The hotel is beautiful and immaculately clean.
The beds were wow....really comfortable. The location is great with near by restaurants etc..
My first visit hopefully won't be my last.
Highly recommended.",5,2022,06,06
105,Champagne Afternoon tea,"Lovely 2 hour afternoon tea at the Chesterfield  Hotel. We were very well looked after and the sandwiches and sweet themed cakes were great and plentiful  , they even insisted we take boxes to take away some extras! Would have been nice to have had  hence to buy a small souvenir of the visit...have done so at other similar hotels ...but we have our memories and photos!!",5,2022,06,06
105,Our Home Away From Home for the Royal Treatment,"This was our fifth visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair, each visit at least a week long.  Each visit has made us feel like we are family.  The staff is what sets this lovely boutique hotel apart from anyplace else.  You just think of a need or want and before you can articulate it, the staff is aware.  Darren will help you with any concierge needs, luggage needs, or directions you may have.  Adrienne, the bar manager, makes you feel like he has been waiting all day just for you.  The food and drinks in the bar were all consistently amazing, and if there is something you want that isnt on the menu, they will make it happen one way or another.  Check in is a breeze, and after a long transatlantic flight we were grateful for early check in.  Our room, as always, was well appointed, clean, and oh so comfortable!  We had a small maintenance issue - our key wouldnt open the door.  It was fixed immediately!  At one point the light in the elevator was out (a bit scary), and they were on it immediately.  We have stayed there for Harry and Megan's wedding, during the Christmas season, for our anniversary, for birthdays, etc and each and evry time we were treated like Queen Elizabeth and her family.  There is no place else we will ever stay in London!",5,2022,06,06
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel,Our 5 night stay was excellent. The hotel is charming and very conveniently located. The service was outstanding and very friendly particularly our bellman Salvatore and our breakfast waitress Slavena who always had a smile. The food for breakfast was high quality as well as the bar food and ambiance. Highly recommended.,5,2022,06,04
105,"Exceptional staff, wonderful location and great food.","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for five days and It was wonderful!  From the traditional feel of the hotel, to the fantastic location within walking distance of Piccadilly Circus and other tourist attractions, to the exceptional staff, we felt welcome, comfortable and in the center of it all. Everyone from the room staff to the reception and concierge were wonderful.  Salvatore and the other doormen were so helpful and a wealth of information!",5,2022,06,03
105,London for the first time!,"If you can find a more attentive, friendly, helpful staff in London, good luck!!  Well located with great rooms, an excellent restaurant, and really good bartenders!!  They also directed us to another restaurant down the street called Corrigan's......outstanding food.  Thoroughly enjoyed London and the sights before driving to Southampton to catch a cruise.",5,2022,06,03
105,"Great location, excellent service, hard to beat","All good things to say-- breakfast, afternoon tea, service- all were A+.  Tamara, Darren, Paolo, Fiachra and others made our stay even better.The piano bar was a wonderful place to wind down each evening.  Luxurious is a good description and for what we got, the price was fine. We could walk to many of the sights we wanted to visit, which we appreciated. For those who aren't walkers, there is close access to the underground, too. The heated floor in the bathroom was another plus, especially stepping out of the shower. All personnel were attentive, prompt and friendly. The room had a good variety of teas and a French press for coffee. Nightly cookies were served along with turn-down services. We wouldn't even look for another place when we return to London and we've already recommended it to family members who are going soon.",5,2022,06,02
105,Afternoon Tea,"This was our family’s first trip to London. We have never had afternoon tea, so we didn’t quite know what to expect. After pouring through many reviews of many afternoon teas in London I decided on the Chesterfield Mayfair afternoon tea. 

This was a truly unique and amazing experience for the entire family. The welcome drink served on dry ice was a lovely touch for both the adults and kids. A variety of sandwiches are served which are all quite nice. The children’s tea is basically the same as the adults with just less food overall. The scones and pastries were all delicious and very well crafted. We couldn’t even finish all the food served you will not leave hungry. Wonderful touch at the end with the choice of several sweets to take home. I would highly recommend the afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2022,06,01

105,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"We have been visiting the red carnations hotels for 5 years now and although the Montague on the gardens is our pefered destination unfortunately it was fully booked so we was then booked into there sister hotel the Chesterfield mayfair. 

The hotel is amazing but the staff are absolutely brilliant, as usual we were made to feel like Royalty from the moment we entered the hotel, checking in was easy as we were expected, the staff then suprised us with a free drinks on the house in there executive bar, this is because  it was our anniversary which to us it ments the world.

The room was fit for Royalty,  very clean smelt like a garden on spring day. We absolutely love the red carnations hotels because we are treated as family and not guests. 

The decor was out of this world totally amazing, we will never stay elsewhere as we have never been made to feel like family in other hotel and we have stayed in quite a few over the years till we discovered  the red carnations. 

The staff at the Chesterfield mayfair are to be commended thank you to all of you who made our anniversary stay even that more batter.

Best wishes 
Mrs Leanne and Mr Mustafa uluhan.",5,2022,05,21
105,Short break,"Excellent Mayfair location and the staff could not have been more attentive and helpful. The doorman and concierge are worthy of praise and Naomi on reception provided high quality service. Overall experience was fantastic. We would definitely stay at this lovely hotel again. The dinning experience was good and catered well for a gluten free diet . The room we stayed in was pleasant and served our purposes well, although some of the furniture and bathroom were showing signs of wear and tear. These are small issues compared to the overall experience which was very positive.",5,2022,05,20
105,"Godd location , but......","Stayed at Chesterfield M 4 nights this month. Been here frequently the last 10 years. A very good location for shopping and restaurants and Hyde park as well.
Very friendly and nice helpful staff.
On the improvement side : the breakfast is still slow. If you go for breakfast between 9 - 10 you must be prepared to wait in a long queue. Not he best way to start the day! The people working in the breakfast restaurant work very hard but the capacity is to low. Seems as a management challenge to me.
Some people order breakfast to their rooms. The dirty dishes are placed in the corridor, not picked up before the next morning. Strange !
Slow check - in. When we arrive we were alone at the desk, long time as well.
We miss the Elemis products in the bathroom. The alternative is not even close.",3,2022,05,18
105,Best afternoon tea & service impeccable.,"Outstanding Afternoon tea. My daughter treated me to this for my birthday. So unique and fun. Felt like a kid in a sweet shop all over again. 
Service is impeccable. The gentlemen couldn’t do enough for us. 
Food was delicious and fresh. 
The extra surprise is at the end when you visit the sweet cart for a bag of sweets. Flying saucers were my favourite. 
The welcome drink was theatrical and quirky. 
Scones melted in the mouth. Sandwiches so so fresh. Cakes Devine. 
As it was my birthday they brought out a little cupcake with happy birthday on it. Sang to me and made it very special whilst very classy. Special Thankyou to our waiter who was so polite, courteous and made the experience so pleasant.  

A real treat and you didn’t disappoint.",5,2022,05,17
105,Afternoon tea birthday party par excellence at the Chesterfield Hotel!,"I recently celebrated a big birthday with an afternoon tea party for friends and family. Having looked at different options in London, I decided on the Chesterfield Hotel. This was mainly due to the responsive, knowledgeable and professional approach by Charlotte in the Chesterfield’s events team from my first email and throughout the booking/ planning process (thank you, Charlotte!) The events team, three staff in total, proved highly efficient and made the planning process easy.
 
Everyone I was in contact with at the Chesterfield before, during and after the event has been outstanding. Having singled out Charlotte, I would also like to name and thank the amazing staff in situ during my afternoon tea party: Rafal, Slavena and Tamara, led by Maurizia. They were friendly, engaging and professional throughout. When I or my guests had a question or needed help, they were quick to offer a hand. They made everyone feel happy and comfortable, including me.
 
I know there were other people involved in the background to make the event a success like the Chesterfield’s front of house, kitchen and facilities staff. It is clear there is a formidable and hardworking team at work at the Chesterfield. Many of my guests made a point of saying how welcome they felt the moment they arrived at the hotel, greeted warmly by front of house and other staff they encountered.
  
Thank you very much to everyone involved and for helping to make my party special. My high hopes for the day were exceeded and I highly recommend the Chesterfield Hotel, its staff and services.",5,2022,05,15

We reiterate the hospitality is second to none and the staff saw to our every need.,5,2022,05,13
105,Top quality hotel,"This was the first time we have stayed at the Chesterfield and certainly won't be the last. This is a 4 star hotel that gives 5 star service, the quality of the hotel, the staff and the food was at a higher level than most 5 star hotels we've stayed at! How lovely not to have to queue up for a buffet breakfast but be served at the table by very attentive staff and the quality of the food was excellent. The room had top quality bedding, towels and dressing gowns, nice. Nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel very welcome, as my wife said she felt like the hotel gave us a hug as we entered. Can't wait to stay again and thank you to all the staff.",5,2022,05,12
105,Like Being Home,"I have been staying at the Chesterfield for almost 10 years now on my London trips, they are like family!  The location in Mayfair is perfect, quiet, sophisticated and close to everything.  The rooms are classy, the staff is fabulous and one of my favorite bars in the world.  I think most of the guests are regulars at this point as it seems everyone is well known to the staff. Best of all it is very reasonably priced especially for that part of London, could not recommend it more!",5,2022,05,11
105,weekend for wedding - fantastic friendly staff,"I went over with friends for my brother's wedding. the hotel is very centrally located and was convenient for us. Our experience was wonderful as the staff are exceptionally friendly, welcoming and helpful. Its a really warm experience.  We had breakfast - which was lovely and sometimes a few drinks in the bar. There were sometimes piano players and singers in the bar. There is a lovely pub opposite with nice bar food and also a lovely coffee shop round the corner for your daily fix - it also does cocktails. My room was comfortable and had everything you could need and was quiet. The walls seem to be thick. Very comfortable pillows",5,2022,05,11
105,Lovely Hotel in a Posh area of London,"We loved our stay here.  We booked two rooms- one room with two double beds for our teenage children and a king bedroom for my spouse and myself.  The hotel is in a quiet part of Mayfair. The hotel has period charm but has nice modern amenities.  The staff was excellent and helpful excluding.

The rooms were nice however I began to have an asthmatic episode due to an allergic reaction to dust and perhaps mold as those are the only things that trigger my asthma.  I called the front desk after the first night of not being able to breath even with my inhaler and asked the front desk for a room change.  They were so helpful and worked the same day to check availability in the hotel or another similar hotel.  They were able to get a more recently renovated room and the front desk even recommended switching to hypoallergenic sheets (which normally I don't need) but with both of these changes I felt better right away.  

When you book I would recommend requesting a street view and a recently renovated room.

We booked it through Costco travel so we didn't get these options while booking. 
The package included Breakfast every morning and 1 tea and dinner.

There was room service available during out stay.

The meals were excellent and the tea was spectacular.

The location is a bit out of the way, we had a 10-15 min uber to get to most city attractions but only a bit of a nuisance.  There are some very nice restaurants within walking distance as well.  

We had a wonderful time",4,2022,05,10
105,Quintessential British Hotel in Mayfair,"We had a lovely experience at this hotel. It is very quaint and feels very “British.” The neighborhood is really safe and walkable to many attractions, especially Hyde’s Park. The service was great as they would come by the room every night and turn down the beds and leave us water bottles! We were able to get good night’s sleeps in the comfy beds and quiet neighborhood. I would come back again!",5,2022,05,09
105,Birthday made special,"A wonderful trip for 4 ladies to celebrate a birthday.  Made so special by the wonderful Chesterfield Hotel.  Lovely ambience but more importantly ALL the staff treated us with such care, especially as we had a wheelchair user. So friendly and attentive, made us all feel like valued guests. A beautiful birthday cake greeted us in the room.  A big thank you to you all... we will be back",5,2022,05,09
105,Eric & Peter,"This hotel truly made our vacation in London a WONDERFUL experience.  The hotel itself is so charming and outstandingly British. The housekeeping is top notch! The staff is super friendly and always helpful.  The restaurant, Butler’s is exceptional! We seriously did not want to fly back to New York! This was one of the best weeks ever, in no small part to the Chesterfield Mayfair !",5,2022,05,09
105,I came to meet friends in London. We went to see a show.,"The location of the Chesterfield Mayfair is great, near the theatres, shopping and Green Park. I took advantage of all! The hotel itself is awesome. My room came with the fluffiest of robes, a whole selection of coffees, teas, cookies, and the bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The AC worked better than most hotels and WiFi was great. Emily at the reception was very professional and friendly. 

I come to London often and always stay at different hotels. I've been trying to find my favorite to use as a standard. I've finally found it in the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2022,05,08
105,Faded elegance - a London gem,"We have stayed at The Chesterfield several times since 2019 and it will always be our ‘go to’ hotel in London. One reason for choosing this hotel initially was that they provide valet parking - ideal for us, as we always drive up from South West England. Nestled in a quiet location in Mayfair, it is well located for anyone visiting the capital. Easy walking to many of London’s attractions. All staff are welcoming and attentive. The rooms are generally on the small side, but scrupulously clean & nicely furnished, with comfortable beds. There’s a cosy bar, with great service - ideal for a night-cap after an evening at the theatre. The restaurant provides excellent dining. All-in-all, quite a find!!",5,2022,05,07
105,Mother/Daughter trip,"My daughter and I first stayed here 3 years ago on a short stay in London, and when we were able to go back this year, it was our very first choice, and we can't wait to go back again.   The Chesterfield is a true gem.   Excellent location in Mayfair that is quiet, yet just a short walk to Bond St, Oxford St, Piccadilly, and Green Park (including the tube station).   If arriving at Paddington Station via the Heathrow Express, it is just a 10 minute taxi ride to arrive at the hotel.    We were warmly and personally greeted each and every time we left and returned for the day, which made for a very personal and welcoming touch.    They are eager to help with any arrangements that are needed, and make your stay a smooth and pleasant one.   Wonderful breakfast, very nice bed, linens, toiletries.    In a time where customer service is often lacking, the Chesterfield shines with outstanding personal customer service and attention.   I will also give a quick shout out to Jozsef in particular, who is a true treasure, and exemplifies the personal service that makes the Chesterfield the best hotel in London.   Well done!",5,2022,05,04
105,Best of London !!,"This was my 3rd visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair & once you stay here you will not ever look to stay anywhere else in central London.        
If you want great concierge, convenient location & a beautiful neighborhood, look no more.
The staff at the Chesterfield goes above & beyond to make your visit to London as smooth as possible.
Manager  Adam Lake is always helpful with any requests prior to arrival. His staff at the front desk 
is awesome with a shout out to Darren, who is beyond helpful. Concierge  are always willing to recommend local restaurants and make reservations in advance.  I can't say enough about this perfect quintessential British
property !

105,Just excellent…..,"The Chesterfield is a lovely hotel, run at five star standard all the way through, from the quality of bed linen, toiletries, standard of rooms and decor through to the amenities in the hotel. There is great attention to detail. The team of staff in the hotel is excellent, amenable, professional, friendly and clearly well trained, my experience was of a seamless service. I loved it. My room was extremely small but we’re in the heart of Mayfair so perhaps understandable, and there was no flat sheet on the bed, which I prefer. That aside, you are getting five star quality and service. So a big thanks to the team at the Chesterfield and I hope I have the opportunity to revisit.",5,2022,05,03
105,Birthday Celebration,Yet again a fantastic stay. Treated like royalty by everybody; as if we are here everyday and a familiar face. This time we spent Saturday evening truly comfortable in the bar listening to the singer with the piano. Amazing service and experience by everyone.,5,2022,04,28

105,Faultless!,"My wife and I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for a couple of nights in March as part of her 60th Birthday celebrations. From the moment we arrived to the day we left we found the staff to be so welcoming, accommodating and friendly...without being fawning!

This in itself would have been enough to justify the 5 star review, but every aspect of our stay, including the perfect location of the hotel, was faultless. 

My wife had another trip to London, with our daughter, booked for early April with another well rated hotel. Our previous stay at The Chesterfield was enough for us to cancel her booking and re-book again with The Chesterfield, despite an increase in cost. I am pleased to say that the two ladies in my life were not disappointed!

Many thanks to James, the deputy manager, in particular, and all the staff for looking after us so well on both occasions of our visit. We will look forward to seeing you all again the next time we are back in London.

105,A great hotel,We had such a lovely overnight stay at this hotel - only wish we had longer but will definitely re-visit.

105,Weekend break,"Our first time in this hotel and it was a great stay.  It’s dog friendly too so we were able to take our dog along with us.

The hotel is cozy, charming, and quaint. The location can’t be beat. We spent lovely evenings in the piano bar making new friends. Butler’s, the restaurant, has very good food with exceptional service- thank you, Richard! If we return to London, we would not consider anywhere else.",5,2022,04,22
105,Afternoon tea,"Wonderful welcome by all the staff 
The complementary drink was such a lovely touch 
Freshly made sandwiches were delicious 
My dislike to dried fruit was noted and we were given plain sones 
All the cakes were so delicious…our plates were all cleared….
And..we thoroughly enjoyed the bag of sweets that we left with…
Can’t wait to return…",5,2022,04,21
105,Hidden gem for a cream tea!,"My friend and I went here for a cream tea. We had the Sweet Shop tea with a glass of champagne.
The cakes are all based around sweets. If that sounds sickly to you I have to say it certainly was not. It was delightful. Amazing choice of teas to drink. Extremely attentive waiters who were amazing and friendly. No stuffed shirts there!
At the end you are invited to choose real sweeties from the sweet cart to take home, on the house. On the whole it was a brilliant theme and would definitely recommend. Will be going back!",5,2022,04,20
105,"Historic, lovely property with all amenities","This is a great location in the nicest neighborhood. The building was a 17th? century residence converted into a small, boutique hotel, and we loved the history. The employees are all very nice, although few were from England so did not know the answers to our London questions. We loved the robes and slippers and bath products. Our room was so LOVELY and the restaurant employees made us feel very special. We were also quite pleased with the food at Butler's.  We also did a children's and adult afternoon tea in the courtyard, which was really special. It is the perfect place to walk to many sights such as Hyde park, Buckingham palace, or the Big Bus green point stop. There is a Pret a Manger 1 block away for inexpensive fresh coffee/snacks. I would welcome any chance to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again!",5,2022,04,19
105,Great Location and Staff!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is in the perfect location. An easy 5 minute walk from the green park tube station makes it convenient to get anywhere.

105,A wonderfully friendly first class hotel.,"First time as guests of The Chesterfield Mayfair for a weekend London trip.
From first being met on our arrival to checking out we were treated with the utmost warm professionalism.

We are not wealthy or upper class and this trip was a treat for us - we were made to feel welcome and as valued as any other guest.

The facilities were excellent and the whole hotel has a quiet charm and cosy feel to it. 
The evening live music was fun and the cocktails sublime!
The only slight niggle was the sound of air conditioning units on the roof outside our room but.it was not intolerable.
The breakfast menu and servlce were absolutely first rate (we ate dinner out).

We really cannot commend the staff there too high, everyone was a consumate professional and nothing was too much trouble. 
We will rebook with the Chesterfield Mayfair  for our next London trip.

It is in such a great location close to the beautiful Green Park, major transit links and West End. 

Highly recommended!",5,2022,04,10
105,Best experience in London,"We stayed in the Chesterfield Hotel for a night with friends and we were so pleased with the warm, dog friendly welcome.
From the moment we stepped in we were looked after and everybody had so much time to fuss over the dog. We had amazing cocktails at the bar, breakfast was great and plenty, but the thing that really makes this hotel is the service from the staff at every turn. Definitely want to come back again!
Hope to see you all soon!",5,2022,04,10
105,Wow!,"This has to be one of the best places to stay in London, from arriving to departing the care and thought that goes in to the service you receive is outstanding.. Michael, Lisa and Nicole are a huge credit to this hotel, along with every other person that works here. The hotel is quint essentially British and has a real sense of class, the room was brilliant, the little things you don’t always get you get here, the attention to detail from topping up the water and changing the towels when we went out last night then woke this morning to find was brilliant! Breakfast was superb, again service, attention to detail and the quality of food was perfect. We will be back again and again!!

The ro service did a great job and provided a turn down service which was a nice touch.  The rooms were very clean, a bit smaller than we are used to in the us though.  The bathroom was really nice. The location is great.  You can walk to Hyde park, Buckingham palace, and Piccadilly pretty easily.  There is a train stop very close as well to get to everything else, which I would recommend, since using the train was very easy.  If we make it back to London we will be staying here again.",5,2022,04,07
105,Amazing Experience,"What a brilliant hotel. Situated in the centre of Mayfair, ideal for all London attractions. Staff wonderful - every single one we met. Will stay again!!

Breakfast was delicious & the service was prompt & friendly, it amazed me to see the wonderful breakfast team in action, especially as it was a busy time with many guests, Alex looked after us & we found him to be charming & friendly.
The bar has a wonderful charm & atmosphere both daytime & evening.  All the bar staff were attentive & Ellie took a genuine interest in our plans for the evening.  They have a very talented pianist, John in the evening, who really adds to an already charming atmosphere. 
All the Concierge Team always welcomed you back at the end of each day with a smile. 
Our room was so comfortable & they think of all the little things that add to your stay, including a lovely welcome card from Adam, the GM.  Beautiful Floris bathroom amenities added to the feeling of being pampered.  The scent in the public areas was a delight to the senses, I’d love it in my own home!

105,The best Hotel in London,"We have stayed in many Hotels in London, but always come back to The Chesterfield.

It really is a home from home.

Perfect location in the middle of Mayfair, very close to Green Park underground.

Strides away from Shepherd Market - a hidden oasis !!

The rooms are lovely, comfortable and quiet.

But its the staff that are the real difference - friendly, warm and really go the extra mile.

The bar is a delight - nothing better than a night cap, listening to John the pianist.

Breakfast is a la carte and the range and quality of dishes is superb. Eggs Benedict for me !!

The Chesterfield really is the best Hotel in London and I can thoroughly recommend it - you won't be disappointed.",5,2022,04,06
105,Birthday Treat for my Mum,"Researched this hotel due to its location (close to Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park) and as we were going to the Palladium to see a show, I knew my mum couldn’t walk too far, this hotel seemed to be in the perfect place, and I quite liked the look of the hotel rooms too. 

On arrival, greeted by the doorman, asked if I’d like my luggage to be stored and proceeded to check in, our rooms weren’t quite ready so we lounged in their bar where we had posh coffees and complimentary nibbles. 

Lisa M, front of House Manager was so attentive and made sure our stay was perfect, nothing was too much for her and she went above and beyond looking after us.
 
This was a treat for my mum for her birthday, once we settled into our suite, we were pleasantly surprised when my mum was presented with a cute birthday cake and card. It’s the little touches like this that made mum feel extra special. 

The room was immaculate, spacious and full of character, we had twin beds and 2 bathrooms. 
The beds were comfy and the linens super soft, we slept really well. The room had a great selection of Twining Teas, hot chocolate and cafetière coffee, plus the instant stuff, and posh bottled water.  We stayed in the Curzon suite. 

The area is really quiet, we couldn’t hear any traffic. 

Our breakfast was included in the price of the room, we both had a full English, it was super tasty and set us up for the day, it wasn’t greasy and the portions was plenty for us. 

Thank you, I’m sure we will visit you again!",5,2022,04,05
105,Great hotel in a great location,We stayed at the Chesterfield for 3 nights in February to celebrate my wife's birthday. The room we were in was their lowest grade but was still very good and perfectly adequate to a 3 night stay. The toiletries was of good quality and shower very powerful. We ate at the hotel on one evening and found the food to be excellent. The waiting staff were very friendly. After arriving quite late (11pm) one evening we found the bar was still open and they were happy to provide us with food from the bar menu. Overall a really good hotel in Mayfair where we would be happy to return.,5,2022,04,05
105,Afternoon Tea,We enjoyed a very nice afternoon tea. They offered a variety of teas and the food was very yummy. Everyone was friendly and polite which made our stay very pleasant. I would definitely come back for the afternoon tea!,5,2022,04,05
105,Whiskey tasting at the Terrace Bar,"A really nice late afternoon at the Terrace Bar with a small group of friends for a whisky tasting session. The Bar manager Adrian was friendly , helpful and attentive. We all enjoyed the whisky and hung around the bar for a few drinks afterwards. 
The bar had a really nice relaxed atmosphere although it did start to fill up quite quickly around 6pm at which point it was starting to get a little more upbeat and loud. 
I couldn't find fault and will visit again.",5,2022,04,04
105,Another Great Stay at The Chesterfield,"This was our 3rd stay at the Chesterfield from the States and it once again did not disappoint.  If you are looking for a boutique style hotel providing a British experience with excellent and friendly service, look no further. The hotel is an excellent location in the heart of Mayfair with excess access to tourist sites, the tube and excellent parks.  The hotel bar is a great setting for an evening cocktail with impeccable service. I would also opt for the breakfast package is it is convenient and high quality.  The rooms are not the largest, but they are quite comfortable and more than functional.  Highly recommended!",5,2022,04,03
105,Afternoon Tea,"We loved the afternoon tea here! Great selection of sandwiches, the tomato bread cheese and ham sandwich was especially delicious! The scones are so soft and the chocolate scone was so cake like and gorgeous. All the little treats were lovely to. If you like something in particular then they will bring you more of it! The staff were the highlight, so attentive, kind and welcoming. Would recommend to everyone!",5,2022,04,03
105,Fabulous Afternoon Teac,My daughter treated me to afternoon tea as a Mothers Day present. Absolutely lovely & every member of staff were very attentive & made sure we had a great time .

105,"Charming, Excellent Staff, Luxurious, Good Value","Wonderful staff, very nice rooms, great location, very good food (except for the afternoon tea). It feels grander and more luxuriously old-fashioned than I was expecting for the price. Rooms are small but have everything you need; we were on the 7th floor and had great big windows, wonderful light. Bed was super comfortable, linens are top-notch, room has all the little touches you want like a robe. The breakfast and dinner were surprisingly very good. Can't say enough good things about the incredibly sweet, sincere, charming staff who go out of their way to provide friendly personalized service. The afternoon tea is a bit tacky -   a phony Disneyland version of tea and kind of junky. Other than that it was a wonderful experience.",5,2022,04,01
105,All Class,"In loved staying at the Chesterfield, a beautiful hotel in the best location. Fabulous decor and colourful warmth. Awesome lounge and bar. Great atmosphere and a pianist playing subtle background music. Staff were wonderful and helped with booking an afternoon tea at Browns and the musical show Six. Not forgetting  the delicious breakfast.",5,2022,04,01
105,5 Stars for Chesterfield!,"I have traveled a lot in my life and I stayed in London many times, but my experience at The Chesterfield is at the top!  The central location is super strategic for visiting London on foot or by tube.  The hotel is very large, clean, elegant and welcoming. The very competent and professional staff immediately puts you at ease.

The bar was beautiful.  Excellent place to get a few hours of work in and to enjoy a nice round of cocktails.

The rooms you get are large and clean, the products they provide you in the rooms are refined and of quality.

This hotel has everything you are looking for for a relaxing trip, without sacrificing luxury and well-being for your person.  10 out of 10, whole-heartedly recommend!",5,2022,04,01
105,The Chesterfield Experience is Unmatched,"I cannot praise this hotel enough. It was excellent.  Some key highlights:  The Chesterfield is in a perfect location (right in the middle of Mayfair, centrally located to the Underground and within walking distance to many of London's key attractions).  The grounds are absolutely charming and the hotel rooms are perfect.  Most importantly, the Chesterfield Team was wonderful and incredibly welcoming.  Thanks in particular to the following team members who made my experience at The Chesterfield so great:

-- Naomi (The One Who Wears Many Hats):  I do not have enough space to describe how wonderful Naomi is.  I ended up at the Chesterfield after my flights home were unexpectedly cancelled.  Under usual circumstances, I'd give my left kidney to stay extra days in London, but I needed to get back home for a family emergency.  Needless to say, I was upset and frantic when I phoned The Chesterfield.  Naomi went above and beyond, not only making sure I had excellent accommodations, but she treated me like a dear friend.  She has completely recalibrated what it means to be a good person for me.  Thank you, Naomi.  The Chesterfield is lucky to have you!

-- Anna (Reception):  Anna, it was such a treat being greeted with your warmth and charm!  You instantly made me feel at home.  Thank you for your assistance in getting me in the most perfect room for my stay.  You are an excellent example of what a front desk agent should be.

--Jozsef (Porter):  JOZSEF!  Thank you for always greeting me with a smile.  You looked after me like royalty, but most importantly, you made me feel safe.  I really appreciate you checking in to make sure I was doing okay and asking if I needed anything.  Being alone in a foreign city, you can't know how much that meant to me.

-- Jake (Concierge):  Thank you for answering my million questions, and for not making me feel like a nuisance asking them :)  Your level of service was first class - polite, welcoming, and genuinely interested in me as a guest and traveler.",5,2022,04,01
105,Short Break,My wife and I  had a very pleasant two night break in this hotel. Location is superb - within easy walking distance of so much that the typical visitor to London might wish to see and of restaurants in the Shepherd Market area which is just around the corner off Curzon Street. From Reception through to Housekeeping all the staff we met had the perfect blend of friendliness and helpfulness without that cloying obsequiousness you sometimes get in quality hotels. Take a bow everyone: you are a great team. The decor is 'of its time' but charming nonetheless. We would definitely stay again.,4,2022,03,30
105,Weekend,Stayed here two nights and what a place!! We was looked after like royalty from the moment we walking through the door.. nothing for the guys was to much and never was made to feel like we was in the way.,5,2022,03,30

105,Lovely Hotel with excellent staff.,"We arrived late Friday afternoon at The Chesterfield Mayfair to be greeted warmly by a lovely young lady at the reception. After checking in she wished us a good evening at Tamarind, an excellent Indian restaurant. Our room was lovely and breakfast good. On checking out the next morning a different member of asked about our evening at the restaurant. It was a nice surprise and what seems to be typical of this very good team of staff at The Chesterfield. A throughly nice hotel and highly recommended.",5,2022,03,28
105,Little Gem of a hotel,"Me and my partner had a fantastic 2 night stay here, the staff are so friendly & accommodating.

The staff are like family and unbelievably the best in the world!",5,2022,03,26
105,Amazing and cosy home away from home...,"This is our third visit to the Chesterfield.  Nestled in the heart of Mayfair, it proves to be one of the most satisfying and endearing hotel experiences we have ever experienced.   The main reason is the family-like staff who constantly impress and are never without a smile and a solution to any question or request.  In particular, the doorman Jozsef is notably helpful and kind.  Another person who I would acclaim is James, the Deputy GM who could not be more accessible or helpful.  We could not imagine staying in any other London hotel.",5,2022,03,26
105,Excellent stay in Mayfair,"Great experience in Mayfair. I really enjoyed this hotel, very nice room, clean and quite spacious. Large wardrobes and good desk space for work.

105,We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London,"After a two-year gap because of the coronavirus pandemic, we were able to return to The Chesterfield for another enjoyable visit. As always, every member of staff - from Reception to Restaurant, Concierge to Chambermaid - was helpful, friendly and willing to go the extra mile without being intrusive.

Rooms are well-equipped, spotlessly clean and very comfortable, with good quality bedlinen - and feather/down pillows, not something you can always expect in a hotel these days! Breakfasts are excellent, with a wide choice from the a la carte menu and exemplary table service.

Quite honestly, we wouldn't stay anywhere else when we visit London and we look forward to our next visit there.",5,2022,03,19

105,Hidden Gem in London,"Came to Chesterfield to meet some friends at the Terrace Bar who were staying there for a couple of nights. I heard the best so my expectations was really high! They didn’t disappoint at all. The receptionist was really friendly and informative. Once we stepped into the Terrace bar we were greeted and showed our table. A lovely lady was playing the piano and we really enjoyed it!
Lukas who took care of us was such a gentleman. Checking on us whenever he had the chance, made us excellent  cocktails, especially the signature cocktail named “Passion for chilli ”.  
Whenever we are back in London we are definitely staying at the Chesterfield!!",5,2022,03,16
105,Wonderful place,First time we have stayed here after a recommendation from a friend who lives nearby.

105,Fabulous stay,"Stayed in another Carnation hotel previously, so knew the Chesterfield would be lovely. The location is fabulous- Mayfair is stunning. Beautiful buildings, gorgeous Berkeley Square, and plenty of Ferrari’s & Lamborghini’s to admire!

The hotel is just a short walk to Green Park Station which makes it incredibly easy to get round London.

My room (Classic Double) was a tad small for me, but was lovely. The bed was wonderfully cosy & comfortable, the shower is fabulous with lovely luxury toiletries. 

The staff are friendly, helpful and nothing is too much for them. Staying here again in April. Can’t wait!",5,2022,03,08
105,Beautiful Traditional Hotel in a Fantastic Location with Amazing Staff,"We recently stayed at this hotel for a short family break, which included afternoon tea at The Ritz. The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Mayfair and is an original traditional English hotel. Absolutely beautiful throughout and wonderful staff.

If you are looking for a traditional, classy hotel with the friendliest staff, then here it is. The location is ideal for Mayfair, Bond Street and Oxford Street.

It has a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere and offers a service which is beyond expectation.  The staff are warm, friendly and welcoming.   Butler’s, the hotel restaurant, is a ‘must’ to visit, if only for the wonderful breakfasts it provides.
Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2022,03,01
105,Afternoon tea,"Took my best friend out for tea at Chesterfield Mayfair. The whole experience was more than perfect. From the main door we were warmly greeted, while our coats were taken and were invited to have a sit as we arrived early. We were welcomed and invited to our table by Denisa. She and Eleonora went above and beyond to help and advise so we can make the most out of our experience. Our table was in the conservatory area very cosy and welcoming. Everything from the tea, the sandwiches, the scones, the small cakes and  sweet treats from the cart were delicious and can't be faulted.  Thank you for looking after us and allowed us to be spoiled.",5,2022,02,28

105,The ultimate British hotel experience,My son and I spent 3 days at this wonderful British hotel.  The staff ( Jake) and so many others went out of their way to be helpful and courteous.  we would end the evenings in the hotel bar with a late evening cocktail while listening to piano music by a nice gentleman attired in his tuxedo.  Wish I could give this hotel 6 stars! Highly recommend,5,2022,02,26
105,"Horrible bathrooms, ok rooms, very unkind staff","The hotel is very old, the rooms are normal but the bathrooms are horrible, when you take a shower everything, I mean everything gets wet! We complained about this situation and they changed our room, but the noise from the hotel staff and guests in this new room was very loud and made it hard to sleep from about 6 am, that they started moving outside! 
The staff members where not very nice, only Nicole and Felipe were nice, everyone else did not want to help and they let you know it with their body language and expressions! 
We did not have a nice stay here, as we did not feel welcome, would not recommend this hotel at all!",2,2022,02,26
105,Excellent stay !!,"Location is perfect in the heart of Mayfair and 5 mins walk to Bond Street.

105,The Chesterfield Mayfair is extraordinary!,"In 2015, I visited the Chesterfield Mayfair with my mother, daughter & aunt.  My memories of this hotel stayed with me so I decided to book again when my husband and I traveled to London this February 2022.  It is located in a perfect location and is quintessentially British.  The staff was simply exceptional, and Jake was the best concierge we have ever had.  Our room was absolutely lovely and well maintained every single day.  Afternoon tea was exceptional as was breakfast and dinner.  British hospitality at its finest!",5,2022,02,22
105,Nicole Giada and Eleonora are so absolutely fantastic!,"My husband and I came just to have drinks at the hotel, but overwhelmed with how wonderful the service is at this lovely establishment.

Nicole, Giada and Eleonora were at the reception desk and I couldn't believe how darling and attentive they were!

Also, Adrian, who waited on us for drinks is an eceptional person, i watched him dealing with everyone in the bar in a way that was so diplomatic and professional.

Chesterfield has a superb team!  Thank you!!",5,2022,02,22
105,Exceptional team,"I thoroughly enjoyed a three night stay in a junior suite this weekend. The most outstanding feature of the hotel is the warmth and professionalism of the team. Whilst the physical hotel is lovely, the facilities are excellent, the restaurant and bar are great I keep coming back to the quality of the team, Just to mention three, Jake was notable for the warmth of his welcome and his attention to detail, Ellie in the bar was just lovely and Farzah in the restaurant a delight.

105,Old English style and service - excellent,"4 night stay was glorious in this good old style service quality establishment.

Staff were all superb, deluxe room

Location excellent for Hyde park and theatre land (without being too central) and the general ambience of the locale was upmarket.

Will return.",5,2022,02,19
105,Just Wow!,"I took my daughter for a night away as we'd recently had a holiday cancelled and she had done really well in recent exams, so I wanted to treat her. We had a look at various London hotels online and she fell in love with The Chesterfield Mayfair. Before our arrival, I initially wanted to book afternoon tea at the hotel but then changed my mind and decided on dinner instead. I emailed initially about the tea and then called about the dinner as I realised the night I had chosen happened to be Valentines Day and getting a table at the hotel restaurant might not be that easy. From both methods of communication, I was well looked after. Despite the Chesterfield not having a table for afternoon tea, the concierge had already checked if their sister hotel had space and emailed me back to offer a table there instead. The lady who I had spoken to on the phone regarding dinner hang up to speak to the restaurant and managed to secure a table for 6.30pm which was ideal timing as my daughter is 10. She called me back and emailed me when she couldn't get hold of me. She also couldn't have been friendlier or more welcoming.
We arrived before check in time to drop our bags which was dealt with quickly and professionally. When we arrived back, my daughter was excited to have the taxi door opened by such a smart gentleman who we later learned was Joszef. Joszef looked after us from check in, taking our luggage to our room, charging my phone when I'd misplaced my cable, showing us where to go in the evening and for breakfast, to putting our luggage in the taxi home. It almost felt like he was there just for us! When we arrived in the room we decided to have a hot drink but realised there was no milk. I phoned Guest Services and in under 5 minutes Christine arrived with multiple pots of milk. On seeing my daughter, she then returned with a teddy and extra biscuits, including chocolate ones as my daughter had said they were her favourite when Christine asked. Yet another personal touch to make our stay so special. Everything in the room was scrupulously clean, tidy and comfortable. In the evening we went down to the bar. I hadn't thought to book and it was busy but a table was found for us and before long we had a cocktail/mocktail to start off our evening. At 6.30pm we went to Butlers Restaurant and were shown to our table which was beautifully set and we were looked after so well by Eleonora B. All questions about the menu and requested amendments were made without any problems. My daughter was keen on a virgin mojito and one was procured from the bar without delay. I asked Eleonora to recommend a wine and gave her my likes and dislikes. The chardonnay she recommended was delicious and complemented my meal perfectly. The food was delectable and by the end of two courses I was full! We returned to the bar for a nightcap and enjoyed a decaf Espresso Martini and another virgin mojito (apparently the best ever according to my 10 year old!) before retiring to our room. Even then, our adventure wasn't quite over. My daughter was curious about the library that she'd seen signposted, so before we headed upstairs, we peered in the window of the door only for a member of staff to see us and open the door to show us the space! Nothing seemed too much trouble for anyone that worked there. We had a great night's sleep in comfy beds. In the morning I had a shower, I wish my shower at home was as good as the one in this bathroom! Breakfast was delicious, it's all to order rather than a buffet. The croissant and French Toast I had were excellent and my daughter enjoyed her toast and cinnamon swirl. On check out we had a lovely chat with Joszef and the ladies at reception who both spoke multiple languages and were very engaging. I can't say that our stay was cheap but nothing was overpriced and it was worth every penny. We can't wait to go back!",5,2022,02,17
105,Friendly and efficient service.,"From initial enquiries to checking in at this hotel I was extremely impressed by the reception and concierge teams.
Travelling on business with vehicles to park and unusual times to check in and out of hotels can sometimes be difficult in London.
Not so here, the staff were efficient, friendly and very welcoming.
The room was great and the food delivered via room service was delicious.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,02,17

105,A real find in a chic part of town,"Lovely hotel in the heart of Mayfair close to some very chic restaurants and stores. The room was compact but well-equipped but the most impressive thing about the hotel were the staff - reception, bar and restaurant staff were all fantastic! So welcoming, eager to please and helpful - certainly not common in central London. We will definitely return!",5,2022,02,15
105,Quintessential gem in Mayfair!,"This hotel is better than some of the 5* hotels in London. The service was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. My boyfriend and I had made plans on the day that we were supposed to check out, which meant that we would not able to enjoy the lovely breakfast at the butlers restaurant. The hotel allowed us to have the breakfast a day earlier (the check in day) instead, so that we wouldn’t miss out! 
We initially checked into room 104 (classic double room) and as nice as it is, we kept hearing what sounded like chairs dragging across the floor above continuously. We called the reception about this and they offered a room change immediately. We ended up staying at room 606 and it was absolutely wonderful. I loved the decor - very quintessential English and modern enough to be comforting. 
I highly recommend this hotel and would totally come back.",5,2022,02,14
105,As always great,"Stayed here for the 3rd time with my wife. Always a great stay and always very personal with each guest that comes through this lovely hotels doors.

Please keep your phones close and open your emails as I'll be in touch shortly for another stay !!! 

Thanks again

105,Customer Service … Par Excellence,"We had a most memorable stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair … celebrating 2 birthdays. All the staff, led by Lisa, were so obliging … from the greet by the doorman, to the first drinks in the bar, the check in and making sure we were very happy with the rooms, to the waiter served breakfasts … it was all such a pleasant experience. This must be the friendliest hotel in Central London",5,2022,02,14
105,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at the hotel overnight after taking my brother and his wife for tea at the Ritz. From the moment we first walked into the hotel we were greeted by wonderful staff who couldn’t do enough for you. The staff in the bar and restaurant gave wonderful service, quickly and always with a smile. The one thing l didn’t like if lm being picky was there was a lady playing the piano and singing in the bar lounge area. The bar is not that big and to be honest at times you couldn’t hear yourself think so obviously everyone was trying to shout over everyone else talking to make themselves heard, it would have been more comfortable if she had just been playing the piano. Having said that what a wonderful time we had, room lovely, staff so kind and helpful and l would highly recommend this hotel. In fact we hope to come back for a longer stay nearer Christmas this hotel is a hidden gem. Thank you so much.",5,2022,02,10

12pm check out which was so nice not to rush and then left cases all day to go shopping until we were ready to head home..

We had room 405, a Superior King which was pretty tight with 2 big cases but thankfully they stood up in the 2  wardrobes. Nice big bed. 
Very bright lights on both telephone terminals which I had to strategically cover along with TV and other light around the room. 

Breakfast was excellent. Everything was order only including juice, yogurt, pastries etc which is quite rare but it didn't bother us. 
I think it got a little out of hand as some people just kept ordering more and more, especially towards the end when the kitchen was trying to close. 
Took several staff to keep on top of (breakfast was a fixed price I think) 

Would happily recommend to anyone

105,An Incredible Stay!,The Chesterfield Mayfair was so much more than I expected. The staff were amazingly polite and super accommodating. We used the hotel as our base for travelling around in and out of London and each time they welcomed us back as though we were part of the Chesterfield family. I could not rate this hotel high enough. Thank you for an incredible stay. I will be back time and time again!,5,2022,02,08
105,"Gin, Whiskey and Rum tasting experience","My wife, her sister and I were recently treated to a tasting experience at the Chesterfield Hotel, and it was both enjoyable and fascinating! When we arranged the date, we were asked which of the three options we wanted to choose; you can have gin, rum, or whiskey. As there were three of us, we decided to go for one each and, throwing covid caution to the wind (we are family!), we each tried a sip of them all. 
We weren’t sure what to expect when we arrived, we had heard good things, and had high hopes, but we didn’t know what it would entail outside of trying the spirits. Adrian, the bar manager, greeted us warmly and professionally before showing us to our seats. We were offered a drink to start while he set up the experience around us. We were astounded! It was so well thought through and every tiny detail had been thought of. Each of the tastings came with its own set up so the table was plentiful with beautifully presented drinks; we were even shown a small distiller, the name of which now escapes me; it was brilliant! Out of the three, the gin was the most elegantly presented with so much detail having gone into the presentation, but the rum and whiskey were not far behind and equally pleasing. 
The tasting itself included 3 gins for the gin option, 4 rums for the rum and 4 whiskeys for the whiskey, but it wasn’t just about the tasting. This was not your normal tasting experience where you go to the venue and it’s over in a flash, no; Adrian took you through the origins of each spirit and the brand and gave you, what seemed to be, a complete education on all matters relating to the spirit you were drinking. I left feeling ten times more knowledgeable than before and weirdly smug knowing that I will now be able to teach all my friends how to properly smell a gin! We learned so much from Adrian, and he described all the fascinating details with such passion. His passion for the subject was intoxicating; he said at the beginning to let him know if he was talking to much… we wanted him to talk more! His knowledge and expertise were superb, the tasters were delightful, and his company was very welcome indeed. 
I would highly recommend that anyone try the tasting experience. My wife hates whiskey but even she found herself appreciating it a little more, and she loved the rum and gin. There’s a flavour for everyone and it is a brilliant way to spend an hour or two in an afternoon or evening. Thanks so much Adrian and the Chesterfield.",5,2022,02,07
105,Wonderful from start to finish,"We recently stayed at the hotel as a couple wanting a short break in London. 
The hotel staff were faultless couldn’t do enough for you and so friendly as well. 
The decor was authentic and quintessential British style which we loved. 
The food was amazing as well we really enjoyed the breakfast and an evening meal there. 
Would definetly return for another visit .",5,2022,02,07
105,A wonderful hotel full of love,"I booked a one night's stay for my parents 40th wedding anniversary on the 5th Feb 2022. As we entered the Chesterfield Hotel the conceirge were very welcoming and friendly. The receptionist who's name I think was Orla checked them in and gave my parents a tour of this wonderful hotel. The manager Lisa also was so freindly and approved a room upgrade for my parent's too. How amazing is that!
All the staff are so freindly and warm. The piano bar is beautiful and the my parents loved sitting there after their night out and enjoyed liste6n to some Motown numbers on the piano.

Thank you to all the staff and for my parents surprise anniversary cake which was left in their room with a card from all the staff..

You guys are amazing and you are the heart of the Chesterfield Hotel.

Thank you so much..

105,"Wonderful stay, with bags of old world charm.","Faultless service and facilities from arrival to departure. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world over and this ranks with the best. The attention to detail with an old world charm, has made this a very memorable stay - just wonderful!!  Thank-you.",5,2022,02,06
105,Phenomenal Experience!,"From the bellman to the concierge to the bartenders, everything was absolutely incredible! I would highly recommend staying here! The breakfast was also amazing! Mayfair is also an incredibly centralized area, so this is fantastic.",5,2022,02,05
105,Super sweet afternoon tea,"My sister-in-law and I enjoyed The Original Sweetshop afternoon tea last Sunday. We were warmly greeted as we arrived before our coats were taken and we were shown to a lovely table in the conservatory area. I would recommend asking for a table in this area, rather than the restaurant as the area is bright and airy and adds to the atmosphere. We decided to upgrade to add a glass of champagne and this was no issue at all. Throughout our afternoon we enjoyed all sorts of sweet treats including a chocolate scone, drumstick macaroon and peanut butter cup. This is definitely a menu for those who have a very sweet-tooth as the menu is pretty rich but we loved the novelty of it. The fruit salad tea should definitely be tried as this was delicious. All the staff were amazing but a special mention must go to Faizah. In terms of customer service, she went above and beyond. She was attentive, helpful, great fun and definitely made the whole experience even better. Highly recommend an afternoon at The Chesterfield.",5,2022,02,01
105,"Excuse me, Tripadvisor, but where is your 6th star?","Last weekend, January 22nd, I had the pleasure of returning to The Chesterfield Mayfair. My husband and I have been lucky enough to stay before, to visit for afternoon tea and on many occasions, to visit their bar, and it has never been anything short of wonderful. But this time was different... it wasn’t wonderful… it exceeded wonderful. It was such a perfect experience that, if it wasn't for the flowers sitting next to me as I write this, and the birthday balloon bopping around my head, you could very easily convince me that it was some glorious dream.

Back in December my husband knew that I had a very big celebration coming up and asked me where I'd like to go; without even having to think about it, I said The Chesterfield. He agreed that this was a great idea and reached out to a few of the hotel team to make the arrangements. Adam and his team were quick to respond and super helpful; everything you could want from a Mayfair Hotel. They kept in touch with him right up until the big day to make sure everything was in order. They even had a secret email trail going on, unbeknown to me, to arrange a surprise for me on the big day. They went to absolutely every effort to make sure I had the best day ever. 

Once we arrived, I was swiftly greeted by the concierge team, bags removed from us and taken straight to the room, and Sam, the head of events, met us in the reception to show us through to the area we had reserved in the bar. Everything was set up ready for us, well in advance, and the team were all on hand to cater to our every whim. It was a jaw droppingly good start to the day. I've never had that kind of greeting at a hotel in my life. I was humbled by the experience. All these truly genuine and friendly individuals, taking the time to greet me and make sure me and my family were happy. It was quite literally second to none. 

Once the party kicked off in the bar, they only continued to impress. Adrian the bar manager has always been exceptional... I didn't think it was possible to exceed exceptional, but he somehow managed it. He managed the room with a subtle elegance and was somehow able to consistently read my mind through the course of the afternoon. What an asset to the team he is. Friendly, confident, skilled and the perfect gentleman. He gracefully weaved in and out of my 30 something guests with ease, and no one was left wanting. 

Another point to mention was the room. Oh my word... the room! We had the absolute pleasure of staying in the Philippe Suite and let me start by staying... we are not worthy. It was drop. dead. gorgeous. So good, in fact, that I was annoyed with myself for being tipsy (understatement of the year...) when I got back to the room. I felt it didn't allow me to bask in its gloriousness. There isn't enough time in the world for that. So naturally, I've told my husband we are going again. Yes. Told. It's that important to me! 

As for the food, we ordered a selection of canapes for the guests and had the breakfast the following day. As with everything we have previously had at the Chesterfield, it did not disappoint. In fact, I don't think I've ever had canapes that I've liked that much. If you have the chance to grab the in-room canapes when you visit, do so. They are exquisite little mouthfuls of heaven. 

Absolutely everything about our stay was perfect. The team even gave me a birthday balloon, birthday cocktails designed just for me and flowers in my room. Extra little bonuses that other hotels just don't seem to think about. They would all do well to take a leaf out of Chesterfield's book. They don't just value their customers; they do everything in their power to make their customers FEEL valued. And I felt it! We have been previously told that ""Chesterfield is your second home"" and were again on Saturday. This is completely true. You could go to the bar and read all day if you wanted, and not be bothered, but similarly you could have a party with 30 of your friends and have everything you need. The Chesterfield Team make sure that they are what you need them to be. It's truly exceptional. 

I had only one negative moment in the whole experience, and that was the moment I walked out of the doors to go home. I've genuinely had post party/weekend blues since Sunday, and we are now speedily approaching Wednesday. I actually think I’ll still be sulking about being back home next weekend. Words cannot express how perfect everything is at the Chesterfield. The team make you feel like family, the food and drink is gorgeous, the ambience is elegant and stylish and the decor is something out of a romance novel. I can quite easily say, in fact I've been telling everyone who will listen since Saturday, the Chesterfield Mayfair is, and probably always will be, my favourite hotel of all time.",5,2022,01,25
105,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel far exceeded my expectations having stayed in eight of the top rated hotels in London over the last 12 months this was by far the best.

The staff are amazing as well as the front of house management very polite & helpful and go out of there way to make sure you have a good stay over.

The restaurant was also amazing great staff and amazing food at a reasonable price.

I would like to say the chefs are excellent and deserve to be thanked for producing a fantastic evening meal & breakfast.

Our room was very clean & comfortable with all the additional extras with a very comfortable bed.

So as you can see from my review I highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely return.

One thing I can advise is to upgrade your room if it is within your budget it really makes a difference to your stay and gives you a few extra luxuries and some space.

Hope this helps.
Thank you Chesterfield for a great stay.

Steve & Jewels Uk London based.",5,2022,01,24
105,Great staff,We had a lovely afternoon tea at the Orginal sweetshop. What made it extra special were the staff. So smiley and singing happy birthday to different families but with the enthusiasm that made each person feel special. Rafal in particular had a wonderful attitude. He was fantastic with the kids and had smiley eyes. It is so rare nowadays!,5,2022,01,24
105,The prefect London base,"I cannot recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair highly enough.
Over our 4 week stay in the UK we used the hotel as our base as we travelled in and out of London. The staff were so accommodating and nothing was ever too much trouble.
The service was impeccable, as were the rooms, location and the overall energy and atmosphere of the hotel.
Do yourself a favour and stay here whilst you are in London.",5,2022,01,21
105,Amazing hotel !,I stayed at the Chesterfield recently with my mum for her 60th birthday. It has been one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff’s attitude and politeness was second to none and the room was beautiful and so comfortable. They even left mum a little birthday cake and a card which was as a lovely gesture. I would highly recommend staying here it’s a perfect location for exploring London too .,5,2022,01,20
105,Rudi is the star,"Fabulous food and superb service from Rudi - a true professional , who completely understands and anticipates a customer’s needs ( a rare commodity ).  Would thoroughly recommend and will visit again in the very near future.
Food was fresh and menu was broad. Linen napkins- a triumph!",5,2022,01,19
105,Amazing Place,"We stayed for just one night but wish it had been longer.  Incredible hotel, incredible service, wonderful team. We had a very slight issue which was dealt with above and beyond what anyone would expect!",5,2022,01,16
105,A heavenly night's sleep!,"I enjoyed a lovely 1-night stay at The Chesterfield. . .the staff were all lovely, the breakfast gorgeous, but what I'll remember most is the fabulous bed, pillows and 600 count (I'm guessing) monogrammed bedlinen. . .like being cuddled by angels ; )",5,2022,01,14
105,A deliciously sweet time at The Chesterfield,"The staff at The Chesterfield Mayfair are graciously friendly and courteous which makes the afternoon tea experience joyful and relaxed. The staff simply can't do enough to make you comfortable to ensure you have a wonderful time.

The afternoon tea is deliciously sweet, beautifully presented and includes great attention to detail as a dining experience.
There is a relaxed and also luxurious ambiance to the venue that easily caters to small groups of friends, large groups of families and couples who attend to celebrate a special occasion. a
This was a birthday gift purchased for me and the experience was thoroughly enjoyable and I would certainly recommend it!",4,2022,01,09
105,Lovely hotel,Stayed here over New Year. The staff are lovely as are the rooms and the overall ambience is good. Food in the bar and Butlers Restaurant was excellent. Would definitely stay again when we need as base in Mayfair.,5,2022,01,09
105,Afternoon tea,"We had a wonderful long awaited due to covid, afternoon tea experience.  From the moment we arrived we were taken care of nothing being too much trouble.  Loved the pick and mix trolley as a 'sweet' touch at the end and Loris was so lovely and engaging as a host as were all of the staff when nothing seemed too much trouble.  We would go again....",5,2022,01,07
105,"Lovely hotel, but what really made our stay was the staff.","I really can not praise this hotel highly enough. The location, first of all, is obviously very convenient, especially with children, being close to two parks. The food is good. Although we only ate breakfast, Christmas lunch, and afternoon tea at the hotel, what we had was delicious. The room we were in was lovely, spacious, and comfortable. We had a suite, which was perfect for our family, as the living area could easily accommodate one boy on the sofa and the other on a cot bed, and there was a wall, with a door, separating the bedroom. One must remember that this is a small-ish hotel, and so the common areas are going to be smaller than they would be at a larger hotel, but not wanting to inflict our very loud children on the other guests we avoided these where possible. The pièce de resistance of this hotel, really, is the staff. Lisa at the front desk was so thoughtful and did everything she could to ensure we enjoyed our stay, including ringing us up in our room before her shift ended to ask if there was anything else we needed before she left for the night. There were stockings, and presents for the boys, in the room and at Christmas lunch. The doormen, the concierge, the porters, and the waitstaff at the restaurant were all superb. I wouldn't change a thing. Well done to you all.",5,2022,01,06
105,"Loris, Maurizia and Eleonora made my family’s NYE🥂🎊","The food, the mood, and the service were none other than exceptional. Everything was prepared with finesse down to Loris’ pour of the champagne he ensured was topped up all night! The two ladies were exquisite, so kind and sweet and handled all our food with such care and no error which was beautiful. Cannot wait to return!",5,2022,01,03
105,Christmas at the Chesterfield,What an amazing experience! Lisa the front of the house manager and her staff was so accommodating and friendly. My wife and I spent Christmas and our 25th wedding anniversary at the hotel and we could not have been happier with our stay. The location is perfect. I will definitely book our next trip to London at the Chesterfield.,5,2022,01,02
105,From the sublime to the mediocre,"We stayed here during August 2021 prior to England being opened up to travellers from outside the UK and when only about 10-15% of the bedrooms were taken. During that visit we experienced excellent personal service. Unfortunately, this experience during the beginning of October 2021 when the hotel was full, was markedly different.

Concierge and doors
Once again, both Joseph and Salvatore provided great service as always, despite being very busy.

Restaurant
Somehow, staff coped miraculously well with large numbers at breakfast and we received the quality of food and service that we have come to expect from The Chesterfield and indeed from Red Carnation Hotels.

We booked dinner on the Saturday night, and despite there being only 6-7 tables occupied, our experience was marred by having to wait an hour for our main course (we didn’t order starters). I wonder if the wedding held next door at the English Speaking Union had anything to do with this?

Bar
Our experience here on Saturday night was positive, despite the hefty price tag for drinks. There was a great atmosphere in the bar, mainly due to the excellent jazz duo and service was on point.

However, my second visit on Monday afternoon was spoilt by a large number of corporate guests who had taken over the bar. This is an issue for leisure guests, due to the lack of lounge areas provided at the hotel. Even the library, which is usually my destination of choice when I just want to read quietly, was taken over by suited and booted grey men for business meetings.

Bedrooms
Again, more disappointment this time. Red Carnation Hotels had matched the cost of two superior king rooms, that the hotel was offering on Booking.com at a reduced price. (This is stated in their booking policy.) We were given two rooms on the second floor, but apart from the king-sized beds, one would struggle to find superior aspects.

This was probably our twelfth stay in a Red Carnation Hotel. During 2021 alone we have taken 2 rooms for a total of 12 nights at this hotel, spending approximately £3000 on accommodation and food and drinks. My main gripe is that Red Carnation Hotels does not reward its long-standing returning guests and is far too dependent on the concierge and restaurant staff doing this through the provision of personal service. Unquestionably, that is a very important aspect of a great hotel, but not the only aspect by any stretch of the imagination.",3,2022,01,01
105,NYE STAY,"We returned to the chesterfield to see nye in with the three children and yet again had the most amazing stay. 
A lovely atmosphere in the bar in the evening followed by room service ordered by my 9 year old which peter the night manager accommodated very kindly for him. 

Beautiful old english decor and the comfiest beds! Breakfast was beautiful, my children loved the pancakes!

Josef was amazing with the children and made them feel like little vips. A truly great way to see the new year in. Special thank you to Darren,James, Josef, Istvan, Naomi and nicole. They all made our stay so special and one to remember.",5,2022,01,01
105,Great Christmas staycation,"The Hotel is great located close to the Bond street shopping area.  A very Christmassy feeling all around the place. 
Friendly and professional staff who made us feel like home.
I high recommend the Chesterfield to have a truly London experience.",5,2021,12,29
105,Christmas stay,"2 night stay over Christmas, we thought the hotel was very reasonably priced especially given the location 
Location was great, a very short walk away from everything we wanted to see/do
Breakfast was the wow factor for us- amazing choice, the french toast was delicious.
The room was spacious and the bed was comfy, decor is quite dated but that’s the style of the hotel- could do with smartening up in a few areas
The bar was nice and the piano player, drinks were pricey though and nothing special
Staff were very friendly and attentive. We arrived at around 9am on check in day and they allowed us to check in early which was really good 
Would stay again",4,2021,12,27
105,Where do I start??,We stayed here over Christmas after lots of research we found this hotel and I will honestly now never come back to London without staying here! The staff made our Christmas we had the most magical stay the service the room the food was all beyond amazing we did not want to leave! You don’t stay in hotels anymore where you experience this they can’t do enough for you not only that they are so lovely we will be booking our stay to come back next Christmas now thank you Lisa on reception you was exceptional.,5,2021,12,27
105,Expect more,Stayed at the chesterfield for our 25th wedding anniversary and was really looking forward to our stay.Check in was very efficient and done in a few minutes we then went to our room which was very -plain and dated not what we were expecting but is was spotlessly clean.When we came back to our room later on a cake had been placed in it a nice touch from the manager.The breakfast choices we’re very good but the service was not the best nothing came together and a couple of mornings never came a tall so gave up asking. The chesterfield is not a bad hotel just a bit more average than we expected for the price so unfortunately will not be going back.,3,2021,12,26
105,Afternoon tea for two,We did the afternoon tea as a Christmas treat it was very nice stuff for family lovely hotel lots of food definitely recommend. They fill up with sandwiches and cakes afterwards we finished there is too much we took them home. It was nice to do Christmas all the decorations and my kids loved it,5,2021,12,22
105,Love it!!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights to attend a Christmas party and enjoy London at this time of year.
From the start, the service and staff were exemplary. My friend had left his wallet and phone in his car and the concierge team undertook a forensic search(!!) to find the missing items … thanks Darren and James.
Naomi on the front desk is a delight and could not be more helpful.
The rooms are comfortable with great beds and linen and a super range of TV channels.
The hotel is full of charm and breakfast is delightful.
Would I stay here again - you bet I would!!",5,2021,12,21
105,Stunning service.,"Absolutely amazing experience.  The service was wonderful from the very second we pulled up outside in the car, to the moment we left. The staff are outstanding. Every member of staff is friendly, attentive and professional,  nothing is too much trouble. 
Our room was beautiful, and impeccably clean. Food was beautiful.  We stayed for my birthday,  and not long after our arrival a cake was brought upto our room, a wonderful touch! 
We have already booked to come back, and plan on returning every year. A very special place. ",5,2021,12,16
105,Luxury  hotel,"A wonderful stay at this hotel, like stepping back in time to stylish regency era, you could film Downton Abbey here
Room was beautiful and spacious gorgeous super king size bed, pillows and bedding were luxurious 
The staff were amazing, we would definitely return",5,2021,12,16
105,60th Birthday weekend,"Had a Birthday weekend celebration here. Characterful charming hotel.  Staff and service were excellent,  very friendly and helpful.  Really nice piano bar.  Had three good meals in the restaurant too.  Not cheap but really was worth it.",5,2021,12,15
105,Fantastic Hotel,What a lovely place to stay in London. Perfect location for shopping or just taking in the sites. Rooms a quite small but have everything you need. We used room service once and they were quick. Pretty Piano bar open 24 hours. We had very nice cocktails. Breakfast menu cannot be faulted. A truly magical stay.,5,2021,12,15
105,Simply 'Fantastic',"We came across this hotel when our usual hotel was shut due to covid. Well we have since stayed there several times and we have never returned to our previous hotel.  They have a motto whilst you stay there it is 'your home' and that really does sum it up nothing is too much trouble and everyone makes you feel welcome and your stay is appreciated. I do have to give a shout out to Adriane in the bar , he goes above and beyond each time we stay - and for that level of service we keep going back. If you haven't tried this gem then you don't know what you are missing.",5,2021,12,13
105,Absolutely Senstaional,"As always it was a pleasure to stay again this weekend, our seventh stay this year. Historically we always stay at the Dorchester but having found this wonderful little gem when the Dorchester was closed during lock down we were overwhelmed. 

From Joseph the most wonderful concierge, to Adrian the best and most hospitable bar manger we have ever met,through to James and Adam both senior managers we cannot praise the hotel enough. 

Having been fortunate enough to stay and some superb places around the world I have to say the chesterfield is up with the best of them from the location, to the service, through to the food.  

Overall simply world class hospitality!!!

Well done team!!",5,2021,12,13
105,Perfect City Stay,"This hotel is located near Berkely Square in Mayfair, so perfect for city shopping and the parks.
We attended a wedding at this hotel.

The room was very comfortable with loads of storage.  Quiet too.

All the staff seemed to love customers and their job (it is well staffed).

The food was very nicely cooked and served, especially breakfast.  Some of my family took afternoon tea which looked delicious and plentiful.",5,2021,12,12
105,My Favorite Hotel in London,"We had a Wonderful Stay at the Chesterfield Hotel.  I Love this quintessential British Hotel. The building is a combination of lovely townhouses. The service and staff are exceptional.  Besides a great tea service, the hotel has top restaurants and pubs within a block from the hotel,  London's finest Indian and Lebanese restaurants are a block away in addition to multiple pubs including the Kings Arms are within a block.  Ask the concierge, Darren, to book you a seat at a Michelin Star restaurant when you book.  Mayfair's shopping streets are all within easy walking distance.  This hotel is part of a famous family owned company with four generations of family in control.  I felt treated as family.  The company is called the Red Carnation Hotels.",5,2021,12,11
105,Sensational hotel and staff,"I can't fault The Chesterfield Hotel, they made our stay so memorable! All the staff are so friendly and attentive and the Hotel itself is beautiful. We will definitely be returning when we are looking for a Hotel in London again!",5,2021,12,08
105,Wonderful athmosphere!,"Located in the heart of Mayfair, The Chesterfield hotel offers a warm and welcoming ambiance which is further enhanced by the beautiful Christmas decoration. The Gingerbread house in the lobby which has been handcrafted from the pastry chefs in the hotel is particularly impressive.  

The Terrace Bar’s live music and intimate athmospere, together with its great selection of drinks, all set the tone for an amazing night out. Furthermore, the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable with a special mention to Adrian. Thank you, we will most definitely come back!",5,2021,12,07
105,Traditional Hotel with excellent staff and the best breakfast in London!,"What makes this hotel special is the staff - at all levels.  We had an initial couple of hiccups but these were dealt with very pleasantly and carefully by Lisa Monteduro, the Front of House Manager.  The bar staff and the restaurant staff were excellent in that they wanted to make us feel special.   Loris has ears at the back of his head!  The bed in our room was very comfortable and for such a small room we were delighted to see two very adequate chairs to sit in.   Congratulations to Adam Lake, the General Manager, for being visible and knowledgeable and charming.  The breakfast (table service) was fantastic.  A huge choice, extremely well cooked and well presented - we ate far too much as a result!  We shall certainly return.",4,2021,12,07
105,Fantastic traditional hotel with amazing staff,"We recently stayed at The Chesterfield for two nights for my daughters birthday. From the moment we arrived the staff were amazing and very attentive. This is a top quality, traditional hotel in the heart of Mayfair and we couldn't recommend it enough.

Will definitely come again. Thanks to all at The Chesterfield, have a wonderful Christmas.

105,WONDERFUL QUIET HOTEL,"5 star hotel. 5 star service but with a very friendly manner. Just the right combination. Easy walk from Piccadilly and Green Park station. Very quiet area. Lunch in Butler's restaurant was excellent but we cannot understand why it was so quiet. The Ritz was very busy on the same day and yet the quality and choice of food was more than equal, and less expensive . Portions were bigger too. Breakfast was also excellent. Large, varied menu and thankfully not buffet. Our room was beautiful with nothing else required. They had thought of everything, including umbrellas! We had booked a deluxe king but were upgraded to the Mayfair suite as it was my 70th birthday. There were also complimentary flowers left in the room. Bedding and towels all of beautiful quality, all monogrammed. Bathroom had jacuzzi bath with overhead showers and a separate shower cubicle. Plenty of storage space.",5,2021,12,05
105,Extraordinary experience at The Chesterfield,"As a business, we work with, review and help hospitality brands with collaborations  and building extraordinary service for customers. The Chesterfield is my personal hotel of choice every time I am in London.  It is in a superb location, the rooms are decadent (if you are looking for trendy then The Chesterfield is not this hotel.  It is old England.  Think of Downton Abbey style... trunks, wood, incredible bedsheets, towels and the staff are incredible).  Every time we visit we end up in the hotel bar enjoying the pianist and sipping fine champagne.  Well done team Chesterfield.  You really do go to the next level!",5,2021,12,04
105,Exemplary service,The hotel looked beautiful for Christmas and the staff were very welcoming.sadly our stay was cut short due to illness and we were very impressed by the care and consideration from all those who looked after us. The service we received was exemplary and we would have no hesitation in returning to the Chesterfield.,5,2021,12,02
105,30th wedding anniversary,"Thank you very much for the outstanding stay myself and my wife had over the weekend. Your staff were very helpful and the service was superb from the reception staff on arrival to the bar staff for drinks and food and finally the staff at breakfast. Everything was exceptional the food was amazing, please give your chefs our complements.
I must thank you for our Happy anniversary cup cakes which was very thoughtful of you as we were celebrating our missed 30th wedding anniversary due to the pandemic.
If we ever stay in London again your hotel will definitely be the one we will be staying in.
 
Please pass on our thanks to all your wonderful staff for making this a memorable stay for us.",5,2021,11,30
105,"Superb hotel, amazing staff, cannot recommend enough.","We have stayed at The Chesterfield on a number of occasions and been impressed every time.  However my most recent stay brings me to this review.

I was a sitting alone in the lobby, listening to the pianist whilst waiting for my fiancé to join me.  Unfortunately, I was suddenly approached by a very intoxicated young man, (not a resident of the hotel)  who behaved inappropriately. The team at the Chesterfield acted promptly, professionally and firmly by requesting the gentlemen leave the premises and made what could of been a very difficult situation a controlled one.

I cannot recommend the hotel and staff highly enough, a 5 star experience from start to finish.  The rooms, food, service, friendliness, security, the entire experience is why we return again and again and now plan to have our wedding there. 

They also adore my bulldog Bella who stays with us every time! Great work, team 👍",5,2021,11,28
105,Another Superb Stay,"Haven’t not visited for 2 years but the same high standards remain. Adam Lake the General Manager is still there and  continues to run a tight ship..

Special mention to Denisa who served us breakfast daily  and wonderful to listen to the pianist again",5,2021,11,26

105,Lovely hotel in great location,"Room 209. The hotel is quite lovely with a great central London location. Check in went smoothly though the lifts are small and few, leading to wait times during busy periods. The room itself is sufficient.  The bed was very comfortable, the in-room tea/coffee came in China cups and a tea pot if required.  The room needs quite a bit of TLC to bring it up to standard and the TV stopped working, but nevertheless it had Sky which was a pleasant surprise. Breakfast was excellent.  There was a fanatic choice, the service was relaxed yet efficient and the quality of products from the hand squeezed orange juice to the sausages/bacon was first class. I would recommend the hotel though it lacks star quality / SPA facilities,  but would happily stay there again. ",4,2021,11,07
105,Poor-quality mattress,"A common criticism of this hotel is that the decor is old and tired, which I didn't mind so much, being old and tired myself. What I did mind, though, was paying £370 a night and being provided with a cheap contract mattress that isn't becoming of this sort of establishment. It's really quite disrespectful for a guest's comfort and the prospect of a good night's sleep being sacrificed for a few extra pounds on the balance sheet.

I also asked for toothpaste (which I had omitted to pack) and ear-plugs (due to noise from air-conditioning units), neither of which the hotel could provide. I find it extraordinary that a supposedly high-end hotel wasn't able to meet either of these requests.

It would have been one star but for the excellent service and kindness from Lisa and Peter, who tried their best to make me comfortable. I won't be returning, though.",2,2021,11,05
105,Best home away from home!,"Our stay was magical. 🔮
Thank you so much for making me and my son feel at home and taken care of!
We really appreciated it!

Food was good. Staff excellent. Small rooms but extremely cozy with a familiar and welcoming approach.
Not to mention the location. Location is fantastic.",5,2021,11,04
105,Outstanding,"Professional service by all staff especially the welcome from the doorman. It was our nieces big birthday and she was delighted to receive in her room a freshly made small pastry along with a handwritten birthday card. The Bar was busy but we were immediately welcomed and seated at a nice table for champagne.  A pianist added to the civilised atmosphere . Breakfast was very good with a large variety of options. We look forward to returning again in the near future to sample great hospitality and service. 
",5,2021,11,02
105,Really nice and elegant place to stay,"Amazing position, staff hyper kind and super professional (Special thanks to Holly, Nicole and Salvatore), clean, nice and elegant 4stars hotel.
Staff has been extra kind in providing help for several need (charging the broken phone, finding tools, assisting in flight booking and to make the needed Covid check).",5,2021,10,29
105,Left disappointed,"Checked in for an overnight stay. Left sunglasses in room... phoned to report after checking out and realising and never heard back. Other than this aspect the stay was fine, but it left a poor impression.",3,2021,10,28
105,Amazing hotel,"I’ve stayed at the chesterfield several times, but my last visit was the most memorable. 
I took a tumble outside the hotel ( just caught my shoe on some pavement). I fell flat on my face. Within seconds the hotel staff was there took me to A&E and brought me back, and generally took care of me. It was amazing. It was like having Mom checking on you. I have to especially thank Salvatore(who was always there), Lisa front of house manager(who called on her day off to check on me) and Adam General Manager, who stepped in right away. This hotel is the absolutely the best 🌟",5,2021,10,27
105,Not Worth The Money,"Had a relatively mediocre experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair recently. Greeting staff at reception at the 4 star Hotel wore a dirty shirt and had chipped nail varnish, something small but you expect more at 4*. Room was quaint, arrived back after a show to turndown service which was lovely. The bed was really comfortable and had a great night's sleep. Went to breakfast at 9am, sat and waited 40 minutes with NO service, guests who sat next to us and after us received attention from the waiting staff however they literally bypassed myself and my wife and left us massively underwhelmed, in the end we got up and left. It was a massive shame that breakfast let you down as we were booked in for afternoon tea this afternoon but felt the service was so poor that we didn't want to waste our time or our money coming back later in the afternoon. 

We received our £50 'extra charge' upon cancelling afternoon tea, though we're still not sure if this was a refund and apology or simply giving us back the £50 we had to have charged to our room for potential damages I'm sure. 

Upon checking out we also overheard another gentleman complaining about the poor breakfast over the course of his stay (4 days). Something clearly isn't right in the dining area, sure, I could have said something to beckon waiting staff, but as a guest paying upwards of £200 a night I expected more.

",3,2021,10,26
105,Lovely setting but a couple of drawbacks,"This is a lovely hotel, with attentive staff and is clean, striking and very elegant. The rooms are cosy but again clean and very nicely decorated. The bar provided a lovely calm low-lit atmosphere. During our one night stay we also used the breakfast facilities in the Butler's Restaurant, which again was decorated and impressively well-maintained. 

However, our room, which should have been guaranteed by 2pm, was not ready until just after 3pm, which nearly affected our early dinner and theatre plans as we had considerably less time to get ready. This was compensated by a free drink token to use in the hotel bar. 

Breakfast, although nice, was nothing too special. Certainly not worth the wait, which unfortunately was over 45 minutes from ordering to arriving. Even then, we were still missing some items which we did not chase up as we had been sat there for too long already. 

Overall, no major issues. It was a lovely hotel but not worth what we paid. ",3,2021,10,26
105,A weekend break in London,"The Chesterfield is a small traditional hotel set in the heart of Mayfair in a prime location, within walking distance of good restaurants and shops. The staff are welcoming and very helpful with regard to finding taxis, booking theatre tickets, restaurants and room service. The food is excellent. The rooms are comfortable and clean, with every facility available.
Patricia Ridge",5,2021,10,26
105,Excellent service in a great location,"It has been about 10 years since we last stayed here.  The hotel continues its high standard of service, with friendly staff willing to make suggestions in response to questions or requests.  This Mayfair location is convenient to restaurants, travel options, and shopping.  Museums and theaters are easy to reach.  We loved it.",5,2021,10,24
105,Excellent Hotel,"This was a great stay. Reception welcome could be better, room for improvement. Apart from that, room very good. We ate in the bar after a trip to the theatre & that was excellent. Simple food done really well, also treated to live music which was excellent. Fantastic atmosphere. Breakfast was the best I’ve enjoyed for some time. Highly recommended. Welcome 4/5, bar food 5/5, live music 5/5, breakfast 5/5, room 5/5",4,2021,10,18
105,Old England Style,"We stayed here with our family as part of an Anniversary and Birthday treat. From start to finish the staff were amazing. The checkin in staff were lovely and very helpful. Our concierge 'Salvatore' was an absolute gem. He even came with me in my car to park at the Park Lane Hilton who had car park spaces available through JustPark.
He and I then walked the short distance back to the Chesterfield and had a good chat along the way. Lovely man. We did eat in one night at the hotel and the food was lovely, everyone enjoyed what they had and our waiter was both charming and informative. The rooms were beautifully appointed and had that old England charm about them. The beds were comfy and sleep was easy to come by. Breakfast each morning was table service. The waiting staff were all so polite and courteous and the food was top notch, with an excellent variety. I would recommend you staying at the Chesterfield for a wee trip back in time to friendly and helpful staff, with a lovely olde fashioned feel. Also, not to forget, the two man jazz band were superb. They were poached away from the Savoy we were told, and it is the Chesterfield's gain I would say. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,10,17
105,Very welcoming,"Very high standard hotel yet welcoming and not pretentious.
Room very very comfortable 
Staff very friendly and helpful.
Breakfast service disappointing (had to ask 3 times where our food was despite others around us receiving theirs) but reception sorted this for us.
Cocktail bar very nice in evening with pianist.",5,2021,10,16
105,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights celebrating a birthday. The hotel was beautiful, staff so friendly and helpful, and the restaurant food was exceptional. An all round lovely stay!",5,2021,10,15
105,Plainly depends on which room you get as to whether you rate this hotel highly!,"For the price we paid for a room over looking the back of the hotel and a noisy bank of fans, it wasn't good value for money  If you are looking for a hotel with clean sleek up to date interiors then this is not for you...think more faded baronial pile.  It's in a good position in Mayfair and does a half decent breakfast  but that is about it. The furnishings in our room were tired and grubby.  Who has a shower over a bath these days!  The back of the hotel is noisy from the fans and is an uninspiring view.  The fabric on the walls was grubby! Curtains had stains. Bathroom was kept very clean but disconcerting to see brown around the outside of the toilet on the marble flooring.  Breakfast is very good but bit hit and miss with portion sizes.  A plate of fruit with 4 grapes and a rather tired bit of plum sliced and an equally tired and tasteless nectarine is a bit...odd!  If we had paid less than it would be fine but we paid A LOT and apparently got a free room upgrade.  Really not sure what the rooms are like if you don't get the upgrade!  Staff are efficient and friendly but just old fashioned, slightly grubby and faded.  During lockdown the hotel could have used that time usefully by doing an assessment of the entire place and doing some upgrading and repairs.",3,2021,10,14
105,Disappointing,"Booked two nights in Chesterfield for 25th Wedding Anniversary. 
Great location in Mayfair and made very welcome when we arrived. Indeed, upon returning to our room on the first evening a plate of cup cakes was provided with a congratulatory message. Very nice!
Unfortunately we couldn’t sleep the first night in room 208. It is next to a machine room( presumably linked to the lifts) and drove us crazy.  This room really needs to be better sound proofed or otherwise not let to paying customers. 
Upon our complaint we were moved to room 419 which was great.
The breakfast experience was a farce. The first day, after waiting 50 minutes, they admitted to having lost outlet order. Ok, mistakes happen. The next day the same manager took our order and apologised for the previous day and assured us it would not happen again. It did! We had to chase again after half and hour and it eventually arrived after 45 minutes.
Given this is a very expensive and supposedly luxury hotel I don’t believe our experience matched what ought to be delivered. Overall, very disappointing!!",3,2021,10,12
105,"Good location, wonderful staff","The Chesterfield is large enough to offer good facilities yet small enough to feel intimate and welcoming. We had one or two issues but once  raised with staff these were quickly resolved. 
We had two rooms. The one to the rear was much quieter.",4,2021,10,09
105,Amazing experience. Wonderful staff,"Forget all of the other hotels in London, book your rooms at the Chesterfield Mayfair. My Wife and I got married and stayed there for one night and we were treated like royalty in that establishment. The members of staff literally did go above and beyond to suit our needs for our special day. Each member of staff, namely Suzie Pagett, the Executive assistant manager of the establishment, are an absolute credit to the Chesterfield and to the Hotel industry. You will not be disappointed with the high level of service and care you will receive from these wonderful members of staff.",5,2021,10,08
105,Mother in laws 60th,"What can  I say about this hotel apart from home from home.  Sadly I wasn’t able to stay but my wife and mother in law did for the weekend. I did however meet them in the bar for drinks , which is everything you could wish for,comfy surroundings drinks from cocktails to great wine and so relaxed and welcoming. Hopefully not too long before I’m back.",5,2021,10,05
105,Above and beyond,I would 100% recommend the chesterfield London. They went above and beyond to make our stay very special. Nothing was too much trouble for the lovely staff. The accommodations were very clean and very comfortable.  I would also recommend the breakfast Thank you all,5,2021,10,05
105,Above and Beyond,"2 nights at The Chesterfield and wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. Everyone made my mum’s 60th Birthday so very special. 

From Reception, Afternoon Tea, Room Cleaning, Bar, Breakfast, Door persons, you feel part of The Chesterfield family. Nothing is too much trouble and it was lovely to see it so busy.

Thankyou everyone for looking after us.",5,2021,10,05
105,A fabulous afternoon tea with a twist,"We love an afternoon tea and having enjoyed many it was so refreshing to have one with a bit of a theme. Not only was it eye catching but the flavours were divine, from the sandwiches right up to the cakes. Not being a cucumber fan I had that sandwich substituted for an extra smoked salmon one but i wish I had had an extra ham and cheese one now because the sundried tomato bread and the thin layer of chutney too just made this the most delicious sandwich I have had in a long while - I don’t often eat sandwiches so when I do they’re a treat anyway but this one was sublime. I know I could have had extra sandwiches but didn’t wasn’t to over so it and miss out on enjoying the rest of the treats.
Having two different flavoured scones was actually really lovely and both were really lovely, light and the perfect size to allow room for the sweet treats on the top layer.
The cakes were so cleverly done, the flavours amazing and seriously eye catching. 
We could have had our plates replenished at any time, but didn’t. Instead we chose to take a couple of scones and cakes home - we put chocolate spread on the chocolate scone we had in the evening and this took it to another level!
The added bonus of not just having the sweet trolley to look at but having a bag of sweets included in the afternoon tea was a real surprise.
The staff were all really friendly and attentive and I would definitely recommend and return in a flash.",5,2021,10,04
105,What a treat,"I had the pleasure of returning to The Chesterfield this week on Wednesday to spend a day and night in London.met up with my life long school pal ,
Both our rooms were absolutely amazing The Duchess Suite and The Stanhope Suite ,

The welcome at reception was as warm as you can imagine , both young ladies very attentive and helpful and happy ,
All the staff are very courteous and nothing is too much trouble help with our bags the second we entered the reception area .

Breakfast was delicious , great choice on offer , bar area was very busy in the evening had a great buzz to it .

Check out again very efficient and easy .

Well done to all The Chesterfield Team ,

Looking forward to my next visit hopefully very soon .",5,2021,10,03
105,Super stay in September,"A really lovely hotel set in upmarket Mayfair.  It has just the right touch of luxury without feeling uncomfortable. Staff were extremely good and special mention to the lovely Italian waitress at breakfast who made our morning. The rooms are very clean though a little old fashioned (and creaky air conditioning!) but they just add to the experience.  I can't find any real negatives though if you  want a quieter stay, I would recommend booking a room at the back of the hotel. ",5,2021,09,30
105,Brilliant Afternoon Tea,The afternoon tea was excellent.  The sweet cart theme was a nice touch as was the pick n mix to take away.  I didn't get the name of our server but she was lovely and really made us feel welcome and that nothing was too much trouble.  The lobby staff were also very friendly.,5,2021,09,29
105,Ruined 25 year wedding anniversary,"My husband and I arrived at the Chesterfield on the 25th of September 2021 at 2pm to check in. We were told our room wasn’t quite ready, which we understood and so we went about our day returning at 5:30pm. From there we were told by the lady on reception that the room still wasn’t ready. I was disappointed as I’d wanted to go to our room and freshen up for a night at the theatre, but we brushed this off and went to see the show.

During the intermission of the show, my husband received a message from the night manager saying to call him back after the show. We called at 10:30pm to be told the room was no longer available and that he would like to upgrade us to the Reubens Hotel and he would have a taxi waiting for us when we arrived at the Chesterfield. We were disappointed and confused as we had booked the Chesterfield over a month in advance so we didn’t anticipate having any issues with the hotel actually having a room for us, however we agreed to stay at the Reubens.

When we arrived at the Reubens, the manager approached us and apologised. They then asked us for payment for a new room at the Reubens when we’d already paid for a nonexistent room at the Chesterfield. At this point we just felt defeated and wanted to go home so we asked for a taxi. We live an hour and a half away so we arrived home late and tired after a long day in London when we had originally planned to stay overnight.

What should have been a lovely weekend away for our anniversary was cut short and we were left feeling really upset and confused by the treatment we received by the Chesterfield.",1,2021,09,26
105,Very comfortable stay,"Stayed one night for my partner's birthday. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was spacious (two bathrooms!) and with a four poster type bed. Ordered a couple of drinks to be brought to the room and they arrived really quickly. Very quiet during the night, despite two weddings at the hotel. Breakfast was very nice. Decor a little tired,but it added to the charm. 

I've knocked off a point for lack of Covid safe measures. When we arrived,the reception area was pretty busy but none of the staff were wearing masks. None of the breakfast room staff had masks on either and guests were not wearing masks as they walked around.  I was actually the only person wearing a mask in the public areas for most of our stay, until this morning when both reception staff (young women) had masks on, which was a welcome sight. The iPad for checking in also seemed to be handed from guest to guest, with no sanitising in between. 

Would stay again, but probably after the pandemic!",4,2021,09,25
105,The wonderful Chesterfield,"My second visit to stay at the Chesterfield, and it was just as fabulous as the first visit.
Darren and his staff were friendly and welcoming from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, they couldn't have done any more for us.
Little touches, like a birthday cake and card in my room, make it so special.

Make sure to stay for a drink in the bar, an amazing two piece singing/on piano, such a great atmosphere whilst enjoying a few gins, before falling into the most comfy beds.
Cannot wait to visit again.",5,2021,09,20
105,Faded elegance,"This small hotel is a little gem, nestled in the heart of Mayfair, only a few minutes walk from New Bond Street, Regent Street and the clubs & restaurants in and around Berkeley Square. Faded, yes, but still elegant. A good bar & decent restaurant. The rooms seem to be rather on the small side - but perfectly adequate for a short stay. We've stayed here previously and will always return when we need to be on this side of London. All of the staff here are absolutely wonderful - nothing is too much trouble. Valet parking charges have increased from £50 per 24 hrs to £65 - which will make us think again about bringing our car - may now be cheaper to travel by train?!",4,2021,09,20
105,WRITER REVIEW OF CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR,"I was commissioned to stay at this hotel for a few days last month to do a written review for a travel industry client. 

The hotel itself has unique charm and character. It was peaceful, comfortable, and traditional. The room we had was pleasant, quite large, and with neutral colours, which is what I had requested prior to my arrival.

The bar was pleasant, and the staff there very professional, polite, and attentive. In addition, the live music in the bar on Friday evening was great, and they allocated us a seat right next to the entertainment as I had been asking about it all week so I could include it in my review.

We had breakfast at the hotel (only one morning) and this was fine. We did not manage to have an evening meal in there, but the restaurant itself was pleasant.

All employees of the hotel we interacted with were great, especially the bar staff and Josef, the concierge, who was very pleasant and helpful. 

All in all, a great stay in a nice hotel.",5,2021,09,20
105,Amazing stay yet again,"Stayed at the chesterfield on the 18th September and as always the service was amazing. This is our 7th time staying at this hotel and everytime we stay we cannot fault it.

Special thank you to georgie, joseph and darren at the concierge who are always so helpful and go above and beyond. 
Also another mention to adrian and how attentive he was all evening during out group drinks in the bar. The live band was absolutely incredible!! 

Cannot wait to stay at back at christmas time with the children.",5,2021,09,19
105,Personal Service- Great Location and Value,"Amazing!  From the moment you walk in the experience is top notch.
Example: we called the hotel to ask where we can buy 5 adapters for US travelers.  They didn’t have any but bought them and had when we returned from the day out !

The rooms have every imaginable detail you need and more and very traditional Classic style. Turn down bed service with chocolates on pillows + hand written welcome note from the manager.

Live music I believe most nights in a cozy bar + the location is right in the heart of beautiful Mayfair, shopping district, pubs, Carnaby street, Hyde Park etc

100% recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair",5,2021,09,19
105,Wonderful hotel in great location,"Just returned from four nights at the Chesterfield. The location is great, you can walk everywhere or get to the local underground station (Green Park) in about 6 minutes.  The Ritz is just round the corner where you  must go for dinner or afternoon tea.  Easy walk to Oxford Street and about a mile to West End Theatres. The rooms are very comfortable and have everything you need. Excellent breakfast. Well cooked and plenty of it. The staff at this hotel is a credit to the management. Very helpful and friendly, special mention to the two gentlemen who run the entrance, helping with luggage and taxis etc.. Very attentive and helpful, they create the good first impression that you don't get a second chance to make.  Will definitely be back. Thanks.",5,2021,09,18
105,Wonderful hotel. Nothing too much trouble.,"We recently stayed in the Chesterfield Hotel for two nights, celebratingourweddinganniversary. We had a truly wonderful experience.  The staff cannot do too much for you. From the warm welcome when we arrived, to the perfect checkout,  we were made to feel special.  

The food is glorious,  the beds comfortable, the staff amazing. The interior is exactly what you're looking for if you want a traditional, English hotel. Afternoon tea is lovely with their sweetshop theme. Breakfast is glorious as are their evening meals.

We have stayed before and we will definitely be back. 
Thankyou to all the staff but especially to Jamie, Darren,  Josef and Eleanora",5,2021,09,15
105,London at its finest.,"Amazing hotel. Amazing staff. Amazing location! This is such a beautiful hotel. Everything was perfect. We couldn’t have asked for a better getaway break. The staff were wonderful and the breakfast was so delicious. We were sad to leave and when we come back to London, we will certainly be staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2021,09,14
105,Excellent in every way. Why stay anywhere else.,"We originally chose this hotel because of its fantastic location and the impressive reviews however, it is so much better than we could imagine. Yes it has beautifully appointed rooms and public areas, great food etc but like a broken record, I like many other reviewers have to single out the staff as the ""Jewel in the Crown"" It can't be by accident that they are attentive, friendly and genuinely pleased to be looking after you. Top of the List for our next trip to London.",5,2021,09,13
105,Fabulous vibe. ,Booked for drinks in the bar. Wasn't disappointed. Exceptional. The staff was so very attentive. The drinks were amazing as were the nibbles. The mini cheese on toast was so morrish. Topped off by the superb music. Double bass and a piano and 2 great voices. Will definately be coming back,5,2021,09,12
105,Oustanding,If you ever get the chance and want to stay in a stunning hotel in London then The Chesterfield should be at the top of your list. The Chesterfield is the best hotel that I have ever stayed in within the UK. The staff where all friendly and nothing was to much trouble. The food was outstanding and excellent quality. The room was spotless and the bed and linen where excellent. Everything about this Hotel is faultless. I will visit again 100%.,5,2021,09,08
105,A really great hotel,"A Red carnation has a reputation and this is a fabulous hotel with staff who truly want to provide excellent service and are so friendly from checking in to picking up our stored luggage everything was without issue. Breakfast is a real treat , a great menu with vegan and vegetarian selections that have imagination , a special mention to Denisa who served us both mornings , who overheard me saying I think I’d like a croissant and a basket appeared ! Small details like mirrors in the right places for drying hair and doing make up , a decent hairdryer with a nozzle ( so often missing) and the comfiest bed ensured we lacked nothing. Perfect for walking to most things we planned. Thank you.our stay was to belatedly celebrate our Ruby anniversary, we are so pleased we chose the chesterfield we shall be back .",5,2021,09,04
105,Quality hotel,"We stayed for  three nights and breakfast was included. The wonderful experience started when entering the hotel as the receptionists were all very professional and friendly and polite. 
The room was clean and tidy with excellent decor and facilities.
The bed and especially the pillows were exceptionally cosy and comfortable and help make the stay so relaxing. 
We had only one problem and that was the card to open the door but the staff sorted it.
We can really recommend this hotel and the staff as it all helped to have a lovely break and celebration",5,2021,09,04
105,An incredible venue for a private event!,"We booked an afternoon tea package in The Library (one of the Chesterfield Mayfair’s private rooms) for my sister’s baby shower and I was SO impressed with the venue and impeccable level of service from the lovely team! Every element was so well thought-out, from the welcome drinks and temperature of the room to the tea service itself. We were even allowed to control the music and bring our own decorative pieces to add a personal touch to the event. Every member of staff we came across was so helpful - even if they weren’t taking care of our group personally! The hotel itself is also incredibly beautiful (the perfect backdrop for the countless pictures we took on the day!) I couldn’t recommend this venue more!",5,2021,09,02
105,Charming and high-quality place! 10/10,"I warmly recommend this lovely place, the staff welcomes you with the most attention and the location in the heart of London, although the street and area remain quiet, is perfect. The restaurant and bar are full of a gentle atmosphere to spend a wonderful stay.",5,2021,08,29
105,Beautiful Rooms and Professional Service 10/10!,"A beautiful, clean, friendly hotel. Staff were all very pleasant and professional. The food was delicious and the service was very efficient. Although I stayed for business, I will definitely be coming back to stay, at my leisure and enjoy again. 10/10! 😊",5,2021,08,28
105,Better than ever!,"Our fifth stay and the first for a few years owing to illness and then Covid. I was surprised at just how immaculate everything was, including reception, the corridors, dining room and bedroom. When I stayed in the Shangri-la in Singapore many years ago it was so pristine that I imagined it had just opened, although it was seven years old. The Chesterfield is a bit older than that but managed to do the same. It is rare indeed for no part of a hotel to have any scuff marks or other signs of wear but the Chesterfield managed it. Every member of staff we met was friendly and helpful, especially the Hungarian doorman and general factotum.

Our only slight criticism was that breakfast took a very long time. We much prefer to be served rather than using a buffet but it would not have been good if we had been in a hurry.

In one way l was a bit disappointed. I would quite like to experience some other London hotels but when you find something close to perfection it is hard to justify going elsewhere.",5,2021,08,26
105,Friendliest hotel in mayfair!,"﻿It’s not often I write an amazing review on a hotel. Lately we’ve stayed in some totals kelps that have been sooo bad and such awful value for money I just couldn’t face reviewing!
In fairness we did get an AMAZING deal due to Covid offers which made it a no brainer to stay for a week. We’d read varying reviewing saying the rooms were small and the service was abit snooty so we had our reservations, but I can  honestly say one of the best things that stands this hotel apart from any other posh expensive hotel I’ve stayed in, is the wonderful, caring, respectful, helpful, efficient and most importantly perfect English speaking staff.
Even before we arrived, we were in contact with the concierge and reception about all aspects of our trip via phone and email and they went above and beyond to help us. Early check in was not a problem. I was greeted by the same irish lady I’d been speaking to on the phone who was just as friendly and superb as she was on the phone. Despite the opulent surrounding, we felt so comfortable and welcome, I can totally see why people call it a home from home! 
Yes, agreed the rooms are small, so go for the superior room which is slightly bigger with THE most comfortable bed imaginable! But they are all so elegant, even the corridors with their plush  royal blue velvet walls make you feel glorious!!
Yes, if you’re very tall and wide as we are, the toilet area is abit cramped and the wardrobe rail isn’t high enough to hang long dresses, but you have to remember it’s mayfair, not america, and if you can afford a suite, great, but we wanted to spend the lion share of our money on enjoying london!
Room service was prompt and always beautifully presented. I think there’s a confusion between the app and the website as the all day menu isn’t the room service menu and despite saying the can meet special requirements, the room service menu at night is very limited, but what we had was compact and bejou and satisfied our midnight cravings!
The piano player Friday and Saturday evenings was totally brilliant, a pleasurable mix of trad and modern jazz with a few genius interpretations of modern chart material. The atmosphere was relaxed and unpretentious and the staff were knowledgable about all of the drinks and cocktails on offer and very attentive.
We enquired about our running total half way through our visit as we’d used room service and the bar with reckless abandon and were abit concerned about charges, but unlike others hotels they charge a percentage of your bill for each room service visit which we thought was very reasonable, 12.5% I think, which wasn’t daylight robbery plus we were quite happy to generously tip each time on top because the staff were so nice. AND most importantly for those of us who LOVE our English tea, they provide jugs of proper milk on request from the bar at no extra charge!
Yes, the drinks are very expensive and racking up a £200 plus a night bill on boozing is WAY too easy, but it’s mayfair, and it’s a special occasion….
I would say only that the restaurant menu was a little too basic for the price and some more fancy al la carte options would have been nice, but with Covid and low occupancy until the economy picks up again, you have to make allowances for cut backs everywhere especially in tourism.
Their afternoon tea was something we wished we had prebooked as we didn’t know it was so popular and couldn’t get a slot during our stay.  We ended up going again to the ritz instead and our verdict was that compared to a few years ago when we went, it was definately not worth the money!! So try the chesterfields instead as it looked much more generous and half the price!!
Oh, and they allow little dogs too!
Overall we had the best time ever in a london hotel and we are definately planning to stay there again. The location is perfect, the hotel is opulent and the staff were outstanding!",5,2021,08,25
105,Highly recommended,"A beautiful hotel, with lots of character. Excellent service from all the staff we had interaction with. Very comfortable bed and bedroom. Very clean and we felt Covid safe. All tables are cleaned between customers. Breakfast was wow, especially the fruit platter and the full English.  Excellent location.",5,2021,08,24
105,Little gem in the heart of Mayfair,"Business trip with a we bit of pleasure thrown in 
New to the Chesterfield Hotel a cracking little gem in the heart of Mayfair for a stopover mid Business trip transit , 

Slightly dated but don’t let that put you off, defiantly in need of a re vamp specifically the Superior King,  excellent size bed but unfortunately very small area to work along with tiny bathroom for 2 persons, albeit don’t let that put you off , even if the wall paper and lineing is coming away from the walls, and paint work in need of a good prepping and re painting 

Hotel is still quaint in its own way and as the saying go’s if it’s not broke don’t mess with it

Hotel front of house one of the best I have had on my many global travels, 
 We were received with a warm sincere Irish welcome from a young lady at reception who certainly put across the management’s duty of care and hospitality to the client in excellent communication, 5 stars straight away on first impression the young lady made on us representing the Chesterfield

 We availed of the Bar on a few occasions  a wonderful snug and cosy location to sit and enjoy a Whisky 

Breakfast once again excellent silver service with attention to details and impeccable table dressing along with service 

Breakfast again could not fault with a selection compatible with any 5 star  location in Mayfair

Would I return, of course I will, suitable & Sufficient accommodation in the heart of Mayfair with that personal touch you don’t get any more at large multinational hotel chains 

From check in to check out the staff and management of the chesterfield Mayfair were exemplary

Certainly, a place I would recommend to friends and colleagues for our next regular business trips to the city",5,2021,08,22
105,A lovely stay,"Stayed for two nights in a junior suite. Very comfortable, with two separate bathrooms! Staff were so polite and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast offering was excellent. Good location, and in easy walking distance of Piccadilly and Oxford Street.",5,2021,08,21
105,Always wonderful,"This was our 8th visit to the Chesterfield. Although we only stayed one night the welcome from the staff was, as usual, outstanding. The hotel felt Covid secure and our bedroom was spotless though surprisingly didn’t contain tea making “facilities” - a surprise as we were last month at Summer Lodge where tea and coffee was freely available.

We ate in the bar during the evening and again the bar staff were exceptional 

The Chesterfield feels like home from home and we aim to return for a longer visit in the near future 

Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making our stay so enjoyable",5,2021,08,18
105,Beautiful food and amazing service,"What an amazing meal after a recommebdation from our friend lukas who also works as a manager for the Red carnation group. From start to finish we were treated like royalty and its claim to have the best Dover sole in London is definitely not misplaced. They may want to pop in a bid for best pies as well!
Coming from Guernsey we are aware of the red carnation group having the wonderful OGH and Duke of Richmond on our doorstep. When on holiday in Cape Town two years ago I also had the opportunity to go to their 12 apostles Hotel.
What strikes me so well about this group of hotels is the service. It really is amazing. This week on holiday in London we also had an afternoon tea from Reubens which we took to the palace Gardens (it is our honeymoon so we decided to treat ourselves). Honestly, this us a wonderful group of hotels. Big shout out to whoever the chef is at Chesterfield and especially the service from Jamie (? I think his name was) and the outstanding Denise. It is nights like this that you remember. Thank you all.
By the way, Mrs Tollman, if you are reading this, your cheesecake was delicious!",5,2021,08,16
105,"Prime location, excellent service, good value","My wife and I had a two-night stay midweek in early August. Our superior twin room, though not large, was very comfortable and, crucially, very quiet - which is to say, you can never get away from 
 ALL the traffic noise in central London, but the hotel itself is padded and peaceful, and there's none of the thumping footsteps from the room above, or slamming doors you often hear in old London hotels. Beds were super comfy, aircon was quiet and efficient, shower was a bit cramped but water pressure was great. All the staff we encountered were courteous, friendly and efficient. Had a late-night bite to eat at the Terrace Bar and that too was great. Last but not least, the location is perfect: in the heart of prestigious Mayfair, but a couple of streets back from the main road, so you can escape the madness anytime you want.  I can definitely recommend the Chesterfield - especially at the price, which is half the rate charged by some of the big-name hotels in the area.",5,2021,08,16
105,Wasim is amazing thank you so so much,"We came today for afternoon tea and it’s all thanks to Wasim who made the booking for us as he fitted us in last minute. He went above and beyond and was absolutely amazing, his customer service is unlike anything I have EVER experienced before and went completely out of his way to help me. He certainly deserves some recognition from his manager as he was truly amazing. It was a pleasure to meet him today when we came for our tea. He truly is first class when it comes to helping customers, I can’t thank him enough!! 

The afternoon tea itself was nice and the rest of the staff were very pleasant. My children loved the welcome drink as they thought it was magic!! 

We were very full and luckily enough brought the cakes back home with us as there were so many. 

Thanks again Wasim - you’re a true little gem!!!",5,2021,08,14
105,"Chesterfield Mayfair is the best London hotel we’ve ever stayed in, and we’ve stayed in a few, for any stay or holiday","We booked in for a quiet holiday in London’s central Mayfair, and the location was incredible - walking distance of many major attractions & the beautiful historic Shepherds Market with its amazing restaurants. it felt like staying in a friendly aristocrats home. Booking a holiday in London demands comfort, &!so many other hotels are expensive and yet inhospitable. The room & en suite here were sumptuous and spacious, with beautiful decor & so quiet. The team at The Chesterfield were excellent, fun and world class, from the talented & knowledgeable chef & restaurant / bar staff to the Concierge, they really go above and beyond and it speaks volumes that many have been there for years. The food & wine cellar is a total treat & the breakfast was delicious every day. When making the booking they took time to talk & recommend what would work, & the Concierge deserves special mention for organising a fantastic itinerary of dinner reservations, travel & tickets to shows & visitor attractions for us. A truly special place, where manners & hospitality excel - & doors are opened for you, we would highly recommend for any purpose, and will always stay whenever visiting London. Great value for money, and thanks to all at The Chesterfield for making our stay so memorable & looking after us with such joie de vivre, care and kindness.",5,2021,08,14
105,Afternoon Tea at The Chesterfield,"Came in with my 4 year old niece for afternoon tea. The service was excellent and she loved every second of it! Thanks to Denisa, Tamara, Malina the candy lady and Eleonora for looking after us! 
All of the food was delicious, and the children’s afternoon tea selection was perfect - child friendly without being childish :)",5,2021,08,11
105,This was indeed 'our home' for 4 days,"This was our fourth or fifth stay at The Chesterfield and our 10th in a Red Carnation Hotel.

We were initially booked into a hotel in Marylebone, but decided to change our booking at the last minute (to make a saving of about £400 for 2 rooms B&B). 

Our two king rooms on the third floor were very comfortable and contained all we require from a hotel in central London. Although the furniture and decor throughout the hotel is 'old school', it's comforting and radiates quality.

It is, however, the staff that takes this hotel to another level. We spoke to a number of them (some at length) and their service was impeccable: cleaners, turn-down ladies, bar and restaurant staff, front desk staff, concierge - all of them have attended the Red Carnation finishing school and are a credit to the company.

As the young Galician bar-tender informed us 'this is your home when you are a guest here' and indeed it was. It is not a matter of 'if' we return, but a matter of 'how soon'.",5,2021,08,10
105,Exceptional afternoon tea,"Another amazing afternoon tea at this hotel. Staff were exceptional and could not be more attentive and thoughtful. Nothing was too much trouble. We were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary and our daughters 15th birthday when we were there. It was fabulous! 
Special thanks to Sam who helped to organise our return visit. Looking forward to returning again in the future",5,2021,08,09
105,Great location and staff,"Located very centrally to Bruton Square and green park.

Concierge was extremely helpful and friendly-arrived early and headed out again.

Lobby area is a old chic, verging on a dusty appearance with tapestry like curtains and table clothes.

Room 418 was so small and noisy- facing the front of the hotel. Changed for 501 which was facing the back and much more quiet.

The room was old school- silk wall
Paper with paintings. Comfortable.

Turndown service at about 6-ish.

Breakfast was truly exceptional- amazing selection , wonderful egg royale, fruit platter, pastry basket.

All in all a great hotel if not for initial room.",4,2021,08,07
105,"Excellent Hotel, great location","I have just spent 2 nights at the Chesterfield Hotel, celebrating my 60th Birthday with 7 of my friends.
The hotel is in a perfect location, within walking distance of many attractions. The area is 1 street away from Shepherd's Market where there are lovely bars and restaurants.
The rooms are lovely with the most comfortable beds and beautiful quality bedding. Fantastic powerful shower.
The staff at the hotel are the friendliest  and most helpful that I have ever found in any London Hotel. All are a credit to the Chesterfield. A particular mention to Josef the concierge who was brilliant and couldn't do enough for us. But also the Reception, restaurant and Housekeeping staff were all lovely.
I will definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend to everyone.
Thank you to everyone there for making our trip so special.",5,2021,08,07
105,Lovely weekend,"This hotel is in a really good location and extremely handy to get to different places. It's a pretty quiet street too so not noisy at night time. It's also not that far from Green Park tube station. We walked to Oxford Street, Bond Street, Hyde Park, St James Park, Fortnum and Mason, Green Park and Buckingham Palace, all very easily.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and the concierge (Joseph) in particular was exceptionally helpful and went out of his way to assist us.
Breakfast was amazing on both mornings. We had afternoon tea the day we arrived which was lovely.
We'd been out for a meal in the evening and decided to have a drink in the bar upon our return and there was live music (not too loud) and a great atmosphere. 
Our room was really clean, tastefully decorated and the bed was so comfortable.
We're looking forward to staying there again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place",5,2021,08,05
105,"Perfect location, excellent price. ","From start to finish the whole experience was first class. Comfortably classic in style without being old-fashioned.  Excellent location and great value too.   The staff particularly were very professional and really friendly.  Our room had everything we needed and everything good quality.

They claim to do the best Dover Sole in London.  That's quite a claim but I'd tend to agree. The food in the restaurant is really good.  The staff on breakfast were particularly attentive and, only on morning 2, they'd already remembered our previous morning's order and asked if we wanted the same.

Just one negative that's not quite enough for me to knock a star off; some of the woodwork around the place was showing signs of having had a busy life.  Doors scuffed in the rooms, for example.  Other than that, that's it.  Definitely going back. ",5,2021,08,01
105,An absolute gem,"Directed to this property due to
Location from a third party booking agent. 

We were looking forward to the stay however a call to check all was on order to central red carnation property reservations the day before highlighted a booking error .

After an initial hic up Maria in reservations sorted things well and the service and delivery  and solution was first class, true central London hospitality standards indeed and such a refreshing discovery .

Rooms are well appointed but it’s the homely , caring service approach that is the winner here and will have us booking time and again in future .

What started as a shaky relationship turned into a true London first class hotel experience , everything one would want and more",5,2021,07,30
105,Anniversary stay,"My husband and I recently spent a few nights at the hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary and I have to say it was excellent!  We were wished a happy anniversary when we checked in and we were greeted in our room with some cupcakes and a card which was very well received and a lovely gesture.  The room was really nice and the bed was super comfortable.  We did not have dinner at the hotel but we did have breakfast each morning in the restaurant which was excellent, as was the lunch in the terrace bar on our last day. We will definitely book to stay at the hotel again for future visits and thoroughly recommend it.",5,2021,07,28
105,Very comfortable,My husband and I stayed three nights and were so pleased to have discovered this hotel.  The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly and our room was perfect and very quiet.  The bar area is also very nice.,5,2021,07,16
105,Anniversary Stay,"We decided to treat ourselves for our 35th Wedding Anniversary.  This is our 5th stay and it was as good as ever, even with the Covid restrictions.  This hotel never failed to please us and would highly recommend it.

Just a very small criticism, I sent a email to the general manager and am surprised that I did not get a acknowledgement",5,2021,07,08
105,Perfect Experience,We stayed for one night and all of the staff were exceptional and helped to make our stay during these uncertain times a most memorable and enjoyable experience! We can't recommend this hotel highly enough and the outstanding afternoon tea.,5,2021,07,05
105,The Champagne Afternoon tea is a must!,"we had the most decedent afternoon tea at the weekend, it was perfect and beautiful!

The service was perfect and the food and drinks were amazing! Cant wait to visit again! it has such a incredible posh feel to the place which makes you feel like you are royalty and the staff treat you like it too!",5,2021,07,05
105,Something extra special - outstanding,"Oh Chesterfield Mayfair, how I have missed you! What is there not to love? Attention to detail with the seven star service, Egyptian cotton, beautiful decor and an opulent but cosy feel. The bar area with live music, ambiance, excellent food and impeccable service. The breakfasts are amazing! It’s a combination of class and a personal touch. An elegant, luxurious home away from home. Will always be my favourite and puts so many five star hotels to shame. I would call out individuals for outstanding service but to be honest they are all outstanding - attentive, caring and proactive!  Honestly can’t fault it - just left longing to return already. Thank you, you must be proud of your very special hotel.",5,2021,06,27
105,Mayfair weekend,"Arrived, to be told that we were to pay £50 on top of room cost for any extras during the stay. There was no mini bar in the room and putting drink or food on the room tab would be paid on checkout as the cost of food and drink would far exceed the £50. We were given room 416 which was terrible, it was very small and  after 5 minutes you had a headache due to the stripey decor that covered the entire room. I spoke to the very nice reception staff and 2 minutes later was taken to room 201 with no fuss. The room was perfect, comfortable and spacious. I called to see if there was availability for dinner and drinks to be told it was fully booked, which was not great that as a guest you have to leave the establishment to eat, so do book before your stay. When we were leaving to go for food the bar was empty so not sure who had booked the tables. On check out we were allowed to leave our luggage for the day as our transport was late afternoon. Other than the little issues which actually led us to find a lovely pub across the road (the footman) the hotel was lovely and so were the staff especially the doormen. Would definitely stay here again but pre-book the restaurant.",4,2021,06,27
105,Perfect Wedding,"We had a wonderful time at The Chesterfield, our wedding was perfect, nothing was too much trouble.  Suzie and Sandra were extremely attentive, helpful, calm and relaxed.  The day went without a hitch.  We were very impressed that Suzie even volunteered to take photos.  A number of our guest commented how good the food was, and the cake was outstanding.  I have no hesitation in recommending The Chesterfield as a wedding venue.  The bottle of champagne in our suite was a lovely touch.  Jamie looked after our guests during our meal and was extremely responsive to all of their requests.",5,2021,06,27
105,Amazing Wedding Venue,"We booked our wedding at The Chesterfield pre-covid and had to postpone but they could not have been more flexible or understanding. The day could not have been any better, from the pre-planning to the day itself, it was all so smooth, they listened to everything we wanted and accommodated it all. The food was delicious, the service attentive, they were fun, personable and did everything they could to make the day exactly what we wanted and it exceeded our expectations. Some of our guests were abroad and not able to be there in person but the hotel helped and facilitated us with live streaming such an important event. We wanted to give a special shout out to Suzie who was with us through the whole process and who we could not have done the day without and also to Adrian who went out of his way to give us the Spanish twist that we wanted.",5,2021,06,22
105,Brilliant wedding venue,"We had our wedding in the Library here on June 12 and it was a brilliant day - the Chesterfield is beautiful, the food was amazing and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Everyone had a fantastic time. Big thanks to the Chesterfield's wedding coordinator Suzie Pagett and her team for making our day run so smoothly.",5,2021,06,20
105,This hotel is 100% fantastic and well worth the 5 star reviews,"I chose the hotel due to excellent reviews for a trip to London celebrating my wife’s birthday.
I don’t really know where to begin,

The staff went above and beyond to make our visit special and were incredibly professional and courteous.
The concierge was very helpful and offered several ideas for parking but we chose their valet option which was perfect.

We ate in Butlers restaurant in the evening, our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable, professional and accommodating.
He was simply brilliant.
The food was spectacular, we started with the scallops and had the chicken roast as the main which was absolutely delicious.
We couldn’t manage desert so finished with coffee.
Following this they provided a cake and sang happy birthday!! Brilliant.

This hotel is an absolute gem, well worthy of the five star status and we’ll definitely be returning.
Thanks so much everyone at the Chesterfield Mayfair",5,2021,06,17
105,Great first stay at the Chesterfield,"We had an absolutely lovely one night stay  at this classically English hotel. The location is second to none. The hotel is very comfortable and the service is excellent. We had a room on the third floor, which was very quiet with a super king bed, marble bathroom and quiet aircon (good as it was hot during our stay). There are tea and coffee making facilities and water provided in the room. 

The facilities at this hotel are great. It has a lovely classic bar. Drinks are really good - great prosecco!  The breakfast the next day was very good and I can recommend that you have breakfast here if possible. We were taking our family to Murano for lunch which is on the same street. Other good food and bar choices are available in the area and it’s a five minute walk to Piccadilly.",5,2021,06,13
105,"Nice, reliable place to stay","This hotel is very conveniently located for our needs. It's easy to visit our family and also to get around the West End. The hotel itself is one of ""faded elegance"", quite charming, small and comfy. Our bedroom was tiny - the smallest I think we've ever had in a London hotel - but it was perfectly functional, and good value for money in the centre of Mayfair. The air-con was good and not noisy. We had one evening meal in the restaurant, and an afternoon tea the following day - both were marvellous. All staff were very friendly & helpful. We have already booked to return later this summer.",4,2021,06,01
105,Afternoon Tea ,"Absolutely wonderful service and afternoon tea at The Chesterfield. The sweet shop themed tea is fun and delicious. The staff were lovely and attentive, and couldn't do enough for us. Made it a lovely afternoon. We had been before about 10 years ago and enjoyed it then, but this time it was even better. Highly recommended. It really is wonderful, and the welcoming treat a great surprise. I won't spoil it! We will be back...soon hopefully. ",5,2021,05,25
105,"The booking team for The Chesterfield, Mayfair - 5*+","I have a very special occasion to arrange for my fiance's birthday weekend in July (hope she doesn't see this!) so I turned to one of my old haunts to help.
Carolina on the reservations team has been amazing and so helpful in arranging this treat & I really cannot wait for the stay but I thought she deserved a special mention even at this early stage.
Another review will undoubtedly follow in July.",5,2021,05,19
105,Absolutely wonderful stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel, they very kindly were open to support key workers and those travelling for business.

From the moment we walked in to the hotel, to the moment we walked out, we had the most wonderful time.  The hotel had an old fashioned but very classy feel, was incredibly clean and tidy, and all of the staff we encountered  were incredibly friendly and helpful.

It really was one of the most memorable hotel stays we have had in a very long time.

As a result of our experience we have recommended the hotel to the guests at our Wedding in November.",5,2021,05,02
105,One star less because of the woman at the reception,"First, we have to congratulate Joszef. Every hotel should have a Joszef to turn an awful first impression in a wonderful stay. Happily, we had a very professional and high level employee at checkout : Sylvain a Breton, i guess. We had a very bad experience with the woman at the reception. We sent an email  3 days before arrival to request one extra night as our flight was canceled. The next day we called the hotel but nothing was done. When we arrived we complained but we were rudely answered. We understood that it was the same woman who took our phone call. Anyway there were plenty remaining rooms by this time of covid. Apart from these unpleasant events we had a beautiful stay, once again thanks to Joszef and Sylvain.",4,2021,03,20
105,Visit for operation,"So we are in the middle of the latest lockdown. I have been offered an operation in London and have to travel on the day and gone again. I did not realise that some hotels were open for essential purposes. I called The Chesterfield and explained we usually stay there but I had an operation and would like to travel the night before and stay over as it would be an early start. 

I was informed that this was a booking that could be made so booked up. It turned out my wife and myself were the only people in the hotel that night. We were allowed to use the bar and were even given an afternoon tea due to our circumstances. 

The staff were attentive and amazing. I was not allowed to eat the following morning but my wife had breakfast and was asked where she wanted to eat. 

We were treated like Royalty. The great service that is always received was there.   After my operation I can back and waited to be collected by our son. The staff made sure I was comfortable and had coffee and found some nice mini cakes for me to eat. They just understood what was needed. 

This is an absolutely amazing hotel with lovely staff who whether they are busy or quiet make you feel like you are the only guests and really look after you. 

Can’t wait for the lockdown to open up so we can come and visit again under normal circumstances. 

Well done again to all the staff at the Chesterfield. You are truly amazing. ",5,2021,03,15
105,Virtual Gin & Tonic Experience,"My girlfriend and I didn't actually stay at the hotel, but during lockdown we did the Virtual Gin & Tonic Experience, which I couldn't recommend highly enough! A great way to bring some excitement to another weekend spent at home. We got told about the background and history of gin as well as the three gin and tonics we tasted, which were all very different and interesting in flavour. Special thanks must go to Fiachra from the hotel who was our mixologist. Even though it was hosted over Zoom, the fact it was carried out in the hotel itself really brought it to life. Fiachra was a great host and I will be recommending it to friends for sure.",5,2021,02,21
105,Lovely,"It is located in London City centre & just 10 min walk from bond Street. 4 star hotel has more than 100 rooms , restaurant & 24 hr business centre. Rooms have coffee maker, free bottled water, free wifi",5,2021,01,27
105,The Chesterfield team gave us the perfect wedding despite COVID :),"Having had our big wedding cancelled earlier in the year due to Covid, we decided to have our legal marriage at Marylebone registry office and our reception at the Chesterfield. From start to finish, we both had (and our families) the most amazing experience – we still talk about it 2months down the line!

Firstly, this is an classy, understated family run hotel. The customer service from start to finish was best in class – we felt special the moment from the first talk we had about the possibility of hosting our wedding in the beautiful library room, our special tasting evening, the special upgrade my husband and I received the day of the wedding to the whole catering and hospitality team who wowed our family with their attentiveness, discretion and friendliness.

The food is high end restaurant quality without the stuffiness and the choices of wines (and champagne 😊) gave us loads of amazing options. In terms of value for money, you will not find the same quality on all levels elsewhere for the price – we would know having enquired with over 30 London venues and restaurants of all shapes and sizes.

We look forward to now revisiting the Chesterfield for our wedding anniversary this year!",5,2021,01,19
105,Perfect Wedding,"We had the most wonderful wedding day on the 12th December 2020 in the Library at the Chesterfield Hotel. We simply could not have asked for a more incredible day. Suzie was amazing and went above and beyond to ensure that the day ran perfectly. Even in the midst of a challenging time due to covid, Suzie and the team at the hotel were always extremely professional, efficient and quite simply, totally charming. The food was impeccable and all the guests commented on this, and still do to this day! There are no words really to describe how we feel about The Chesterfield and we just feel extremely lucky and grateful that we were able to have this experience there. The library is a beautiful setting and with the candelabra and flowers it is like a fairy tale! Our families also stayed at the hotel and were treated so warmly by the staff who were always friendly and happy to help in any way. thank you Suzie and The Chesterfield Hotel - You gave us the best day of our lives and we will treasure that memory forever.",5,2021,01,17
105,Staff go above and beyond,This was my second stay at The Chesterfield but the first time with my children. As always the service was incredible. My children were treated like royalty and the staff did everything they could to make our stay special. The Christmas decorations in the lobby were magical and really got us in the Christmas spirit. Thank you to all the staff at The Chesterfield.,5,2020,12,21
105,Great hotel,"I have stayed a few times recently.  Great location.  Nice rooms.  Good breakfast.  Lovely bar with frequent live piano.  

But the best thing... The staff!   Genuinely lovely people working hard to ensure you enjoy your stay.  

I look forward to returning as soon as I can. 

Thanks",5,2020,12,15
105,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my 3 housemates celebrated my birthday yesterday and it was beautiful! The service was excellent.. the Christmas decorations were stunning and the treats were lovely! We really enjoyed ourselves. There was a sweets trolley at the end of the experience which was a nice touch. When my friend booked she had added a note that we were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a cupcake with a candle.

Thanks to all the staff for a lovely time. I can’t wait to go back!",5,2020,12,14
105,Fantastic place friendly staff,"Me and my husband checked out of the Mayfair and into the Chesterfield hotel and what a great move we made, it’s traditional friendly amazing staff they had a beautiful piano player in the bar area the hot sausage rolls were fabulous, we were waited on hand and foot just lovely  old fashioned service the room was lovely 308 and breakfast was exceptional I really couldn’t find a fault ",5,2020,12,13
105,Wonderful Festive Afternoon Tea,"I love this hotel! The staff cannot do enough for you, the cakes are presented beautifully and taste amazing! I have lots of food allergies that were catered for which was amazing. This was a special treat for my dads 60th birthday and we had a really lovely time! We couldn’t eat all the cakes so were given nice branded boxes to take them home in as well as a sweetie bag from the sweet trolley!

105,Winter wonderland afternoon tea,"Had a delicious Christmas themed afternoon tea, tasty vegetarian sandwiches and cakes provided for myself, husband enjoyed his usual selection, the choices of teas were great would recommend the chocolate tea. All finished off with a trip to the sweet shop stall for a bag of sweets to take away. Would recommend coming here for afternoon tea this was our 3rd visit",5,2020,12,07
105,A fabulous long weekend at The Chesterfield.,"My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield for two nights. Everything about our trip was just perfect. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, with a special mention to Josef. 
Our room was a superior King on the fifth floor. Space was a little tight, especially in the bathroom, but it was beautifully appointed and to be fair, we weren’t in the room very much. 
The bed was super comfortable and we didn’t hear a sound at night. The location is excellent, being a couple of minutes walk from Shepherd Market with all its bars and restaurants. Bond Street is a five minute walk away. 
We were delighted that the bar was open and serving fabulous cocktails. Current regulations require food to be ordered with any alcoholic drinks, but we always had room for a light bite to share at £7.00. We will most definitely be returning!",5,2020,12,06
105,Amazing food and staff!,I went for afternoon tea yesterday and have to say that it was the best experience. Staff were making sure that everyone was safe and masks were worn by all staff members. Would 100% recommend the afternoon tea - incredibly tasty! Fiachra (manager) was so helpful and was exceptional. I am going back in December for the whiskey tasting and I look forward to seeing the staff again!,5,2020,11,03
105,A lovely experience,"I do like a posh English afternoon tea, and this was one of the best. Great food, nice surroundings and friendly staff. The welcome drink and bag of sweets were memorable touches. Good value for London.",5,2020,11,02
105,Brilliant first time visit - totally recommend,"We booked the afternoon tea the day before after deciding on a last minute day trip to London. We had the original sweet shop themed afternoon tea and absolutely loved it.
Valerij served us and he was a superstar. Very attentive and professional and lovely with the kids. They were given a little bear and a bag of sweets from the traditional sweet stand at the end. 
The cakes were plentiful and decent quality. The sandwiches were not the quality of the Ritz or Savoy but to be fair it was nowhere near as expensive. We had a fantastic visit and I would totally recommend. Brilliant hygiene in the current climate too.",5,2020,11,01
105,Short stay in October,"We stayed for one night and all of the staff were exceptional, (Josef, Federika and Ellenora), you were fabulous and helped to make our stay during these uncertain times a most memorable and enjoyable experience!
We can't recommend this hotel highly enough, and perfectly situated for a short pleasant stroll down to the Ritz for afternoon Tea.",5,2020,11,01
105,An excellent alternative,Very helpful friendly staff who provided exceptional service throughout our stay. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary in London due to not being able to go to Venice due to Covid 19. Our stay at the Chesterfield proved to be an excellent alternative with a personal touch that was much appreciated. Nothing was too much trouble and all the staff we met were warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you all for a lovely stay.,5,2020,10,29

105,Anniversary break ,"My husband and I have just spent a most enjoyable four days at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary.  We were made very welcome by the excellent friendly staff, particularly Jozeph, Mauritzia and Denizia. Nothing was too much trouble for them. All the meals were delicious especially the Prawn Stroganoff. 
Our room was extremely comfortable, clean and very cosy with delightful decor. 
The Coronavirus protocols were well maintained and we felt quite safe.
If we decide on a short break in London in the future, we shall certainly want to stay here again. 
 ",5,2020,10,27
105,The Original Sweetshop Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful afternoon tea experience- a lovely theme of retro sweets.
Maurizia and the staff were all friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, and the staff came several time to ask if we needed anything. We ordered several tea flavours to try, my fave being fruit salad tea, and the sandwiches were fresh n tasty- the regular filling you expect with different and interesting breads. Everything was replenished, including the scones, and a doggie bag was taken home by all which included extras. A wonderful bonus was the sweet trolly which was filled with our favourite sweeties to enjoy, we left happy and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.",5,2020,10,25
105,Lovely hotel recommend,"I really loved this hotel it’s good location, walking distance to a lot of restaurants and bars and train station. The hotel itself is clean and old fashioned which gave it a real cosy feeling. They have a piano player at night in the bar which was really lovely to listen to while having a relaxed drink. Really loved the decor. One thing We didn’t like was the breakfast. We got the fry and wasn’t worth 15 pound but part from that amazing.",4,2020,10,25
105,Just Lovely,"Wonderful hotel, staff so helpful, nice surprise of a personalised welcome card and biscuits in our room on our first night. Room very well appointed, bed linen divine, beds comfy, room spotlessly clean. Breakfast delicious. The only sad thing for us was not being able to have a kettle in the room due to COVID risk assessment identifying it as a high touch point, which for us tea addicts was a bit of a disappointment. Understand of course,  although I would have said the loo and the door handles were a more significant risk than a kettle. Anyway it did mean we had a pot of tea in the bar one afternoon along with some more delicious biscuits, so no harm done really. Recommended. (And do check out the prices on their website rather than the hotel sites, got it much cheaper by booking direct.)",5,2020,10,13
105,Amazing Afternoon Tea experience ,"We came here today for the candy themed afternoon tea for my daughters 6th birthday. The staff were so kind and went above and beyond to make my daughter feel special, even cheering her up with a candy cane and a teddy bear when she accidentally knocked over my afternoon tea stand and got upset! The impeccable customer service and the great quality food means we will definitely return and we highly recommend it to others. Thank you so much to the kind and professional staff. ",5,2020,10,10
105,An incredible afternoon tea,"My family and I went to afternoon tea at the chesterfield mayfair hotel and we were blown away by how innovative and special the experience was. The customer service by the waiters and waitress was impeccable and they all anticipated our needs and the service was seemless. We also loved the songs that the pianist played and how skilled he is. As Swedes we enjoyed the ABBA most of all, of course.We all agreed that this is the best afternoon tea that we have been to. From entering the hotel everyone welcomed us and made us feel special and that carried on throughout. We highly recommend this afternoon tea.",5,2020,10,10
105,Afternoon tea,"My family and I visited The Chesterfield for a last minute afternoon tea due to a hiccup with a previous booking elsewhere. Thank goodness for the hiccup because this was the better option, the afternoon tea was truly delightful, the hotel was spotless and the service was really second to none! The staff were amazing, so friendly and you could tell they went above and beyond for you to have a great time especially given the current situation with covid 19. Special mention to Mauritza who was fantastic. Thanks to all and keep safe!",5,2020,10,10
105,Perfect,"I stayed here last night for one night as I was attending an event nearby. I can’t fault anything - from the room to the service, everything was just perfect. All staff members I came across were very friendly and helpful. My room was lovely and comfortable and had pretty much everything I could want. The only thing it didn’t have was tea and coffee making facilities, which would have been nice, but there were 2 bottles of water provided. The 24 hour bar downstairs had drinks, including coffee, that we could take up to our room if we wished. I stayed in room 317 - a small but comfortable en suite room with a double bed and a very large flat screen tv with Sky tv. There were plenty of sockets in the room to plug in your electricals, including USB sockets. An ironing board and safe are in the wardrobe. The bathroom is filled with everything you could need - large bottles of shampoo and conditioner, towels, dressing gowns, soap, hand and body lotion, cotton buds, and even face cloths, which I was particularly pleased about, as many hotels don’t provide face cloths any more, and I hadn’t brought my own. There was a bath and a shower in the room. The bed was very comfortable, the room temperature was just right, and it was nice and quiet, so I slept well. I’d definitely stay here again.",5,2020,10,08
105,Fabulous Hotel,"I have just returned from an overnight stay with a life long friend 
From our arrival at reception until we checked out this afternoon the service we received was tremendous .

Our rooms were ready on arrival no waiting around for the room to be cleaned , room was amazing we were so lucky to be upgraded to a suite ,,, what a surprise it was huge , beautifully furnished ,bathroom with bath and shower ,

105,Weekend stay,Wow. Fab location. Fab bar. Cosy rooms. Really great hotel in such a great location for shopping and food. Staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay. The breakfast was really great and a good size,5,2020,10,05
105,Superb wedding experience.,"We had our daughters wedding here last Sunday 27th Sept which originally should have happened 3 weeks later but due to Covid guide lines being changed to 15 guests only from Monday 28thSept, the hotel managed at very short notice [4 days] to arrange a marriage and celebration dinner for 30 guests. There was absolutly  nothing that we can think of that could have made a happier day, the service from all of the staff in particular Suzie and Edgar along with many others made it such a great occasion.  A very big thank you Chesterfield Mayfair absolutely brilliant!",5,2020,10,04
105,Beautiful wedding venue with exceptional staff,"We recently got married at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel and it was absolutely beautiful. We are really grateful to the manager Sarah Walsh and her team for hosting our wedding in their exquisite old Library. 

From our first email to them until the time we left the hotel everything was handled seamlessly with outstanding service, friendliness and professionalism - from Sylvain and Lauren on reception who greeted us when we first arrived, to Jorges on the door and the waiter who expertly served us amazing food and wine throughout the evening meal. Their service was absolutely exceptional. 

Despite it being a small wedding their team made it feel really special and they all went the extra mile in everything they did. They allowed us the flexibility and space to make the day our own which was very much appreciated. The food (you must try the dover sole!) and the bar service was also fantastic. 

The Executive bedroom suite was luxury and came with a complementary bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries which was a really nice touch.

A really beautiful hotel with exceptional staff.",5,2020,10,03
105,Anniversary Break,"We spent 3 nights @ The Chesterfield and had a wonderful time. Our room was super and the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. The staff were relentlessly accommodating especially Eleanora in the bar, with whom we did the gin experience, and Daniela in the restaurant, who looked after us very well at breakfast. We will return!",5,2020,10,02
105,"Brilliant staff, warm atmosphere","The restaurant and bar relax you from the moment you arrive. The staff are friendly and attentive and make the whole visit thoroughly enjoyable. Thank you to all, especially Eleonora who made the gin tasting experience informative and fun. Looking forward to my next visit. Well done everyone involved.",5,2020,10,02
105,Afternoon Tea Birthday Celebration,"Very relaxed atmosphere which I liked. Staff were fantastic. Food on the whole was really good. The only 3 things I didn’t like were the cream cheese & cucumber sandwiches - soggy & bland, cupcake was quite dry & the cheesecake wasn’t a cheesecake. Overall really good value for money. ",4,2020,09,27
105,Gin&tonic experience,"Brilliant gin & tonic experience, great explanations and friendly, engaging staff, Eleonora was lovely. The live band was amazing, created a great atmosphere. Bar staff were friendly and helpful. Will go again!",5,2020,09,25
105,"Great location, great staff.","Right in the heart of Mayfair, the best word for the Chesterfield is probably 'plush'. Lovely, old style rooms, with excellent beds and tasteful furniture. Breakfast was good and the check-in was faultless. Would recommend.",4,2020,09,23
105,Invited by clients,"I took this invitation to take my wife to this magnificent hotel, everything was majestic, very warm welcome, little gifts in our room, bright room and magnificent decoration, the bathroom was worthy of a fairy tale, small lunch worthy of a palace, many choices, salty and sweet, everything was at will and so delicious, this hotel was above what I expected, bravo",5,2020,09,23
105,Another Great but Short Stay - December,"Another Great but Short Stay - December

In December, we were back to London, and this time for a leisure trip. We did a split-stay, in Mayfair, and ended with The Chesterfield Mayfair. This was the 6th time, by my count, that we had stayed there, though our last, was over a year ago. As there were no business meetings, and we did not need a large board room, we were free to stay, where we wanted, and that was The Chesterfield.

The Chesterfield Mayfair, which is part of the Red Carnation Group, is a quiet, quaint, classic, intimate and very charming hotel. It is smallish, and that is a large part of its charm. I typify The Chesterfield Mayfair, as a “luxury boutique hotel.” It also has stellar service, and even after more than a year, we were welcomed as though we had just stayed there.

For the third time, we got to stay in the lovely, and fairly spacious Duchess Suite, 429. As this suite is in an adjoining building, and attached to the main structure, and as with many adjoining buildings, the fourth floor in one part, does not align with the fourth floor in the other. That is the case here, as there are about three short steps down to this part of the building, from the fourth floor of the main building. There is a small lift, but then there are still the three steps.

The Duchess Suite #429 is basically three rooms: an adequate bedroom, with a comfortable King bed, a large bathroom with a very small walk-in shower (my wife has artificial hips, so a major plus), and then a living room, and the hallway, including the entrance. All aspects of this room were great, and very, very comfortable. We were very comfortable with both the layout, and the arrangement of this suite. Almost nothing (that I noticed) had changed, from our previous stay - the lovely décor had not changed - nothing - but I think we got more TV channels, than before?.

The bathroom had a full compliment of bath amenities, in the Elemis line, and we had soft, fluffy towels, plus a very effective towel warmer - nice for December. We had very good hot water, and very good water pressure, at all hours of the day. Going back to our first stay in The Duchess Suite, I learned that I had to take care in the small shower. At 6' and 200 lbs, I tended to brush the shower controls, when turning around. I found that I am getting better at not doing so now.

Upon arrival, we had a nice fruit basket, along with a lovely floral arrangement. Before the end of our short stay, there was another fruit basket in the room. We had a decanter of Sherry w/ two goblets, and then a “Farewell” chocolate plate, on the day of departure.

We had learned on the previous stay, that the floor creaked, and especially at the entrance, and the entrance to the bedroom. We had pretty much mapped out where to walk, in case there was a room just below us. By now, we could walk almost silently between the bedroom and the livingroom. Now, I only hope that any creaking was not heard by other guests, as we heard nothing, from inside the hotel. On a previous stay, there was some street noise, from racing sports cars on Charles St, but we heard no traffic noise this time. The windows are also double-pane, and that kept the cold December air at bay.

The Duchess Suite overlooks Charles St, and being on the 4th floor, so there is no real “view,” except for the buildings across the fairly narrow street - however, the view is inside the suite.

Again, we dined at Butler’s, on-property, for several breakfasts, and then for one dinner. We visited the bar, plus the Afternoon Tea room, on several occasions. Once more, the bar staff seemed to be keeping tabs on our desired wines, and frequently as we were being seated, those would appear without ordering – a very nice personal touch

We have always found the staff at The Chesterfield to be great - gracious, friendly, helpful and always welcoming. Before our first stay, many years ago, we had stopped in, at the recommendation of a friend. The manager gave us a complete tour of the property, and we knew that we would be returning, as patrons, and have many times. We will be back again, as this is such a wonderful hotel, and The Duchess Suite suits our purposes nicely.",5,2020,09,22
105,Mrs brown,"Hi I had a fabulous time .. the room was lovely , beautiful sheets . I have dietary issues that were taken care of , nothing was any trouble . Superb breakfast . Lovely staff , polite and helpful 😀Will definitely book again. 😀🍾",4,2020,09,20
105,Afternoon tea,"Today myself and my husband had the sweet shop afternoon tea . The staff were fantastic and made sure you didn’t go hungry or thirsty . The afternoon tea it self was lovely and if you have a sweet tooth like my husband then it’s deff worth trying. 

The only Criticism from me is I don’t agree on a service charge on top . I feel they should up the price and take away the service charge if it’s the hotels way of making more money . I have been to a lot of afternoon teas and the staff and hotel do the same job as any of other hotel or venue does and they don’t have a service charge . This is just my opinion and I would not come back here again as I don’t agree in service charges . I would much prefer to go to a restaurant and leave a tip that I feel the staff and venue deserves then to be dictated what to give .      ",4,2020,09,20
105,A luxurious gem in Mayfair,"Staying at the Chesterfield in Mayfair was a very good experience. Situated off the busy Berkeley Square the hotel is well appointed from the moment you enter. The staff   were most helpful in all areas, from the lobby, to the restaurants, bars and reception all made you feel welcome. Service was excellent and the hotel have made the stay exceptionally covid safe all around the property. We ate in the evening and had breakfast too at the hotel and the quality and service was tip top. They have a special afternoon themed tea that looked tempting maybe another time. All in all a highly recommended hotel if you are staying in central London.",5,2020,09,14
105,In the heart of Mayfair,"I visited Chesterfield for my birthday. The hotel is in heart of Mayfair in a great location only 8-10 mins from Green park around a 15 min walk to Buckingham palace.

The rooms are to a high standard. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment. The cost of breakfast was £25 we headed to a McDonald's which was a 15 min walk.

The staff are excellent especially a French guy called Silvian, he gave me and my fiend a tour of the hotel and was so helpful at giving help & advice during our stay.

As a birthday treat a small birthday cake was sent to my room which i thought was an excellent touch from the hotel and i will remember that for a long time.

I would 100% return to this hotel & would recommend to friends & family.",5,2020,09,10
105,Lovely hotel for a special occasion,"We generally stay at another Red Carnation property, but as that one was not available, we chose to spend our anniversary at the Chesterfield, and we were not disappointed.  The staff were just as lovely to us here as in our usual haunt.

The property is lovely and luxurious, situated in Mayfair - close to Buckingham Palace and Green Park (among many other things).

We had a noise issue our first night, but the staff was very kind and helpful and arranged for us to transfer rooms the next morning and surprised us with an amazing upgrade. 

Front desk was friendly, the bar / breakfast staff were lovely and attentive. 

We had a very nice afternoon tea and were again surprised with a special cake for our anniversary. Everyone made us feel special throughout the weekend - our thanks to all of the staff.",5,2020,09,05
105,Great Teamwork,"Our first return to our favourite hotel since 'Lockdown' resulted in another very enjoyable stay despite the obvious low occupancy and constrained manning. As always nothing was too much trouble for this hotel team who were multi-skilling - the Receptionist on check-in was also serving drinks in the bar and when we checked-out after two very comfortable nights, even the General Manager retrieved our car from valet-parking! On the second night we enjoyed a very tasty menu from the 'eat out to help out' fare - two courses for £20 a head. Clearly business levels are low but that did not prevent us from having another great stay at this well-run, customer-friendly hotel. Just a quick mention of Bellman Joseph, he's a star, couldn't do enough for customers and remembers everyone's name (including Peanut - our Sheltie) .",5,2020,09,03
105,London weekend,"Superb stay at the Chesterfield.  We travelled as a family and stayed in the beautifully furnished Stanhope Suite.  The children were delighted to have their own slippers and bathrobes - a lovely touch!  We treated ourselves to afternoon tea, which was fabulous and very creative, with a special treat for children at the end.  The breakfast menu is extensive with choices to suit all tastes. The hotel is situated near Berkeley Square, about a 5 min walk from Regent Street - very central, yet in a lovely quiet street away from the crowds. The staff are very friendly and attentive - special shout out to Jozef who looked after us throughout our stay!  Would highly recommend this to anyone visiting London for business or leisure.",5,2020,09,02
105,BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"I had the most wonderful experience in this hotel. We were greeted by the manager Sarah upon arrival who was so welcoming and friendly, she set the mood for our fabulous stay. 

We were so enamoured by the hotel interiors which rang with tasteful opulence. Incredible attention to detail was displayed regarding cleanliness ensuring that we felt totally safe and comfortable throughout our stay.

We treated our selves to the Afternoon tea which I can not  recommend highly enough! I also advise future guests to enjoy the bar where an array of cocktails are served and the atmosphere is enhanced by a pianist playing in the background. The hotel is set in the heart of Mayfair and we were able to indulge in the cities finest shopping and dining. Finally the extensive breakfast menu offered a great selection of vegetarian options for me. I can’t wait to return!",5,2020,08,28
105,A characterful and ultra friendly hotel,"All the people who worked here in the hotel were so friendly and welcoming. They made us feel at home, especially in the bar which is a great place to hang out, we found. The room (a classic double) was comfortable and the bathroom quite a good size for London hotels. We liked the individual and characterful design of the place. Location is great for Mayfair, the parks, Knightsbridge is within walking distance. The shop where Nancy Mitford worked is just round the corner. We dined at the restaurant one evening  and had a fantastic meal. So, definitely will be staying again.",5,2020,08,26
105,August 2020 Birthday Stay,"5 Star experience throughout for Girlfriends Birthday celebrations. Booked for one night for ease of access to selection of restaurants and Heathrow Airport the next day via taxi which is 25/ 30 mins or tube from
green-park. My girlfriend and I had afternoon Tea on arrival along with cocktails and drinks in the bar. A pianist played in the background of the bar area with a decent level of atmosphere as a result with many residents  dropping in. Drink selection is vast with a very knowledgeable bar man. Room cleanliness was outstanding and nothing spared with Covid measures throughout the hotel. Special mention to Sarah the Manager who we met on arrival who ensured our experience from start to finish was top class. ",5,2020,08,25
105,Celebrating 15th Wedding anniversary ❤️,"Lovely weekend away. Beautiful hotel, lovely atmosphere, very friendly staff & very good service. Working for NHS I felt very safe with all covid protocols in place. Special mention to Sylvain and Lauren who was always happy to assist. Thank you and hope to come back again to explore more of London. ",5,2020,08,25
105,Very special afternoon tea ,"The sweet shop afternoon tea is very special. This hotel is beautiful and the afternoon tea tables were well spread out. I do love a theme and it’s pretty well thought out including fruit salad flavoured tea!

We really enjoyed the little surprise at the start of service which made us smile. The sandwiches were very fresh. The scones were top notch. The cakes were great. Our favourite was the eclair which we agreed was the best we ever had. Sadly the cupcake was stale.

The service was fast & efficient. My nut allergy was well catered for. 

I wasn’t impressed about paying £5 for a small glass of Diet Coke.",5,2020,08,24
105,Incredible from start to finish,"I recently visited the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair as a post lockdown treat. I was greeted with the same usual warmth but all of the necessary precautions were in place.

Sylvain was great upon arrival and gave us a tour of the beautiful historic building.

We hardly left the hotel the service was that great. The room was spacious, beautifully appointed and with everything we needed and more!

We organised all of our dining via the Food & Beverage Manager - a charming gent called Edgar. The Chesterfield are taking part in the popular ‘eat out to help out’ which provided additional value upon an already very reasonably priced menu. And the food is DELICIOUS. 

We enjoyed afternoon tea one day which has an excellent theme, great portions and amazing flavours.

The second evening we relaxed in the bar, listening to the pianist and Adrian the Bar Manager took care of us. He recommended me some fantastic gins from their selection and I had to ask him to write them down, I was very impressed. We even had the pleasure of meeting the Chef, Nathan, who despite being very busy had time to come up and talk us through the dishes we enjoyed, giving us some top tips.

I will not stay anywhere else when staycationing in London again - thank you to the team at The Chesterfield for everything.",5,2020,08,23
105,A memorable stay,"We were originally booked to go to Spain in August , but due to the current situation we cancelled the trip. Decided to stay in the UK , but avoid the hordes at coastal resorts. Originally looked at The Edgerton which is a sister hotel to the Chesterfield , but they were fully booked, am now glad they were!
We checked in for a 4 night break and the staff on reception could not have been more welcoming. The hotel has a very intimate feel ,and is more like a cozy London club. We upgraded to a suite ,and stayed in the Duchess Suite, which is very traditional, which we loved. You could have imagined Winston Churchill staying in our rooms drinking a whiskey and smoking a cigar. We had room service breakfast for a couple of mornings and service was quick and efficient and the food was great.
The hotel bar was a lovely place to have pre/after dinner drinks .The bar bar staff were very friendly and knowledgable ,with excellent customer service skills. A special mention to Victoria in the bar, who is a credit to the The chesterfield .The location of the hotel is in a quiet street in Mayfair, a short stroll to oxford street and all the surrounding places of interest. All in all highly recommended ,and thanks again to all the staff who made our stay memorable .",5,2020,08,22
105,BRILLIANT STAY,"We stayed here because it was conveniently close to the Ritz, where we were having Afternoon Tea the following day, gifted to us by a relative. 
The hotel was lovely. We had a standard room that was spotlessly clean and incredibly well maintained. We stay in a lot of hotels and seldom have we found one that is so well maintained. (No peeling wall paper or shabby paint work). The service that we received was exemplary. Despite the challenging times that post Covid have brought upon the hotel industry, we were greeted by Sylvain with such warmth and friendliness. We also had the pleasure of meeting Adam, the general manager. Whilst enjoying some late night hospitality, he kindly told us that we may have a late check out the following day so that we did not need to spend hours in our finery wandering around London before taking afternoon tea at the Ritz. This was much appreciated. All the staff we met were very well trained, polite and welcoming. Breakfast was also very good. In fact, as I write this review we are inviting our friends to join us on a return visit in December. Thank you Adam and team.",5,2020,08,21
105,The best,"I’ve paid a visit the other day for afternoon tea as never had The experience before, as soon as We walked in we were so impressed with the service, this guys are on the top of my favourites list, the food was amazing and the champagne was as bubbly as our servers. 
To describe in one word I would simply say A M A Z I N G
Well done team and thanks for making my experience unforgettable.
See you soon ",5,2020,08,19
105,Excellent service and worth the price,Me and my partner were meant to get married this month however due to Covid have had to reschedule for next year. Therefore I planned a small treat at the Chesterfield for afternoon tea and a nights stay on what would have been our wedding day. Service was excellent from booking online ( I booked during lockdown so emailed to check reopening) to the day itself. The afternoon tea was delicious and would recommend getting it with a glass of champagne. The staff were welcoming always happy to help. The room was luxurious. We would happily come again and would recomend for anyone wanting to stay in Central London.,5,2020,08,14
105,Little rugby trip,"We stayed at this lovely hotel whilst visiting london to watch England play rugby at Twickenham (England won, which of course added enjoyment to our trip) we visited the ice bar, sexy fish, had dinner at Novikov and oysters at Bentleys.. all of which I would fully recommend (all pre covid).The hotel itself is luxurious, friendly and in a great location. The staff are so attentive and helpful, attention to detail is second to none. Cocktails are also amazing as is breakfast! Great stay in london and a great base to explore the wonderful sights.",5,2020,08,05
105,Afternoon tea at last,"I was given a gift voucher for Afternoon tea as a  Christmas present and intended to use it in April for my friends birthday , then lock down happened. Last week I noticed that they were open for teas again and phoned up to book a table , I had no trouble booking for my preferred time.
We were greeted with a warm welcome and chose where we wanted to sit, I couldn't believe we were the only ones there at 2 pm .
We were brought a delicious little drink , asked if we had any allergies and told we could order more of everything so there was no need to argue who was having which cake.
The sandwiches were divine , fresh and so tasty but the fruit scones with clotted cream and jam were to die for ....I did try one of the chocolate ones as well.
By this time we were feeling rather full but we tasted some of the cakes after cutting them in half, the cakes left over I brought home as the delightful waitress brought me a little cake box to put them in. 
Being older and more traditional I found the taste of some of the cakes a little odd.
The sweet stall was tucked away in a corner but as I wanted a photo of it the waitress took us over and gave us a bag of sweets.
We had a relaxing enjoyable tea which I thoroughly enjoyed.
I would suggest you book now , everything was very clean and the tables separated  so you wouldn't be sitting close to anyone.",5,2020,07,25
105,Lovely as always -,"Spent three days at The Chesterfield. Return every December to same hotel and same room. Breakfast is superb, room service is great . This is my favorite hotel in the World and I just love IT ❤️Staff is excellent and the tea party is lovely. ",5,2020,07,14
105,when will we receive our refund?,"STILL WAITING FOR REFUND!
Paid  for room as a birthday present in January(£480.25 )  it is now July 1st and despite countless phone calls/emails (all unanswered until June 5th we are still waiting for refund.i spoke to Lauren today and am told no date can be given for refund .the hotel is now taking new bookings so perhaps they are just to busy to reimburse?? very disappointed and let down. when this awful situation does finally change i will not be booking the Chesterfield again",1,2020,07,02
105,"Inconvenient location, rude concierge","The location is tucked away so well it is hard to find.  Inconvenient for Theatreland visits if you are a walker.  Walking is part of what makes London wonderful.  If you want to be treated like a dumb tourist (which is the attitude here), they happily have lots of taxis outside ready to take your money and laugh all the way to the bank.  Breakfast is exorbitant $$$$ but you are stuck if you want a bite before heading out.  Concierge is incredibly rude, condescending - needs to go back to his council flat and stay there.  This is a hideaway hotel for Brits.  Also local Mayfair crowd that like the bar and tea.  Spare yourself.  The low cost of rooms  overshadowed by Inconvenience, Overpriced Food, Rude Concierge.",2,2020,06,21
105,More than Exceptional!,"I there are no enough words to describe how amazing, caring, professional, second to none their staff is! My husband and I were there for our anniversary, and their staff paid attention to every little detail for us to have no need to ask for a thing. Before we even through about needing anything, it was already taken care of. The hotel is beautiful and centrally located. We can't wait to go back.",5,2020,04,15
105,Stunning Hotel in Mayfair,"Used the Chesterfield for a recent trip to London to attend a concert at the Palladium. Staff very friendly and efficient. Hotel located in a quiet area with a short walk of the Greenpark Tube station. Nice bar and food available, but also lots of alternatives in the neighbouring streets. Room was spacious and well appointed with all modern conveniences. Short walk to Regent St and associated good shopping.",5,2020,04,01
105,Another great time at the Chesterfield,"After staying at the Chesterfield Palm Beach, we became enamoured with the boutique hotel experience.  So, for our recent trip to London, we were happy to find the Chesterfield Mayfair on our short list.  Once we arrived, we were immediately impressed with the staff and we made our way to our gorgeous room.  Over the course of 5 long, touristy days in London, we were happy to return to this magnificent establishment and sit and enjoy a few cocktails in their well appointed lounge.  Many thanks to Oisin and Alex in the lounge for their professional service and well made cocktails  (top notch work Oisin :) .",5,2020,03,31
105,Exceptional hotel,"The hotel is truely exceptional and the staff are wonderful, considerate and caring.
We were staying at the hotel as a special treat, on our wedding night. 
Our wedding was cancelled but we decided to continue with our stay. 
We were delighted with the care and attention we received, with a room upgrade, complimentary champagne and special dessert from the chef.
We can't wait to go back next year for our real wedding night.
Thank you to all the staff 
The location of the hotel is great, walking distance to Hyde Park, Picadilly and many fine bars and restaurants.",5,2020,03,23
105,Gracious and kind hotel!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is centrally located in Mayfair. Our room was quiet, comfortable, nicely decorated and impeccably clean. Excellent breakfast with an extensive menu - the hotel is classic British design and comfort. However, what was most impressive was the excellence of the hotel staff's service. We stayed  during the implementation of travel restrictions by the US due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The hotel's desk staff were very understanding, helpful and kind as we cancelled plans and rebooked airline tickets. However, all the staff - desk, room cleaning and dining room staff were gracious and helpful throughout our stay. The very best of British hotel service - we will definitely stay here again.",5,2020,03,20
105,"Super lovely decorations, playing the piano and super friendly all of staffs","Every staffs from door mans to waiters and waitresses were super friendly and they always smiled. The place was lovable and the mood was so cozy. Plus, here were beautiful bunch of flowers inside. I saw a little boy's birthday celebrations, the staffs gave a cute doll for him. I guess this place is specially good for children because there were many candies decorations and they gave us real candies for thanks gift. I want to highly recommend here for everyone. :)",5,2020,03,19
105,Birthday Surprise for my boyfriends 40th,"Wow! Not sure where to start other than our stay was absolutely wonderful.
I wanted a treat for my partner so decided on this little gem, from the red canopies outside, to the beautiful entrance and being greeted by lots of smiling staff...not the false smile, genuine please to meet us smiles.

We arrived early so thought we would just be storing luggage until later in the day but our room had been made ready early so we had time to freshen up before the show. The room was spotless and felt quite opulent...fabric walls, silk curtains, everything embroidered with the Chesterfield ‘C’. We came back after the show to be greeted with a hand written birthday card that the whole team had signed and a fabulous birthday cake...my partner was very pleasantly surprised.

We went to Gordon Ramsey’s for dinner wish was only 10 minute walk away and decided to end the night in the Terrace bar with the talented pianist. Perfect end to the day. 

The bed was so comfortable (loved the quilt) We had our breakfast delivered to our room then relaxed in the dressing gowns until check out at 12pm...this has to be the most relaxed weekend I’ve ever spent in London. 

We decided to go shopping in oxford street as it was only 15 minute walk and was able to leave our luggage all day.

I can not fault this hotel, we would love to return and I made the perfect choice to celebrate my partners birthday.

Thank you so much to everyone that made it so special.",5,2020,03,17
105,Our home away from home,"This is our fourth stay in 2 years at this fabulous property, each stay being over a week long.  when going to London, we dont even consider other places to stay - this property is our home away from home.  The staff tends to your every need as if you were royalty.  They make it really difficult to go home.  Carlos is the new Guest Relations manager and is the crowned jewel in the crown of this gem of a hotel.  We chatted about mulled wine, and that evening he came to the room and made some for us!  Mention a former menu item?  He's got it for you.  Karolys will make recommendations and secure your reservations to anything you want to do in the city faster than you can blink (be sure and congratulate him on his wedding). The heated floors in the bathrooms are fabulous, the rooms spotless, the doormen like having mom greet you after school, the bar drinks and food just amazing.  The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the underground or the staff can get you a taxi in 2 minutes.  Honestly, I miss this place and the staff when I am not there.  Cant wait to go back...",5,2020,03,16
105,Unforgettable proposal,"We would like to thanks all staff members for everything. We have spent a wonderful journey in your hotel. The room was vert clean and neat, beautifuly decorated. Every staff members was very nice and kind. The food was excellent, the Gin expérience ce was perfect the cocktail seras very good everything was perfect.

Special thanks to the pianiste and the hotel manager who made this magic night unforgettable.",5,2020,03,14
105,Perfect stay,"Loved this little hotel. Staff were very kind and accommodating. Room was ample size for two, clean and comfortable. I loved the location in Mayfair - off the main road, but close enough to many great things including restaurants and Green Park.  Tube station only about 7-8 minutes away. Restaurant was also quite good.",5,2020,03,13
105,Great service ,"We stayed here for two nights. The staff were brilliant, friendly, and helpful! Nothing was too much trouble for them. Only downfall is the rooms are a bit basic for what you pay but we know your paying for the postcode. The rooms just didn’t look like the photos on the website. We had breakfast both days, that was lovely! Bubble and squeak was my favourite. We had chips and sandwiches aswell and they were lovely! ",5,2020,03,11
105,One night only,"We stayed here for one night in Saturday. Yes it slap bang in the middle of Mayfair and the price reflects that ... ouch! The front desk staff were top notch. The room was luxurious, the linen was exceptional. Robes were provided although we didn't use them, toiletries were plentiful. I was disappointed that there were elements that let the room down such as a badly scratched toilet seat and stains on the bathroom floor. And the view was of the back of the hotel area. Not very inspiring. But the bed was soft and luxurious and we slept well.",4,2020,03,10
105,A fabulous  afternoon tea,"Fantastic food and great service, we loved the sweet shop afternoon tea! Well worth a visit and reasonably priced. The fruit salad tea was delicious, the welcome drink was a raspberry lemonade and was steaming! We absolutely loved it",5,2020,03,08
105,Our second visit it won’t be our last!,"This hotel is superb.  The staff are extremely helpful, the beds are extremely comfortable and the food delicious!
We have stayed there twice now and we will return. 
Another bonus is the location which is only a few minutes walk from Piccadilly. ",5,2020,03,08
105,Fabulous hotel in every way!,"I spent two days at the Chesterfield Mayfair and loved everything about this lovely hotel. But what stands out most is the extraordinary staff. When you call reception you might be fortunate enough to speak with Wasim, the friendliest, most helpful hotel employee I believe I've ever encountered. He sets the tone for a staff that is eager to help, always polite, and well trained in the art of hotel management. I would surely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again. Brilliant location, lovely decor, comfortable rooms. Just perfect.",5,2020,03,06
105,Located in the high end district it is an old hotel with lovely appointments.,An absolutely fabulous breakfast.  The rooms are charming though a little small for US standards.  It is located in the yuppy areas of London local markets and food easy walking distance.  the bar was lovely as was the staff.,4,2020,03,06
105,Wife's Birthday Treat,"We spent three really enjoyable Days at the Chesterfield, it was everything we hoped it would be, the staff attentive polite and knowledgeable, the restaurant both for evening dining or breakfast was exceptional and the superior king bedroom was just that, I would highly recommend a stay here and look forward to returning in the not too distant future.",5,2020,03,05
105,Weekend Anniversary ,"It’s not often I take time to write such reviews however I must say I feel compelled to feedback regarding the hotel and absolutely wonderful staff. From the concierge, the waiters, front desk, cleaning staff and all the rest of the staff there a big big thank you for taking the time to make such genuine effort to make our stay special. Our room was delightful and dressed to make our anniversary special from the moment we opened the door. 

It is if real credit to any organisation when the staff are self motivated towards genuinely wanting visitors to feel welcomed and special. 

Well done all and a very special thank you back. 

Neil and Natalie. ",5,2020,03,02
105,"Lovely hotel, service and location ","From arrival we received a great welcome and service. The Butler Bar was comfortable, with a good selection of bar food for a lunchtime snack (the sharing plates worked well for us) and breakfast was tasty, with a good selection. The bedroom was comfortable and spacious enough. My advice is to book direct with the hotel rather than through a booking g site as we then received a voucher towards lunch in the bar or dinner. The location is very central and just a few minutes walk from Berkeley square, Hyde Park and Oxford Street",5,2020,03,01
105,Home away from home in the heart of Mayfair,"I have been travelling in and out of London for years and have struggled to find somewhere which has been close enough to work, but peaceful enough for me to return. The hotel itself is beautiful, with stunning details at every glance. My room was perfect, spacious and with everything that I could have needed. Reception and concierge team were so helpful and efficient to me and my family.

I had the pleasure of getting to know many members of staff throughout my time at this beautiful hotel, which really is a hidden gem, far too many to mention them all and I am sorry if I miss any!

I found myself in the Terrace Bar a lot, considering it was a work trip and I got to enjoy it in all of it's glory - Vicky & Eleonora took wonderful care of me both during the day whilst I was peacefully working, but also in the evening when my wife joined me and we enjoyed the wonderful live music they have. The whole bar team were so attentive and after a couple of days they knew exactly how I liked my whiskey and had exciting new suggestions for me all the time.

I had the great pleasure of meeting both Mr Pou - Restaurant Manager and Mr Hindmarsh, their charming and talented Executive Chef during my time with them. It was so fantastic to meet the Chef after our dining experience and to hear his views on cooking and food as a whole, an experience you don't get in many restaurants. Mr Pou and his team took excellent care of my family one day whilst I was working and they all very much enjoyed the Chesterfields famous sweet shop inspired afternoon tea. My children can't stop talking about it and are asking when they can come back!

All in all, the Chesterfield is a hotel I will return to upon my next visit to London and that is not something I have been able to say about a London hotel in a long long time!",5,2020,02,25
105,Home Away From Home,"Whenever we are in London my wife and I stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair - not only does it have a great location, consistently friendly and efficient staff but it's also dog-friendly ( as with all the Red Carnation collection). This time was a special Birthday treat and we were generously upgraded to a Junior Suite - complete with 'Happy Birthday' amenities and welcome. 
A sign of a great hotel to us is not only consistency, but loyalty and the faces of the staff are familiar ones on every visit. No doubt the management team have created a happy working environment for their staff - and it shows. Consequently The Chesterfield really does feel like a 'home away from home' for guests - even our taxi-driver, when asking where we were staying, commented 'the staff are always so friendly at that hotel' .
We highly recommend a visit.",5,2020,02,25
105,Excellent service. Excellent location.,"I work in the travel industry so have a pretty high standard for hotels, but the Chesterfield Mayfair really blew me away. This was my first trip to London and the location could not have been more perfect--in a quaint and quiet neighborhood but within easy walking distance to tube stations and lots of major attractions and shopping. The hotel itself is inviting and cozy with lots of luxury finishes, and the staff should truly be commended for a great sense of hospitality. They all went out of their way to be accommodating and make us feel at home. We loved finding little treats in our room when we returned from a long day and when the restaurant learned it was our anniversary, they sent us a special dessert. The traditional tea service they serve daily is also a great experience and a great value compared with others in the area. Thank you to the entire team at the Chesterfield Mayfair for making our trip so memorable!",5,2020,02,24
105,Fab night with my daughter ‘lovely Old Mayfair’ hospitality,"I sent a perfect night last night at The Chesterfield in Mayfair.  A romantic warm inviting hotel where service and manners are exemplary.  After a long days shopping on Oxford street and a few champagnes, my daughter and I decided to go out for dinner and spend the night in Mayfair.  Room was lovely, warm, fab steaming hot bath, and a beautiful warm lively bar! A perfect stay! I recommend it ",5,2020,02,23
105,Great London Hotel with Great Location,"This is a very nice, clean hotel in a great location near restaurants, sites, museums, shopping.  The staff were very helpful.  Joe, was very helpful in terms of sharing information on places to go, the concierge was great and the lady who cleaned the room was very personable and helpful.  They have a nice bar/cafe and a nice restaurant for breakfast.  The food was great and everyone that worked here were extremely friendly and helpful!  I highly recommend this little hotel!",5,2020,02,22
105,Top ten ! ,"We’ve been in London several times in different hotels. This boutique hotel is one of the best we’ve been. It’s a beautiful old house with a lovely antique atmosphere,  the rooms have  luxury amenities ,very clean and comfortable, huge  breakfast, - to sum it up- you can’t ask for more .But most of all -  a very friendly and attentive staff, all through our stay they were always willing to help in every way they can, everyone from the concierge and reception which I’ve called later on to ask if they’ve found lost property that my daughter left. They were incredibly helpful and I thank Mr. Jack Elliott. It’s been an amazing vacation for us and we highly recommend this hotel ",5,2020,02,21
105,Better Than a Home away from Home,"I have stayed at the Chesterfield 3 times now and each time have been beyond impressed. This hotel provides elegant accommodation right in the heart of Mayfair at an unbelievably reasonable price. The rooms, the staff the breakfast are all top rate. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it is one of London's best.
I would like to thank all of you for a wonderful stay.",5,2020,02,20
105,Lovely Stay,"The description says “quintessentially English”...very true. The staff was charming, friendly and professional. The bed and linens are pure comfort. Room service breakfast was served hot and delicious, delivered with a smile. Live music and Classic cocktails were welcome after a blustery cold day sightseeing. The overall decor is traditional and welcoming. History of the building/buildings in the room binder was a bonus as well as the jogging/walking park map provided. The location of course is perfect for shoppers, walkers and fine diners alike. My Traveling companions enjoyed the hotel’s restaurant very much although I did not get the opportunity. I would definitely return for another stay.",5,2020,02,20
105,Just wonderful!,"I just love the Chesterfield. It is my London home.
Great hotel in a terrific location. Very professional, friendly and accommodating team. Lovely rooms, wonderful breakfasts and terrific service. Very English. Adam runs a tight ship and I appreciate it. No request is too much. Joszef and Frederica -- thank you!",5,2020,02,17
105,Loris made our day!,"What a delightful afternoon, most importantly, very memorable.
We were visiting just for the afternoon tea but felt like we left with much more. I can definitely recommend going to for tea to anybody. You'll have a lovely time and will be treated very well where nothing is too much trouble.
Well done Chestefield, you have a great team morale.",5,2020,02,17
105,Good location,"Great hotel in a convenient location. About 5 minutes walk from Green Park tube and in walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street etc. 

Our room was characterful and had thoughtful touches that I didn't expect from a 4 star hotel. It was an exceptionally quiet room.

Staff were excellent and very friendly - a credit to the hotel. 

The only reasons we are not giving 5/5 is the service at breakfast. It was a little chaotic - we didn't know we had to order toast as part of our hot option, our breakfast order was wrong and we asked for grapefruit juice (it was listed on the menu). The waitress told us it was 'over there' on the buffet - but it wasn't. Small things I know, but it's not exactly a cheap hotel so in some ways you anticipate perfection. 

We would stay again.",4,2020,02,16
105,Super!,"Probably the best hotel in the city, friendly and highly accustomating staff. Stayed here for a few nights and it was an exemplary of classic Britishness. Albeit only four stars, I would definitely recommend it over any of the five-stars I've stayed in London.",5,2020,02,15
105,Quintessential English hotel ideally placed...,"To access all the key business districts or tourist sites. The hotel team were highly professional, courteous and friendly. Too often in London this type of hotel impresses with front of house and falls short when it comes to the rooms - not The Chesterfield. Room was a double and on the small size but very well set up. Desk for working was a good size and had Uk, European and USB sockets (most other London hotels please take note). Overall the room was very tastefully decorated and furnished. Bathroom was also small but shower had great water pressure (most other London hotels please take note). Breakfast was good without reaching excellent - standard fare cooked well but lacking flair. Finally for a medium sized hotel there is a very good selection of meeting rooms / conference  facilities available. We used the Queens room which had a certain charm with all the technology we needed. An enjoyable 4 days.  ",4,2020,02,11
105,Excellent,"Very friendly staff (particularly Yoszef) and delicious breakfast. Great, centrailized location and clean, cosy rooms. Feels like home! We will stay at the Chesterfield again. Highly recommend to to everyone.",5,2020,02,11
105,Perfect stay,"We stayed for a few nights and we were delighted, of what was on offer. We stayed here as we came to London on business. We explored different things and also the palace was a few minutes away, but when we came back rooms were tidy and beds comfortable",5,2020,02,10
105,Perfect for a couples break,"Lovely hotel in a super location a few mins walk to a Green Park and Buckingham Palace. My husband and I spent two nights here for a weekend of sightseeing and a theatre trip. 

The rooms are themed and really quirky. Very well equipped and  cosy.

The staff are very friendly and helpful. There is a super breakfast menu. The terrace bar has a lovely vibe for drink before heading out for the evening.

We would not hesitate in going back. Ticks all the boxes for sure.",5,2020,02,09
105,Sweetshop afternoon tea hen party,"From enquiry to payment, the staff at the Chesterfield could not have been more helpful and more welcoming. Kornelia handled our booking to the last detail, Mauritzia and Jamie looked after us so well on the day and all the staff were so helpful and welcoming. We were there for my friend's hen party and had the sweetshop afternoon tea. 10 of us and not one thing out of place. Everyone said it was the best afternoon tea they had had and would definitely be returning. We were given welcoming drinks (very theatrical), a token for a voucher to return with a discount of some sort and some sweets from the huge sweet card, served to you by a man in candy stripe uniform! Very luxurious, the food was amazing and unlimited refills available for tea and food went down well with us all. Thanks so much for making it so special, complete with congratulations plate for the bride to be. Definitely be visiting again!",5,2020,02,09
105,Outstanding Service!!,"My sister and I had the true pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair just before Christmas.  We were welcomed and cared for daily by the wonderful Chiara.  She was amazing and set the tone for our entire stay.  We also loved Valentina and William in the bar, who made every visit a treat.  In the dining room, we were impressed by Roberta, Velemir, and the quiet helpfulness of Paula.  For personality and outright fun, no one could beat Joe, Grigory, and Nino out front.  What wonderful representatives they are for the Chesterfield.  All in all, our stay was absolute perfection.  We have stayed in many fine London hotels but none can hold a candle to the personal, warm, service-driven staff at the Chesterfield.  Oh, yes, and our room was great, too!",5,2020,02,04
105,"Very good,excellent value",We have stayed at the Chesterfield on two occasions with a couple of years between the visits. We were greeted and warmly welcomed by name by all the staff! We had a Junior Suite which had all the amenities we needed and we enjoyed both our visits and will definitely return,4,2020,02,03
105,Lovely hotel,"My wife and I stayed there on Saturday night for a birthday celebration. The hotel has a sort of quirky traditional ambience, with stripy wallpaper in the rooms, interesting old portraits on the walls and of course splashes of Red Carnation red here and there. We loved our stay, and thought all the staff there were superb. The bed was very comfy, and the room quiet and dark. Breakfast was stunning - one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had in a long while.",5,2020,02,03
105,Fantastic stay for my special birthday,"My husband booked the Chesterfield as a special surprise for my birthday. We had a lovely room the Berkeley Suite and it was a lovely suite, Gold and blue tastefully decorated and a lovely bathroom with nice toiletries and fluff towels. Everything that we would need. Staff were very friendly and helpful and a suprise birthday cake and card appeared in our room. Very thoughtful and delicious. Breakfast was very tasteful and we will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a lovely stay in London. We will visit again.",5,2020,02,02
105,Just perfect,"I stayed at The Chesterfield during a January weekend as a base to show my six year old son the sights. I could not have made a better choice. Every single member of staff that we met were wonderful; welcoming, kind and generous. The room was perfect and every single thing that we could have needed was already provided for and more.The hotel is in a blissfully peaceful area, but close to London's attractions. My son asked me whether I wished that we lived at the hotel, he gave it 10/10. Laura on reception in particular made my son's trip extremely special, thank you. I can't recommend The Chesterfield enough",5,2020,02,01
105,Back Again - Great Hotel,"We visited The Chesterfield about 3 years ago and came back once again.  This is an ""old world"" type of hotel, old-fashioned, beautifully furnished from the great oak bar to the brass elevators.  The rooms all vary in size and in style with some a bit more modern.  This visit we requested a front street view and happily were granted a nice room on the 4th floor with a king bed.  We had expected some noise from the traffic but it was actually very quiet.  We arrived quite late (9 pm) and were pretty exhausted so left our baggage in our rooms and went to the bar area where we were able to order food, drinks and watch a Liverpool game.  It was just the perfect ending to our day.  The rooms include amenities like bottled water (glass!) everyday and full tea service set up including a variety of tea and biscuits daily.  On one of the nights, we did have an issue with our heater but Maria, front desk clerk, worked hard to get it working.  A couple of other things that are worth noting and that's great water pressure in the bathrooms and plenty of super hot water.  There was even a US voltage outlet that didn't require a converter. The bar can get a bit busy but it's still a great place to relax and enjoy a drink.  The hotel is within 3-4 city blocks to the tube and close to restaurants and bars throughout the Mayfair area.  It is also close to Hyde Park and Green Park which are so worth a visit - absolutely breathtaking.  We also took the opportunity to attend mass at a nearby Catholic church (5 blocks away) and we were treated to the most beautiful church and a choir unlike ANY I have every heard (Jesuit parish of the Immaculate Conception).  I also want to sing the praises of all of the staff.  They were so accommodating and accessible.  All in all, the hotel is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone.  We had a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield and are looking forward to the next visit - hopefully even sooner than the previous 3 year wait.",5,2020,01,30
105,Superb experience,"Best hotel in London with good price and excellent service. It's not the Savoy or The Ritz but you get quite a good deal for what you pay, feeling that excellent british service. Will come back in my next visit",5,2020,01,27
105,Afternoon tea birthday celebration ,"Brilliant! An amazing few hours celebrating my mother’s 60th birthday - a vast array of teas and a very tasty, well balanced spread.

Service was brilliant, the ladies were very knowledgable about the teas and were pleasantly attentive without being overbearing.

Throughly recommenced.",5,2020,01,27
105,Jolly Good Stay!,"My sister & I spent 3 nights at the CM & it was lovely! The staff are very kind, helpful & welcoming. We loved our peaceful, well appointed room, and the tea & coffee box was a delightful surprise. The location can’t be beat: 7 minute walk to the Green Park tube station; 15 min walk to Buckingham Palace. High Tea was super fun, too! We highly recommend the CM! ",5,2020,01,26
105,A gem in Mayfair,"This was our first stay at this hotel and as we have stayed at other Red Carnation hotels ( The Milestone and the Montague on the gardens)  we knew that it would be quality. The location is great-on a quiet street in Mayfair, but easily walkable to many places of interest. One of our favourite Lebanese restaurants was only a couple of minutes walk away. Our car was valet-parked and we were checked in in no time. All of the staff we encountered were lovely. The bedroom was great-with underfloor heating in the bathroom. Breakfast is a mixture of buffet and a la carte-we particularly enjoyed the full English. There was live music in the bar during the evening. I am sure we will return!",5,2020,01,23
105,Enjoyed our stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the The Chesterfield Mayfair. We were blessed with unexpectedly beautiful January weather and the proximity of the hotel to restaurants, Times Square, and shopping was fantastic. Everyone from the check-in staff, to the housekeeping staff. Well recommended!",5,2020,01,23
105,Grateful ,"Afternoon tea? You are in the right place.
A mix of elegance and hospitality, the staff at the Chesterfield was amazing during my experience! The stand with pastries, scones and sandwiches accompanied by different delicious teas made my day and the service offered by Roberta and Marcella was really enjoyable. Also, in the end of the afternoon tea I received a complementary package of candies plus a voucher to spend on my next visit!!! The Original Sweet shop theme suits on all the people that looking for a sweet afternoon, the next time I will be back in London, this will be my choice:)",5,2020,01,22
105,A perfect west London base......,"We booked at a Michelin starred restaurant in the West end, and needed a hotel close by. The Chesterfield was new to us, but proved to be excellent. A warm welcome, friendly staff, pleasant room and good value (for London!) was complemented by a cosy bar to which we returned after our dinner, and an excellent breakfast the following morning. We will return.",5,2020,01,22
105,A gem of a hotel,"We’ve now switched from “corporate” hotels in Mayfair to The Chesterfield after a recommendation and we haven’t been disappointed.  The staff are lovely, the hotel has a welcoming feel, beautiful warm decor and the rooms are so comfortable. This is our 4th visit and will now be our regular London hotel 
Very handy location too, just off Berkeley Square.",5,2020,01,21
105,Disappointing,"This was a present for our daughter and her partner. The staff were very polite and helpful but at check they were asked to pay £250 again for the room, which they did on a debit card, even though the full amount had been paid at the time of booking last year. They queried this later after contacting me and it was embarrasing to have to talk about how much I had paid for their present. It was rectified by the next morning but the excuse was that check in had been handled by an inexperienced member of staff - really??? Also, a superior room had been booked with a King Bed but the room they were given had twin beds and no alternative offered when they queried this. The room itself was okish but resembled none of the rooms shown on the hotel website. As an apology, they were told they would be upgraded if they stayed again in future. Simply not good enough. The least they could have done was to offer a complimentary drink/meal or something for this stay. Left a bad taste in the mouth.",3,2020,01,20
105,Excellent stay in Mayfair,"Everything about our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was splendid. The hotel is located in the best neighborhood of Mayfair. The front desk, concierge and lobby staff were always helpful and friendly. They have a nice lobby bar that is open 24 hours! Our room was tastefully decorated, roomy and had everything we needed. The bathroom even had heated floors, so nice considering our stay was in chilly December. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a classy lux experience!",5,2020,01,20
105,Butlers restaurant afternoon tea ,"Really good service and lovely staff they were very welcoming. We had Manuela serve us and she was lovely and nothing was to much trouble. 
The food was great,  I would recommend for a lovely afternoon tea for couples and families. ",5,2020,01,17
105,"Perfect Service, wonderful accommodations","My sister and I stayed at The Chesterfield late 2019, I hadn't stayed for a few years.  I can't say enough positive things about our stay, from the greeting of the staff at Reception to the comfort of our beautiful room.  I'm planning my next stay at The Chesterfield right now.",5,2020,01,16
105,SATISFIED CUSTOMERS,"The success of any business model, is building from the bottom up, and the Chesterfield Mayfair, understands this principal.
You just get this comfortable feeling, that if anything is not just how you would like it, then the staff have the autonomy to resolve whatever little problem you may have, ensuring you have a great customer experience.
I can only repeat what endless reviews have already said, and cannot add any new, complimentary adjectives, which highlight the high level of customer service .
We only stayed for 2 days, but from check in to check out, we were treated with the utmost courtesy.
I still feel our room would benefit from a small L E D time clock, however, perhaps I should be fast asleep. enjoying the relaxing bed during the night, rather than looking around wondering what time of night it is.
We would have no hesitation in recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair to any of our friends and colleagues, and hope to return to experience the same warm and friendly service at a future date.
Thank you all for looking after us.

Rita and Alistair..",5,2020,01,16
105,Amazing suite,"Here on business and I was put in a suite, it was pretty sweet if you wil excuse the weak pun! Beautiful and unusual room, fabulous bathoom. Did not have the chance to sample any food and drink but everything looked cool, and the check-in chap was charm itself.
I'm coming back 28th Jan (cough cough) and I hope I have a similar experience then!",5,2020,01,14
105,Hotel Chesterfield Mayfair London,"If you like the illusion that you may run in the Earl of Chesterfield this Hotel shines with that Downton Abbey decorating vibe: traditional, elegant, and always impeccable.
Personally I'm getting a bit spooked in places with many dead people portraits especially during the night.
However its all about the English breakfast, even when taken at an early hour, is usually a fairly substantial one, and rightly so, for a good meal, if enjoyed and digested gives the support necessary for the day's work.

Forget about the dead Brits and enjoy porridge, eggs - either fried, scrambled, boiled or poached - bacon, sausages, cold meat, potted meats, bread, butter, jam, tea and coffee. 
Be more daredevil and indulge into kippers, kedgeree, devilled kidneys and lamb cutlets or fresh or stewed fruit!
Loved it.",4,2020,01,14
105,Ms,"What a beautiful hotel situated in the heart of mayfair. We stayed 9 nights and never wanted to leave. Being used to South African hotels we were a little disappointed in the size of the bathroom but realise this is typical of most London hotels. 
We loved the staff the bar and lounge area and breakfast was a treat. 
Service level excellent food excellent..
Red carnation group we will be bwck over and over again",5,2020,01,14
105,Afternoon Tea ,"My mother, sister and I visited for the Retro Sweet Afternoon Tea and it was simply delicious from start to finish. We’ve been to LOTs of them (including the dorch and ritz) and this place had THE BEST scones I’ve ever tasted.
Everything was so fresh and well presented.
It really was a great experience.
Thank you to Marcella and the candy man. Xx
And the special treats at the end.",5,2020,01,14
105,Return visit after 6 years and delighted!,"Our party of four spent one night at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.
What stood out ( and I have mentioned this regarding other hotels in the Red Carnation group), was the superb level of professional and yet friendly service from all of  the staff throughout the 24 hours stay.
Antionio, was particularly delightful and you could tell he loved his job.
Another important point to make was the first class standard of food and beverages being offered, from the Twynings teas and quality biscuits in the room ( with the swiftest room service for fresh milk and ice)to the best value and standard breakfast we had eaten in a long time.
The quality just stood out- thank you for not offering cheap fruit juices and jams or giving a frugal selection of meats and pastries. The breakfast was just amazing value and appreciated by us all.
Our rooms were immaculately kept by housekeeping with the most comfortable bed and bedding to lie on and even though we faced the Main Street, no noise was heard from the traffic or other rooms- to say we felt cosseted was an understatement.
This next point is not a criticism, just an observation, but some of the upstairs doors and woodwork did look a little ‘tired’- I appreciate keeping everything fresh is almost impossible, and hope you don’t mind me mentioning it.
It certainly did not detract from our wonderful stay in a great value and situated hotel.
Thankyou Red Carnation and all your amazing staff.
Hopefully we will return without n the next 6 years!",5,2020,01,12
105,A Gem in the heart of Mayfair,"This was my third visit to this hotel with my friend Gill. We first discovered the Chesterfield a number of years ago when we found it to be luxurious, relaxing, exceptionally clean with outstanding food and a service so personal, caring and professional that it is very hard to describe. As I have taken afternoon tea at the Ritz I can say with some authority that in my opinion the afternoon tea at the Chesterfield is far superior. This as been mine and my friends experience on every visit. All of the staff are a credit to the hotel providing attentive service where nothing is too much trouble. This is a pet friendly family hotel where you are made to feel part of that family the way we were  treated at any time of the day or night made us feel special and put a smile on our faces. 
Central to the whole of London this gem is not to be missed",5,2020,01,09
105,Memorable experience,"This is a somewhat belated review in fact some years, however, its something that I have never forgotten and felt compelled to put in writing our experience.  We travelled from Australia to London on Christmas Eve some years ago with our then 17 year old son.  We had pre booked a Christmas lunch in the same area and set off in the morning for St. Pauls and then to lunch.  The weather was cold, dark and raining.  We enjoyed St. Pauls and would have loved to have stayed for the service, but alas we didn't and now wish I had because I might not get to London at Christmas time again.  There was no public transport and the cabs were super expensive so we walked by the time we got to Charles Street, we were pretty sodden as well as jet lagged.  The kind doorman saw us and invited us in.  He said come in and enjoy some warmth and showed us into a lovely lounge.  Never batted an eyelid at our weary demeanor and sodden touristy clothes and took our jackets and hung them up to dry.  We were served coffee in front of the fire.  The waiters were all very friendly and talked to us about their experiences of Australia.  Not once did they give us the impression that we didn't fit in to their very up market environment.   We were welcomed like old friends.   We ordered a toasted sandwich (we couldn't afford very much being on a budget), but they were lovely just the same.  We were invited to stay for lunch and had we not already made and paid for our booking in the area we most definitely would have.  I've not forgotten the experience and hope that I'll return again for a longer stay.",5,2020,01,08
105,Afternoon Tea,"Went here with my daughter, daughter-in-law and granddaughter and we were treated to a lovely afternoon. Lovely sandwiches, tea and coffee in abundance. Tasty scones and lots of cakes. Anything you don’t like, no problem you can ask for more of what you do like. 
You can take home what you can’t eat and even get to choose a bag of sweets to take with you. 
Every single member of staff was so friendly and attentive. Made our visit so enjoyable. 
Well done!",5,2020,01,07
105,Fabulous afternoon tea,We loved the Winter Wonderland Afternoon Tea - a perfect Christmas treat. Fantastic service and fabulous food. The chocolate scones were great and the visit to the sweet cart at the end is the icing on the cake. Thank you!,5,2020,01,05
105,XMAS delight,"Wonderful hotel & excellent staff. Such a nice welcome & very helful.
The room was very, very small. But clean.
Breakfast  incl. was a huge disappointment, you have to pay extra for a full breakfast. The reason for only 4 stars.",4,2020,01,05
105,Great hotel. The best of service!,The hotel is pure London is so many ways. The service and hospitality of the staff is second to none in London. The restaurant and bar exceeded our expectations with gracious and always helpful staff. We travel a lot and you can't beat this charming hotel.,5,2020,01,03
105,"Amazing hotel, impeccable service",My friend had his wedding reception here on New Years Eve and we stayed in the hotel that night. We had a newborn with us. Staff made the wedding party and also my family feel incredibly welcome. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Amazing!,5,2020,01,02
105,New Year Delight,"We booked a room and special dinner for New Year's Eve-our first visit to this hotel. As many others have observed, the setting and service are brilliant and the dinner was beautifully prepared and served, as was breakfast the next morning.
The reason for only 4 stars rather than five, was that our room, described as a 'Superior King' was disappointingly small and gloomy. To the hotel's credit, however, as soon as we expressed our concern they sought to remedy the situation and we were satisfied with the outcome.",4,2020,01,02
105,Gala night dinner New Years Eve,A quaint hotel hidden in Mayfair a stones throw from Park Lane and provided a seven course dinner to a high standard throughout the staff were friendly and efficient. The meal consisted of goose and waga  beef which was really delicious. The evening rounded off at midnight with unlimited champagne. The people on our table where friendly and made the evening a success,5,2020,01,02
105,"The Chesterfield Mayfair,Your Home away from home!","Every hotel offers a clean room, good food and some cordial folks to attend to your needs- not at the Chesterfield, here my fourth visit over a 20 year period, offers each visitor A Memory!
An experience of feeling like Royalty!
Urgita I sincerely thank for being the Queen of the House, but it does not end there, from your greeting at the door by Rolando, to Maria who attends to you’re every wish, from the top under the direction of Adam Lake, all the way Down, to Marcia and Mellisa who serve your morning tea - this is a place that yo return time and time again!
In the land of Queens and Kings at the Chesterfield you Are Her Highness or King with no request too small or to grand that you will be disappointed!
I worked here in London many years ago, the grandeur is still very much alive!
Not so easy these days, forget your troubles and come join the World of The Red Carnation Hotels, you shall never regret it!

105,Return visit,We made a return visit to thia beautiful hotel. We were made to feel so welcome when we arrived . Our rooms were  very clean and we had everything we needed for a Christmas stay in London. The bar staff were great and we enjoyed time in the bar. Breakfast was delicious and ataff very attentive . As a special treat we returned for afternoon Winterwonderland tea again the staff were excellent and the sandwiches and cake selection was excellent. Thank you all we will hopefully return next Christmas,5,2019,12,28
105,Excellent Christmas stay,"Thank you to The Chesterfield for looking after our family this Christmas. My husband and I, two dogs, parents and my grandmother all had a very comfortable stay. The staff went out of their way to help; special thanks to all the doorman and porters who helped with the wheelchair and Roula and Eryk who served us on Christmas Day. 

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a stay at The Chesterfield for Christmas. The hotel is in a great location and incredibly dog friendly while still being luxurious. ",5,2019,12,27
105,The Charm of the Chesterfield,"We had the most delightful stay at the Chesterfield during the festive season. The hotel is beautiful in a very storied British way. If you are considering a suite, then I would encourage you to push the boat out and enjoy. The Phillipe Suite, for example, is so lovely; roomy; and comfortable.

The breakfast was the perfect way to start the day, from the cooked meals to the wide range of continental offerings. Quite a treat. 

The staff is absolutely second to none.  What a welcome sight they were after returning from a busy day or evening out in London. It was clear they had everything well in hand. They were completely guest-focused: helpful and friendly at every turn. I can’t put my finger on it exactly, but I have the sense that the team works seamlessly together. What I can say is that whatever they are doing creates a calm, relaxed, and pleasant atmosphere for guests. 

Our daughter celebrated a birthday there and they made sure to give the occasion a nod. The card mentioned our Chesterfield family, and we certainly it felt as such. 

Cheers to the Chesterfield.",5,2019,12,23
105,Cocktails Bar and club,You have to reserve before. until 22:00 its still quite to have a conversation after that you better find another place. we ordered much of the menu . The food was nice but nothing to Run and tell your friends. Cocktails on the other hand were great.,3,2019,12,22
105,Very comfortable and friendly hotel,"We spent our 40th anniversary weekend at this hotel, which proved to be a great choice.

The staff were all extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating. We had dinner in the restaurant, which was very nice with excellent food and wine. When the restaurant staff found out it was a celebratory weekend for us, they certainly helped to make it even more special. 

We would certainly recommend to friends and family.

Many thanks Chesterfield.",5,2019,12,17
105,Great Service...Nothing was ever to much for the Staff,"Great Rooms, Fantastic beds, Fresh Food and the best Service I have had in a long time. I will gladly recommend this Hotel to anyone. The breakfast was really good. The bar also has a great selection of drinks and good food.",5,2019,12,15
105,"Quaint, old world charm with amazing service!","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in October, and the service from the moment you step in the door until the time you leave was amazing.  We arrived to the hotel early morning after a long overnight flight.  Check-in was a breeze, and we were incredibly pleased to find a light breakfast with coffee waiting in our room as a welcome.  The room was beautiful, although a little tight on space as was the bathroom (or loo).  But, we truly didn't care as who is spending all their time in London in the hotel room?!  The restaurant had very good food (and again service).  We finished every night in the lounge with a pot of tea or cappuccino or something stronger.  I did not want to leave!!  I highly recommend this beautiful hotel.
    The hotel is tucked nicely away about 2 blocks from Hyde Park - easy walk to the subway.  I couldn't believe how quiet it was back there.  The staff will also assist you in getting a taxi at any time.
    Almost forgot - one evening we came back to the room to find a letter on the desk informing us that one of the hotel's neighbors intended to have live entertainment.  They hoped we would not be bothered by the music, and they had asked the venue to please request the music end on time at 11:00 pm.  WHO DOES THAT?!  
    Again, I highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2019,12,14
105,What a treat !,"I treat my daughter and myself to a stay at the Chesterfield every year just before Christmas and we are never disappointed.
The staff are always so helpful, friendly and professional. The service is very good and the facilities are very good.
We were fortunate to stay in the Executive Suite this year which was exceptional!",5,2019,12,11
105,They welcomed our honeymoon visit with love,"we really appreciate the staff for taking the time to set up this surprise for us! The signed card definitely touched our hearts. We felt very welcomed during our stay! The concierge was great help especially! Definitely worth the stay, but be wary of the lack of refrigerator, microwave and the expense of the laundry facilities! I wouldn’t call it a deal breaker, but it’s definitely worth the note",5,2019,12,09
105,Very nice hotel in a great location,"Recently stayed for 5 nights at the Chesterfield. Really enjoyed our time and wouldn't hesitate to return.  The staff at the restaurant were especially wonderful every morning. They were so helpful and there wasn't anything they wouldn't do for us. We were initially worried upon check in as there was a function going on that was extremely loud in the courtyard.  We called reception with our concerns and they indicated this was not a function put on by the hotel but rather by a neighbouring business, and that it would not be allowed to continue past 10PM.  This was the only small issue we had during our stay (and it indeed did not go on past 10PM) The location was great. In a nice quiet area and about a 8-10 minute walk to the tube station and about a 20 minute walk to the theatre district.  All in all a great stay and we wouldn't hesitate to return.",5,2019,12,08
105,Disappointing,"In a nutshell:
1. Booked junior suite - the room was barely 12-15 square meters. When asked if they have something bigger more matching a”suite” , the reply was “you should have asked in advance that you want a normal size junior suite”.
2. While checking-in was asked about newspapers: never got one in 4 days stay, in spite of daily complaints with concierge.

Otherwise expensive, excellent location, not the best from the group.",3,2019,12,08
105,A beautiful hotel with an old English charm to it,"I stayed here December 2019 with my husband. It was the beginning of a trip to Europe to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday. The chesterfield Mayfair did not disappoint in fact it superseded any expectations we did have.

From the moment we were met at the door we were made to feel welcome. After dropping by in July and asking to stay in a particular room the staff on reception remembered us and fulfilled our request. We were advised that our room was vacant and should be ready for before 2pm check in which was a lovely surprise after flying through the night.

The bar area is beautifully quaint and offers a great selection of food and drinks in a comfortable setting.

Breakfast at the Mayfair was another stunning affair. A great selection of continental breakfast followed by a selection of hot breakfasts. Our host was amazing and attentive but not over bearing.

All the while during our stay we were located centrally in London and able to walk or tube to all the relevant places necessary. 

As it was part of a celebration we received a box of chocolates and a balloon which was a lovely added touch.

As a frequent visitor to London I can safely say that I have found my hotel of choice. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff seem genuinely interested in making you feel welcome and happy.

",5,2019,12,04
105,A Perfect Place,The perfect place to start our first trip to London. Met our desire to be in a historic and central location to see important sites. Comfortable accommodations. All the staff were kind and professional and attentive to our request and questions.,5,2019,12,03
105,Excellent as always!,"This was our third November in a row staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We simply love this small, friendly hotel! From the moment we stepped in the door, being greeted with a warm smile from the doorman, to the time we checked out, the staff was wonderful. The breakfast is lovely with a very nice selection and excellent service. We also visited the bar and the staff there was also great (Victoria and Oisin). The hotel is in a great location, quiet yet just a few minutes walk to the Piccadilly and the Green Park tube station.  We will be back next November for sure! ",5,2019,12,03
105,Fantastic afternoon tea,"Last Friday my wide, daughter and I visited The Chesterfield for afternoon tea having been recommended by a friend. The service was fantastic and I cannot remember being so well looked after in a long time. Nothing was an issue and all our requests were catered for without any hesitation or question. The staff was so helpful and the setting has a character all to itself. It was a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Winter Wonderland. I cannot praise the staff enough and I hope to be able to visit again next time I am in London. ",5,2019,12,02
105,When a hotel saves a vacation.,"Since my review of this hotel two years ago, we've stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair two more times, most recently a few weeks ago.  The hotel is just as charming as ever, the rooms are just as good, and the bar and restaurant are just as wonderful.  What I want to comment on now, however, is the marvelous staff and how they went above and beyond the call of duty to save what could have been a disastrous experience.

We flew Business Class on American Airlines from Miami to London Heathrow, arriving on a Saturday morning.  There was heavy rain in Miami when we departed and in London on our arrival. Our suitcase, which was tagged ""Priority"" did not enter the carousel in the first wave of luggage, and there was a long gap until the 2nd wave arrived.  The suitcase had weighed in at 48 pounds and seemed very heavy, but I attributed that to my fatigue from the long flight.

When we arrived at the hotel and opened the suitcase, we were flabbergasted to discover that the interior of the suitcase and all of our clothes were soaked through.  That included sweaters, shoes, coats, jackets, and a blazer. We visualized the days ahead, which included plans for theater and dinners, to be a nightmare.  I contacted the desk manager, who informed me that the hotel's laundry did not operate on Saturdays.  However, she came up to the room with another staff member, and they observed the situation.  Not only was everything soaked, but a few items, such as shirts, were stained by dyes from other items.  It was a Saturday morning, and we were exhausted from a transAtlantic flight with dinner plans for the evening. Without any obligation on their part to do so, the hotel staff put everything back into the suitcase and took it with them.  Throughout the day, several staff members came back to the room with clothing items that they had dried and laundered if needed.  Items that needed to be dry cleaned did not come out as well, but they were dry. By the end of the day, all of our clothes and the suitcase had been returned to the room.  I requested the manager that the cost of these services be added to our bill, but she refused to do so.

While The Chesterfield Mayfair staff came through and saved the day, American Airlines, which was negligent in this matter, downplayed the issue and agreed only to reimburse us for the dry cleaning of 2 items that we had cleaned upon our return to Florida. That is the difference between a great hotel and its staff, and an airline that doesn't seem to care.",5,2019,12,01
105,Excellent stay and location,"Stayed here 5 nights for our first visit to London. The hotel is in a great location for two reasons: quiet side street and close to many attractions and shopping. Check in was quick and efficient. The attendant showed us to our room which we appreciated as we were able to ask questions about the hotel and the area. We had a king room and it was spacious for Europe. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we’ve ever had. Nothing wrong with room - good lighting, comfortable and nice shower pressure. The light system, in the hallway,to indicate ‘make room’ or ‘do not disturb’ is an excellent way to communicate with room attendants. We only took advantage of breakfast at the hotel on one morning and it was good as was the service. People working at this hotel are very attentive to your needs and you are always greeted with a smile in the lobby area. From the hotel, we were able to walk to Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Oxford street and Regent street, Piccadilly Circus and The National Gallery. We also took the Big Bus hop on and off tour which had a stop 10 minutes walk from the hotel. We would certainly stay here again.",5,2019,11,30
105,What an amazing Christmas display,"I have recently visited the Chesterfield Mayfair for an afternoon tea.
The hotel is beautiful and the Christmas decoration are sublime, they have the best ginger bread house that I have ever seen!
 I was lucky to be able to be shown around by a very friendly member of staff and felt very welcome by everyone. 
They were able to accommodate any of our needs, especially my daughter's dietary requirement.  It not usually easy to find a good dairy free afternoon tea, and this one met and exceeded our expectations. I will definitely come back again and bring other members of my family there. They really have a way to make everyone feel special!",5,2019,11,29
105,Amazing,"Enjoyed an amazing afternoon tea with friends, loved the food and the service was amazing, everyone was very friendly and smiling!     5 ⭐️ 
Would definitely come back, beautiful location in the centre of London.",5,2019,11,26
105,Welcoming Staff,"Visited over the weekend while we were walking through London. We just wanted somewhere nice to grab a coffee and had heard so many good things about the Chesterfield. Needless to say the hotel really justified these comments, all staff members were so welcoming and treated us with such a high level of service and care. A massive shout out to both the Management team (Fiachrá) and the employees on duty that day (Willian) for looking after us with the utmost care. Will definitely be returning the next time we are in London. Clodagh and Ruairí",5,2019,11,26
105,The best Afternoon Tea,I really enjoyed the tea experience ( was my first afternoon tea ever). The service was impeccable with our waitress being incredibly attentive and happy to explain everything to us. The food was delicious. I will be back definitely:),5,2019,11,26
105,Simply amazing!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is definitely my favourite place for an Afternoon Tea in London.
The food is superb, staff is very friendly, attentive and helpful! Big thanks for Edgar and his team for the excellent hospitality. If you looking for great experience I would definitely recommend this hotel !",5,2019,11,26
105,Winter wonderland afternoon tea,"Visiting London with my 2 year old daughter and had the most amazing experience for afternoon tea here! All the staff were so attentive and so friendly,  especially toward  my daughter which made the experience even more relaxing and enjoyable. Big shout out to Tamaiza, Eleonora, Giulia and Fiachra that made the experience so amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone especially during Christmas",5,2019,11,25
105,Afternoon Tea...Fantastic,"First time having afternoon tea...wouldn’t recommend the place more. The atmosphere, service and quality of food is top class! Fiachra a credit to the hotel! Manuela, Elenora and Tamara were brilliant. Will definitely be recommending and returning! ",5,2019,11,25
105,Consistently Excellent,"We stayed again at The Chesterfield this past weekend and as always received the most warm and friendly reception from the staff. Without exception, in all areas the staff are the most obliging, welcoming and professional. Having experienced a couple of other hotels in the group there is no question this organisation breeds the right culture amongst it's employees - they all exhibit genuine care and attention towards their customers.",5,2019,11,21
105,A hidden gem,"Directly you enter the hotel, the greetings are so warm and friendly that you feel at home straight away. The staff are really what makes this hotel stand out. It has an opulent feel but with a cosy vibe. Our trip from start to finish was faultless and we cannot wait to return next year. Thank you for making us feel so welcome.",5,2019,11,21
105,Superb afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea here is a must!! This is my second visit here and will be back again I’m sure. Lovely food and setting, and incredible professional service from Valentina and her colleagues. Very impressed, and would 100% recommend to others :)",5,2019,11,19
105,A great location and a hidden gem. ,The first time we have stayed here although we often stay at the top hotels in the West End.  This is a real hidden gem very close to Berkeley Square.  The bed was extremely comfortable in a very pleasant bedroom The breakfast was excellent and the Staff very efficient.  We didn’t eat dinner or lunch in the restaurant but hope to next time. ,5,2019,11,18
105,Very friendly and efficient. ,"Almost over decorated and adorned, but the plentiful, beautifully dressed and friendly staff confirm you are somewhere special. 
Yes our bedroom on our first night was almost perfectly finished but small and with our luggage for our 4 day stay, very limited drawers to put our clothes! But they moved everything to a more accommodative room very efficiently. 
The restaurant beautifully decorated but almost OTT, but friendly efficient staff immediately made you feel comfortable and welcomed. Food  very well cooked and presented, and as one of the websites suggested perhaps the best grilled Dover Sole available in London. We were very well liked after!
Thank you",5,2019,11,17
105,Sweet Shop High Tea,"This is becoming a regular treat for us, as the service is so friendly and the atmosphere welcoming and calm.

The tea itself is very tasty and the special thing about this tea was the theme - Sweet Shops.

We were greeted with a flying saucer suspended above a bowl of dry ice - a treat for the eyes and a stage setter.

There is a wide variety of splendid teas (drinkable type) on offer - but they had Fruit Salad Tea and a BlackJack Tea, they actually tasted like the sweets - amazing.

Sandwiches and tea were bottomless, but be warned there are lots of cakes to get through.

Sandwiches were well presented and very tasty: the chicken rolled in nuts is amazing.  This was followed by two scones with plentiful cream and jam, supported by the classic discussion regarding cream or jam on top.

The cakes were plentiful and in the main very tasty, however be warned some are very sweet - the fudge eclair and peanut butter cup.  We found the cakes a little too sweet so were unable to eat all of them.  We weren’t the only ones, most tables had left cakes.

As we finished we were given a token for a large gumball machine to win a prize and a very large bag of sweets taken from a selection of an old fashioned sweet trolley.

We would definitely go back but next time, take it easy on the sandwiches.",5,2019,11,17
105,Perfect birthday treat,"A delightful hotel, friendly staff and beautiful surroundings. I took the candy afternoon tea with my family. The sandwiches were scrumptious, scones were some of the best I’ve had and the patisseries were delectable. Our host was so lovely, he even brought out a nice birthday cupcake and gave me red a flower 🌹! I never got his name, he was the chap in the black suit. In addition Marcella was very accommodating and hospitable. 
Will most certainly return. It is especially lovely during the winter holidays with all the festive decor!",5,2019,11,17
105,Fantastic service and food. Strongly recommend a visit.,"Restored my faith in what a London establishment that prides itself on the quality of its food and service can achieve. 
A total contrast to another London visitor attraction that I visited earlier today and the subject of my last review. 

We arrived earlier than our booking time-not a problem. We wanted to tweak the sandwiches in the afternoon tea menu-not a problem.

Food all fresh. Scones light and delicious. Cakes exquisite and melt in your mouth. 

Service from every single member of staff first class and nothing too much trouble and all extremely courteous.

I was so impressed, I might even stay at the hotel with my good lady one weekend, the next time we visit London to catch a show.

If you want a great afternoon tea knowing you will have a wonderful time, treat yourself and have a visit.",5,2019,11,16
105,4 Wonderful Days at The Chesterfield,"We spent 4 days at the Chesterfield while in London for a family wedding. From the minute we arrived Joe helped us with our luggage and then proceeded to take care of us. He told us where to go for coffee, how to get to the Underground (short walk from hotel). He checked in with us every day and made you feel at home. He could not have been more helpful or pleasant. The front desk was great as well. The Chesterfield has a very cozy bar just off the lobby which serves great food and drinks. They are open 24hrs if you are a hotel guest. The location is great. You can walk to the Underground in 5 minutes, St. James Park is also 5 minute walk. Lots of little pubs and restaurants in the area. We would definitely recommend this hotel to people who want to be able to access all the attractions in London, but want a quiet area to retreat to for a good nights sleep.",5,2019,11,15
105,Exceptional hotel!,"My husband and I have been traveling to London for the past ten years. This is now our favorite hotel! Well located on a quiet street in Mayfair, close to the Green Park tube station, the hotel is exceptionally hospitable and charming. From the moment we walked in, our needs were not only met but exceeded on a daily basis throughout our week long stay. We look forward to our next stay!",5,2019,11,14
105,Excellent Stay. ,Very comfortable quiet and well located hotel. The staff were so friendly and welcoming nothing was too much trouble. Lovely food especially the home cut chips! It was also refreshingly not oppressive or stuffy as so many Mayfair hotels are. A great advertisement for the Red Carnation family. We will definitely return. ,5,2019,11,13
105,The best wedding reception ever!!,"We had our wedding reception for 40 guests, and stayed over the night! We  had the best time of our lives, impeccable service  and food was simply delicious! 
Sandra Costa and Kornila gave us all the support and attention we needed. Spartaco and his team were amazing! No faults on the service! Could not be any better! 
Our room was beautiful and extremely comfortable!  
Without any doubts, it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in our lives! We felt at home!
Thank you very much Chesterfield for making it so special! 
Sincerely, 
Douglas Correia",5,2019,11,13
105,Exceptional stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"My wife and I have had another exceptional stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, this time in the remarkable Stanhope suite. Complete luxury, with a dining room, sitting area, and desks with a Winston Churchill portrait. Simply stunning. 

We had dinner at Butlers Restaurant, served in the Library since the dining room had a private meeting. This made  the dinner even more special. The Terrace Bar is another destination I look forward too

The staff were fabulous as always. Friendly, helpful. We couldn't ask for more from a hotel.",5,2019,11,12
105,London Design Seminar,"Very happy with the accommodation and the staff at The Chesterfield Mayfair. Everyone was very friendly, perfect location, and would be happy to stay again and recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to a large, and sometimes quite impersonal larger hotel chain.",5,2019,11,12
105,Delightful Boutique Hotel in Chic and Lively Mayfair,"My husband and I just ended a fabulous six-night stay at this Mayfair gem -- a very British boutique hotel with heavenly beds, linens and pillows; marble bathroom with room enough for two; plush oversized bathrobes; windows facing the street but without street noise; lovely turndown treats at night; and an excellent breakfast buffet served in the handsome Butler's Restaurant.
That said, as other reviewers note, what makes the Chesterfield Mayfair such a standout is the extraordinary staff who are dedicated to giving guests topnotch service 24/7. Special mention goes to Chiara in Reception (who graciously resolved a minor glitch upon check-in); Manuela and Valentina in the dining room; the always-delightful Gyorge and Joe at the front door; and Laura on Checkout. We cannot say enough about the quality of every staff member we encountered during our stay and
can't wait to return to Room # 319 at our new favorite hotel in London!",5,2019,11,08
105,What an experience,"Probably the best hotel in London by some distance. We stayed just one night to celebrate my wife’s birthday and what an experience. From the moment we stepped through the front door until the time we checked out the service was beyond excellent. The attitude of the entire staff can not be faulted. Special mention to Laura on the front desk for her attention to detail, but so too to the entire front of house team. The room was exceptional, the bar a treat in itself, the breakfast really good and a wide choice. Really sorry to leave but will definitely be back as soon as possible. The Chesterfield is an absolute treat.",5,2019,11,08
105,"Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel, London","My wife, her sister and I stayed in this hotel for four days during our trip to London.  It is very conveniently located to attractions in central London (many in easy walking distance).  It may seem small at first glance, but it is very well appointed and maintained.  We felt that the staff is it’s most outstanding feature.  Without exception they are all capable, courteous, and eager to make your stay a pleasure.",5,2019,11,08
105,London treat,"Great location, you can walk anywhere easily. The staff were superb and the bedrooms very comfortable. Breakfast was also excellent and bar area very pleasant. I would not stop anywhere else in Mayfair or close by!",5,2019,11,06
105,"Traditional hotel, with service so warm they made us feel like family","Given its prime location near Berkeley Square in Mayfair, this hotel is a value. It's nicely decorated in traditional British style, well-maintained, and particularly well-appointed. In addition to British outlets, many rooms also feature European or North American outlets, making it easy to plug in a computer. Rooms with a bedside desk also have USB ports by the bed. The rooms are big enough to hold two chairs and lots of work space without feeling cramped The hotel offers multiple meeting rooms for everything from speed dating to weddings. The playing of pianist John Hudson lured us to the bar evening after evening; he is joined by a fine jazz combo on Wednesdays. 

The staff learned our names. Salvatore would welcome us when we returned in the afternoons, ask how our day had gone, and make us feel as if we were part of a family. Josef went out of his way to be helpful. When we discovered that the big local sports bars weren't showing baseball, Adrian helped us find the MLB playoffs on the bar TV. Tony tipped us off that if we wanted the Beef Wellington on Sundays -- and, yes, we would surely want the Beef Wellington -- get to the restaurant early, because it sells out. Loris memorialized our afternoon tea with the best picture of the whole vacation. Maurizia, Miruna, Manuela, and Roberta ensured that we got great service in the restaurant. There were many more wonderful employees than we can mention -- and they all made us feel like returning as soon as possible.",5,2019,11,05
105,Excellent hotel.,"I cant rate this hotel enough .lovely clean hotel, decor was nice, the people on reception were so nice and helpful,as were everyone. We only had breakfast there ,but that was really nice and the waitress was so helpful. At the end of our stay they went and waved a taxi down for us.
Haven't got anything bad to say about it.",5,2019,11,05
105,Lovely Hotel,We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back again.  Service was great and the staff went out of their way to help you. Many restaurant choices nearby and within easy walking distance.  Breakfast in the hotel is good but there are many other choices close to the hotel.,4,2019,11,05
105,First ever Afternoon Tea,"We went to afternoon tea for the first time and were met by the friendliest of staff who were able explain everything to us. The hotel itself had good aesthetic and the servers were friendly, helpful and easily accessible. The overall quality of the food (sandwiches, scones and see deserts) was excellent, a mixture of sweet and savoury that was both delicate and filling. The array of teas was lovely and interesting even for those who don't usually indulge in tea drinking. 
For those planning on visiting London who are looking for a place to have afternoon tea the chesterfield Mayfair is perfect, you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,11,04
105,Great location,"The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and not far to Kensington. The staff could not have been nicer at the hotel. The bar area was very nice, with live music at night. My only complaint was how small the room was. I am used to European sized rooms but this one was small even for European standards. It was difficult to walk around the bed as the bed took up the room. ",4,2019,11,04
105,Great Hotel,"We stayed last month in the hotel for 4 nights and had the best time. the staff was very kind and helpful, the room was specious and the location was perfect. We recommend the hotel with no reservations! Rachel and Ruby",5,2019,11,04
105,Excellent yet again,"This is the third time my husband and I have stayed at The Chesterfield, and yet again it did not disappoint. We love the location, the comfy beds and the lovely staff. We were fortunate enough to get upgraded to one of the suites, the lovely garden room. The suite was gorgeous and loved the spa bath. Thanks for a great stay yet again Chesterfield!",5,2019,11,04
105,We Adored This Place - It is Everything You'd Want and More..,"I selected The Chesterfield Mayfair for a 4-day stay in London and in short, we were thrilled with the selection.  This hotel is not large place, however it is beautifully appointed and charming, and everyone working there is amazingly friendly, professional  It was always service with a smile every time.  

We'd taken a night flight from New Jersey to London that would arrive at about 7:00 a.m. UK time, so we booked for the night we left as well.  It was a great decision that allowed us to get a bit of sleep before starting our day.

When we arrived at Check-In, the woman at the front desk was pleasant and welcoming and in no time we were checked-in and escorted to the elevators.  In fact the woman at the front desk offered to walk us straight to our room.  That was more than I'd ever experienced at a check-in.

The hotel room is beautiful.  Though it's not big by U.S. standards it is in line with other hotels in the area.  That said, the appointments in the room, the comfort of the bed and the cleanliness was outstanding.

We loved the bar area where we enjoyed cocktails with a bartender that was always on duty and made wonderful drinks.  We also enjoyed tea in there a few times as well as a great cappuccino.  We also dined in the restaurant for breakfast which was really great as well.

We will be back at the Chesterfield Mayfair because checks the box for everything we want in a top-notch hotel.",5,2019,11,02
105,"After staying here nearly every year for the past nine years, I still rate it as my #1 hotel in London","Nine years ago, I wrote this review titled: ""Faultless, glamorous, luxury hotel ... you won't be disappointed.""

And after nine years, it continues to impress, with my most recent stay in July this year for twelve nights. Here's what I said in 2010:

""I was recommended to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair by some English friends who had stayed there, and had their wedding reception there. I found it to be exactly as they said: a five-star luxury hotel, without the impersonal feeling of the large chains, but with all of the glamour. The staff are thoughtful and discreet. The rooms are large (something that is very unusual in London) with excellent inclusions and lovely English furniture (there was even a full stationery kit with stapler, scissors, etc., in one of the drawers ... I've never seen that before). The marble bathroom had fantastic lighting and lots of mirrors (including an illuminated close-up mirror) and there was no flushing noises from any other room at any time, including all night. I had a wonderful room-service meal there one night ... three courses at amazing value (there was enough cheese on the cheese platter for three people). Breakfast in the restaurant was quiet, with a full range to choose from, plus all hot dishes were made to order and weren't sitting dryly in a bain-marie as one now expects. And the location is central to everything one would want to see in London. Hyde Park and the Brompton Road (Harrods) a few minutes in one direction by foot, and Piccadilly (Fortnum & Mason, theatres, Leicester Square, Buckingham Palace, etc.) a few minutes in the other direction. Plus, it's a quiet location in one of the best streets in London. I'll be going back, and am looking forward to it.""

And I'm looking forward already to my next stay!",5,2019,10,30
105,"Lovely hotel, good rooms and service","We and another couple stayed for seven nights.  Our rooms had plenty of closets, shelves and drawers to unpack and put away our suitcases.  Bathroom was small, but had enough counter space.  We enjoyed the bar - very English decor, good drinks and service although the drinks were pretty pricey.  Easy walk to the Tube.  Breakfast was included in the price, and there were plenty of choices, both from the buffet and menu.  Service for breakfast was leisurely, great cappuccino, but difficult to get a runny egg.  Not much to complain about, wouldn’t you say?",5,2019,10,29
105,"My stay at Chesterfield Hotel, London","During my latest visit to London I stayed in this hotel for 7 nights had a very good experience 😃

I arrived at the hotel early in the morning and checked in and had to wait for almost 3 hours to get my room, the check in staff were helpful and professional.

The room I stayed in was clean, quite specious and well maintained. The toilet was neat and clean. The bed was quite comfortable and nice.

The hotel staff were kind enough to offer me a complimentary breakfast which was really good and delicious. On certain days I had the breakfast ordered in my room which was always delivered on time and deliciously hot and of course for FREE!

Chesterfield hotel is located in a good location that has vast variety of different cafes and resturants. It’s just a short walking distance from the fascinating Piccadilly Circus 🤩

Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel 😃",4,2019,10,29
105,A little Gem,"We stayed here for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. Situated a stones throw from Green park in Mayfair, the Chesterfield offers relaxed quality accommodation and food at a NON Mayfair price. The staff are relaxed, professional and very friendly. You feel you are staying in a small club. Quibbles?....none. They could teach the Shard about how to mix a Mojhito!.We will be returning",5,2019,10,28
105,Mrs Lindner ,"I've visited the Butlers Restaurant for Afternoon tea .
I've had a great experienced, enjoying my mix cakes sandwiches are amazing and the welcome pink lemonade with dry ice very catching eyes for the children my boy loves it so much..I was really amazed with the service and attitude of the staff, Manager of the Restaurant very polite comes to my table and greeted everyone.
Reception are friendly concierge always there to assist you for our coats..
The Toilet are very clean housekeeping has a very good team and friendly.
It's a 5 ☆ Experienced  service at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2019,10,26
105,Gin class evening ,We recently attended a gin evening and enjoyed both the atmosphere of the bar and the event. Our attendant Victoria provided information with enthusiasm and humour. Excellent service and compliments to her. It’s a beautiful hotel and a special space to enjoy an event or social occasion. ,5,2019,10,25
105,First class as always,"Our second visit to this wonderful hotel in Mayfair. It will be our London home forever. Why? The location-Mayfair is lovely, full of fine restaurants, shopping and pubs. Just around the corner and down the street (towards Piccadilly) you will find a little warren of such fine establishments. Plus you can walk almost everywhere from The Chesterfield. The Hotel. Service galore-staff everywhere-opening doors, handing luggage, arranging shows, tours even providing us with a complimentary drink in their classy bar. The restaurant-breakfast there every morning in luxury. Want to live well at a reasonable price (for London at least). Book the Chesterfield. Enjoy.",5,2019,10,22
105,Service was fantastic,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night and we also had the afternoon tea. From the moment of check in until check out, the service was fantastic! Everything was explained perfectly. Our room was a King Room and I just loved the material walls...super clean with a sanitised remote...attention to detail! 
The afternoon tea was fantastic and we had refillable sandwiches and cakes. The pink lemonade and little sweet truck were an added benefit. 

My only issue was breakfast...on e again great service but most of it was cold and there was no toast. For £25 I would expect  hot food.

Overall though fantastic stay!",4,2019,10,21
105,Great afternoon tea for birthday celebration,"My friends and I visited the Chesterfield Mayfair for afternoon tea and had a great experience! The staff is very welcoming and did their best to make our birthday celebration special. We really enjoyed the welcome drink and appreciated being able to try a variety of tees. The peanut butter cupcake, sandwiches and chocolate scones were my favourite. The atmosphere is cozy and the glass ceiling makes all the difference. The candy man (name starting with V, sorry can’t remember) and Denise were excellent. I would highly recommend it to friends and family. Keep up this great work !",5,2019,10,21
105,Outstanding afternoon tea,"It was our first time having Afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair and it was an amazing experience from start to finish. 

We were served by the lovely Denise and Loris and everyone else was very attentive and welcoming. 
All the food from the food stand was spectacular but we especially loved the chicken and mustard sandwiches, the chocolate scones, the cheesecake and, of course, the peanut butter cup😋. We liked these so much that they refilled our stand and also brought new tea pots to try other infusions. The welcome drink was very special and innovative!

Lastly, the ambience was quite magical for London as the room has a glass roof so there is plenty of natural light and we appreciated the live music played by the guitarist on the background.

Outstanding service!!",5,2019,10,21
105,Anniversary Weekend ,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for our anniversary weekend at the end of September. What an absolutely wonderful hotel! Fantastic location in Mayfair, amazingly friendly and accommodating staff, awesome breakfast and a charming room with an exceedingly comfy bed and a fabulous shower. We were so pleased, truly couldn’t have picked a better hotel for our first time in London. They surprised us with a delicious cake, bottle of champagne and basket of fruit on our anniversary. So thoughtful, wonderful and delicious! Thank you so much for making our trip so memorable. The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of the best hotels we’ve experienced and is definitely on our list of favorites. Looking forward to coming back to London for a future visit and once again enjoying all the comforts of the Chesterfield! ",5,2019,10,20
105,Great Stay,"We were referred by our travel agent and really glad we stayed here. Quaint, convenient, friendly, professional boutique setting. This place has the old world charm that we like to think represents historic London (Kensington actually, but you can easily get there.) Quiet neighborhood within walking distance of the energetic modern day sights that you will want to see.",5,2019,10,20
105,Afternoon Tea,"Darlene was amazing! I’ve traveled a lot and she is one of the top waitstaff I’ve experienced. Not only is she professional and knowledgeable, but she is genuine. She actually engages and cares about her interactions which make the hospitality experience heightened. Thank you.",5,2019,10,18
105,Old World Elegance,"We spent four lovely days at this hotel.  This establishment exudes English taste.  If you desire to stay in a hotel where service is centerpiece of their mission statement this is the place.  If you can't afford to spend a night here do yourself a favor and at least have either afternoon tea or dinner in their restaurant.  The afternoon tea was exquisite right down to the candy shop offerings at the end of tea.  Dinner was a culinary delight not just gastronomically but with regards to the staff as well.  This was a dining experience not to be missed and sadly, not to be found in many restaurants in this day and age.  The attention to detail, the level of service and the ability of the staff to do this so seamlessly made our night so very special.  Loris was our main waiter.  He deserves every accolade available.  Thanks to the entire staff at this hotel for making the end of our trip to England so memorable.",5,2019,10,18
105,Lovely Hotel in a great Spot,"A short walk from the Green Park underground station, this boutique hotel was quite nice. The room was very comfortable, quiet and had a good sized bathroom with soaking tub as well. We had a great 3 nights with impeccable British service with a smile. 

The bar on the ground floor made some great drinks and was a great place to unwind after a day of shopping and sightseeing. ",5,2019,10,15
105,Service service service,"The staff goes out of their way at this hotel. We were warmly greeted and although our room was not ready we were very happy with our decision to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair! They sent us to the hotel bar with complimentary drinks to quest our thirst as we waited. It was smart on their behalf as we decided to partake the hotel’s famous Tea service. Wow! We were blown away with the Tea and what amazing sandwiches. The best chicken salad ever Tea sandwiches. The male server was so professional and helped immensely.
That level  of service was maintained throughout our stay.
We were upgraded to the Dormer Suite as we got the Signature travel through What a hotel .com and the room was more like a flat! Elegant and comfortable, we felt quite at home.
I had injured myself a few days previously in Bath and needed to ice my foot; the hotel was amazing providing bags of ice through the three  days of our stay.
Our only snag is the quality of breakfast. The food was hit or miss but only at breakfast and our waitress was so amazing and attentive that we hate to complain.
On the whole I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel. It does cater to tourist groups but other than breakfast we never felt their presence and the hotel staff and accommodation was so superb I would say it is worth staying here!",4,2019,10,13
105,Good British experience.,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair and had a pleasant experience with the exception of the “tiny” room that we had.  We couldn’t move around the room without bumping into something.  (We’ve had small rooms in Paris, but this was really small).  And if left the bathroom door ajar during a shower:  It triggered the smoke detector.

However the staff was exceptional in all regards, except for the restaurant manager, whom was “very stiff”, during dinner(not warm or inviting.)

We return to The Goring on my next visit to London.",4,2019,10,13
105,Great location and atmosphere,"Traditional Mayfair hotel with perfect location between Royal parks, shopping and fine dining for a great weekend treat. Rooms incredibly comfortable and very quiet. Hospitality warm and service good. Breakfast has wide variety with taste and care. ",4,2019,10,13
105,50th Birthday Weekend ... fabulous!,"Hubby wanted Black Tie private dining in London for his 50th birthday dinner party ... we found The Chesterfield Mayfair.  What a find .... everything we wanted, private dining in the Library .. wood panelled walls, silver candelabra, one large oval table, nice crystal ....  From our initial inquiry in February to the party last week it was an absolute pleasure to deal with Events Manager Kornelia and the team.  Every question asked was answered, usually the same day, you cannot ask more than that.  The events menu was extensive and easy to chose a varied selection for our guests, special dietary requirements were also catered for easily.  A private free wine tasting was also offered ... and taken up!

The weekend came and we arrived at the hotel on the Saturday morning and were immediately greeted by smiling faces.  Our luggage was taken from our car and the car taken off by the concierge for parking.  The reception team were very welcoming and greeted by hubby with a 'Happy Birthday'.  One total surprise was that they had upgraded our room to a Suite, the Dormer Suite to be exact .. absolutely fabulous!  We were shown to the suite by Joe and when we entered the room we were greeted by balloons, champagne and a card signed by the staff .... how wonderful, hubby was especially touched.  When we settled into the room, we went down to the bar for a welcome drink, only to be greeted again with 'Happy Birthday' by several members of staff.

The evening and our guests arrived and everything went brilliantly. We were looked after by Spartaco and Valerij, nobody had to ask for anything!  The food was divine, there were 17 of us and everything arrived together.  Wine and water glasses were continually topped up much to everyone's delight!  A fabulous evening was had by all and the birthday boy was extremely happy.

We stayed until Monday morning and wished we'd booked in for longer.  The whole weekend was brilliant, the hotel is stunning in a lovely quiet part of London and the staff are amazing, we felt incredibly special and didn't want for anything. 

Would we stay again .... absolutely, try and stop us !!!",5,2019,10,11
105,I wish Room 314 was better-it could have been a 5 * experience,"My husband and I stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 nights in October.  The hotel is in a great location. The staff were very nice, especially at breakfast, which was a huge offering of food.  The room was small but efficient.  My only problem, which lasted through my entire stay was the lighting in the room. I told the front desk on my 2nd day that the light in my vanity mirror and the lamp next to my side of the bed were not working.   When I returned to my room in the evening, they were still not working. The next morning I reminded the front desk that neither lamp was working, and when I returned a few hours later the bed lamp was working but the vanity light was not.  It wouldn't have been such a problem, but the hotel installed antique 'frosty' mirrors in the bathrooms (I guess to make it moody) so it's difficult to shave without the vanity mirror.",4,2019,10,10
105,Super! Ottimo,"Excellent experience. The hotel is really nice and comfortable.
I have to express my special thanks to the manager who managed to solve a reservation issue that occurred to me for my fault. Her humanity and empathy are absolutely to be underlined.
During my staying of 2 days, all the members of staff have been professional, kind and excellent.
Breakfast was extraordinarily good as well. Omelettes are definitely great and tasty.
Ottimo veramente. Consigliato assolutamente.",5,2019,10,09
105,Lovely XMAS Holiday,I have been to The Chesterfield twice in early December and absolutely loved this boutique hotel in  the heart of Mayfair.  Room and bed were very comfortable; staff extremely helpful; location is perfect. London is just wonderful at this time of year and The Chesterfield is beautifully decorated for the holidays.  Cannot wait to return.,5,2019,10,09
105,Wonderful hotel,"Great location, within easy walking distance of many of London's sights.  The wonderful and attentive staff made sure we were always comfortable.  The food was well prepared and served promptly.  The Bar was a great spot to relax in after a day of walking around London.",5,2019,10,07
105,Excellent Stay - Twice!,"We stayed 3 nights at the Chesterfield before our cruise and 2 days after.  Lovely boutique hotel with old world charm.  Quiet neighborhood.  Centrally located within walking distance to restaurants, shopping, parks, Tube, and places to visit. Staff  was very friendly, helpful, professional, and attentive. Stayed in a standard King room, which was somewhat small, but typical of older European hotels.  Views from the room windows weren't the best, but not a big deal.  Bedding was beautiful and the bed comfortable.  Bathroom was spacious, updated, and well appointed including the heated floor, a nice touch.  We dined in Butler's restaurant, and had wonderful meals and service for breakfast and dinner.  Enjoyed cocktails and music in the intimate bar, off the lobby.  Very pleased with our stay and would recommend to family and friends.",5,2019,10,07
105,Afternoon Tea,"I arrived in London a few days ago and spent many hours in restaurants, hotels, museums, etc. I’ve have never been more warmly received and accommodated anywhere than at the Chesterfield. Your London staff is by far, the most polite, most interested in who they are tending to, and most helpful. 
We had reservations for 4 o’clock tea and arrived over an hour early. The doorman immediately made us feel welcome and sat us comfortably in the lobby. He then introduced us to Roberta. Roberta quickly took us under her wing and began working on rearranging our reservation to 3 o’clock. She escorted us to the bar, gave us a comfortable place to sit and offered us a menu. She assured us she would be back soon with an update on a table. 
Happy to rest from walking about town, we ordered drinks and relaxed. About 30 minutes later, Roberta came back to announce our table for tea was ready and said she would deliver our drinks. After being seated at the nicest table in the atrium, she delivered our drinks and asked if this was a special occasion. We informed her we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. She congratulated us and said she would be by later to check on us. 
We went on to have the most delicious and amazing dining experience! The wait staff was very attentive and kind. Roberta came back to check on us again. Later I saw her in the hallway and she asked if I enjoyed it. She never forgot about us and we never felt like we were handed off not to be thought of again.
She kept a vested interest in us through our entire experience today at the Chesterfield including after tea, we retired back to the bar, she came in to speak to us again.
We have all experienced good service even great service all over the world. But the service we received by Roberta today was like being with a friend at their home. It was the first time since I’ve been in London this week I have felt welcome and like I belonged. People typically in service positions just don’t treat customers like that today, we are normally pushed off, looked over or rushed through our experiences.
Thank you Roberta and the Chesterfield. We will be back and next time to stay!",5,2019,10,06
105,Really hoped and expected more,"The Chesterfield is what it is, a Once, now Tired Grand Lady.  Room 314 overlooks a rooftop HVAC pod and even though the room is intended to be sound proof, all those compressors cycling made sleep difficult.  Beds were not 'Mayfair' quality, actually hard.  Staff is excellent as is the location around the corner from Shepherds Market.  $50 uber to Heathrow btw.",3,2019,10,06
105,Best wedding I have been to.....,"We had our civil wedding at the Chesterfield, organised through Kornelia who manages the events team. It was fabulous! The whole day was brilliantly organised (Kornelia came in on a day off to ensure it was perfect), the Library is perfect for a small intimate ceremony and reception, food in the Conservatory for 30 was excellent, table service was 5* - unobtrusive and detail-perfect - and the hotel provided some delightful touches - a room upgrade, a wedding cake and champagne in there to greet us, every detail was taken care of.
For a central London luxury venue, it was excellent value, it's the sort of place where we could slump on the leather sofas in the bar, take your shoes off and relax.
We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, be it for a meeting, lunch, London overnight stay or the event that changes your life. Ideal, perfect.",5,2019,10,05
105,Great hotel in Mayfair,"Great hotel in Mayfair
Wow, what an amazing hotel! Its great location at Mayfair is just the start of the stay. Very luxurious hall and room. Excellent breakfast, restaurant and bar. Really attentive service! I certainly recommend it and would definitely stay again there!",5,2019,10,04
105,Mid Week Break,"We booked the Chesterfield through Booking.com at a reasonable price especially for the area we wanted, upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly welcome by the consierge and the check in desk. Our room wasn't quite ready so we sat in the lounge for 5minutes, we did not have time for a drink but they looked very appealing. The room itself was quite small but was fine for just the two of us, I had emailed prior asking for a upgrade if available as it was our anniversary/husbands birthday. We did not get a upgrade however we were left a cake and a card which I thought was very thoughtful. The location of the hotel was perfect and easy walking distance to green park tube station and a short ride from kings cross in a taxi. The hotel was very clean and the bed is the comfiest bed I have ever slept in. All in all we will return.",4,2019,10,03
105,Top notch through and through,"Wonderful hotel with an outstanding staff. Everthing from the room, front desk, breakfast and staff was excellent. Everyone on staff went out of their way to provide the most professional service. Appointments in the room were very nice, right down to the heated floor in the bathroom. Would highly reccomend,",5,2019,09,29
105,Never a disappointing experience..,"I discovered the Chesterfield around 13 yrs ago and have stayed here quite a few times during my visits to London. I was there late August-early September for 5 nights. I booked a Superior room but during check-in they upgraded me to a Jnr suite. I walked in to a charming room called the ""Garden Room"" on the Fifth floor. I absolutely loved every minute of my stay. The staff are so courteous and professional. The Breakfast is wonderful (both served in the room and at the restaurant). I always love staying in Mayfair, elegant and so convenient. I'm looking forward to my next visit. I recommend it to all my friends and family as a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the always stimulating metropolis of London. 
P.S. You can never go wrong with a Red Carnation Hotel..",5,2019,09,28
105,Whiskey tasting ,"Oisin gave us the whisky tasting with chocolate.   He was a fantastic host and very informative. 
We had  a great afternoon...followed by food which was great.
My hubby had a great birthday x
Food was great we really enjoyed.",5,2019,09,28
105,"toilette not flushing properly, good for nothing concierges, not great location","We looked forward to our stay in this expensive hotel in our first visit to London. However our stay was not a fun experience and it tainted our whole London visit. For the location: The hotel is not as central as we would have liked and we always ended up going through some rather dark alleys on our way back to the hotel at night. Consequently we were fearful of staying out past like 8:30 pm at night. For the room, it took quite some effort just to push the button to flush the toilette since there wasn't space to use the whole hand but only like 2 fingers; and then after pushing this button, it didn't flush well, so we needed to flush several consecutive times and even then some toilette papers were always left floating there. I told the reception who said they will inform maintenance but nothing changed. Sigh. Finally, the concierges were worse than useless because they gave misleading and partial information while making the impression that they knew what they were talking about. The first concierge advised me about cafes that will be opened early morning before our tour starts, and then I went there and they were in fact only going to be opened much later. In addition he referred me to other restaurants for after the the tour, but those restaurants were in a totally different place to where I asked. The second concierge I asked about the price for a metro from the hotel to somewhere and he said 'less than 5 pounds', as if this is great, and didn't bother to tell me about the Oyster card which could have saved us a lot. in addition to being the opposite of helpful, both concierges were condescending and also not present past like 7:30 pm which made it almost impossible to get hold of them in the first place, which in retrospect was a good thing.",1,2019,09,25
105,Best part of our London Trip,"We visited London for the first time last week. Without question the hotel and it's start were the highlight. The concierge team lined up a football game for us at Tottenham. The Restaurant staff from Tony the maitre'd, to Andreas and Jess all were superb. The were engaging, witty and pleasant. The food at Butlers was exceptional. If you go to London try the Dover Sole here. A few nights later we eat here again and enjoyed the Lamb Canon. Loris the maitre'd was also a pleasure.
In our rooms the beds are comfortable and a complete plus was the heated bathroom floor,...a sheet delight.
Stay here....you won't be disappointed!",5,2019,09,22
105,A Hidden Beauty,"A lovely relatively small hotel, away from traffic yet close to Piccadilly, Berkeley Square and Green Park Tube, that is an absolute gem.  I travel to Europe a good deal, staying in many London hotels, this is now my number 1.
Front desk staff, doormen, bar and restaurant staff could not have been better.  Congratulations to management and ownership.  I have seen this hotel in the past and it is at its finest with its new ownership! A pleasure to get up every morning knowing what will greet me in the dining room and as I start my day.",5,2019,09,21
105,Great location very clean,"Cleanliness is always top priority for a hotel stay and couldn’t fault this hotel for that. It is an ideal location for walking to all areas of central London we easily walked to Covent Garden, River Thames and Oxford Street. Staff were all very good and all friendly and helpful. Very nice breakfast lots to choose from and nice to see they still bring toast to the table rather than the slow toasters others use. We didn’t use the main restaurant but it looked ok. The room we had was a typical London size just enough room but nothing to spare, it had everything you needed, (lots of mirrors mind you we had six, 6 only  missing one on the ceiling). ",5,2019,09,19
105,Afternoon Tea,"Three generations girl trip and it was Our last day in London. We wanted to experience an actual English tea (we are from the US). We were so glad we chose the Chesterfield. Loris and Rafcar were our servers and could not have been any more attentive. My daughter and I wanted to make sure my mom enjoyed herself. Mom said I feel like the Queen here!. The presentation was absolutely beautiful and the food tasted as good as it looked. I am not much of a tea drinker, but I enjoyed their choices of tea. We really enjoyed ourselves and definitely will return if we get the chance to return to London.The candy cart was an sweet surprise too.",5,2019,09,18
105,Back to the Chesterfield Mayfair,"13 years ago, I proposed to my wife at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The service was excellent and the rooms were small but fair.  Now, things have changed.  The hotel has upgraded the rooms we are staying in.  They are still on the small size, but the furniture is better laid out and better designed for a stay.  

Gone is the mini-fridge.  Never had anything from them in any hotel I’ve been in, but being a diabetic, its useful for holding my medications.  To compensate for this, I carry my meds in an insulated bag with an ice bag.  Imagine my surprise when I asked for ice for my meds at the bar when they told me, I can just call room service and ask for an ice pack for free!  That really sums up the Chesterfield Mayfair.  They may not have everything a 5 star hotel has, but they do have friendly and accommodating service people which seems to make up for any real deficiencies.  

Hotel has a decent restaurant and the few plates which were not to our liking, the staff bent over backwards to correct the issue.  When they found out, my wife and I were celebrating our engagement there and that my wife just got an acceptance letter for her first novel that night, the staff gave use several complementary desserts.

Food for the most part is excellent.  Tea is a bit expensive but the is well done in a beautiful setting.  The hotel reeks of old world charm having been created out of several old Georgian townhouses.  Location is good too with major tourist spots not more than a mile away.  This is good, as traffic in London has gotten worse in 13 years.  Access to the subway is not far for those needing to go farther or if you a traveling in a group, black cabs can easily be summoned via the doorman.

",5,2019,09,18
105,Lovely traditional hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights last week. We were greeted so nicely by the Reception staff and found the staff were consistently polite, friendly and professional. 
We were upgraded to a suite which was such a nice surprise, and really made our stay very special. 
The suite (Dormer) was very spacious, pretty and comfortable- nicer than the website photos suggests
 !
Breakfast was comprehensive and mostly cooked to order, service and quality were excellent. 
The hotel is central and can easily walk to many attractions and a short walk to nearest tube station. 
Overall the hotel has original , more period decor and provides quality personal service. 
We would definitely return.",5,2019,09,18
105,Perfect,"The only criticism I have is that we didn’t stay long enough at this hotel.  We stayed just one night in a standard room checking in very early (11.30am). This meant our room wasn’t ready. That was ok with us, our luggage was left and we went off to do what we were in London to do: the Radio 2 Festival in a Day at Hyde Park. 

We finally got back to the hotel and saw our room at around 10.30-11pm. Our luggage was already in there waiting for us. 

The room was gorgeous with treats left for our impending wedding anniversary, and chocolates on the pillow. Wonderful! 

After quickly freshening up we went back downstairs to the 24 hour bar for cocktails. They were lush! And the service impeccable. 

We had breakfast included in our booking and we had the option of either ordering what we wanted from the menu to be brought to our room at no extra cost as room service, or to partake in the very nice breakfast buffet downstairs. We opted for the latter, and very nice everything was too. 

So. 

Next time I have a need or desire to stay in London I will certainly aim to stay at The Chesterfield again, I’d like to enjoy one of the very interesting things mentioned on the menus such as gin tasting or cheese / beer tasting (I fancy that one the most).  I’ll also do my very best to stay more than just one night as well.

I found no faults during my stay, and that’s very unusual for me; I’m very picky and particular.

105,Afternoon Tea at The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Yesterday my mum and I had afternoon tea at The Chesterfield Mayfair. The whole experience was truly wonderful. The setting is beautiful and the fact that there was a wedding in the hotel added to the beauty. The live musician added a lovely touch to the tea - a great voice and the sound was enough to hear him but sill engage in conversation. The tea was gorgeous - very tasty, very fresh, very abundant and every cake tasted as per the flavour suggested. But what really made the experience so wonderful were the staff and especially our main waitress, Jess. She was helpful, she kept making sure we had enough, she was warm, she had great social skills, she was warm and lovely. A truly wonderful waitress who will go far. A credit to your hotel.",5,2019,09,15
105,Great hotel restaurant,"We had dinner at this nice hotel restaurant. Really good food and reasonable prices. They have both saefood and meat, with Dover Sole is one of their specialities. 

You can book a private dinner in the library, which has an interior that is like going back more than 50 years in time. ",4,2019,09,13
105,The Chesterfield never fails to impress,"I have stayed at the Chesterfiled hotel at least  a half dozen times over the last 8 years. When I say to the cabbie, 35 Charles street it sounds like I am saying home! The staff are genuinely friendly, helpful and knowledagble. The rooms are well appointed and for London offer resonable living space. 

If you are looking for a well situated hotel in Mayfair with a good restaurant, cozy bar, excellent staff and high standards of care and hospitality, consider the Chesterfield.",5,2019,09,13
105,Original Sweet Shop afternoon tea,"Birthday treat at the hotel's Butlers Restaurant. Arrived and was warmly greeted by Roberta who asked if it was a special occasion. I told them it was my birthday and explained our dietary requirements which were noted. We were seated in the stylish conservatory and offered a delicious welcome drink which came in dry ice which added theatre and excitement.
The menu was explained by friendly and very competent waiter Andrea (Italian pronunciation) who tended to us extremely well during our dining. 
The tea was delicious with chocolate scones in addition to the traditional fruit scones. The cakes are creatively based on traditional sweet shop treats such as cola sweets and fudge. The cola slice was our favourite. 
As it was my birthday, a special birthday cup cake with a candle on a decorated plate with my name, was brought to our table and the lovely staff sang Happy Birthday. 
After tea, we were invited to their sweet cart for a take away pick and mix which was a lovely touch. Another excellent waiteress, Darlene, who was friendly, dispensed our treats patiently. 
The whole experience was excellent. The excellence award is well deserved. Congratulations to all involved. We look forward to seeing you again when we return. Thank you for making my birthday treat so special. Great service from a great team.",5,2019,09,13
105,The Sweet Shop Afternoon Tea,What a fantastic afternoon we had at The Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair & this was due to a Wonderful Afternoon Tea - the kitchen should be highly commended & then we can’t praise the front of house staff enough from the moment we stepped into the hotel we felt special & that continued right up-until a Taxi was hailed on our departure! 5 stars are well deserved.,5,2019,09,12
105,High Tea at the Chesterfield,"We booked a vegetarian high tea for two. It was exquisite (and expensive). A wonderful and leisurely  experience. Excellent service and the staff talks with you as if they are sincerely interested in you as a person and what you have to say. My daughter had ""Dancing Dragon"" tea; amazing to watch the flowering tea bulbs and to hear an explanation of the tea.It is a silver needle green tea.I had Silver Needle (can't go wrong with Silver Needle). The desserts were yummy with lots of chocolate selections. No problems with dress code.",5,2019,09,11
105,"Location, Location, Location",The Chesterfield Mayfair was in a prime location for all we planned to see and do in London. Many of our destinations were within walking distance while everything else was a short Uber ride away.  Our room was very comfortable and the staff's service was outstanding.,5,2019,09,08
105,Cozy hotel friendly  efficient service elegant,Stayed for overnight on a business trip - very good location - short walk to some of the offices I visited ; several restaurants in the neigbourhood. Service was exemplary - right from concierge to reception and service at the restaurant . Well appointed rooms with a nice executive desk for work and very comfortable bed /lines - it has an old world charm. Had a great experience at Butlers for dinner where I had a specific vegetarian food requirement and also for breakfast . Lively place and it was packed with American tourists who seemed confused to press 1 or G in the elevators for the lobby . Staff anticipates your needs than being reactive - which is very good . Chirpy and friendly service - had to defer my departure due to work but the hotel was busy and couldnt manage an extra night.,5,2019,09,07
105,A Cozy Gem,"This lovely hotel is within easy walking distance of major museums and the finest shops and bookstores, yet it is on a quiet street.  Our room was up to date, pretty, comfortable, and quiet.  It had every convenience such as a hairdryer, safe, coffee/tea provisions discreetly tucked away, toiletries, extra pillows and blankets, and ample towels.  The hotel staff was friendly, gracious, and helpful, without being obtrusive.  Breakfast was very good (we ate elsewhere for dinner), and fresh apples and delicious, fresh lemonade was offered in the lobby.  The rooms seem well insulated from sound, so we could not hear people closing their doors in the hallway, which can be very disruptive.  The hotel is our go-to place in London from now on.",5,2019,09,04
105,What a gem!,"Visited London for the first time with my daughter. I chose this beautiful quaint hotel that seemed like the perfect choice in terms of location and size for what I was looking for. Many of the sights were within walking distance, close to shopping, Buckingham Palace and great restaurants. Hotel was on a quiet street so we did not hear any street noise at all which was great. Hotel was so clean, room was super cute, service was phenomenal. Staff was so welcoming. I cannot begin to express how amazing the staff was. So much attention to detail. Our breakfast was brought up every morning to our room by Andrea who was so thoughtful each morning and always took care to make sure we ordered enough to eat.  I ordered hotel dinner one evening and the wait staff brought me a sampling of dessert just so I could have a taste, even though I hadn’t ordered any dessert. I was so stuffed from the delicious fish and chips. Service at the restaurant was fantastic. Front desk was always so helpful with any questions I had to navigate my way through London. The biggest surprise was the lovely gift and cupcake the staff left in our room for my daughter’s birthday.  Such an amazing surprise.  It was probably one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at and I cannot wait to return.  The hotel looked like a great choice based on previous reviews but our stay exceeded all my expectations. You will not be disappointed with this hotel.",5,2019,09,04
105,Fantastlc Afternoon Tea,"Came here with my wife for afternoon tea and
had a great time. The food was wonderfu with lots of variety and the selection of teas was fantastic with both classic and exotic types available. Would definitely recommend anyone reading this to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion here.",5,2019,08,31
105,Best wedding hotel,"We had the privilege to have our wedding at the Chesterfield Hotel in early August. Everything from the early days of organising to the last minute prep was perfect!
The Chesterfield staff are extremely professional, welcoming and helpful.

We booked both the library and the conservatory and both were impeccable, very personable and intimate venues which waere perfect for our wedding!

Many thanks to Kornelia and her wonderful team!",5,2019,08,31
105,Great Stay,"My husband and I loved our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair! Lots of little touches and surprises throughout your stay. Rooms are smaller than here in the US, but they are clean and adorable. Great location from Green Park station which has a direct route to Heathrow airport. Make an effort to do the afternoon tea they serve too, you will not regret it!",5,2019,08,28
105,Excellent 4 star hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Great experience all round at this hotel during the heatwave in London a few weeks ago. Staff service is superb, rooms was very comfortable, and the bar with live Jazz on the Wednesday night was like an oasis in the desert like heat. We had our small dog with us and the hotel is genuinely dog friendly, which is fantastic. I would return without hesitation and recommend to others. Well done Chesterfield! Keep it up.",5,2019,08,28
105,Wonderful hotel in a wonderful neighborhood ,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 nights and it was just perfect for our family.  The rooms were well appointed, the staff is friendly and professional.  The neighborhood is fantastic.  Beautiful and quiet.  The tube stop is a short walk as are many of the major sites.",5,2019,08,25
105,2 thumbs up! ,"Perfect location. Accommodating staff. Great service. 
We stayed for 5 nights in Chesterfield Mayfair to end our euro-UK trip honeymoon, and we loved it! It is 5 minutes away from the train station (although we rarely use the tube because almost all places are walk-able!). There is a nearby Tesco (mini grocery). There are a lot of great pubs beside it. And the shopping area is very accessible!! 
Besides the location, the service was also amazing. They have friendly and knowledgeable staff who will help whatever your concern is! They even prepared some champagne, cupcake and souvenir picture frame for us since they knew we were celebrating our honeymoon. So sweet. 
I will definitely recommend this hotel! :) and hopefully will be able to come back again! :) ",5,2019,08,25
105,Great hotel in great location!,This hotel was in a residential neighborhood but so convenient to everything. We walked everywhere. The staff was very friendly and helpful also. We would stay there again if we are in London!  It’s a wonderful hotel,5,2019,08,25
105,A blotch on the Carnation hotel chain name,The Carnation hotels run superbly by the Tollman's are usually a delight to visit. Not this one. Windows do not open. Grimy feel to the rooms. Depressing hallways. Dispirited and poorly trained eastern Eurooean staff. Dark..very dark. I have been in happier funeral homes. Summary: everything is wrong with this place.,2,2019,08,24
105,Simply Spectacular,"Stayed with my 88 year old mom two weeks ago following a trip to Scotland. Our room was gorgeous and my mom was treated like the Queen. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud, bedlinen was divine!. The room was spotlessly clean and super comfortable. The shower was incredible! Great water pressure.  :)  The staff was charming, responsive, helpful and always available. The gentlemen at the door were so helpful, along with the staff at the front desk.  The Concierge who was there during our stay, Karolis, was just wonderful, taking care of all of our requests immediately.  The public areas of the  hotel were beautiful, quiet and so comfortable. The bar was a wonderful way to relax for a couple of hours and have lunch and the dining room was great.  I did not have tea there but it seems that other guests truly enjoyed it. I have been to London several times, but between the customer service, the comfort and the location (walking distance to a number of lovely restful and beautiful parks!) this will be my choice in the future.  My sister and my friend Elizabeth are traveling to London next week and will be staying here as well.  I know they are in for a fabulous stay.",5,2019,08,23
105,"Not Even A 4 Star, Let Alone 5","The room was so impossibly small that we constantly hit our knees and toes on furniture just trying to move around the bed. The staff seemed to be used to a mostly American clientele who are on their first trip abroad and therefore respond to guests with very generic, and often inaccurate, city information. If you aren't an international traveler or aren't familiar with London, you'd just take whatever they say, but I live in the UK and my friend has been many times, so we were a bit shocked by some of the very poor responses we received to the simplest of requests. We did not have a meal or drink in the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. We did ask for two bottles of water to take to our room one night at the bar and they charged my friend £5 EACH for an 8 oz bottle of water. I presume it was blessed by the Pope for that price. Otherwise the hotel is in a great location, but it is not somewhere I would recommend to my friends or that I would ever stay again. Lastly, I would say it was a luxury price on par with actual 5 star hotel costs, but very much a 3 star facility and service.",2,2019,08,21
105,perfect!!,"Great location,great service, room good sized for central london, very comfortable beds. Easy access to many london sites and Green Park tube station easy walk. Overall well worth the value and would certainly return.",5,2019,08,17
105,My second visit was excellent like the first!,"I just stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair for the second time in several years on my second trip to London.  I'm a solo female  traveler and appreciate their excellent service and hospitality.  There are numerous points to mention: 
1) The breakfast in the dining room is superb.  The wait staff are very attentive and remembered my coffee preference after the first day!  The atmosphere amongst guests was very convivial -- lots of travel trips and stories are shared,
2) Shout out to Gorgy and Joe on the door staff.  They were super courteous and helpful in getting me safely where I wanted to go. 
3) The linens on the bed were divine and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in. 
4) The night time housekeeping staff were super - they'd come around in the evening for turndown service and had extra towels and water at the ready. 
5) The hotel bar is very welcoming and the bartender made the best Negroni I've ever had!
6) My room, 608 was very quiet.  You don't hear any interior doors slamming or street noise.  Plus the water pressure in the shower was nice and strong, which you don't find in all hotels.
7) It is a 10 min (at a slow pace) walk to the Green Park tube station and bus stop, which is a major connection for travel in the city.
I can't imagine any other hotel where I'd want to stay in London!",5,2019,08,16
105,Wonderful Stay!,My mother and I stayed here for two nights and had a fantastic time! The hotel is centrally located and has one of the best breakfasts I’ve experienced. The staff was friendly and helpful. Antonio made us feel very welcomed. Thanks for a great stay!  ,5,2019,08,15

First time someone picked up, never managed to complete my first sentence and the person hung up. A few minutes later i did complete the call,  a somewhat gruff gentleman answered. Told me that there was nobody there who could take my reservation, asked for my phone number which I gave, and he assured me that I would be called back the following day. Still waiting for that call, never happened. Of course reserved another hotel but a very strange way to treat potential customer",1,2019,08,15

The hotel is withing walking distance to many London attractions and the shoppig district, and it is also close to the Green Park tube station from where you can get directly to Heathrow airport via the Piccadilly line without the need to change trains.  The rooms are small but charming and it was great for a small family. We stayed there for almost a week. The staff is extremely helpful and welcoming. The dining options at the hotel are delicious. We had breakfast there during our stay and also tried the hotel's afternoon tea experience. All in all, I am extremely satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to London. ",5,2019,08,13

105,Five Star Hotel Experience,"My wife and I, newly married, started our honeymoon by staying at this hotel. Upon arrival, the doorman Adrien quickly greeted us and helped usher our bags in. The receptionist, Maria, was friendly and informative, and was apt to engage in light conversation with us. She upgraded our room, free of charge, once she learned of our recent marriage. A very professional and courteous staff overall.

The venue itself was very clean, and offered light refreshments (e.g., chesterfield lemonade daily) and coffee in the lobby (e.g., mornings). We had afternoon tea in the butler’s restaurant, which my wife enjoyed. One of the evenings we ended up at the bar, where we had surprisingly the best fish and chips meal of our entire trip, and we ate a lot of them. The cocktails were suitable, but the bar staff were equally professional and friendly as the concierge.

Our room was clean and was well equipped to accommodate two people. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Although we do not like carpeted rooms, this one was very clean and had no odours. Perhaps our only grievance with this place is that there was no cable tv for our room, but then again this is negligible seeing that you’re here to take in the sights. 

The location of the hotel was good, and within walking distance to many sights, shops, and pubs/restaurants. Since the hotel was located in the Mayfair area, it was very safe.

At the end of our trip, they gave us a gift to commemorate our honeymoon stay, which was a photo book. A gracious and thoughtful gesture. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, it was a five star experience, and we will return. ",5,2019,08,11

105,Memorable stay for 40th birthday,"I could not be more positive and complimentary about our stay here. I booked this almost 7 months in advance for my partner’s 40th birthday. I knew we would be working that day and had planned to go to a restaurant in the area and chose this hotel for its proximity and because it looked charming. When I booked I added a note that it was my partner’s 40th birthday and I hadn’t booked the romance package because we had to work and only staying one night so wouldn’t have the opportunity to enjoy it - I thought maybe they’ll put a nice touch in the room, I never expected the overwhelming welcome we received. On checking in, rather damp and bedraggled thanks to typical British summer weather and having both worked all day, the staff were friendly and welcoming but said nothing until taking us up in the lift when she commented wasn’t it a special day and we said oh yes it’s his 40th but we’ve been working all day. She then told us they’d put us in the best suite and goodness it was! The staff had even signed a card and left a little cupcake for him. I couldn’t have expected or asked for something more special and we got to enjoy some real comfort and luxury. The suite was impeccably laid out with all the amenities you could desire - charming and classic. The breakfast was truly delicious and the staff so lovely. Thank you Chesterfield for making my partner’s day - it was truly memorable and I am going to recommend to all. We’ll be back for sure and I also want to return to try your afternoon tea as if our stay was anything to go by it will be truly exceptional. ",5,2019,07,31
105,A 5 Star Royal Experience,"My royal 5 star experience started when our taxi pulled up to the hotel.  We were whisked into the lobby along with our luggage before I even knew what was happening, lol.  The doormen are at the top of their game.  Our room was not quite ready and so we were whisked into the bar where we were given complimentary cocktails.  Before we even finished our drinks we were informed that our room was ready and given our key cards.  Our room was lovely, overlooking a charming courtyard where they host weddings.  The parties were always over by 10:30 or earlier, so that was never a problem.  I slept like a rock every night. 
  We felt incredibly spoiled each night with a different treat on our pillows with the turndown service.  Please do get the breakfast included package.  The buffet is incredible, including healthy fare.  So, so delicious!  We ate a couple of times in the bar for lunch/dinner.  Best fish and chips in the world!  We also ate in Butlers restaurant one night for dinner.  I had the fillet of sole.  They are famous for having the best sole in all of England!  I can say that it was certainly deliciously melt in your mouth fare. I will continue to dream of it until I return ;).
  Every staff member was stellar.  Especially Gyrgory at the door and Elsa at the desk.  Housekeeping seems to know what you need/want before you even think it.  There was always plenty of shower gel, shampoo, soap, towels, anything your heart could desire.  Tea and coffee kettle and supplies in room included cookies, should you get hungry.  If any item was consumed it was then replaced by the next day.  
  This hotel should be #1 on TripAdvisor for this city.  I feel they must give this royal treatment to every guest.  I felt as if I was in a dream and so sad when it came to an end.  You get a delicious farewell cupcake on your last night at the turndown service.
  Until we meet again, Chesterfield Mayfair.  Until we meet again <3",5,2019,07,30
105,You Deserve It,"Here's what we found at the Mayfair: they LOVE their guests - nothing is too much trouble.  They understand that their guests' happiness is the ultimate compliment to the Chesterfield's service. 
We were stunningly upgraded ( not sure if this is routine ) but whether or not we were upgraded wouldn't have mattered. This place is all about: What can we do for you? 
We were treated to English High Tea and here's a tip: get one and share! They replenish the finger sandwiches and cakes so you will leave very satisfied. The breakfast buffet is quite varied and really eye-popping. Superb.",5,2019,07,26
105,worth the splurge,"Wonderful luxury hotel in a charming quiet neighborhood. Recommended in Fodor's ( their only ""con"" was some rooms were small- ours was fine), Michelin and now #5 in T&L top 10 London Hotels of 2019. Good TripAdvisor reviews. Staff friendly and always willing to go the extra mile. Very good breakfast with eggs perfectly done for instance. Everything about the rooms was very nice- comfortable bed, nice linens and large fluffy towels, and great heating and cooling ( VERY quiet and effective). Definitely would stay here again when visiting London.
For a good restaurant nearby- try Iran Restaurant.",5,2019,07,26
105,Perfect Wedding Venue,"I recently got married at The Chesterfield and we are so glad we booked our big day at this hotel. Kornelia was a pleasure to deal with in the planning stages and was always available to answer questions and offer advice. We had a small wedding ceremony (20 people) in The Library followed by delicious dining in The Conservatory. The day itself was simply amazing and all the staff (too many to mention!) offered a top-class service from start to finish. I would highly recommend The Chesterfield Hotel as a wedding venue. David, July 2019",5,2019,07,25
105,Great Introduction to London!!,"My mom and I took a quick trip to London only spending a total of three days and our trip was amazing greatly due to The Chesterfield Mayfair. This being my first time in London, this hotel makes me want to come back! Upon arrival, we were happily greeted by Jack. Jack kindly explained everything we needed to know and then called the bellmen to assists us with our luggage. One of the bellmen guided us to our room and he also informed us of all we needed to know about our room. We decided to stay and eat dinner at the restaurant located inside the hotel. The food at the restaurant was beyond delicious with exceptional service. All of the staff were enthusiastic about the food there and offered suggestions on what we should order. Loris, the restaurant manager helped make our time at the restaurant even more enjoyable with this charming personality. Highly suggest ordering the scallops, eel, and bacon appetizer (hug in the mouth) and the cheesecake is absolutely the best cheesecake I have ever had! The breakfast spread was also delicious with an assortment of smoothies, pastries, yogurts, and so much more. The rest of the time there was well spent, as we ended up eating the majority of our meals there. The staff was not only competent and kind but also remembered us and greeted us every time we entered and exited the hotel asking us about our days. Highly recommend staying there!",5,2019,07,25
105,Love the Chesterfield,"The Chesterfield was everything we hoped it would be! From the Doorman to our charming rooms everything was excellent.  We stayed 5 nights and loved this hotel.  Great location, fabulous staff, charming room and breakfast was wonderful.  We have been to London many times and this is now our favorite place to stay. Hotel is lovely, clean and convenient and  we will stay here every time we visit!     ",5,2019,07,25
105,Friendliness and comfort,We were genuinely touched by the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff at the Chesterfield.  It is rare nowadays for a hotel in London to have a personal touch.  If you are looking for a hotel near the famous tourist landmarks I would highly recommend it as an oasis of calm.,5,2019,07,24
105,Excellent Gin Tasting Experience - Thank you Adrian!,"Just last week, we have received a fantastic Gin Tasting Experience by Adrian, a charming and competent Gin Expert. 
I choose the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair as I previously visited it few times for work, and I have always received the best customer service. 
This occasion was a small leaving party for an old friend of mine, and it was 4 of us attending the Gin tasting experience.
Adrian reserved for us a more than generous portion of the room, and we were soon presented with juniper, fruity and spicy notes, to match with 3 selected types of gin samples.
Adrian wonderfully explained the gin distillation process, the history behind this drink, and why he proposed this selection. With clear communication and such approachable manners, we indeed asked him a lot of questions, and he promptly welcomed them. 
The overall experience lasted about 1hour and half. It was such a pleasent and memorable evening, thank you Adrian!",5,2019,07,23
105,Beautiful hotel very English ,"The chesterfield Mayfair property Charles and queen. This is a charming well appointed small hotel in a quiet area near plenty of amenities and activities. 
Hotel details - greeted by a well dressed door man and concierge staff, Josef and Paolo. We were early to arrive and they graciously took our 16 bags of luggage - there were 8 of us traveling and held it until the rooms were ready, allowing us to explore nearby Picadillly -15 min walk, st James park, buckingham palace and green park. All within 15 minute walk. 
Rooms had nice beds with turn down every night, USB ports near the bed, plenty of space, nice toiletries in the bathroom and a red carnation in a vase. 
The hotel has everything on site, restaurant, bar, tea service.  It’s about a 10 minute walk to the Green park line if you plan to take the tube. Mayfair area is lovely. ",5,2019,07,23
105,Birthday Afternoon tea,"Had a fantastic experience here. Took a party of 14 guests and had the champagne afternoon tea. 
There was plenty of food : the sandwiches were delicious , the scones amazing and even chocolate scones!
The selection of cakes all based on sweeties were stunning and tasted really good.
Nothing was too much trouble including catering for special diets .
A vast array of speciality teas helped with the enjoyment !
The afternoon was finished off with a trip to The sweetie man !!
We would go back - definitely worth a visit !",5,2019,07,23
105,Excellent hotel,"Second family trip here & it feels like home! Staff extremely welcoming & friendly from doorman to front desk, wait staff in restaurant & concierge. Excellent location, within walking distance to major sites.",5,2019,07,23
105,All Hail The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"Okay.  This is for the “bottom line up front people”.  The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is FABULOUS.  Five star service without a pinch of snobbishness.  Rooms are extremely comfortable, tastefully decorated with modern amenities and surprisingly spacious.  And their food and staff and overall atmosphere? STELLAR. ACE.  BOMB.  Just GO. 

Now for story-time folks, please read on!

I’m an unapologetic Downton Abbey/Jane Austen-based rom-com fan and royal-watcher (no judging, please!!!) and I just love London.  I don’t know “why” specifically – although I’m sure that the downward US-UK exchange rate trend for each trip no doubt helps!).  But part of what makes travel experiences special for me is my hotel base.  Hotel trip 1 was the Rembrandt in Knightsbridge. The room was sunny, clean, charming, and snug…as in I had to climb over my bed to get around the door to get in the loo (early 2000s…things are likely different now).  But the main point of the trip was to hear Maxim Vengerov rock his violin magic at Royal Albert Hall, so the convenience of skipping across the street and a 10ish minute walk made the hotel perfect for my needs.  Then trip 2…it was 2012 and London was The Place to be because of the Olympics and the Jubilee!  I got upgraded at the London Marriott County Hall on the Southbank overlooking the Thames and the London eye. No kidding. I was on such an emotional high between that room view and going to Highclere Castle (the real Downton Abby, for the uninitiated) that I don’t quite remember what the food or service was like.  But I felt like a queen and was pretty convinced that nothing could top it.

And now comes The Chesterfield.  I am in love for LIFE.  I’ve only been back home for a touch over a week and I’ve pretty much been whining and pining every day and becoming more and more determined to go back.  And I will be back!

Let’s talk location and arrival for a minute.  I’ve never stayed or even walked through Mayfair before.  But it’s only 15-20 minutes from Paddington Station and the hotel staff could not have been more welcoming.  I got there around 9:00am – way earlier than I wanted and I just hoped that they’d at least be willing to secure my bags without a problem.  They could not have been more accommodating…of course, they’d be happy to do it!  And speaking of happy, I got the sense from every doorman, every valet, every front desk rep and concierge that they were working there because they LOVED TO SERVE.  It wasn’t just a job and they don’t appear to play favorites because someone is dressed more nicely, nor do they have noses raised because Mayfair is such an uber-classy and posh area (and it really is, y’all). Case in point:  2 of my valet/doorman friends (they feel like family after a while) got into a spirited discussion for the right to pick up my dinner take-out order from down the street.  And that was AFTER they and half of the front desk reps jumped online to review the best nearby Indian restaurants that would even let me do a take-out (Matsya won out, btw, yum!).  You can’t really buy that kind of consistent customer service excellence attitude.   But that’s how The Chesterfield – and perhaps Red Carnation Hotels in general – roll.

TV?  One can make the argument that one visits a city to spend more time out of the room than in it, so who really cares?  Well, you do when you don’t feel like moving right away, or anymore, or at all.  Me and my buddy did just that when we were just exhausted from exploring – like when I got inspired to walk from Kensington Palace (excellent Queen Victoria exhibits!) to the Princess Diana fountain and then onward through Hyde Park and back to the hotel…in wedge heels…dumb-de-dumb-dumb.  We decided to order room service and just chill.  And that’s when I discovered that the huge wall mounted TV actually worked AND they have a HUGE selection of channels to choose from.  Gracious….everything from the best of British to the best of American comedy to Turner Classic Movies to BBC 1-4 to ITV 1-3 (or more?) and then Wimbledon, of course.  Between excitement out of the room and entertainment in the room, I really felt pampered and rather privileged.  Such an investment must cost The Chesterfield more than a couple of pounds every month.  I, for one, want to say that I recognize and appreciate it. 
 
Ah yes, room service.  I’m telling you…I’m telling you… this really stood out to us.  This poor young lady (Dahrlene? Gosh I hope this is right) was unfailingly efficient, polite, kind, and friendly.  She may have been the only or main person assigned to delivery.  But regardless, she is a gem.  She got her exercise with us!

Food.  You know, hotel restaurants are not always known for being a destination in and of themselves.  Those that are can often be super exclusive, with multiple attendants per table, delectable (one hopes) but small portions, and extravagant costs.  Well, the Chesterfield breakfast and dinner offerings are not extravagantly priced compared to, let’s say, Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester (a mere 10-15 walk, btw). But they really deliver the service and quality aspects in spades.  The Butler Restaurant is inviting, beautiful, and relaxing.  Breakfast offerings are plenteous, as is the Illy coffee (yes, please!) and you can even eat it in the Bar for those of us who sleep in too late.  The servers work seamlessly as a team – everyone comes by to serve and sometimes just ask how you’re doing and if you desire anything else.  I felt cared for but not suffocated.  And the same goes for the light-filled, family friendly, spacious tea area.  If you have kids and want to introduce them to the afternoon tea concept, I recommend theirs highly.  For adults, you’ll be happy too; also, consider checking out the same service at The Milestone, the Chesterfield’s sister property, for a more hushed and traditional atmosphere.

Kudos to Everybody.  I’m really kicking myself because I should have taken the time to write all of the names down.  So please forgive any omissions:

•	Reservations:  Chloe Slater and the rest of the team, to include Giacomo and Andreea  ... you put up with my multiple calls and emails to get us the perfect room for our needs.  And we truly appreciate your generosity to include the free daily breakfast, not to mention the arrangement of an early room check-in.  I so enjoyed kicking off my day at Butlers with great food and the latest newspapers.

•	Doormen/Valets:  Antonino Tresca, his brother, and everyone else… your can-do and genuinely friendly attitude, along with your smiles, will always be remembered.  

•	Front Desk:  You all seem to never leave your posts, but your service excellence commitment never wavered that I could see. I’m in awe.

•	Restaurant:   to Fia’chra (sorry if this spelling is all kinds of wrong) and everyone serving the restaurant, tea area, bar area and room service.  You’re all 5-star to me.  And the Farewell Cupcake???? I would have left and come back every day to get another – which, of course, I couldn’t.  But wow, I wish. Really.

•	Housekeeping:  You rock!

All in all, to bring things full circle, I can’t recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair enough.  I don’t do hotel reviews very often, but I was compelled to do it this time because I had such a great experience.  I hope that you, dear Readers, will consider making your way there as well.",5,2019,07,21
105,Practically perfect in every way,"I wanted a once-in-a-lifetime experience for my Anglophile wife on her first trip to London. Boy did these folks help hit it out the park! Oops, a baseball analogy about a British hotel. Located close to shopping, sightseeing, and theater - and also to bus and Metro lines. The staff treated us royally - appropriate given how close we are to Buckingham Palace. Afternoon tea was unforgettable. Perhaps most amazing of all was the bar. Not only do Adrian and James provide attentive service and exquisite cocktails, but their passion for spirits and mixology shine through. Our friends booked a “Gin and Tonic Experience” for us that was so much fun, we squeezed in a “Rum Experience” between theater and dinner two nights later. Mind- blowing! This kind of attention to guest experience pervades the whole staff. I had both the Continental breakfast (fantastic breakfast breads, yoghurts, and cold meats) and the even heartier English breakfast. Both kept me going until teatime. London has hooked me, and so has The Chesterfield Hotel. ",5,2019,07,19
105,Mind blowing hotel,"“By far the best hotel that provides exceptional service. I’ve travelled around the world and visited many luxury hotels but Oberoi is all ways the chosen one for me and family ”
I will come again in this hotel with family next time",5,2019,07,18
105,15 Great Nights!,"We stayed fifteen nights in May and had a great time. I drank a frigate’s worth of tea. The service at the Chesterfield Mayfair was outstanding, well managed. I have attached a photo of the four wisemen: (l to r) Darren, Antonio, George, and Joe. They helped us tremendously, Darren, the concierge, hooked us up with whatever we needed. He’s got a well-worn book full of names and phone numbers. It’s probably worth a fortune. George fetched us a blanket for the park and well as other items we needed throughout the stay. Antonio and Joe were there to provide umbrellas and happy greetings whenever we left or returned. The rooms were quiet, clean, and comfortable—luxurious for London’s standard. Housekeeping was very kind, providing extra towels and of course—tea! We enjoyed the hotel’s morning breakfast a few times before venturing out to the surrounding areas to mingle with the locals. We found cheaper options a few blocks away including Henry’s Café Bar Piccadilly. The library, just off the lobby, was a nice place to sit and read, however, they had it closed many times for meetings. That was a bummer. It seemed like a few nights they could have opened it up. But for location, price, luxury, service, it’s hard to beat the Chesterfield Mayfair. You will enjoy. The four wisemen will ensure it.",5,2019,07,17
105,Would Stay Again,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a boutique style hotel in an excellent location. From the time we were greeted at the door of the hotel everyone was hospitable and made us feel very welcome. Our correspondence with the hotel started months in advance and Paolo, the concierge was very helpful before we even arrived to arrange theatre tickets and make travel recommendations. Jozef, the bell captain helped with any need we had to get our luggage and to assure we were familiar with our room. The housekeeping staff was amazing and the room was well attended throughout our stay. The dining room staff was exceptional and friendly.  everyone was so helpful and kind. The food was excellent. The young man that worked in the bar in the evening from Sicily was exceptional. As the week progressed we were able to interact with many of the other staff and Darren another concierge at the desk helped so often with directions and recommendations and was so kind. The reception staff was outstanding also. The hotel was beautiful and being a tennis fan who was there in part to attend Wimbledon made me appreciate even more the tennis decorations that were done to celebrate the start of the tournament. If we are blessed in the future to come again we would welcome the chance to stay again at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2019,07,14

105,THE BEST,"My husband and I spent almost two weeks at the Chesterfield Mayfair in May 2019 and it was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The location is great and the hotel itself is a gem....beautiful public areas and comfortable, clean rooms that are well-appointed and a wonderful restaurant and bar. What is outstanding is the staff. The concierge Paolo is excellent and helped us plan our day every day. He made our trip easy and most enjoyable!  Charlotte, Jack and Sandra at the front desk were a joy to speak with and were most accommodating and helpful for our entire stay. In the restaurant, we loved Manuela at breakfast and Loris at dinner. True professionals and simply lovely people. The bellman are wonderful too and will help you in every way possible...thank you Joe, Antonio and Gyrgory. The entire staff is well-trained and welcoming and this hotel has created a culture of excellence that makes a stay here THE BEST! We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,13
105,What a delight,I was lucky enough to stay with my wife at this hotel for one night. Wish it had been longer.  From the welcome to the quick check in the service was flawless.  The hotel bar was warm and felt like a new home from home. The room was immaculate and first class with excellent attention to detail. Superb Service and friendly staff are standard.  The hotel is also so reasonable for its fantastic location.  So close to Bind Street . I would strongly recommend staying here. ,5,2019,07,13
105,Visiting our son in London.,"Found the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel on TripAdvisor and definitely it was a great choice. The elegance and character of the people and the place itself was top notch. There was so much charm in this hotel. It's beautiful, the rooms are small, but so inviting. The bed was spectacular.( so comfortable). The location is in a perfect area to walk to or if need be take the Tube, or aka the underground train . The restaurant is charming and the people who work there are friendly, but very professional. I would definitely recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel to anyone who wants a great experience at a great hotel.",5,2019,07,11
105,Chesterfield will not disappoint,"I first stayed at the Vhesterfield hotel 25 years ago and was impressed at that time, I recently stayed at the hotel in May this year and to say that they have ratched up on the quality and value for money is an understatement. the room was great the service was fantastic and the meals were fantastic. Would certainly stay there again and have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to friends and family",5,2019,07,10
105,Beautiful Hotel,"The Chesterfield harkens back to the days of outstanding service, impeccable housekeeping and premises that are lovingly maintained.

The bartender , James , is super kind and make exquisite cosmos,  the service at Butlers restaurant is excellent, the deep passion that Loris has when explaining the food ingredients is a rare beauty to see, Rafcar was also very kind and attentive with the wine and i don't know the chef, but i know how tasty and beautifully presented was the meal so thank you all( especially to the lovely Sylvain )for a lovely birthday dinner!",5,2019,07,09
105,Lovely hotel,"We struggled to get a hotel for our trip to London due to Wimbledon, Stevie Wonder and Pride weekend all being on at the same time.
This hotel came available due to a last minute cancellation.
We were greeted by lovely staff, fresh flowers and lemonade.
Very helpful at check in even though they were very busy .
Room was not ready so left luggage and went for lunch. Said to come back in 1 hr.
We came back 2.5 hrs later and room was still not ready due to air conditioning problem.
We said we only needed to be in/out as concert had started and engineer could go in when we left.
We were offered breakfast for the inconvenience. Very much appreciated.
Room, bedding and towels all lovely.
Complimentary water. 
Breakfast was very good.
Overall we had a fantastic stay and would certainly stay here again.

105,Afternoon tea,My family participated in an Afternoon Tea service on our first trip to London. We picked this location because it is one of the few places that offer a gluten free menu. I can say this was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! The tea and food was delicious and the service impeccable! A special thanks to Toni and Andrea for making this a wonderful experience we all will remember.,5,2019,07,06
105,Lovely Hotel!,"Myself and a colleague came here to meet two Italian friends, who were staying in this Hotel, over the weekend.

Truly very lovely place indeed. Staff were charming, and the Hotel amenities superb.

The four of us had early afternoon tea - the standard was really impressive and the sandwiches were great. 

Very lovely hotel indeed.",5,2019,07,06
105,Love The Chesterfield Mayfair,"We had a fantastic stay here. I specifically wanted to stay in a more traditional hotel. I’m not a game of the soulless chains that abound around the world. The hotel gets a lot right. First, great Air Conditioning in room.  This was greatly appreciated as we arrived during the heatwave. The second thing we loved was the complimentary glass bottles (no plastic, yay!) of still and sparkling water we were provided each day. Again much appreciated in the heat. Third, our rate included breakfast and it was fantastic. Several made to order options plus a beautifully laid out buffet. Great staff as well. Fourth, in the desk in our room was a small organizer filled with office supplies including scissors, post its, tape, and a stapler. I can’t tell you how many times I have traveled and wished for scissors. Nice touch Chesterfield. Fifth, very nice toiletries by Elemis including lip balm. All the staff, including the front desk and door men were great- always cheerful and friendly. The location of the hotel was great too. Also roomers very quiet. My only small quibble-the drapes did not cover the very top of the windows so room was very bright. I’m sensitive to light while sleeping so that was a minor blip in an otherwise great stay. ",5,2019,07,06
105,First Rate in every way,"My first stay at the Chesterfield. The location, obviously, is as central as a visitor could ask. As others have already said the service throughout the hotel is amazing and the rooms are as comfortable as a guest could want. I wasn’t so surprised by the attention to every detail when I discovered the hotel’s ownership also runs Uniworld River Cruises. Look forward to my next visit.",5,2019,07,04
105,Afternoon tea - charming!,"My partner and I went for the sweet shop afternoon tea, and we had a ball. The food portions were generous (all we could eat!) fun and different. Andrea served us and he was brilliantly attentive, lovely to chat to and made us feel extremely welcome. His tea recommendations were fantastic - there’s a massive range of teas to choose from, most of which are unusual and in keeping with the sweet shop theme. Andrea even brought us more of our favourite sandwiches and some desserts to take home! A fantastic experience, great value and we certainly would recommend this experience to anyone who fancies a sweet treat!",5,2019,07,04
105,"A Gem of a hotel, Amazing Service and Perfect Location!","By the time you leave the Chesterfield, you will feel like you're leaving family! The best service ever and I mean they sincerely ""care"" about each and every guest.
The location is perfect! We walked to and from the West End and many other attractions which was great seeing that the traffic in London is insane.
I've been to London several times and this was my first stay at the Chesterfield but it definitely won't be my last!",5,2019,07,04
105,Sumptuous but very friendly,"This hotel almost trips into the over the top category in its decor and feel, but make no mistake the staff that work there and very friendly, polite and helpful. The bar is well stocked and service is polished and professional, breakfast is a delight. Reception and concierge very efficient. The rooms are not large and many look over the air conditioned roofs of Mayfair. So all in all, not cheap, but very nice for a weekend break in Mayfair.",5,2019,07,02
105,"Great service, amazing food, unforgettable experience ","This was my second visit to The Chesterfield for Afternoon Tea, the last being in 2015 for their Charlie and the Chesterfield themed afternoon tea, so when we had a family member visiting the UK from Oz I knew there was one thing she had to experience on her visit and that was afternoon tea at the Chesterfield. 
This time it was The Original Sweet Shop themed afternoon tea and it did not disappoint. 
Upon arrival we received a candy flavoured shot presented in dry ice shot with flying saucer sweet, so we knew straight away we were in for a treat. The sandwiches and scones were fresh and plentiful and the sweetshop themed pastries and cakes were deliciously inspired, my favourite was the rhubarb and custard macaron, tasted just like the sweets. 
Great selection of teas, I had the Fruit Salad tea which tasted just like the sweets. 
Afterwards we got to pick some pick n mix sweets from the cart to take home and also received a token to put in a little machine to win a prize. 
The whole experience was perfect, complete with a musician playing guitar,  the service was on point, asking if we would like more and making sure we were ok for food and drinks. A special thank you would have to go to the lady who's name I sadly didn't catch but I presume she was restaurant manager, who was so friendly and also a big big thank you to Andrea who was just superb and made our experience extra special. He was so friendly and fun, taking lots of pictures with us at the sweet pick n mix cart and just went above and beyond. He really made our experience and was so obliging. 
I would definitely recommend this afternoon tea, after their Charlie and chocolate factory theme a few years ago I wasn't sure they could match it and live up to that but they surpassed it. One of the best in london, worth every penny, and the little touches such as milkshakes for the kids and also noticed kids receiving colouring books too just make it that extra bit special. 
Well worth it for a treat in London and our visiting family member said it was a highlight of their trip ",5,2019,07,02
105,Wedding!,"We held our wedding (ceremony and reception) at the Chesterfield hotel on 1st June 2019 - and a number of family members stayed the night before and night of the wedding. 

From the time I enquired about holding our wedding at the hotel to the time we left the day after, the staff at the hotel were amazing. I visited the hotel a number of times between booking and the day itself and the event coordinator always professional and friendly, making sure she took notes of everything for the day, making suggestions if necessary. 

The day itself was wonderful, and a big part of that was the professional and friendliness of the staff ensuring our day ran smoothly. Our guests commented on the beautiful decoration of the hotel (Art Deco). The food was fantastic, catering for all (vegan, gluten-free, allergies, children, etc) - always willing to help find a solution so everyone was happy. 

Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our day so special and memorable.",5,2019,07,02
105,Quality old London hotel,"This is a good quality hotel with nice sized rooms, especially by London standards.

The front desk staff and porters were excellent. Housekeeping and restaurant staff were a bit spotty, great some others, not so good on others.

My only real criticism is that it is old, meaning floors creak a bit and furniture is not as comfortable as a modern hotel. That said, it is also its charm.

I will stay there again.",4,2019,06,30
105,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"Took my mum for the sweetshop afternoon tea when she visited this weekend and we had the most wonderful time. The food was delicious and the service was great, the trip couldn’t have been nicer. Plus I got the extra bag of sweets to take home, bonus! Thank you!",5,2019,06,30
105,Afternoon tea ,"My lovely friend treated me to an afternoon tea here for my 50th. The staff were lovely and the food really nice. It had a sweetshop theme. We were greeted by a steaming welcome drink which was delicious and a glass of champagne. We had a choice of tea (dancing dragon flowering tea was brilliant!) then were brought the sandwiches and cakes. There was only one of each cake which meant we had to cut each one in half so we got to try everything which was a bit strange as most people want to try it all. The atmosphere was lovely too with a live singer/guitarist with a big smile. The only strange thing was is as we were leaving we asked the sweet shop cart man where the toilets were and he started to take us out the door when he asked if we had our sweets but we declined as we had eaten enough by then, but he then explained we got a bag of pick and mix included and told us to choose our sweets, he was so friendly and these last few minutes actually topped the experience off to amazing. Bit strange why no one else had mentioned this before we were out the door.",5,2019,06,30
105,Phenomenal Hotel,"Perfect location in charming part of London.  Easy walk to Hyde Park and Green Park. Cozy, British feel inside.  Clean, nice rooms.  Polite and helpful staff.  Great lounge/bar- great gin and tonics.  Loved the attention to quality detail in the room.  Great breakfast foods in restaurant every morning. We will definitely stay here again if we ever get back to London.  We loved it!",5,2019,06,29
105,A Haven of Peace in London's Mayfair,"When you walk into the hotel, there is a friendly greeting in an atmosphere of calm. The staff is always polite and helpful. Yesterday I met an old friend for lunch. The menu is pricey but if you're not worried about price, all kinds of dishes are on offer. Starters include a lobster omelette and chicken noodle soup. My guest and I went for the rib-eye steak. It was as good as Hari Kari in Chicago, the benchmark for steak approval! Cooked to perfection. It is easy to wreck a steak. We both resisted dessert.

I hope it will not be too long before I return. If you have children and want a rare experience for them, tea at The Chesterfield is something else. You can say hello to Willy Wonka.",5,2019,06,27
105,Excelent hotel,"Very beautiful, elegant and comfortable.
The rooms are beautiful and cosy. 
Very good service, friendly and professional.
Perfect location. Walking distance to Buckingham palace and Picadilly Circus.
I❤The Chesterfield Mayfair",5,2019,06,26
105,Fantastic Afternoon Tea and Great Service,"We booked for an Afternoon Tea experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair and our family loved it. After a morning of walking around, touring London with kids, we had a much needed break for afternoon tea.  
Service was top notch. 
The hotel staff is super attentive from the moment you walk in.  They were super helpful in stowing away our baby buggy and other traveling encumbrances, all done with a smile and eagerness to welcome our family.  The welcome we received at the restaurant was just as great and they attended to requests with pleasure.  Our table was primarily by Andrea who is friendly, attentive and made sure you and the kids are enjoying the time.  
The tea menu, the candy-inspired pastries, the scones and sandwiches were great and you can have as much as you want. 
We were very pleased with this experience!",5,2019,06,26
105,Quirky afternoon tea,"Fantastic attention to detail and fabulous creativity at this sweet treat themed afternoon tea, beautiful surroundings, delicious 'sweet' inspired goodies, extremely friendly, welcoming and attentive staff. Suitable for children as well as adults with a sweet cart to choose from as an added extra. As this was a birthday treat from my daughter, pink champagne was included and they even presented me with a birthday cup cake with 'happy birthday' written on the plate, a lovely touch.",5,2019,06,24
105,Creative afternoon tea ,"I've been to several 5 star afternoon teas in London now and have always found them fantastic, but this was the first I've been to that showed such amazing creativity, attention to detail and which was definitely suitable for both children and adults. It was also great value for money.
The little touches such as a fun sweet dispenser machine at the end with a good marketing technique of the possibility of winning a free prize, the pick and mix stand and the fact that all the cakes really do celebrate the flavours of the traditional English sweet shop without tasting 'fake' or tacky were all testament to how good this was.
The staff members were also all so polite, attentive and never made you feel greedy!They were brilliant and this afternoon tea definitely exceeded my expectations and stood out amongst other London afternoon teas I have been to.",5,2019,06,23
105,Loved it,"Almost as soon as you enter a number of highly rated hotels, you can tell from your interactions with the staff that the hotel is very well run. This is one of those hotels.

We stayed in Room 407 which overlooks an interior courtyard and roof tops. It was very quiet with no outside noise. The room was good sized, beautifully decorated and well equipped. We lived in London for a number of years and this hotel is a good example of the classic old London hotels

The hotel is located in a quiet part of Mayfair but it is only 2 blocks away from the hustle and bustle of London.

One afternoon we enjoyed the hotel’s high tea with some old friends from London. If you like high tea, this is a good one.",5,2019,06,20
105,A wonderful experience,"I've visited the Butler's Restaurant before, but this time I took my husband for the very first time, because I wanted to show him where I followed my courses (which were always in the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel). We enjoyed afternoon tea, the Sweetshop edition. And how great is was! Delicious food, wonderful tea and great service by the staff members. A must-do event. The Experience is complete, from A-Z! Greetings from Belgium, we will be visiting you again soon!",5,2019,06,19
105,Ten Stars,This is the perfect hotel in the best section of London with great rooms and outstanding service.  We booked a junior suite and by fate were upgraded to the Stanhope Suite room 101.  This is the nicest suite we have ever stayed in with amazing features like a dining room/office with a portrait of Winston Churchill and a flat screen TV in the bathroom.  Charlotte and the rest of the front desk staff took great care of us as did Andrea and the rest of the breakfast team.,5,2019,06,19
105,Quiet hotel in centre of Mayfair what a find!,"Spent 4 nights here last week and the staff made our visit. They were thoughtful and changed our room to an accessible room before we arrived, it had not been available at the time of our booking.
There was an excellent choice for breakfast and a few errors were quickly corrected.",4,2019,06,18
105,Wonderful Hotel with Excellent Service,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights and thoroughly enjoyed the professional staff, comfortable room and convenient location. Its a small boutique hotel tucked into Mayfair but close to Piccadilly . I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very nice stay in London.",5,2019,06,17
105,Höglund Review for our visit in June 2019,"We visited London in June of 2019 and strayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  It was one of the best hotels we have ever visited.  The staff was amazing in their attitudes, work ethics, and all around help.  We enjoyed wonderfully delicious food and with excellent serving staff always available. We particular enjoyed Andre and Loris.  Our Concierge Karolis Simsonas was magnificent and very knowledgeable with regards to places of interest in the city. He helped us plan our itinerary as well as scheduling transportation to and from the airport with our outstanding driver, Danny who gave us a brief history lesson of the city on our way from the airport.  The gentlemen who opened the doors and carried our luggage, and I am so sorry I cannot remember how to spell their names, were so very helpful in securing a taxi for us each day as well as bringing out my mobility scooter when we were going to walk.  The people here at this hotel are there to serve their guests and seemed to be one step ahead of us expressing our next wish.  My husband and I have been fortunate to travel extensively and never have we ever received this much consideration, kindness and excellence service at any other hotel.    ",5,2019,06,17
105,very good with problems as well/mixed bag,I found the decor to be a little bit worn in the halls. My room was refurbished so that was nice but my gosh DONT stay here on a Sat night.(was told that is when the wedding parties take place.) There was a wedding next door and the music was blasting until 11:30! It was so loud there was no way we could sleep. The bathroom was nice but be very careful of the shower water the taps tend to be a bit off and it is very hot. The breakfast service was hit or miss. On some days it was great on other days  you sat there forever waiting for your order. I didnt think that the food was of good quality either. PLEASE dont use the phone in the room for phone calls. 10 minutes was 20 pounds for a local call. I found this ridiculous  in this day and age maybe 1980 but not 2019. The staff was lovely but honestly I wouldn't book this hotel again. It wasnt a terrible stay but these issues should not have occured for a luxury hotel.,4,2019,06,16
105,Great experience,We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for about a week in April.  The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Green Park station which makes it super convenient to explore London.  The hotel is well kept and clean and the employees are friendly and helpful.  We would happily stay here again.,5,2019,06,15
105,"Phenomenal hospitality, attention to detail",I have never seen this level of hospitality and attention to detail apart from the Oberois of the world. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. The staff is so cheerful and helpful. And you are walking distance away from all things London ,5,2019,06,14
105,GOOD SERVICE,"staying here was a very pleasant experience. the staff was good, the rooms were clean and tidy. a very perfect hotel.i'll back to this hotel very very soon with my family and friends.all the staff are very helpful",5,2019,06,14
105,"Incredible Staff, Location and Hotel","My wife and I chose to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair after some pretty extensive research of hotels in London and are glad we did.  From our early morning, jet lagged arrival from the States to our checkout 5 days later, the service and accommodation could not have been better.  We stayed in Room 406, which was quite large by city standards and had an incredibly comfortable king size bed, a perfectly outfitted bath with the best water pressure in a hotel shower I can remember, a large desk area, plenty of drawer and closet space, and a decent view out over the back of the property. The room was slightly worn, but in all the right places, which actually just added to the charm of the room.  The room even had one American 110 volt outlet so we did not need to use an adapter. Also, almost inexplicably for such an old building, the entire hotel was so solidly built and kept that you never heard a squeak of a floor anywhere when walking and, even though the hotel was quite full when we visited, we never heard a peep from another guest from our room. 

My wife mentioned while making our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel provided a beautiful and delicious dessert tray on our first evening turn down service. This was just part of the incredible service we received throughout our stay, from staff remembering our names, to politely inquiring each day about our plans upon our departure and our escapades upon our return.  Unfortunately, I’m not as good at remembering names so I cannot mention staff by name, but really everyone was great. 

The location of the hotel is also ideal as you are a short walk from Piccadilly Street and all it has to offer, including the Greene Park tube station, but far enough away that you are in a pretty quiet residential neighborhood. The hotel was also an easy walk from the Bond Street tub station, which we utilized several times.  Also, almost within stumbling distance of the hotel is Shepherd park, which is not really a park but a collection of amazing pubs and restaurants.  We actually approached this area for the first time from another direction and only later realized it was a block away from the hotel. Just an amazing, perfect location.  

Finally, the included breakfast was beyond our wildest imaginations.  When our travel agent mentioned that breakfast was included we imagined the type of terrible continental breakfast you get in the States, but this was in a whole other category. When we were seated in the beautiful Butler dining room on the first day and looked over the incredible buffet, we were delighted. Then when the waitress asked if we wanted to order any “hot” breakfast from the menu, we were a bit dumbfounded. No, we said, we’ll stick with what’s included with our stay. Her response, the fresh cooked menu items are also included. Again, incredible. The breakfasts were cooked to order, delivered timely, and ultimately delicious. By the time we left, we had tried everything on the menu and everything was great.  

We also got to enjoy a couple of drinks in the amazing bar on a couple of evenings upon returning to the hotel. Here too the service was excellent and the drinks were amazing, even though it got pretty crowded around 5:00 - 6:00 pm.  We did not get to try the afternoon tea, but the tea room looked delightful and we will definitely try on our next visit.  

Overall, this is just an incredible hotel and was a perfect respite for us on our first visit to London. Would highly recommend.  ",5,2019,06,13
105,Fantastic Accommodations!,"This hotel provided maximum service, comfort and a convenient location for our four day stay in London. The location is favorable--within walking distance of Knightsbridge, Soho and Belgravia.The accommodations were excellent including a morning breakfast and dinner menu. We ate in the dining room one evening and were treated to some of the best dover sole imaginable. The dining staff are well trained and skilled. Hats off to the lobby and door crew Antonio, Georgy and Salvatore!",5,2019,06,12
105,Afternoon Tea with Maurizia,"My friend and I were in the neighborhood looking for a place to drink afternoon tea and we stumbled upon The Chesterfield Mayfair. We decided to give it a try and wow, what a wonderful experience we had! It was our first visit to London and we had never had afternoon tea before, but this place was the best place to try tea for the first time! The staff was so friendly and willing to help. Maurizia (I hope I’m spelling your name correctly:) was so great! She came to check on us often and we laughed a lot together! There was enough tea in the pot for 4 cups, and more food than you could imagine eating. My friend is also a vegetarian and they were very helpful in getting her a vegetarian only plate. I will be back next time I visit London! Thank you for a great experience!",5,2019,06,11
105,Afternoon tea,"The best afternoon tea, Andrea made us feel at home during the whole experience and my birthday treat was so lovely thank you the food was lovely cakes outstanding we felt we were on the set of Mary poppins lovely extra touches such as pick and mix and teddies for children will definitely be back",5,2019,06,10
105,Lovely afternoon tea!,"My 2 children and I came here for afternoon tea.  The service was impeccable.  We loved our server, Andrea.  He was quite the gentleman, very attentive, and provided excellent customer service.  We have been to many afternoon teas in London and this is one of my favorites, especially with children.  At the start, we were given a sugary drink that was surrounded with dry ice - such a fun way to begin the tea!  Children can order a milkshake instead of tea and they are given sandwiches that suit their tastes better.  Mine were also given a cute teddy bear at the end, plus we all left with a bag of our choice of sweets from the candy station.  There were many choices of tea and Champagne.  We were able to get unlimited amounts of savories, scones, sweets, and tea - not all teas in London allow this.  The tea was served in an area of the restaurant that resembled a garden, not plush but was adorable.  Please know that you will take your time here, enjoy it rather than rush.  It does take time to box anything you couldn't finish and pay the bill.  But we all enjoyed ourselves and I was quite happy my kids were content as well!  There were many people there without children so please don't think it is only for families with kids.  I would go there again with or without children.",5,2019,06,10
105,The best service of ever,"Such a beautiful day! Many thanks to Andrea for make our afternoontea magnificent! For sure the best in London! We really enjoyed! Thank you so much for your patience and you PASSION.
we will never forget you",5,2019,06,10
105,Cozy luxury,"Everything was perfect - the impeccable service, the comfortable room, the tasteful atmosphere, the location, and breakfast. We never waited more than a couple of minutes for the elevator or for a taxi. Breakfast offered a variety of choices.",5,2019,06,09
105,Great Location,We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair based upon United Airlines Luxury Hotel Listing. The restaurant was very good and the rooms were nice. The location is excellent and convenient to all Central London venues. Their breakfast buffet was very good. Would recommend. ,4,2019,06,09
105,Exemplary service in an historic hotel - and in a great location,"This is rather late because we stayed here right before the holidays. We were impressed with the festive decorations, the lovely rooms, and especially the extraordinary service. 

On our last morning there, I awoke with a painful earache that needed attention before our overseas flight the next day. The wonderful concierge working that morning, Karolis, made arrangements for me to see a doctor nearby and also cancelled a Michelin** restaurant reservation for us (without a penalty), even though it was past the cancellation time. His attention to service was exemplary and he also demonstrated sincere care and concern by running out to our cab as we were leaving to ask if I was feeling better. Needless to say we were somewhat overwhelmed that he remembered us with all of the guests that he encountered. 

We were also very pleased with the housekeeping services and how they were careful to pay attention to our needs and wishes, even without asking.

This type of customer service is what makes a hotel great so we commend the Chesterfield Mayfair on their excellent staff.",5,2019,06,09
105,IFSO London ,"Great location, middle of London,great for first time visitor,nice hotel but small rooms which is expected in London, they have great breakfast and tea time  , you can walk to exford rd , Edward rd, Hyde park and buckingham palace also short distance to bus stop so you can take bus tour very easy .",5,2019,06,08
105,"Excellent location, Great Staff","Love the Location.   Berkeley Square, Grosvenor Square, Shepherd's Market,  St. James Park and Palace, Burlington Arcade, Buckingham Palace and more.   All in easy walking distance.    Miss all the dog pillows in the Bar, but Bar is stil great.   The have some crunchy things they serve with drinks that are delicious.  Great breakfast.   Eggs Benedict three ways!   Very nice and friendly staff.   Darren, the concierge got us tickets for Tina, the Musical.   It was fabulous!!   The rooms are small, but nicely appointed.   In retrospect, we probably should have upgraded to a Junior Suite.",5,2019,06,08
105,Always Magnificent,"From the biggest of  warm smiles from Latetia at reception as she welcomes you back, you immediately feel at home. The location is superb,the staff are simply wonderful.A special mention to Oison in the  lounge Bar and on checking out by Hani the night manager who has worked at the hotel for over 43 years!  The rooms are spotlessly clean as always. The breakfast is the best in London. Cannot recommend highly enough",5,2019,06,07
105,Wonderful choice in Mayfair,"Several enjoyable nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair: attentive service, well appointed rooms, fine dining and a great location. The combination is difficult to match or beat and offers excellent value for a luxury property. The hotel truly lives up to its stated philosophy: “no request too large, no detail too small”. We will happily return on our next visit to London.",5,2019,06,06
105,Fantastic Eight Night Stay at the Elegant Chesterfield Mayfair!,"My girlfriend and I loved our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair for three reasons-the hotel, the staff, and the location. The hotel itself is what I think of when I think of British elegance. It is very well kept on the inside and I would definitely classify this hotel as a luxury hotel. The dining room where we had breakfast every day was elegant and the food was very good. We had both the continental and full breakfasts. The room was very nice and I really liked the look of the lobby. Speaking of the lobby, this is where we would be greeted everyday by hellos and smiles by the staff. They were very helpful whenever we had a question about how to get somewhere. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of many tourist destinations and only a block or two from the Shepard Market which had several small restaurants that we frequented. I really liked the fact that the hotel was in a quiet area, far away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist spots, but still within walking distance. When we left London for our next destination, we were sad to leave our home away from home. I'd definitely recommend staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair the next time you are in London.",5,2019,06,05
105,Great experience,The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is a boutique hotel located in Mayfair the nearest underground being Green Park. We usually sway away from hotel restaurant but butlers restaurant is an exception; we dined for breakfast and were intrigued by their lunch and dinner a la carte menu which we decided to book and were not disappointed. They have a terrace bar with the traditional feel serving all the classic cocktails as well as innovative ones too. We enjoyed our 3 nights at this hotel and our only regret is not staying longer. All the restaurant staff and all the staff were kind to us and made our stay comfortable.,5,2019,06,05
105,Fabulous Stay,"We recently spent 4 nights at the charming Chesterfield Mayfair and we had a wonderful time. Our room was spotlessly clean with high quality linens and towels. Comfy beds and pillows and a powerful shower head. We really enjoyed the complimentary tea, coffee, and bottled water along with cookies in our room. Quiet neighborhood location but 2 minute walk to restaurants. The tube is 5 minutes away but we walked everywhere. Service was impeccable and seamless...so much so that we will seek out Red Carnation hotels in the future. Every single member of the staff we encountered couldn’t have been more helpful and professional. Thanks for a great vacation!",5,2019,06,04
105,A wonderful family reunion gathering for tea!,"We were in the solarium - all fourteen of us! Brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins from Atlanta, Georgia.  The service was personal, gracious, and prompt!
The food was amazing and the presentation exquisite!

Thank you so much for such a lovely family memory!
Warmly,
Amy Durham",5,2019,06,04
105,Par excellence,"We had a Superior King Room on the 4th floor and stayed for six nights. There was very little noise on our floor during our stay. Our booking included breakfast. Staff in all areas of the hotel were friendly, helpful and focussed on making our stay one to remember. We spent most nights in the Terrace Bar being entertained by John on the piano and his jazz band on Wednesday night. Great selection of meals at breakfast time. The Hotel is located a short walking distance from Green Park Underground and bus stops to take to you various locations in London.",5,2019,06,04
105,Top Notch,"The excellent service is what makes this place what it is.  Building is older but nicely remodeled.  Our room was small but well designed and adequate for modern electronics.  Great TV but nothing worth watching on the satellite channels (not the hotel's fault).  With help from the staff was able to hook up my Roku and use it.  The Wifi was great and allowed streaming.  

Racked my brain to come up with something negative.  The plumbing is not up to the standards of the remainder of the facility.  

Would be nice to have a quiet lounge.  They have a library but usually in use for meetings.",5,2019,06,03
105,Chesterfield Mayfield Brunch,"What a fantastic gem to find this afternoon tea brunch spot that serves candy! It started with a smoking mocktail - very unique and special touch.  Andrea was our server and he made the experience unforgettable. He was attentive, professional and made the family visiting London feel so welcome. If you have an opportunity to visit, it’s worth it and ask for Andrea!",5,2019,06,02
105,A hidden gem....the perfect getaway in London,"I have been staying at the Chesterfield for quite sometime and every time I go back, it is like visiting a second home and a second family. The hotel and its entire staff are always committed to their guests and visitors. I always receive the warmest welcome from Letitia and her team and upon seeing her, I know that I am getting one of my favourite rooms with all my bedding &F&B preferences being taken into account. As I mentioned it earlier, staying at the Chesterfield is like visiting friends and family.
Thank you Letitia for always looking after me.",5,2019,06,01
105,Like Home,"Great staff, great atmosphere, even better service. This hotel always delivers! 
I always feel super comfortable because of such warm and friendly staff and the clean decorated rooms  always make me feel welcomed <3 Thank you",4,2019,06,01
105,What an experience...,I stayed at The Chesterfield for two nights and had the most incredible experience ever. From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like royalty. Letitia on the front desk was the first person we met and what a brilliant character. The restaurant was exceptional and we loved every minute. Can't wait to come back!!,5,2019,05,31
105,The Perfect Weekend,"Had a good weekend, went to see a show nearby and the hotel was walking distance from it (Hamilton) excellent facilities, nice atmosphere and pleasant food all round. It made for a very good weekend. Stayed there in the month of May.",5,2019,05,31
105,A good time,"Old style design with a modern twist. They offered us s newly refurbished room which was on the 5th floor. Close to many places for good shopping, I really had a good time
 I'd recommend this place to everyone",5,2019,05,31
105,A great stay,"I stayed for 3 nights with my partner, and I’m so happy that we chose the Chesterfield. Upon arrival we were checked in by Charlotte, who then continued to recognise and welcome us whenever we walked through the reception. We spent an evening in Butlers restaurant, which was a great deicision. The next night we ventured out for dinner and visited Shepard’s market (suggested by Paulo, the concierge) and I must say this was a definite hidden gem! 

We will definitely be back to the Chesterfield, and cannot wait.",5,2019,05,31
105,Another great stay ,"Lovely couple of days at the Chesterfield this May. Location super convenient, enjoyed the great breakfast and room was full of character and comfort. Staff Friendly warm and welcoming as ever. Will be back! ",5,2019,05,31
105,Perfect hotel,Stayed with colleagues for a conference which was held at another hotel in the area. The hotel where the conference was held was a 5 star hotel and this was a 4 star hotel. We much preferred the service we received at the Chesterfield! The front desk team - nothing was too much trouble. They were all efficient and friendly. We hope to have our conference at this hotel instead next time!,5,2019,05,31
105,Great And Excellent Hospitality,Second time back as we were going to watch the cricket. Great sheets and powerful shower. Amazing feels just like home now. Lastly beautiful and lovely staff who were courteous and granted an hour delay on checkout time.,5,2019,05,31
105,A perfect bank holiday,"This was the second time I've stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair with my partner. Once again my stay was beyond words the staff here give you exceptional customer service! I have travels to various country's and ive stayed in various hotels, but I have NEVER had the pleasure of experiencing such an attentive, polite, thoughtful and friendly team of people. The hotel is beautiful and the Staff have reached the pinnacle of customer service.

 I would like to give a special thanks Miss Letitia for making my stay special and the bartender Mr James for his excellent service. These are two people I will never forget. I was blown away once again by the room services staff and perfect food what more could I ask for! This hotel exceeds exspections every time. I will be staying here again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of booking a hotel in London,  look no further as a londoner that has stayed in many hotels in my city I can assure you The Chesterfield Mayfair is the best. ",5,2019,05,30
105,Beautiful Memories Made,"We stayed for my daughters 18th birthday and had two rooms booked. As soon as we checked in they knew who we were ?! Not sure how but it really created that moment, the staff signed a card which was delivered along with a cupcake to wish my daughter a happy birthday. When we had breakfast the next day even the dining room staff recognised my daughters birthday. A really special place that I would not hesitate to recommend.",5,2019,05,30
105,Diana,Our room was miraculously ready at 10.00 am when we checked in! We were not expecting this as we know this is a popular hotel. Thank you to the housekeeping team for being so efficient! Our room was spotless with comfortable high thread count sheets and fluffy bath robes. We ate in the restaurant the first night and enjoyed the hay smoked chicken as well as the Dover sole which is their specialty. Overall superb - this is our new favourite hotel,5,2019,05,30
105,Beautiful Stay,"Stayed for a wedding we were attending next door at Dartmouth house. We had a few rooms booked and requested for dresses and suits to be steamed for the wedding the next day. This was done and garments delivered back to respectful rooms well in advance. The staff seemed genuinely interested in our plans and that was nice, made it feel like genuine hospitality. They took great care of all of us",5,2019,05,30
105,Awesome Experience,"The staff were very welcoming and we were lucky to stay on a Wednesday for Gin and jazz night. The front desk staff told us about this and suggested we book a table, instead of going out with our friends they met us in the hotel and we spent the night enjoying gin and jazz instead! The breakfast the morning was also a delight and was delivered to our room by a delightful lady for Portugal - this was delivered with no tray charged. We stored our bags for the day with joe who remembered us from last time",5,2019,05,30
105,The Charming Chesterfield,Oh my mother and I loved our stay! We typically look for a hotel with a pool and spa facilities but we could not resist the charm of this hotel: all decked out with English paintings in the hallways and traditional rooms. We booked an executive suite and the concierge arranged for someone to come and give us a massage in the comfort of our suite which was just charged to the bill. Bar was upscale and so was the restaurant. Concierge helped by booking us into top restaurants in the area - all walking distance. We shopped on new Bond Street and when we came to drop off shopping bags joe welcomed us back by name and simply took them to our room while we ran out to get more. This is our new fav,5,2019,05,30
105,Amazing ,I returned from Canada and this time with my partner and son. It was his first time being in London and he was welcomed with a milkshake voucher as well as miniature robes in the room! One evening my partner was unwell and we all stayed in our robes ordering food from the menu: it was perfect. We escaped a few hours to have our room cleaned and the floor supervisor even asked us how we were feeling when we returned - wow! I will hopefully return in October for a trip with a few friends just currently working out logistics but can not wait!,5,2019,05,30
105,Best service in the best location!,"I adore staying at the Chesterfield whenever I’m in London. The staff go above and beyond with every request. It feels like coming home to family and every interaction is genuine and warm.

105,A personal service with a smile.,"What a hidden gem of a hotel the Chesterfield Mayfair is ,just a 5-10 minute walk from park lane & piccadilly 
This small luxury hotel takes you back in time to the days when making the guests feel special & were nothing is too much trouble to make you happy & comfortable, I arrived very early in the morning so expected my room not to be ready till after lunch but the proactive reception team had put a room on priority for me so I could freshen up & have my suit pressed before my meeting at 1pm ,the Concierge provided me with a jogging map so I could navigate hyde park more efficiently on my tight schedule & a bottle of still water & a towel was provided on my return from my run.all of the staff of the Chesterfield are very attentive to guests needs & seem to have a solution for every problem that might arise which exceeded my expectations of any hotel I have stayed in before well done.",5,2019,05,30
105,Amazing,What a wonderful oasis in the heart of Mayfair. Stayed for 3 nights for a city break with 3 other friends for a birthday: we had two rooms close together all furnished with everything we could ever need. One of the ladies had to work one of the days and was pleasantly surprised to see stationary equipped in the drawers. Booked two twin rooms allocated close together with breakfast. Booked directly with hotel for free breakfast and they matched the booking.com price without breakfast. Wonderful hotel,5,2019,05,30
105,The best in london ,It’s not my first time at The Chesterfield and definitely not my last. Stayed in one of their newer rooms on the 5th floor - very elegantly done. All staff were genuinely kind from the Italian doorman down to the chamber maids. I went to see a show: tickets obtained through concierge hassle free. As always such a wonderful stay. Thank you ,5,2019,05,29
105,Lovely,This hotel is superb located in the heart of Mayfair close to all you could ever need when visiting London. The hotel is small and has a superb dining room. The front desk staff all knew us by name and were a delight. Will return in the fall with the rest of the family,4,2019,05,29
105,Bank holiday weekend,"This past bank holiday weekend will now be the 4th time o have stayed at The Chesterfield! Honestly the consistent excellent customer service is unparalleled! 

The staff are sooo friendly and nothing is ever too much of an ask!

When arriving I explained I couldn’t get an appointment anywhere local for pedicure and 10 mins after arriving in my room, Miss Letitia, one of the managers had a mini pedicure set sent to my room with lovely nail polish! Just an example of how the staff really do go out of their way to help! My partner and I were also treated to a bottle of champagne! 

It definitely will not be my last time staying here.",5,2019,05,28
105,Luxury in Mayfair,"We enjoyed a wonderful lunch at the Chesterfield Mayfair and afterwards sat for a while on the leather couches in the foyer, extending our pleasure.  Not a hint of snootiness from any of the staff members.  We felt welcome, respected, safe and comfortable throughout our visit.  The bathroom facilities were a luxurious experience in themselves.  The whole environment was beautiful and I will recommend this hotel to everyone visiting London.  Even if you are only here for an hour or two, you will recall it as a highlight of your stay.  ",5,2019,05,27
105,Nice location- hotel with character,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for 3 nights. The hotel is well located in Mayfair and convenient to the Green Park tube station. It is walking distance to Bond Street and Picadilly so extremely handy. 
Rooms are very small (I was hoping for an upgrade (gold status) but it was not available)... Bedding is comfy; area is quiet...
Breakfast is tasty and staff is nice. It is not cheap but reasonable given the area it is in. Still rooms are so small that I would stay elsewhere next time.",4,2019,05,27
105,Friendly Traditional Hotel,"Loved our 2 day stay at the Chesterfield. Enjoyed I could walk almost everywhere, Knightbridge, Chelsea. Had the best cob salad ever in the bar. Our room was not ready in time so we got allocated another room, I was told the bed was a king size but it felt more than a small double but as it was very comfortable so it didnt seem to matter too much. The atmosphere of the Hotel is cosy, unpretentious and has the feel a traditional and luxurious hotel. Staff are very kind and ready to be of help with any odd request you might have, nothing is too much trouble. Will definitely recommend and cant wait to revisit.",5,2019,05,26
105,Quintessential British!,"Perfect location near restaurants, shopping, the Royal Parks, and best of all—the Tube. Our room was lovely, totally comfortable. The staff could not have been more responsive, helpful, and friendly. Every recommendation the Front Desk gave us was 'spot on.' A perfect visit.",5,2019,05,24
105,Enjoyed our visit,"Stayed for  2 nights using the ""old folks "" deal . Nice room (225)  ,a bit on the small side but adequate with nice bathroom . Luxury hotel in a very well heeled part of London with designer shops galore in easy walking distance in Bruton Street /Bond Street ,even shop for a Bentley at Berkeley Square . Breakfasts very good indeed . Used their restaurant on one night ,dover sole was very good but pricey @£50 with service charge .Recommended hotel in the best part of London ,but I guess at their  prices it should be",5,2019,05,24
105,Afternoon tea,"What a wonderful way to celebrate a 60th birthday with the best afternoon tea in London. Wonderful service with thoughtful touches, lovely friendly staff and a great ambience in the Garden Room. Adam Lake and his staff do an amazing job. ",5,2019,05,24
105,Warm welcome and excellent location,"Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and genuine smile. All the staff were excellent and we were made to feel comfortable throughout our stay. The room was well equipped and very clean - look out for the tea and coffee making facilities in a box in the wardrobe - we almost missed it!!
The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Close to Shepherds Market with plenty of places to eat, Green Park, Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,05,24
105,Attention to detail,"Wonderful hotel - highlights for me - decoration , staff so friendly , very comfortable and quiet room , ability to look after the small stuff. Definitely would stay again. 5 minutes walk to Green Park Station.",5,2019,05,24
105,Brilliant Afternoon Tea,A wonderful experience enjoying afternoon tea for the first time! The Chesterfield Mayfair offers an assortment of delicious teas and pastries. Andrea was amazing and went out of his way to help us celebrate our anniversary! I won't hesitate to return any time I am visiting London!,5,2019,05,21
105,Recommend!,"My husband and I stayed here for our wedding day, and I also got ready for the wedding with my bridesmaids in one of their suites. Our experience was stunning overall, and the hotel was exquisite to behold and to stay in. 

The staff were super helpful. We had a number of requests given the wedding preparations, and they delivered on every bit. They kindly hand-signed a congratulatory card which was deeply appreciated. When I forgot and left a few things behind, they kept it safe and re-delivered to me. 

I would stay here again in a heart beat and would recommend it to any future brides and grooms as well if getting married nearby!",5,2019,05,20
105,Hen afternoon tea,"Fabulous is the only way to describe this from the wonderful greeting at reception and the friendly bartenders, wonderful pre white wedding cocktails then in for a fantastic afternoon tea the good and drinks on offer was exceptional and the very attentive waiters Tony and Andrea made it extra special for the bride to be, they really could not do enough. We will back for sure and would without doubt recommend. Special thanks again to Tony and Andrea xx",5,2019,05,19
105,Lunch in london,Having stayed in the hotel before and finding it excellent a friend wanted to take me there for lunch. Must say from start (in the bar of course) to finish service was very professional but not over the top.  Food was very good. A question was asked could we have smoked salmon (sliced at the table) with scrambled eggs the answer “of course yes”. It really did feel like nothing was too much hassle. Basically a fantastic lunch ,5,2019,05,15
105,Another Wonderful Business Stay,"This was our 5th stay at the lovely Chesterfield, in London/Mayfair, and the second this year. We were back in London for a board meeting, involving my wife, so returned to this property, in November. The previous stay had been in April, also for this same board’s meeting. On our April stay, though it had been over 10 years, since we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, we were greeted like frequent guests. Well, it had now only been seven months, but again, one would have thought that we had returned after only about a week. Everyone treated us, as if we were family members, coming for a holiday feast. This is service at the upper levels, and extended throughout the entire hotel, to the restaurant, to the bar, to the doormen, to housekeeping – everyone was excellent, and that is what we enjoy about this hotel. When we first encountered The Chesterfield Mayfair, a board member had mentioned it, as his corporation put visiting VIP’s up there. On a stroll around Mayfair, we stopped in, and asked for general information. The GM stopped what he was doing, and led us on a tour, and invited us to basically take free rein, and ask any questions of him, or his staff. It was on our next trip, that we booked the hotel, and returned until we got a flat, a few blocks away, for about 4 years (8 visits).

The hotel is historic, and is actually several buildings combined. Though the buildings are quite old, the interior furnishings of the hotel, its restaurant and its bar, are not. The general décor appears to be Victorian, but everything is newer – much newer. The common spaces have the feeling of a “gentlemen’s club,” with lots of wood, and more formal furniture, and there are “hunting” elements everywhere. So let’s say a gentlemen’s country hunting lodge. Now, and with that said, it is very comfortable, and in all respects. In general, the lighting is subdued, but with enough well-placed lighting instruments to create specific pools of light. I would typify it as elegant, understated and very warm and inviting. The Chesterfield, part of the Red Carnation Group, is a quaint, classic, intimate and charming hotel. It is small, and that is a large part of its charm. Maybe it would be fair to call The Chesterfield Mayfair, a “luxury boutique hotel?”

Once more, we had booked the same suite class, and were, once again, assigned to the Duchess Suite, 429. This suite is in an adjoining building, and attached to the main structure. As with many older, and historic inns in London, The Chesterfield has expanded over time, and adjacent buildings have been incorporated. Such was Suite 429. While we were on the 4th floor, we were in part of that adjacent building, and, as it turned out, about 4 steps lower, than where the lifts (elevators) put us out, on the “4th Floor.” No issues, but a slight elevational change in the connecting hallway. Oh, and the lift is small, but 4 people, without luggage, can easily fit. Throw in our week’s worth of luggage, with other destinations on either end of the London trip, and only 2 people could fit with our load.

The Duchess suite is basically three rooms: an ample bedroom, with a comfortable King, a large bathroom with a very small walk-in shower (my wife has artificial hips, so a major plus), and then a living room, and the hallway, including the entrance. All aspects of this room were great, and very, very comfortable. We felt as though we were “back home again.” Even though I had made the offer to take another suite, the answer was a question, “Did you find the Duchess Suite to be to your liking last time?” Of course my answer was yes, so to the Duchess Suite we went.

Our bathroom had a full compliment of bath amenities, in the Elemis line, and we had lovely, fluffy towels, plus a very effective towel warmer. We had great hot water, and very good water pressure, at all hours of the day. One caveat: the shower is small, and at 6' and 200 lbs, I would accidently brush against the faucet to change the water temp – going in either direction, that got my attention a few times. Maybe if I hadn’t eaten so well in London, I would not have had such issues?

We had a lovely welcome fruit basket upon arrival, along with a lovely floral arrangement. We had a decanter of Sherry w/ two goblets, and then a “Farewell” chocolate plate, on the day of departure. During the stay, there were nightly “gifts” from the restaurant of candies and pastries too.

We had learned on the previous stay, that the floor creaked, and especially at the entrance, and the entrance to the bedroom. We had pretty much mapped out where to walk, in case there was a room just below us. However, during both stays, we heard absolutely no noise from the rooms above us, and hope that can be said for those on the third floor, below the Duchess Suite.

Our suite overlooked Charles St, and being on the 4th floor, we did not have what I would call a “view.” Still, that was not an issue. On our previous stay in the Duchess Suite, street noise from exotic cars, being driven too fast through Mayfair, had been a bit of an issue. Even with the double windows (more for thermal insulation, I would guess), the noise continued too late into the evening. During this stay, we barely heard a sound from Charles St. Maybe the Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Aston Martins had all gone down to Monaco? Very quiet this time.

We dined at Butler’s, on-property, for several breakfasts, and then once for dinner. As we had booked through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts, we had a dining and beverage credit, but with my penchant for fine wines, probably devastated that allowance on the first evening. We visited the bar, plus the Afternoon Tea room, on several occasions. Once more, the bar staff seemed to be keeping tabs on our desired wines, and frequently as we were being seated, those would appear – a very nice personal touch. On the April visit, I had gotten a tour of the meeting rooms, and my wife took my advice to host her board meeting at The Chesterfield Mayfair. She, and her board were very pleased. All such spaces were lovely, accommodating, and attractive, having the feel of a very nice “country club,” or maybe a “city club?” My wife held two much smaller meetings in the Library, which functioned well for her.

For both pickup from LHR, and then the return (due to a very early flight out of LHR, we moved to the LHR Hilton T4) to the airport, The Chesterfield arranged for a driver with a lovely black Mercedes S-Class, who was friendly, and efficient. A perfect service.

We love the location, right in the heart of Mayfair, and on what are *usually* two very quiet streets: Charles and Queen Streets. One is so very close to so very much, from Hyde and Green Parks, to Shepherd Market, to Picadilly and Park Lane, and Oxford and Regent Streets are just a few blocks away. One has extensive dining options, and almost across the full spectrum, with Michel-starred restaurants, to Pret a Manger. The Green Park and Marble Arch Tube stations are within blocks, and then there are major bus stops, a couple of blocks away on Park Lane. For us, the location could not be more ideal.

We will very likely be back at The Chesterfield Mayfair, for the same board’s meeting, and again in November – we missed London in April/May, as my wife brought her UK board to the USA for that meeting. Just a beautiful, intimate small hotel, with so very many amenities.",5,2019,05,13
105,Superb service,"My wife and I were in London for 4 days in May. It has been more than 10 years since I stayed at the Chesterfield, but it was like coming home. Very little had changed, and all  for the better. The rooms were very small, but well appointed. The services at the hotel were very good. The food in the restaurant was exquisite!",5,2019,05,13
105,The Sweetest Afternoon Tea,Absolutely amazing Original Sweet Shop Afternoon Tea.  Amazing experience with very attentive staff.  a big high five to Andreas who was our waiter who welcomed us and looked after us.  We had such a laugh.  Thank you Andreas.  Would highly recommend. Great value for money,5,2019,05,11
105,Charming Chesterfield Mayfair,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair the end of February 2019.  The hotel offers the charm of London!  The staff is extremely friendly and engaging.  The hotel is conveniently located a short walk from the Green Park Underground, and just behind the high traffic of Mayfair.  Whether business or pleasure the Chesterfield is a perfect stay for your London travels.",5,2019,05,10
105,Great location and superb staff,"I picked this hotel because of location and because the red carnation hotel group is always reliable for service and food. There may be some things that need attending to but the staff always responds. I always leave feeling paid attention to and cared for even when I am traveling alone.
This trip was to celebrate a friend’s birthday. It is difficult in London to find two separate beds for two women traveling. The Chesterfield has a room with two beds. That being said our first night was somewhat challenging. The light came around the beautiful drapes. The mattress was less than comfortable and the cold water did not work for our first evening. I could easily have moved to a private club nearby but decided to try staying.
I stayed primarily because of the general manager and staff. They upgraded my room allowing me to have privacy , black put drapes and a small shower in a much larger room. Thank you because this saved my trip as my friend has different habits than I do : allowing me to sleep. 
I also need to mention that the rate was good here for London. The breakfast is included and excellent and the location is central if you are going to theatre or sightseeing.The tube stop is four blocks away and you are one block off Berkeley Square in Mayfair. 
The bar is warm and friendly. The food is delicious and the bartender has a lot of fun getting you to try the specialty drinks. 
There is a tea room which we didn’t try. There is coffee in the lobby along with apples. We emptied the bar in our room so we could store treats from Ottolenghi and Sketch as well as cheese from Burrough Market.
This is a four star hotel with five star service. They will do everything to accommodate you and take care of you during your stay. The decor is London Club with a bar, a beautiful library and a tearoom as well as a restaurant.
We ended up on the first floor which turned out to be better than I thought because the elevator is small so you have the option of the stairs if you are in a hurry.
Thank you again to the general manager who embodied service with a smile. You truly saved the day and it was much appreciated. My friend had a wonderful birthday and said “she so appreciated being taken care of for our entire stay.” 
Thank you and I will recommend you to friends who are considering price, service and location.",5,2019,05,09
105,Backpacker,"Our recent stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel was outstanding! Breakfast was exceptional and with excellent service. Concierge service was also outstanding with suggestions for dining, sightseeing, and arranging tickets for events.",5,2019,05,09
105,Charming!,"My daughter and I visited London for the first time in April and stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 nights.  This charming hotel is in an excellent location, close to St. James's Park, Hyde Park, and Buckingham Palace.  The staff at Chesterfield was friendly and always eager to be of assistance in any way.  The room was lovely and serviced well.  Breakfast was amazing with a full buffet and/or a full English breakfast from the menu.  Quite a treat!",5,2019,05,08
105,Excellent service with charming ambiance.,"My daughter and I had a 2 day stopover in London, and chose The Chesterfield for it's excellent location.   It does have an excellent location, but it is one of those hotels that really makes you want to stay longer.     The service was excellent from everyone---our check-in was nice and easy, the doormen and porters were always quick to anticipate our needs and our room was always immaculately clean.    We especially enjoyed coming back after the theater to find small treats on our pillows and the bedside lights on.    We were sorry we only had 2 days there, but we will definitely be back!",5,2019,05,06
105,Afternoon tea,"Visted the Chesterfield mayfair, for afternoon tea with my husband and 2 children. The staff were absolutely amazing friendly and on hand. We had a great enjoyable and memorable day thank you so much.",5,2019,05,04
105,Fantastic afternoon tea experience,"My fiancé and I regularly enjoy afternoon tea across London (Claridge's, Dorchester, the Rosewood, Landmark etc etc etc). A couple of relatives were visiting from up North and we wanted to take them out. We were looking for a more reasonably priced tea to suit their budget but also something good quality and fun. We didn't know of the Chesterfield prior to our visit, but I am pleased to say we had a truly fantastic experience from start to finish and would recommend to others. We enjoyed a nice quiet table, very good selection of teas (including more than one white tea option - much to my delight!) and very attentive staff. All of the sandwiches were delicious. Two of us do not eat red meat and the staff were perfectly happy to substitute ham sandwiches for an additional one of the other sandwiches of our choice. The sweets were tasty, attractive and varied - as well as absolutely spot on with the flavours they were meant to be! Very sweet of course, but what do you expect with the theme?! We were offered as many refills of food and drinks as we could handle and were allowed to take away unfinished food - very generous. My fiancé was even presented with a celebration plate, as we were celebrating his 30th birthday; a lovely touch indeed. I cannot remember all of the staff's names (apart from Andréa), but they were all wonderful - particularly the manager - and really made it a lovely afternoon for us. The visiting relatives still can't stop raving about what an amazing time they had. You also get a bag of sweets to take away from the sweetie cart, and a token for the gumball vending machine. This gave us 25% off our next afternoon tea, which we definitely intend to redeem! Thank you so much to everyone at the Chesterfield for a very special afternoon tea!!",5,2019,05,04
105,Amazing afternoon tea!,"Me and my friend visited the Original Sweetshop afternoon tea yesterday. We were so excited to try a traditional high tea and the Chesterfield just reached our expectations. All the staff, from the smiley hostess, Roberta, our fabulous  waiter, Jamie and the real Candy man Rafcar were amazing. The food is splendid, the atmosphere takes you back to your childhood with all the sweets, delicious sandwiches, amazing pastries. Thank you for an unforgettable experience to all the staff who made our afternoon so memorable. We highly recommend this tea to everyone, who wants a lifetime experience!",5,2019,04,30
105,Outstanding ,"We are on a pre-cruise visit to London that was arranged by KMX GLOBAL TRAVEL.  The Chterfield Mayfair is an outstanding facility from the staff that greets you, the Hotel and beautiful rooms, to the Butlers restuarant.  We could not have been more pleased.",5,2019,04,30
105,Heart of OLD London,"Wonderful small hotel-service-food -location the best. Stayed April 3-6th this year and will return with pleasure. Having been in the travel business for over 40 yrs you get to know what is the real experience and essence of where you want to be.England of  the ""old  school""  at it.s best.",5,2019,04,29
105,Outstanding,The Chesterfield is an oasis in the middle of Mayfair. The restaurant boasts fantastic Dover sole which they like to say is the best In london and I agree. The rooms are decked out in padded walls with individual designs and the staff are kind. We booked an advance purchase rate and paid a little more on check in for a larger room which was great. We will return with our parents in the summer,5,2019,04,28
105,Fantastic hotel,"What a fantastic hotel with beautiful furnishings from the lobby to the bedrooms. I was very impressed with the friendliness of everyone there. We were treated like royalty and offered everything we needed. The service is perfect without being too intrusive, the hotel is part of a collection called Red Carnation and I cannot wait to discover their other properties.",5,2019,04,28
105,Ammasing Hotel,"It was my birthday treat and my partner brought me to the Chesterfield as a complete surprise. The staff seemed to be in on the surprise as we were led up to a beautiful suite decorated with balloons, cupcakes, a present from my partner and a card signed by all the staff. We stayed in A luxurious suite with a four poster bed and had breakfast delivered to our room. The front desk did an excellent job along with my partner. This was a birthday celebration I will never forget",5,2019,04,28
105,"Fabulous hotels, excellent service","My favourite hotel In london. We returned after staying three years ago and the same people who worked there then were still there AND they remembered us! This hotel is in a very good area for the theatre, Michelin star restaurants, shopping and all the major parks of london. Joseph on concierge was very polite and helped us each morning; remembering us by name, another gentleman joe was also very friendly and they guided us to restaurants and places we were visiting each and everyday. When it was time to go it felt like saying goodbye to close friends. See you all again",5,2019,04,27
105,Wonderful and friendly front office staff and lovely stay .,This hotel is in the heart of Mayfair close to all the best restaurants. The front office staff are both funny but professional. We had a laugh each day we came in and talked about our day. I would like to recommend this hotel for anyone looking for down to earth luxury.,5,2019,04,27
105,Relaxing short break,"We stayed for 2 nights with my partner for the first time since having a baby, we told the hotel this and they surprised us with a romantic turndown and drink vouchers for two. We felt so relaxed and almost wished we had more time in the hotel to be completely looked after. We enjoyed the afternoon tea which is themed and this was delicious and great ambiance with the live music. The reception and concierge staff were wonderful, thank you Charlotte on reception for the extra attention.",5,2019,04,27
105,Very nice stay,My husband and I recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel for three nights.  The hotel is very charming and the service is excellent.  It is located in a very nice area.

The Chesterfield Mayfair is filled with kind hearted staff who are well trained to provide excellent hospitality. It’s important to provide extra care to retain customers especially in London with many competitive properties. We will return",5,2019,04,27
105,Beautiful junior suite,We enjoyed an 8 night stay in a junior suite which was beautifully decorated and cleaned daily. The team knew we liked our room cleaned early as we ate breakfast which was appreciated. We received canapés as well as a daily gift on our pillow. This is less expensive compared to all the other 5 stars in Mayfair and of very high quality. Thank you CH team,5,2019,04,27
105,Amazing,This hotel was fantastic. Thank you to everyone who welcomed me when we arrived tired after a long flight. We had a room on the 5th floor that was beautifully decorated. Thank you to Joseph who was particularly gwelcoming. 5 stars from me!,5,2019,04,27

Beautiful hotel, Impeccable service and amazing cocktails.
Barman Adrian looked after us, and recommended some wonderful drinks!
Would definitely go again!!",5,2019,04,25
105,Wonderful Staff!,"The staff at this hotel is top notch! They are very friendly and professional. The purpose of our trip was for my husband's birthday. With turn-down service, the staff put a birthday card, cupcake, and wine in our room. It was so thoughtful!

105,Home Away from Home,"This is our third stay at this fabulous property in the past 11 months, each stay being at least a week.  Yet again, the customer service sets this property apart from the rest.  The staff members make you feel l family, as if they have been waiting all day just for you to arrive.This is true not just upon check in, but each and every time you leave the property to go about your day.  Our room wasn't ready upon check in, so our drinks in the bar area were comped.That is literally the only hiccup in our stay.  Karolyis, the concierge, made our reservations at Acqua Shard and got us theater tickets in under 5 minutes.  He was so friendly and accommodating we wished we could've taken him with us!  The lovely Victoria in the bar made sure our drinks were perfect each time and saw to our comfort.  Letitia, the guest relations agent, is warm and accommodating, always greeting with a cheerful smile.  From our welcome fruit, to our farewell cupcake, to our chocolate strawberries, no gesture was unnoticed.  The room was clean, the toiletries beyond the expected, and turndown service left a little surprise on our pillow each night.  The complimentary coffee and croissants each morning were fresh and delicious, as were apples in the lobby.  The fish an chips, club sandwich, and cous cous were delectable.  In all honesty, its hard to leave this wonderful hotel in the day...everything you need is right there.  The property is a short walk to the local tube stop and a taxi is available literally in 1 minute, if you need it.  There is no other place for us to stay when we visit London.  It is our home away from home.",5,2019,04,21
105,Wonderful Holiday.,Wonderful location to be able to get around London. Staff was plentiful and very attentive your needs. Room was comfortable with heat and cool air easily adjustable. Bar staff was fantastic. Dining room staff fantastic as well. The doorman and cheek in staff also exceptional.,5,2019,04,21
105,Special few days in London,"This was a return stay with the Chesterfield.  The hotel is relatively small for London. The location is a 10 minute walk from Green Park and shopping areas such as Old Bond Street.  The front door staff are always very helpful as are reception.  Our rooms were a good size and very comfortable.

We had bar snacks on our first night.  There was a Jazz band playing and was very entertaining. We returned to the bar after our days out on the other days.  It was very cosy and comfortable.

Breakfast is excellent with a great range to choose from.  The restaurant staff were very attentive but not intrusive.

I would thoroughly recommend the Chesterfield.",5,2019,04,20
105,Hospitality at its best ,"I stayed at the Chesterfield as my son was getting results after under going hospital treatment. On knowing of this the hotel went way and beyond with arrangements made for us to watch the football in the room as it was on a different channel from the channels on the room tv . I have stayed in various Red Carnation hotels throughout London and SA they definitely know how to look after their guests.
A big thank you to all ",5,2019,04,20
105,Delightful Afternoon Tea,The afternoon tea at the chesterfield is absolutely the best in London. The cakes and sandwiches were presented so well by Fiachra who explained each one in detail and made them sound even more delicious! It was a great treat for me and my daughter and I hope I can come back again.,5,2019,04,18
105,Hotel was fabulous but....,"The hotel is in a great location. The rooms are superior. The staff at the front desk and at the door were outstanding. The restaurant where we ate breakfast every morning was excellent. We did have one unfortunate experience with one of the staff members who worked at the bar. One evening, we visited the hotel bar. My Mother wanted a dessert. Nothing on the menu was particularly intriguing so she asked the waiter if she could have a brownie. My sister and I started laughing at my mom's silly request. The waiter who was not English did not understand. I think he thought we were laughing at him and apologized and left our table. We had to flag down another person to bring us the check. Two nights later, my sister and I went to the bar again for a drink. This time without our mother. The same waiter ignored us while he waited on everyone else. Finally, after I flagged him down,  he took our drink order and returned with the drinks. He did not give us the complimentary bar snacks (pretzels, olives, and nuts) that everyone else was enjoying until I asked for them. He literally slammed down a ""used"" plate of snacks. No nuts (crumbs in the nut bowl). My sister noticed a gnawed on olive-it literally had teeth marks in it. I observed the waiter kindly and attentively waiting on everyone else in the room (it was not crowded). In particular, a young woman sitting next to us ordered tea and biscuits. He brought her several plates of biscuits and asked how she was doing while he ignored my sister and me. The woman was on her laptop and even seemed annoyed that he was being overly attentive. It was fairly obvious that he held a grudge from the misunderstanding from the other night. I have never witnessed this kind of behavior. I know that because English is not his first language, he may have misunderstood us, but nevertheless, his subsequent behavior was very obviously vengeful and unprofessional. Other than my mom's ""joke"" we were very kind and patient with the him on both occasions. We said please and thank you. He clearly had his knickers in a twist! So, if you visit the bar at the Chesterfield, don't ask for a brownie and by all means, do not laugh about it.",4,2019,04,17
105,"Charming, Caring, exCellent Chesterfield!!","Just stayed at The Chesterfield yet again for a couple of nights whilst enjoying A trip to ~London. We have stayed here on many occasions - and as again - the hotel does not let its customers down!! Brilliantly central, very clean, well appointed, and really one of the best places to stay. From the moment you check in - nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. It has real charm. The breakfast is cooked to order - and very good. But it is the staff that make this place so lovely. They have absolutely 'cracked it' as far as customer service is concerned. On leaving the hotel and getting about a third of the way across London to catch a train, I realised that I had left our door key in the safe in the room..... The young man in the reception couldn't have been more helpful when 'this mad woman' charged through the door like a lunatic announcing that she needed to get back into the room.... He remained calm cool and collected and moved very quickly to get me back into the room so that I could grab the key and run out of the hotel - equally  like a lunatic!! I think I said ""THANK YOU"" to him but if I didn't then - THANK YOU now!!! The staff are brilliant - the bar is great, the food is top drawer and the service wonderful. We are booked to return in early June and bring my niece and her husband with us as a treat  for them - and we know that they will be as impressed as we are. Thank you so very much. All the staff can be justifiably of themselves!!",5,2019,04,15
105,Afternoon Tea,The original sweetshop afternoon tea was amazing! Andrea was such an amazing waiter and is a credit to your team!! We really enjoyed our time at the chesterfield hotel!  Thank you Andrea! :) you were great!,5,2019,04,13
105,‘ Lovely Stay’,"We had 3 rooms here for an overnight in London, I had stayed here about 10 years ago. Check in straightforward and friendly, had a drink in the bar to meet our friends, staff very attentive, room was a little small but well appointed and comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble, we were out for dinner but made it back to the bar for a late drink, busy but again really attentive. Breakfast was excellent. Great location in Mayfair, I will stay again when in London. Compared to similar hotels I thought it was great value.",4,2019,04,13
105,Lovely afternoon tea.,"Visited with my husband and 2 young children for the Sweetshop Afternoon Tea. The staff were friendly and very attentive. Maurizia and her colleagues did a great job! Great relaxed atmosphere for the children too (unusual for afternoon tea venues in London). Food was fresh and tasty. Tea selection was excellent. A quirky take on a traditional afternoon tea which made it far more interesting.  Overall, a lovely experience. The children were given their own activity packs and we all left with a lovely selection of sweets from the candy cart. Well done!",5,2019,04,13
105,Great London boutique hotel,"This boutique hotel (75 rooms) in the heart of Mayfair is a real find. Kind of a classic style but not like the large and impersonal hotels. Close to everything. Room was very nice. The service was excellent, everyone going out of their way to help. This is now my go-to hotel in London. ",5,2019,04,12
105,Afternoon tea,"A really lovely afternoon tea, food was lovely and really presented well and a lovely little extra treat at the end with a bag of sweets from the sweat cart. The staff were all lovely and polite and nothing was too much trouble would definitely recommend it.",5,2019,04,11
105,Mother and daughters Afternoon tea treat.,"A delicious afternoon tea in beautiful surroundings. The staff were attentive and friendly. We weren't rushed so it really was a pleasant, relaxing afternoon. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon tea at The Chesterfield Hotel.",5,2019,04,11
105,Perfect location!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for several days while visiting London for the first time.  The location is absolutely perfect.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  We had no view from our room, but it did not matter.  We were up first thing in the morning and explored the city all day.  We were cozy and comfortable and slept very well.  I don't think I will even bother looking for other accommodations when we return next.  We found our London home-away-from-home.",5,2019,04,10
105,Fantastic!,"My wife and myself stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair last year and absolutely loved it, so much so, that we returned in March. The staff are so friendly and attentive, everything is spotlessly clean. We had breakfast and an evening meal and the food is excellent.
Our room was excellent, particularly the bed and pillows which were so comfortable.
The hotel is also in an excellent location.
We had a fantastic 2 night stay and would recommend to anybody, will definitely be returning!",5,2019,04,09
105,Classic!,"Classic London hotel room, I booked a standard room with breakfast option.  Perfect way to start the day before you head out to discover the town.  Great location, walking distance to all the local sites.  Lounge and restaurant have great food and good service.  Front desk staff are polished and professional.",5,2019,04,08
105,Our Special Place,"Visited again to celebrate my 70th birthday because it is my favourite hotel in London and we know we will be welcomed and treated like old friends. We were even given our favourite room. A special place that continues its excellent standards and exudes class and quality. The location cannot be beaten for ease of access to everywhere. For those who want an English experience at its best this is the hotel for you, and dont skip breakfast, it is the perfect way to start a day in London.
Thank you once again to all the staff at the hotel, and for my birthday treats.....we will be back soon.",5,2019,04,06
105,Getaway to London Experience,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair earlier this week. We arrived on the Sunday and stayed for two nights and the experience was speechless. Everything from being greeted at the door to the room and the facilities were top class and so relaxing. We stayed in the 'Music Room' which was designed to great detail and the Room was not only clean but the facilities available on hand were excellent. We ordered room service for our breakfast which was delivered with a friendly face and the food was not only still hot and fresh but very tasty and set us up for our day perfectly. As it was a special occasion we were surprised by a birthday card from the hotel staff, a personal greeting card from the general manager (Adam? i believe) and a complimentary bottle of champagne to celebrate! I have to give a special mention to Letitia, the guest relations manager, who made our weekend stress free with her friendly and approachable enthusiasm towards any of our requests and queries. 
I would definitely recommend the Chesterfield and we are already planning our next trip back. Thank you for making our excursion that extra bit special!",5,2019,04,05
105,A great hotel,"I have stayed at different places in London but had always wanted to stay at the Chesterfield. My wife and I spent one night there and thought it was wonderful. We were shown into a  very nice room and were most comfortable. We had a very good dinner  although the Dover  sole, which they suggest is the best in London, was a little bland. It was, however, deboned with great expertise. Breakfast offered a great variety and was delicious.From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were impressed by the staff- efficient and friendly and, above all, most helpful. Highly recommended. TonyC Hiltong",4,2019,04,05
105,Birthday weekend getaway in London ,"My boyfriend and I visited The Chesterfield Mayfair and we are still speechless after the experience we had. The room, the service, the attention to detail we were treated like superstars. We were placed in the music room which suited both our interests really well. Special mention should be made to Letitia the guest relations manager who made sure we had everything we needed. She was always smiling and kind ensuring we were well looked after for the two nights we were there. we had breakfast ordered to our room, it was fresh and exactly what we wanted each morning. The staff are very professional and always ready to lend a helping hand. Not only would I recommend this hotel we will definitely be back again. Thank you for making our stay one we will never forget. ",5,2019,04,03
105,"Good location,  comfy bed","Recently stayed for three nights with my husband. Hotel is very well located, close to tube and a lot of the main London sights. Our room was spacious and the large bed was very comfortable with high quality linen. Aircon meant temperature in room was spot on. Bathroom was a bit on the smaller side and shower is in the bath. The bathrooms could definitely do with some updating but the shower itself was powerful and nice fluffy robes were provided. 

The lady on reception at checkout (Leticia) was particularly friendly. Bar is quite expensive, although expected given location. We had room only rate and ate breakfast out during our stay so can't comment on that. 

Overall, good quality hotel and location is hard to beat for a sight-seeing city break. ",4,2019,03,31
105,Sweets afternoon tea,"I don’t normally write reviews but I felt I need to on this occasion. Today being Mother’s Day I was treated to afternoon tea by my daughter, who also came along with my 5 year old grandson to the chesterfield London.The food was wonderful, fresh and plentiful. The staff were attentive, polite and friendly, really good with my grandson too. I highly recommend you visit for an afternoon tea, I hope someone will take me back one day. Well done all",5,2019,03,31
105,Amazing,"This was our first time to the U.K.  We took private transportation (see my review for London-Transfers) and our driver told us that we were staying at 'Ritzy Place. Compared to other resorts (like Disney Hotel) the price was not high and it included a full (hot menu items and breakfast bar), nightly treats/tea/ bottled water in our room and it was worth every penny. The service was excellent and everyone was helpful with anything we needed. The bar was a great place for a drink in the evening. The girls enjoyed the afternoon tea-although this was one thing that seemed overpriced. But who can pass up afternoon tea, in a cute tea-room with candy, sweets and tea? We enjoyed the location- 2 blocks from train station and close to restaurants, shops and Buckingham Palace. We hired a private guide (toursbylocals.com)- Dawn and she was worth EVERY penny, so email me for details on that if you want more information. My husband and I had a junior suite and our 2 daughters (13&15) had an adjoining standard room. Very small, but luxious. We didn't spend much time there so room size was not an issue. Do note that they do not have true 'connecting rooms' but we actually preferred the set up of the adjoining rooms better and so did our teenage children. Essentially they are side by side. However, you have a single entrance from the hallway (so it looks like you are entering one room) that takes you into an inside small private area with 2 individual doors to each room. It was perfect. ",5,2019,03,31
105,The perfect stay in the quintessential Mayfair hotel,"A bold statement but it was for us. Adam and his team made our weekend here at this outstanding hotel very, very special after I told them that I was going to propose to my partner. I had booked the romantic package and had emailed Matthew my plans for the day. From there the team just made everything work beautifully. The welcome was very warm and the room was exceptional. I was bowled over and thanked Ivana on reception. When we got back from sightseeing and saw the room with all the rose petals, champagne and glasses (part of the romantic experience) with Adam’s note is was just the perfect to a very special day - I just smiled stupidly at the  awesome result. The location is excellent, right in the heart of Mayfair close to everything you’d expect and the hotel has masses of charm and opulence. Thank you again Adam and your team. And my partner said ‘yes’!",5,2019,03,31
105,The Terrace Bar at The Chesterfield Mayfair,"My wife and I often stay at this first-class hotel whenever we visit London - the location is ideal, the staff are outstanding, the service warm and friendly and the rooms very comfortable. The Terrace Bar is one of our most favourite, and we know London hotels well.
Not only does The Terrace Bar have an impressive selection of cocktails, wines etc. but we are always pleasantly surprised by the generous and delicious snacks served.  Apart from large green olives, cashew nuts and tasty nibbles that are replenished when necessary, from time to time complimentary canapes are served - a far higher standard of amenity than some of the five-star venues offer. From 6.0pm there is live music, sometimes a pianist and at the moment a four piece jazz quartet. We enjoy the club style of the bar, the attentive service and have found it ideal for both business drinks as well as just relaxing after a busy day in town.",5,2019,03,30
105,5 Stars Servive,"We usually stay at the Mayfair Hotel but wanted something a bit more traditional keeping the same great area of Mayfair which has everything you could ever want. We booked a suite on a promotion directly with the hotel which included breakfast and nightly canapés. We stayed in  the jungle suite which was suave and just what we were looking for; luxury with a bit of quirk. We received lovely daily gifts on our pillow; one of them being a handmade candle. With all the competition for hotels in london you won’t go wrong if you pick the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel, the staff are all extremely friendly and willing to help - always! The chamber maids were also very delightful and I made friends with a lovely lady from the Philippines called Riza. We were also greeted by our name daily by the gentleman who took our bags up: joe. We have found our new home away from home and look forward to returning in the summer",5,2019,03,29
105,Great customer service,"As far as service this hotel is the best! Sure they don’t have a spa or gym on site but they have everything else you would expect from a luxury hotel in the heart of Mayfair. They have an affiliation with a gym which is 5 mins walk away and free of charge for guests staying in the hotel, We checked in and were offered the chance to upgrade our room at a discount and yes we chose to do so, we stayed in a newly refurbished executive suite and my oh my we are glad we paid that bit extra. The breakfast was included so we chose to have that in the room and the receptionist explained there was no tray charge for this which was nice. We were looking for a casual dinner and Joseph the porter did not only show us their restaurant on site he also walked me to shepherds market, yes he took time out of his day to walk us there. We would also like to give special mention to Ivana who checked us in, thank you all for a magnificent stay.",5,2019,03,29
105,Afternoon Tea,"Fantastic family experience with superb service. From food, to ambience, to location, it's hard to beat. And relatively good value for money. I cannot remember the name of the waitress who looked after us (Denise I think) but I do remember she was Romanian. Lovely friendly welcome and great with the children. Very tempted to stay here on my next trip to London on the basis of this experience.",5,2019,03,29
105,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel in Mayfair. Centrally located close to great restaurants and all the greenery that london has to offer. Taxis are easy to summon and front desk staff friendly. Lovely rooms each one different, did not like first allocation but were swiftly moved to a more modern room, there is a room for everyone! Great services from Joseph and joe from the front desk team.",5,2019,03,28
105,London Shopping and Girlie Escape 🛍🍾,Great location so close to everything you need. Clean sheets with daily housekeeping and a good pressured shower system - a big plus for me! A warm and friendly welcome from Ivana on Reception who also offered me a larger room upgrade at a discounted supplement - so worth it; Chesterfield suites are lovely and well worth the extra cost you pay. I would like to say a special thank you to Joseph and Joe who were always at hand and happy to help me too. What an enjoyable and pleasant stay. I will definitely return on my next visit to London. Thank you 😊,5,2019,03,28
105,Just Right,Joseph was amazing and really helped with everything I needed. Tip top service with that extra thing. Clean rooms which is a plus in my books. All in all lovely and Cosy. Keep up the good work Joseph and team.,5,2019,03,28
105,Lovely experience,Well done on giving excellent service ! My room was not ready but this was okay I was ushered to the bar as it was past 14.00 and the receptionist took care of my drink. I was then taken up to the room by Joseph who was a delight through my stay - thank you.,5,2019,03,28
105,9 day visit in Feb 2019,"this hotel is one of the lovliest in Mayfair.  It is close to everything, each room is decorated individuly with luxury materials and furniture,and the staff is the friendliest and most helpful I have ever come across.  the dining room and bar are delightful.  you can't do better than the Chesterfield Mayfair.. ",5,2019,03,26
105,Wonderful hotel in which to spend a few days.,"Our second visit here to celebrate my husband's birthday, it is situated in a quiet area and is  so handy for visiting the central London sights and theatres etc.
The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The breakfasts are first class with cooked food served to your table and a wonderful selection of fruits, pastries and continental style food.. All the staff are friendly and cannot do enough to help you. The pianist in the bar is a wonderful asset. It is very relaxing to have a quiet drink listening to the music at the end of the day.
I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if you want to be really well looked after but without any fuss. ",5,2019,03,25
105,Lovely stay!,What a lovely hotel! We stayed in room 225 which is decorated green and gold. The rooms are on the smaller side but beautifully decorated. If you want a larger room do ask for the options and you can pay a fee for this. We were so well taken care of by everyone there. Our room was ready at 11am when we arrived and we were able to buy big bus tickets from the concierge. I asked for a good fish and chips place and they recommended their own! Very nice portions and delicious: I’m glad I tried it. Special thanks to the front desk team for the extremely warm welcome and treating us like royalty.,5,2019,03,22
105,Just Perfect!!!,"This hotel is the only hotel we will visit when in London! The room was beautiful; we paid a little extra for a suite and it was worth it. All the suites are different so let them tell you the different designs; we had the jungle suite over looking the street. Thank you to ivana, Joseph, Karolis and the whole front desk team for making our time in London simply fantastic.",5,2019,03,22
105,Ms,"The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is located in the heart of Mayfair. As soon as we checked in Joseph the porter could not be more helpful, asking if we needed maps, theatre guide: everything. We stayed in a classic room on the 7th Floor - every room is different and clean sheets, secure, tea and coffee making facilities, daily housekeeping, you can even order room service breakfast to the room for no fee if it is included in your rate. We were delighted and impressed to have three beautiful from the front desk (I am sure one of them was the manager who welcomed me) wearing St. Patrick’s day hats offering my husband and I sweet treats ! It’s the little things like this that count. The service was second to none. Thank you for a magnificent stay we will return",5,2019,03,22
105,Best service,Thank you for the warm welcome from all the Chesterfield staff ! We stayed the St Patrick’s day weekend and the staff genuinely looked happy to do their job; it’s hard to find this in a luxury hotel as often people are what I call ‘stuffy’. The Chesterfield staff made us feel so welcome and went out of their way to deliver sweet treats to the room that were st Patrick’s day themed. Thank you to Charlotte on reception for speaking to her hardworking housekeeping colleagues who were able to grant me an early check in. Thank you to Joseph for remembering my name and helping me out daily; as a single female traveller having such a stellar group of staff at your accommodation quite simply makes the trip enriching.,4,2019,03,22
105,Excellent service,"This hotel cares about the little details ! We received a gift on our pillow each evening; one night we even received a home made candle from their Guest Services Manager Letitia C. In world of hotels it’s little touches like this that separate you from the competitors. The hotel was all the other things 4 star hotels in Mayfair should be; clean, quiet with good dining options. We were delighted to be embraced like family by the magnificent staff in this establishment. My standout staff members were; the gentleman who answered my phone each morning - Wazeem and the luggage porter from Hungary Joseph. Thank you",5,2019,03,22
105,Top,The chesterfield has the best hotel bar I’ve ever been in. The staff are so friendly and so accommodating. Their cocktails are to die for and the little touches like the nibbles with the drinks or biscuits with coffee are always a win for me. Victoria is definitely a star of the future and I’m sure she’ll go a long way. Thank you :),5,2019,03,22
105,What a Party,"We had a fabulous evening celebrating my Birthday a couple of weeks back. We have celebrated many occasions here, and true to the wonderful standard the CM family has set, we enjoyed the most wonderful food, and exceptional service all in a beautiful hotel in Mayfair. We stayed in one of the suites which is always a real delight, a nice home away from home. We cannot thank the team enough for yet again helping us celebrate another key milestone in life! Finished off our stay with a magnificent breakfast, a true delight every time. 

It was a trip down memory lane, we got married here this day four years ago.",5,2019,03,20
105,Delicious themed afternoon tea and attentive service,"My two teenage sons and I visited the Chesterfield for the Hardy's Sweetshop inspired afternoon tea late on a Saturday afternoon. The food was delicious and plentiful and the tea menu impressive. The serving staff were friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble. At the end of the meal we were invited to choose some traditional sweets from the sweet cart to take away with us.
The reason for 4 stars not 5 is because the atmosphere was too heavily influenced by the presence of a large group of 7 years having a birthday party.... as a result it was noisier than any other afternoon tea I have experienced in London.",4,2019,03,20
105,Weekend Break,"We were a party of three family members who stayed for a lovely weekend at this boutique hotel. We found all members of staff to be very pleasant, professional and courtesy at all times. The rooms were all very clean, the breakfast was substantial and we enjoyed a lovely evening having cocktails in the bar and listened to the lovely piano music. This hotel is well worth a visit.",5,2019,03,19
105,Review,"Just come back from staying at the chesterfield. Have never been to London before and couldn’t have asked for anywhere better! The staff where so wonderful, attentive and never intrusive. Special thanks goes to paolo on Concierge for helping us so patiently!",5,2019,03,19
105,とても綺麗で、快適です。中心部にも近いロケーションでおススメです,"The rooms were very clean, comfortable, breakfast was delicious and above all the staffs were all very polite.
Also location of hotel is very close to central of city, we could reach the Buckingham palace by walk. 
And it is so easy to reach subway station “Green Park”, convenient to go to anywhere. I recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair 

部屋はとても綺麗で清潔です。朝食も美味しいイングリッシュブレックファーストで満足できました。何よりスタッフのみなさんがとてもフレンドリーで親切で丁寧です。共に80を超えた私の父と母、それと18歳の娘の4人での旅行でしたが、皆心地良い旅行を楽しんでいました。部屋はそれほど広くはないですが、また行きたいです！",5,2019,03,19
105,The little extra's that make your stay special,"I stayed at this hotel for just one night as part of a birthday weekend bash in London. It was booked by the husband so was a complete unknown but what a choice. The hotel is fanstastic, it has the feel of a small hotel but the oppulence of something much more. The staff were fantastic, we had a room upgrade to a junior suite, with a couple of drinks vouchers thrown in, and a cake and birthday card, signed by the staff on duty were in the room when we returned from a meal out. The breakfast was great, it arrived quickly and was super tasty. I cannot praise this hotel more and will be definitely be staying here again, hopefully for more than 1 night next time!",5,2019,03,18
105,Amazing stay 👍,"We were upgraded to a suite and couldn’t have asked for more. The staff are incredible and with a real personal touch. Thank you Letitia and staff. Would love to return.

105,Weekend break,"Stayed 3 nights and could not fault  the hotel, staff and quality of the offering . Not cheap but “you get what you pay for”
Recommend for  all London amenities and sights . 

We upgraded to the music room which was great. Our only small grumble was that bar prices were a little steep . But you are in Mayfair!

105,Chesterfield Mayfair,Excellent hotel. Staff very knowledgeable and friendly. Would highly recommend. Great location. Walk to Buckingham Palace and Underground at Green Park. Clean rooms. Bar/restaurant in hotel was very nice.,5,2019,03,17
105,"Great Location, Great Hotel The Best Staff",I began staying at the Chesterfield Hotel 10 years ago and have always enjoyed it...the location is perfect but as good as the location is everything about the hotel is better...Adam Lake is the GM and he has put together an incredible staff that pays attention to detail! Darren is The Concierge and he handles whatever requests you need. Letitia greets you with a smile!  Edgar is in charge of F&B which is very good and the bar is a fun place to hang out if you can get a seat (it has become quite popular)...When we stay we always feel like we are treated more like a part of the family than being a guest! Kudos to you guys you are truly the best...see you next time.,5,2019,03,16
105,Afternoon Tea,I went there for an afternoon tea with my partner. What a lovely afternoon and a beautiful place! Welcoming staff and delicious food! Also live music to set the mood! Would highly recommend it to anyone!,5,2019,03,16
105,Lovely afternoon tea,My partner and I went for an afternoon tea as a treat. The staff were welcoming and made our visit very easy. The food and selection of tea was great and we were regularly checked on to see if we were happy or wanted more. We were surprised to be offered a selection of sweets on our way out. I'm keeping this as an option for a future visit,5,2019,03,16

105,An absolute pleasure,I stayed four nights here with my son and it was a wonderful experience. The staff is excellent and both suites were very nice. The breakfast is exception as well. The location is close to everything in Mayfair yet is off a relatively quiet street. I will definatly return here the next time I am in London. I recommend booking directly through the hotel as they have specials not available on the travel sites.,5,2019,03,15
105,Excellent experience,"My wife and I had received a gin experience as a Christmas present. We were amazed by the whole thing &nbsp;our experience was led by the wonderful James, he was so knowledgeable and clearly passionate about what he does. After our experience we asked to try some other gins and James suggested 2 that were fantastic (brockmans and gin mare). We would love to return one day soon.",5,2019,03,15
105,A real gem!,"We wish to thank all the Chesterfield staff for our wonderful experience at Chesterfield Mayfair. We enjoyed every minute from being welcomed at our arrival up to the last minutes of our stay. Everybody and everything was superb. We appreciated the room and breakfasts, the afternoon tea that simply left us speechless, visiting the bar with our friends and colleagues, the location, the beauty and the spirit of Chesterfield. And most of all, the professionalism and friendliness of Chesterfield people!

We'll keep wonderful memories and will certainly share our impressions and will come to stay again. We're looking forward.",5,2019,03,14

105,A great experience!,Went to the chesterfield for afternoon tea. Have to say a massive thank you to rafcar he truly made our afternoon. I went with my boyfriend and was a great experience. Will be returning soon for more!,5,2019,03,13
105,True hospitality in a wonderful location,"I spent 2 nights here with my mother...What a wonderful hotel! From the moment we arrived we were made feel welcome. The concierge team were amazing and went above and beyond, the reception staff were lovely and the restaurant and bar staff were friendly and professional. The talented pianist created a lovely ambiance in the bar

The rooms were spotless, and every guest need was considered. Beds were extremely comfortable. 

Breakfast was fresh, plentiful  & delicious 

This is a very special hotel operated by a lovely team. 

I hope to return soon",5,2019,03,12
105,Excellent,I don’t usually got to hotel bars when I go to hotels but I was given a voucher as part of my package so I decided to use it and go. This bar was absolutely incredible. The range of drinks they have are beyond good and their cocktails are so delicious. I chose the Eton mess cocktail as it’s one of my favourite desserts and I couldn’t believe that it tasted almost identical to the dessert! Adrian in the bar was brilliant who came and explained the cocktail as I had to break it open out of an iceball with a hammer! He also helped me select some food as I was feeling so relaxed and didn’t want to move from this place anytime soon. I cannot wait for my return so I can try more that this bar has to offer.,5,2019,03,12
105,A most hospitable hotel in central london,"We just came back from a week in London where we stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was a great experience from reservations to coming in and all during the stay. The staff are welcoming and friendly, the service is great and so are the restaurant and bar.
The location is central and within walking distance of The Mall, Regent street and more attractions as well as 5 minutes from Green park underground station.
All in all, highly recommended",5,2019,03,11
105,Simply perfect,"Tonight is our last night and I’m going to miss this place dearly. The room was perfect and the service was outstanding. It all started with Laticia (one of the managers) making sure our stay started off on the right foot. The staff makes you feel welcomed and the location can’t be beat.  You are within a 5 minute walk to the tube, amazing shopping, Hyde Park and tons of restaurants.  The bar is cosy.  Our room was immaculate (my biggest concern with any hotel).  My only gripe is that our neighbors blasted the tv nightly and we could hear what they were watching.  ",5,2019,03,10
105,Wonderful experience ,"A stones throw away from the center of London and all it’s craziness sits a hotel that you wouldn’t believe existed. So tranquil and beautiful this boutique hotel is everything a traveler could ask for. My check in was swift and easy, the room comfortable and quiet. It was truly perfect. I must thank Josef for helping me with taxis every morning. I will be back!",5,2019,03,10
105,Amazing hotel ,The Chesterfield is beautiful hotel in a great location. It’s clean and up to date. The staff really make the hotel. Charlotte on reception was amazing super helpful and nothing was too much trouble. She went above and beyond to help us celebrate our special occasion. Would definitely recommend the Chesterfield and can not wait to return!! ,5,2019,03,10
105,Awesome place and staff!,"The chesterfield Mayfair truly is a diamond! This hotel is fantastic in every way. The staff are sublime especially Karolis on concierge, he helped us with many restaurant reservations. The rooms are beautifully designed and incredibly comfortable. I really couldn’t find anything slightly out of place",5,2019,03,10
105,Great hotel! Highly recommend staying there,"This is the second time I have visted the Chesterfield. It never disappoints when it comes to the quality of service provided, room design and overall friendly attitude of staff members. I never once felt out of place and if I ever had an issue, staff members would assist no problem. During my time at the Chesterfield, I tested the breakfast service. This allowed me to have my food delivered to my room. On the card given, I was able to pick a time I wanted my food and sure enough, I heard a knock on the door at that exact time. I highly recommend visiting this hotel if you're staying in mayfair.",5,2019,03,10
105,A Breakfast for Kings,"If you want a breakfast with true class, this is the place. There is a cold buffet for the European palate including smoke salmon and beetroot juice. The choices for a hot breakfast are wide but the full English is just perfect. The service is immaculate. I guess you get what you pay for. It costs £23 but so worth it.",5,2019,03,09
105,I’m planning to return in the Fall! ,"After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to choose The Chesterfield Mayfair over The Arch London. And let me tell you...it’s the best decision I made! From the moment I walked in, all the staff were so welcoming. The Guest Services Manager, Letitia, sent up a fruit tray as I had just flown in from Cork and must have looked tired after pulling my luggage from Green Park Station. It was so sweet and hit the spot perfectly. 

The location is perfect! A 5 minute walk...if even that...from Green Park Station. You can easily get to Green Park from Paddington Station and I followed the hotel’s directions from their website and it was easy to find. It’s walking distance to all the major attractions and shopping. The hotel is situated on a quiet and beautiful residential street. This time round I visited a lot of different sites as I’ve been to London many times. It’s close to the Churchill War Rooms, lots of plays and musicals at Leicester Square and Westminster. I even walked back from seeing Les Miserables at the Queen’s Theatre and it was really a quick walk. 

The room is gorgeous and very comfortable. The breakfast is delicious and has hit the spot everyday! And for the turndown service I’ve received different things each day - chocolate, face spray, lip balm, etc. Such a great touch! 

Yesterday I took advantage of the gin tasting which was conducted my Adrian. It was so much fun and I learned a lot. Not sure if I’ll be able to replicate this at home but miracles can happen right? It’s too bad I didn’t have time for the whiskey tasting - I’ll have to do that when I come back for my next visit. 

The customer service is honestly like nothing I’ve ever experienced before in all my travels. All the staff is so courteous and kind. Always smiling! Even today, on International Women’s Day, I came back to the room and there was a poem and a rose from Letitia! And I just received a farewell cupcake as I’m leaving tomorrow. 

I feel so sad that I have to leave tomorrow but on the bright side, I’m already planning my next trip to London in the early Fall. And when I do come back, I’m only staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair. Thank you to everyone here who made my stay so memorable and made me feel like this hotel was my home away from home! ",5,2019,03,08
105,Wonderful experience!,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for six nights.  The service was beyond first class by everyone that works there.  The customer's comfort and experience is their primary concern, no matter what the issue may be.  I would highly recommend staying in the Chesterfield while you are in London.",5,2019,03,05
105,Superb bijoux dog friendly hotel in heart of London ,"A wonderful hotel which catered for all our needs. On arrival we were welcomed by the porters and the desk staff who were friendly and helpful. Our room was extremely clean, attractively decorated and had everything we required including bathrobes. The breakfast buffet had an excellent variety of foods. I especially enjoyed the granola yogurt with strawberries.
The central position means that you can easily walk to all the sights and theatreland. ",5,2019,03,03
105,"So friendly, helpful, comfortable ","What a lovely hotel with such kind, helpful staff. We only stayed one night but the service was impeccable, the room spotless and comfortable and the atmosphere/ambience so friendly.  And they know what a cortado is!  It is definitely going to be our ‘go to’ when we visit London.",5,2019,03,03
105,Warm hug on a cold night,"I enjoyed my stay here immensely. The bathroom tiles are heated, the bedding is supremely comfortable. There's a selection of still or sparkling water. Very, very friendly staff that are genuinely polite and quick to help.",5,2019,03,03
105,Honeymoon,"We didn’t tell the hotel we were on our honeymoon night, but they found out and were amazing.  The were all helpful, friendly and generous.  I’ve stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels in London and have always found them cold, uncaring and basically awful.  The chesterfield hotel and their staff are without measure in how they treated us.  We couldn’t have wished for a better afternoon and evening.  We will come back here constantly to for the rest of our natural lives.   Thank you. ",5,2019,03,03
105,Good restaurant,I will sure come back and have a great dinner and lunch again like the last time I had been here. Is one of the best. I love it every thing is perfect. The Chester professional waiters knows how to treat clients and make you come back again ,5,2019,03,03
105,My new favorite London Hotel,"I have visited London several time but just completed a stay with a friend who was there  for the first time. We had an amazing experience at the Chesterfield and highly recommend this lovely hotel in a beautiful Mayfair section of London. The staff is wonderful and so accommodating. The bar is cozy with a wonderful selection of wines, beers and food, available even when arriving late. The room was spacious enough for the two of us and the room service excellent. It is however the extras that make the difference. A gift on our pillows each night, immediate help when needed and a farewell cupcake on our last night!! I doubt I will ever stay anywhere else!",5,2019,02,28
105,A Fabulous Hotel With Fabulous Staff,"We have visited the Chesterfield several times now for our wedding anniversary and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in London!  
The hotel is elegant, the rooms delightful and the food is excellent in terms of the variety, it is well cooked and beautifully presented.  But if there is one thing in particular which sets the Chesterfield above every other hotel we have stayed with and that is the staff.  They are outstanding in terms of making one feel special and valued and that nothing is too much trouble.  Each time we have stayed, we have received Anniversary cards form our 'Chesterfield Family' along with balloons and little treats in our room! This exceptional standard has been maintained with every stay and I would certainly commend and thank the manager, Adam Lake in his selection of staff and attention to detail in creating a wonderful atmosphere and a delightful place to stay!
I would recommend anyone who visits London to stay here as the hotel is a delight!",5,2019,02,28
105,Best bar un London,"This bar is amazing. They have an experiencia for everyone. You do not like whisky, gin... Adrian will match your experience. They also have the best cocktails in town. Cocktails serve y in a ice glass, dry ice, anything. 
",5,2019,02,24
105,Great Afternoon Tea for children/teenagers/sweet lovers!,"We chose this hotel because of the sweet shop themed afternoon tea for our teenage daughters to enjoy and were not disappointed! The service was friendly, efficient and quick. Our table was located in the main restaurant next to a beautiful orchid display. There was a good choice of teas, or hot chocolate for our daughter who isn’t a tea fan! It was a lovely surprise to be brought a smoking pink lemonade drink, a great novelty touch! The selection of sandwiches suited my daughter who requested the vegan ones and my other daughter enjoyed her ham/salmon/egg fillings. The cakes and scones went down very quickly and refills were offered but enough sugar was consumed! 
Finally we all enjoyed choosing our sweets from the sweet trolley at the end, which was the perfect accompaniment to our trip to the cinema later that evening.  Highly recommended. ",4,2019,02,23
105,Home away from home!!!,We arrived a bit early and our room was not ready but we were made to feel very welcome immediately. We sat in the terrace bar and enjoyed a few sharing stands while we waited for the room. Once in the room it was immaculately decorated feeling very British; the room has all you need including a miniature stationery drawer. The breakfast was superb in the morning we opted for the full English breakfast. We came into the bar and had  two coffees that they personalised with our name on! That was a wow factor so thank you to James in the bar for doing that for us it was an unexpected delight. Another standout was Joseph the doorman he was just super friendly and helpful. Thank you for a lovely stay.,5,2019,02,23
105,Excellent service and amazing staff,"I have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair on numerous occasions and I have to say/write that it has really become my ""second home"" and the staff my ""second family"".

I want to specifically thank Letitia who has always been looking after me from the moment I phone to the moment I check out. 

The reason I love that place is entirely thanks to the team working there to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Again, thank you Chesterfield for making my stay memorable one more time!",5,2019,02,23
105,Outstanding service,Stayed here at the Chesterfield Mayfair overnight after a late business meeting and I must say the service was superb. From the first moment I entered the building I was greeted with warning smiles and the room itself was very spacious and clean. The restaurant serves some of the best food I have eaten at any restaurant and I have been to quite a few. I will definately be back here in the near future and keep up the good work.,5,2019,02,23

105,Superb time!,"Came with my fiancé and we had a superb time. There is no stuffiness that you usually experience in luxury hotels; everyone greeted us in the corridors and was ready to take care of us. We had one drink in the bar as we had quite a busy schedule but it was a good drink. Front desk staff were so lovely and managed to get our room ready for us: we were lucky after a long flight from South Africa. The 5th floor is newly refurbished. What a perfect hotel, thank you all",5,2019,02,23

105,9oth birthday event,"For my husband's 90th birthday we wanted to have a very special event and decided to choose a private room at the Chesterfield Hotel to entertain a large number of guests.  We could not have made a better choice!  The hotel has been known to us for some years and is always our first choice for any special occasion or indeed just to hold a meeting or meet friends.  The staff are exceptional.  Nothing is too much trouble. The quality and choice of food is excellent and the comfort and attention to detail in the bedrooms is first class.  Overall, the ambience of the hotel has a unique private, personal and calm feel, unlike many of the larger hotels.  It is a peaceful haven away from the noise and bustle of the city.  A very excellent place to stay. Valet parking is available if necessary.

105,Unforgettable Afternoon Tea,"I do not normally write reviews, but my recent experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel made me want to share it. My partner and I tried the Original Sweetshop Afternoon Tea at the Butler's restaurant and could not have enjoyed it more. Delicious food, attentive and professional staff are just few of the things that made our experience truly unforgettable. 

We were greeted by a delightful Ukrainian lady, who showed us to our table and explained how everything worked. We then placed an order and before we knew it, our delicious food had arrived. We had the chocolate tea, which we had never tried before and we were very pleasantly surprised by the velvety smooth texture and light sweetness of the drink. Our waitress walked us through the menu and she was always around to refill our plates.

The main event for us was the Candyman and the sweet cart. We got free sweets to take away, which was welcomed by my partner who has a real sweet tooth.

We had an amazing time and we are definitely coming back soon.",5,2019,02,19
105,Excellent location and staff.,"We returned to the Chesterfield to stay with friends for a theatre visit, combined with us all meeting up with members of our families.

It is located in a very upscale neighborhood within a 5 minutes walk to two Underground stops for exploring the city. The staff was very attentive and met all our needs. The breakfast was great to start the day before going out. The bar had great cocktails with special gin and tonic selections. Finally the room had a comfortable bed with perfect pillows. 
I would rate it a 10 if I could. I plan on recommending it to everyone I know.",5,2019,02,18
105,Amazing Experience,Had a fantastic stay at this hotel everything was outstanding. We were given a warm welcome by Jozeph the luggage porter and the whole front desk; he even offered to take the backpack off my back as it looked heavy. Nothing was too much trouble and we observed how everyone was treated like royalty. We stayed in as beautiful room on the 5th floor which still smelt new as we learnt it had just been refurbished. The rooms are a very good size especially for London we will definitely be returning,5,2019,02,18
105,Amazing Experience,The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is a luxurious gem in the heart of the affluent Mayfair! The front desk staff are extremely courteous and so are all the staff we encountered. We received a warm welcome from Sanae and Jozeph who worked well as a team to make us laugh and talk about our disastrous journey with delays and bad weather. We felt relaxed as they assured us all was okay now that we had landed at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. The room was blue and white in colour on the 2nd floor with a nice big bed. Housekeeping do a fantastic job when they service the room daily; immaculate! We hope to return back to this gem of a hotel,5,2019,02,18

Everything from check in to check out gives you the feel of home. 
Will be part of this story also in other places in thw World.",5,2019,02,16
105,Warm welcome!,I stayed here and the number one stand out for me was the staff ! I was so happy with the swift check in from Sanae but mostly the outstanding recognition and the fact that they remembered my name. The hotel was beautiful (all the rooms are individually designed) and it’s only a close walk from Green Park. Thank you; I will definitely return.,5,2019,02,16
105,Special stay,"This was my second visit to the hotel for a family occasion. I was delighted to be allocated one of the junior suites which was beautiful , elegant and resembling a set from a period drama. There were also all the necessary modern touches and a fabulous bathroom with high end toiletries. I would like to thank guest services manager Letitia for being a bundle of joy and for all of the thoughtful personal touches.  I am not fortunate enough to experience this type of accommodation very often but was made to feel just as important as someone with unlimited funds. There is no stuffiness, but hugely professional and friendly service. The location is excellent and even after one night I felt as though I had experienced something special .  I very much look forward to next time",5,2019,02,16
105,Great Service!,The hotel is wonderful! All the staff were engaging and friendly. The luggage porters were particularly engaging and prompt with assistance carrying shopping bags straight from the street. Joseph was especially impressive and went out of his way to walk me to a nearby gym bringing a towel and some water to boot. That’s what I call service! On check-in Sanae was very hospitable and greeted us with a warm welcome and even took us to our room. That extra attention to our every need was enough to keep us hooked for life! I always have friends and family visiting from out of the country and I wouldn’t hesitate to bring them to the Chesterfield again and again for our trips to London! Thank you.,5,2019,02,16
105,Awesome Awesone Awesone!!!!!,First impression was a big smile from a gentleman from Hungary! Jozeph was so good with our children and he later explained he had children of similar age. he handed me a box of kleenex abd basically kept us company as we arrived early! i travelled up to London for a meal with the children and we met friends who were staying in the hotel. we went up to their suite and it was beautifully decorated in classic British style: our friends told us it was the best hotel they had stayed in and we could see why. the food in the restaurant was excellent and the kids were given Chesterfield teddies. thank you all,5,2019,02,16
105,Five Star Service.,"My husband and I wanted somewhere to go and relax and get away from the kids and feel spoilt.Upon arrival we were welcomed at the door and immediately felt at home.The receptionist was equally welcoming.We were pleasantly surprised by the room it was simply breath taking.The decor was amazing and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne. It was perfect.We had the choice of room service so decided to have both as we were there for a few nights.
The cuisine was delicious I am not exaggerating when I say it was fine dining all the way. Tasty quality food and impeccable five star service. We would come here again and again to experience this 5 star service. I would recommend Chesterfield Mayfair every time.Very impressed.

105,Perfect!,I really enjoyed my stay at The Chesterfield. All the front desk girls are immaculately presented and a delight to talk to. They checked us in swiftly with genuine interest in our plans. A member of staff that stood out was Charlotte she was really engaging and remembered us each time we walked in and out of the hotel. We booked a classic double and were given a newly refurbished room on the 5th floor. All the maids we encountered were friendly and even allowed a bit of a later checkout free of charge. Thank you all,5,2019,02,15
105,Amazing ,Completely British and completely and utterly adorable ! I was impressed with the detail the owner adds to the whole establishment. We have previously visited their hotel in palm beach Florida which is also called the chesterfield. Extremely warm welcome from their guest Services Manager Letitia who offered us pink lemonade on Valentine’s Day! We grew close to the staff in this building and I cannot name them all but room service down to the reception staff and ladies who cleaned the lobby everyone wore a constant smile! Can not wait to return to this gem. Will be recommending to all our friends and family in Canada,5,2019,02,15
105,Great Place,"I had some great service, especially when I went to the dining area for some breakfast. Staff were very nice and I really felt at home there. I highly recommend that you visit if you are in the Mayfair area.",5,2019,02,15
105,Rum Tasting Experience at the Chesterfield,"Highly recommend the rum tasting session, even if you think you don’t like rum.

Great cocktails, too!",5,2019,02,15
105,Wow is all I can say,"Wow is all is can say. Came for afternoon tea and it was far more than I expected. The staff are lovely, welcoming and attentive. Our waitress Manuela was great always with a smile and making sure we had enough to eat and drink. The afternoon teas best part for me was sweet trolley, you can take a bag home of your favourite and it really reminded me of my childhood sweetshop. I will be coming back again soon.",5,2019,02,14
105,You Can't Miss with a Red Carnation Hotel,"The Red Carnation  Chains seems to hold their hotels to a high standard of service, and this was true at the Chesterfield Mayfield.  Much of the service was outstanding –especially housekeeping, room service, and the front desk.  Breakfast was delicious, and the service was impeccable, as long as we had our initial server, Danesa, who is ready to move into their 5-star property. The Mayfair Location was wonderful – so many neighborhoods and shops to explore. Also the Green Park subway is a short walk.  We hope to stay again.",4,2019,02,14
105,First trip to London,Wow this Hotel is amazing. We arrived in the morning from the USA and our room was ready.  What a great way to start our vacation.   The beds are sooo comfortable for starters.  The location couldn't be better. Walking distance to everything you need in London.  I can't wait to go back.,5,2019,02,14
105,The most amazing hotel!,"I have just stayed at the chesterfield Mayfair for a few days. Having never been to London before I looked on trip advisor before making my decision on where to stay and this hotel truly lives up to the hype. Everything was immaculate, the staff so friendly and welcoming which makes a first time traveller feel so at home. The breakfast was amazing and so plenty full. My waitress was Ieva (hope I’ve spelled that correctly) and she was awesome. Always happy and welcomed me everyday. She even remembered what I ordered the day before and would ask if I wanted the same or wanted to try a recommendation. I will definitely be coming back",5,2019,02,13
105,Excellent location and service,"This is a very good hotel for a long weekend in London. Perfect location with easy access to central London and all restaurants, sights, parks in walking distance.
The breakfast is worth the stay every morning. Staff is superb and attentive. Bar is really good with a wide range of selections. Well worth the money.",5,2019,02,13
105,Afternoon Tea,"Thank you, thank you,thank you!
Do you know that seriously this is the most perfect and charming hotel in London? I have been coming for Afternoon Tea and occasional luncheon for 16 years or more and Loris is still perfect with perfected staff! Their customer service is more than 5* and he has trained them so so well! Every little detail is covered effortlessly and with decorum and ease. They float about carefully watching if you need topping up or more sandwiches etc. His staff are never intrusive but just attend to your every little need before you even know you need them!! The Tea experience far exceeds many of the top hotels and they could all show a thing or two to The Ritz, Claridges etc etc. My friends had never been and I’d recommended your hotel for a 60th. They were so impressed and we all can’t wait to return. Thank you for looking after us. It is like Mary Poppins has floated in and worked her magic!! However you are not ‘practically perfect in every way’ but truly ‘perfect in every way’. Being in customer service management all my life I notice every tiny detail and you’ve certainly made it all look a dream. Congratulations to you all. You are all much appreciated. None of us could find any tiny fault with the whole experience!
Kind regards

105,Super Hotel,This was a birthday treat for me. I had the most fantastic time. The afternoon tea was incredible. Retro sweets theme with lovely sandwiches and scones. The staff here are amazing they remember your name. They bring a birthday card signed by all the staff. I had a lovely little cupcake and sweets left in my room with Happy Birthday written on it. The room was a lovely suite with two bathrooms. Very clean. Very bright and cheerful. Most comfortable bed. Lovely hot water and super soft towels. No request is too much trouble for them. Roberta on reception. James in the Bar and Loris in the restaurant. These people deserve a special mention for being outstanding. All of the staff were perfect. From the doorman and concierge to the managers and housekeeping. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back.  Thank you for all your kind service. ,5,2019,02,12
105,Best hotel ever,"I think this must be the best hotel in London. Not only is it a beautiful old buliding in the heart of Mayfair, it is also beautifully appointed and fitted out to the highest standards. The restaurant serves excellent quality food with a great ambience, and the bar is like a gentlemans club complete with pianist.
What really sets it apart though is the staff. Every single one we met was friendly, charming and helpful. James in the bar was especially good, made us feel like family. We will return whenever we are in London",5,2019,02,12
105,Fantastic birthday weekend,"Quite simply the best hotel in London. We enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea with our family and then stayed for two nights. On discovering it was my wife's birthday we were upgraded to a very swanky junior suite, complete with a personalised cake and a birthday card signed by the staff. Every member of staff we met were exceptional, special mention to Eleanor who served our afternoon tea and James in the bar. This almost seems unfair to the rest of the staff though. Most highly recommended, we wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2019,02,12
105,Amazing London Visit,"We arrived quite late on Friday evening yet the welcome was amazing by Letitia, Edmond and the nights team. Dining in the bar was relaxed and very enjoyable the Red Carnation ethos evident throughout the stay. We were spoilt right down to the very last detail. Housekeeping, F&B, Front of House all doing an amazing job. The hotel was so near everything you couldn't ask for more. The were staff beyond words but here's a few to describe, helpful, friendly welcoming, like family they always had a smile & a word. Breakfast was so vast the variety was great and the staff each morning made for a wonderful start to the day. We really didn't want to leave but Roberta on leaving said ""see you again soon"" & I hope this is so true. We will be back. Ger & Family ",5,2019,02,12
105,Wonderful evening,"I was in this hotel to celebrate the birthday of a friend of mine. we had a great time. dinner was perfect, we relied on the advice of Maurizia and Loris. they were very professional. Thanks also to Roberta. Everything was lovely and amazing... thank you very much for the wonderful evening. See you soon",5,2019,02,12
105,Celebrating a special 60 th birthday ,"The food and staff , the drinks , the utter friendly relaxed and professional service make this hotel and afternoon tea experience stand head and shoulders above many others . Top notch 
Nothing is too much trouble with unobtrusive but rapid attention to your needs ",5,2019,02,10
105,Top class,"My wife and I have been to this hotel several times over last few years. It is well situated with good access to shops and public transport.
Throughout this time the standard has never dropped.
The rooms are very good and the hotel quiet. The breakfast quality is excellent and the restaurant is to be recommended for an evening meal. 
The other major plus is the staff, who are a credit to the hotel
being very friendly and helpful.",5,2019,02,10
105,13th birthday celebrations,"I visited the chesterfield hotel today for my daughters 13th birthday treat. The sweet shop afternoon tea. We had a table of 13 young ladies and a table of 9 for us accompanying mum's. Everything was lovely. Hotel lovely...food was good and the staff great. It was very kind of them to sing her happy birthday too. Our server Tony done a great job keeping us all happy and on time for our next appointment that day...even though we were rushing him a little towards the end. Good job under pressure! 
We took away what we didn't finish though as there was plenty of everything. 
The children had sweets and a souvenir teddy on leaving which was a nice touch. 
Would definitely visit again.",5,2019,02,09
105,Penelope w,"We visited this hotel for afternoon tea, after being to other afternoon teas this was the best!!..
All the food was tasty. Great value for money & the service was outstanding nothing was to much trouble for our waiter Tony ..
I would highly recommend this place..
Thanks for the memories x",5,2019,02,09
105,English charm,"I wanted to stay somewhere (3 night stay) that oozed English and this was perfect! The interior decor is fabulous. The staff (particularly the doormen we dealt with) were friendly and helpful. The bar is very comfortable and the piano playing just tops it off perfectly. Great location. Comfortable (although small) room, very quiet and the beds were comfortable too.
Highly recommend.",5,2019,02,07
105,Nice Stay,"We have just had a nice overnight stay at this hotel with some friends, had some lovely drinks in the bar last night and the staff were great.  Our room must of had a broken lock as we could not unlock our room and had to go down to reception several times to get new keys done which still didn't work and had to then go back and get the staff to let us in, not great at midnight!  Breakfast this morning although lovely was not great service, the cooked breakfast included black pudding which 2 of us said we didn't want and one of us asked for no tomatoes, we all got the same...……… no black pudding and all with tomato, we had to ask several times for lemon to go with our hot water and my husband asked for sweeteners that never came.  So although the breakfast was presented well and tasted great it was far from perfect.",3,2019,02,07
105,the best,"Not only was this hotel perfectly themed for an American visiting London, but the service was the best I've ever seen at a hotel. My fiance and I had just gotten engaged and my parents sent us flowers- well the front desk noticed and sent us champagne for two just to be nice! The front desk agents were very nice and the folks in the lobby and at the curb were knowledgeable and made us feel welcome",5,2019,02,04
105,Surprise stay for our engagement,"Amazing stay - all of the staff were fantastic and the hotel is lovely. I arranged a meal and a night's stay as a surprise for my girlfriend when proposing. I told the staff I was planning this and they were very happy to accommodate. Everyone was friendly and had been told of the occasion and all of them wished us congratulations, we got an upgrade to a beautiful suite, an extra dessert with ""congratulations"" written on it and champagne at breakfast the next day. It made an already brilliant night truly magical and I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,02,04
105,Our go to residence,"Great location, staff, food, comfortable room. We have used The Chesterfield for the last five visits to London. The staff has always been gracious and helpful. They know us by name and always upgrade our room. The breakfast is great and service good. Fast cab service and or easy walking or underground to all important areas. Very often good rates online. Concierge for performances is superb especially if you call before coming. We will be back!",4,2019,02,03
105,Brilliant afternoon tea!,"We joined for afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon. A lovely room with skylight awaited us, making us feel far away from the London craziness outside.
The team that looked after us was very friendly and welcoming, regularly checking if we needed anything else or wanted a top-up of anything.
The sandwiches were very tasty, with different types of bread such as onion bread and basil bread, very nice! I have never had a chocolate scone before but it was absolutely yummy.
Then last but not least, the pastries: inspired by popular sweets, a very colourful selection awaited on the top of our stand. Each piece was perfect in its own way, with flavours of chocolate, cola and many others.

Having tasted over 20 different afternoon teas throughout my years in London already, I would certainly rate this as one of the very best! There were no kids in our party, but the little ones around the room were very well treated and spoiled by the team.

Thank you Edgar & team for a great afternoon!",5,2019,02,03
105,Another wonderful stay at this lovely hotel,"Our third stay at this gem of a hotel in Central London.  Location is great -  for shoppers it is a comfortable walk to Bond Street and, Oxford Street area through Berkeley Square.  Green Park tube station no more than 10 minutes walk away - only 2 stops to Oxford Street or Knightsbridge and other places of interest easy to access by underground.   Hotel is not large, glitzy or pretentious - just elegant, classy, comfortable and friendly with Old English charm.  Its biggest asset is its wonderful staff - all of them.  Wonderful , friendly welcome from door staff  who make guests  feel important and valued - not just paying customers on their way through. Quick and professional reception staff,  friendly 'turn-down' service personnel  etc.  Staff in dining room professional, friendly knowledgeable and interested in their customers.  Rooms are well equipped -  maybe a little small but more than made up for by quality of furnishings - beautiful and tasteful fabrics.  We had afternoon tea on this trip.  In our opinion better than The Ritz, Fortnum and Mason, Harrods and The Shard - and equal to Claridges all of which we have experienced.  We ate in the hotel each evening - good choice of menu, beautifully presented, good portions and delicious.  Management and Owners  should be very proud of this hotel - especially all the staff.  ",5,2019,01,31
105,Felt Like Staying with a Wonderfully Large Family,"I have procrastinated too long on writing my review. It probably won't seem that typical. From the moment we pre-set up our Christmas Dinner to our saying ""good-bye"" it was a top notch experience. 

The location of the hotel is tucked into what felt like a residential neighborhood but close enough to businesses that we could walk easily to restaurants, pubs, coffee shops and fun shopping.

What made this hotel the most special, though, is that everyone we dealt with was so friendly and helpful.  It felt like one big happy family and at the risk of leaving someone out, I compiled a list of all the fabulous employees we encountered: Guest Services - Letitia, what a joy! and thank you for the special ""treat"" at my tea with my daughters. I'm sorry I didn't get to thank you in person. Loris, who brought us the treat, how wonderfully thoughtful to make sure it was all okay before you did. Alex and Jaimie, who made our family Christmas Dinner extremely special - so attentive! Roberta at the front desk who was extremely thoughtful when I had an issue to deal with. Eryk who handled room service better than I have ever experienced...and all the amazing doormen who made us feel as if we were being greeted by family every time we came and left: Joseph (I'm sorry we didn't get to say good-bye), Antonio, Joe and Gyorgy (I know I'm spelling your name wrong but I didn't want to worry you by staring at your name tag for so long!)....I also didn't get the name of the man who ordered our ride to Glastonbury. He personally made sure all was okay.

I know I've left so many names out; the cheery cleaning crew and busy wait staff but know that as a whole you made our first vacation abroad with our four children a truly special adventure that we will remember for the rest of our lives.

Thank you, thank you.",5,2019,01,27
105,The Best Hotel in London,"I have said it before and I repeat that this is the best Hotel in London.  The service is impeccable (they seem to know what you want before you request it), the food is of the best quality, and the accommodations the best.  The Hotel even added a personal touch that was very special to us: an anniversary card signed by all of the staff.  If you want the perfect place to stay when you are in London, this is the Hotel to be at.",5,2019,01,27
105,A Traditional London Hotel,"Located just off Berkley Square, the Chesterfield Mayfair is superbly situated for anyone wishing to indulge in the boutiques of Mayfair, take a stroll around Piccadilly, Jermyn Street and St James Street or catch the tube from Green Park Underground Station to travel further afield.
I stayed at the end of November and found the hotel suited my needs perfectly as a base for my Christmas shopping escapades and also for sightseeing and enjoying the Christmas Lights. 
The staff were courteous and obliging throughout my stay.
There were plenty of choices on the breakfast menu, although I have had better bacon at home. However bonus points must be awarded for serving proper Gloucestershire butter.
On the first night of my stay, I took my evening meal in Butlers Restaurant. The young lady at Reception recommended the fish and chips but I settled for the roast leg of lamb. I was not disappointed. The generous portion of lamb was served with boulangère potatoes, vegetables and some excellent gravy, all washed down with a glass of good Rioja. This was followed by Linzer torte and a fine glass of Frapin Cigar Cognac. Splendid.",5,2019,01,26
105,Superb ear ice.,"What a gem! Superb service. Small (typical for London) but very comfortable and well appointed bedroom with ensuite(shower in bath), tea & coffee, TV and dressing gowns. Nice fluffy towels. Lovely bar and excellent breakfast. From arrival and greeting through to check out the polite, friendly not over-the-top service was notable.  Definitely stay again for more than just business trips.",5,2019,01,26
105,Fabulous,"I booked a twin room for a special trip to take my adult daughter to London for the Harry Potter show. We arrived early at the hotel to leave our bags as we could not take them to the theatre and were welcomed warmly. On our return we found our bags were waiting for us in a lovely room, we also found a personal note welcoming us and hoping we had enjoyed the show. This was on a slate which was decorated with gold iced broomstick and cupcakes with Harry Potter characters. There was also an invitation to the Terrace bar for a couple of free cocktails. The barman in the Terrace bar was very friendly and helpful in advising our cocktail choices and the gentleman playing the piano in the corner made the atmosphere very special.
Overall a fabulous experience and would recommend to anyone",5,2019,01,25
105,excellent location,"This hotel is exceptional and excellent value for money.
 Excellent location in Mayfair, within 3 minutes of bars and local shops. Easy 15 minute walk to Oxford and Regent streets. 5 mins to Underground station. Quiet location, not on main road.
The rooms are beautiful with large comfy beds and all the amenities you would expect of 5 star hotel.
The breakfast is the exceptional feature. Having a buffet with an a la carte menu for the hot food meant the food was of a high quality restaurant quality, rather than the normal hot buffet that the majority of hotels offer.
The service from all staff: concierge, reception, doormen, restaurant, bar, cleaners was excellent. Very friendly and welcoming.
The hotel doesnt have a gym on the premises, however does have free access to a full gym facility which is only a few minutes walk away. 
Another nice touch is the Library room which was a nice large quiet room to do some work in.
I will definitely stay here on next trip to London.",5,2019,01,25
105,Did not want to leave,"This place was really something magical.  The hospitality, service, care, and attention given to each individual guest is really a lost art.   My daughter received a birthday card with hand-written wishes from each staff member. Who does that? :)  Our room was STUNNNING.  Breakfast was delicious.  Taxis abundant outside.  Umbrellas at the door.  Great bell and housekeeping service.   Honestly, I am a picky traveler from LA.  If I could, I would give this place 12 stars.  Charming, quiet, and very English.  It was perfection!  Cannot wait to return to this tiny gem of a hotel.",5,2019,01,23
105,An exceptional Mayfair hotel .....,"My husband and I have just spent a week in this unique hotel.  We have stayed here before but this time I was somewhat disabled and need to walk with a stick. 

Our welcome and treatment throughout the week was exceptional - nothing was too much trouble.  The staff were first class and very attentive - I wanted for nothing.  That staff remain with The Chesterfield for years speaks volume - one member of the dining room staff told us, when we asked  that she has been there 22 years and the handy man who rectified in a minute a fault on our TV told us he has been there 18 years.  It is having  such wonderful staff that makes this hotel a rarity in central London.  

Other pluses are the excellent food, a first class buffet breakfast, and a comfortable bar with a pianist!  Our room was spacious with two bathrooms. We had a most comfortable super kingsize bed with the softest pillows and top grade bed linen.  In other words we experienced top class service in a first class hotel in a great location.  We can't wait to come again. Thank you.",5,2019,01,22
105,Christmas sparkle,Wonderful hotel tucked away with easy access to every part of London. The service is excellent the food is outstanding. Our room was a little small compared to our previous stay but non the less wonderful.  ,5,2019,01,16
105,Absolutely lovely!,"This wonderful hotel is in Mayfair among the beautiful, old homes.  Lovely area to walk around and feel a part of the neighborhood.  Quiet, peaceful but close to transportation.  The staff is absolutely wonderful.  From front desk, concierge, and porters to housekeeping and everyone you encounter. Everyone seems to love working there...they’re like family. The hotel is in excellent condition and little things like toiletries are top notch. Everyone goes out of there way to make sure they are helpful and friendly.  I would urge you to try it especially if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of London to sleep in a quiet neighborhood.",5,2019,01,15
105,. excellent accomodations,"Friendly staff. always attentive to your needs. lovely traditional rooms. Excellent breakfast staff.
A great Mayfair location.
Our family Visit London from USA every Christmas. The Chesterfield set the mood for a nostalgic Dickens Holiday., with all the modern amenities.. the best!  Be back next year.",5,2019,01,15
105,London visit,Visited to see 2 Romanov exhibitions  and thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Chesterfield.Welcoming staff comfy clean rooms excellent bathroom and a great position to go to for shopping shows tube etc Thankyou for a pleasant visit,5,2019,01,14
105,Delightful boutique hotel in London ,"We just completed a 3 night stay at this wonderful hotel. The room, service and ambiance were lovely. And the location was so convenient we never needed a taxi or the tube.
When we arrived at 10 pm we were able to enjoy wine and some delicious pub food while listening to the piano in the warm, comfy bar.
We definitely will plan to stay here again!",5,2019,01,14
105,Easy 5 out of 5,"Stayed here as it's only a 15 minute walk from the London Palladium and a couple of minutes from the tube.
Staff were all friendly, polite and helpful (we couldn't find the kettle on our room, they came up straight away to show us where it was).
Room was clean, well equipped (USB charger sockets as well as standard sockets) and the beef was comfy.",5,2019,01,14
105,Calm and comfortable,"We have stayed in the Chesterfield on more than 50 occasions in recent years. We have always found it warm and welcoming, and the service level is efficient and unobtrusive. We usually stay in a Classic double; these rooms are not large (the hotel is in a series of Georgian town houses) but we've never found that a problem as we only ever want to use the room as a base while in London for either business or pleasure. We stayed there over last weekend, and the hotel was able to give us an early check-in (which was very helpful as we had tickets for an early matinee). They offer fresh milk as an alternative to the usual sachets, and this was brought to us promptly. Our room rate included breakfast and after a quiet and comfortable night we had an excellent breakfast with well-cooked Eggs Benedict before heading off for our day.",5,2019,01,14
105,What A Place,"Wonderfully located in Mayfair just a few blocks from the tube, busses, shopping, and theater. We only stayed one night and certainly would have liked to stay more. Breakfast and a morning Times were included in our rate, which was a great value. Certainly a much better value than comparable boutique hotels in NYC and the service was great. My only complaint was a very slow draining sink and no hot water for a shower but plenty for a bath. ",5,2019,01,14
105,Outstanding - this is a must visit,"This is truly a hotel that lives up to their values of outstanding customer satisfaction.  From the minute we arrived and were met with such smiling faces on reception and the door manager, Josef's welcome, it felt like this was going to be an outstanding experience.   It more than lived up to expections, particuarly when my mum became poorly and then the support and empathy went above and beyond, for which I was extremely grateful.  Staff, Guests, Food, Ambience is First Class.  Please put it on your 2019 must visit list, a perfect location for the perfect getaway.",5,2019,01,07
105,Perfect Balance...Perfect Harmony...Perfect Location,"This 100 room hotel,discretely tucked away on a charming Mayfair street is only 3 blocks from public transportation and while not glitz it exudes British charm and civility. The rooms(and we had two) aren't large but perfectly designed with ""built ins"" that accommodated  all our luggage and personal effects with room to spare plus a desk(with clerical essentials like rubber bands). The decor was engulfed in in dual design elegant wall covering that made such a cozy and quiet environment over our Christmas stay.The beautiful Christmas trees were real hemlock that gave a wonderful aroma to the lobby.The staff was sort of like Downtown Abbey....impeccable and pleasant.
Chesterfield Mayfair is now our hotel of choice in London, a home away from home.",5,2019,01,07
105,Birthday Treat,"a warm smiled greeting welcomed us on arrival,even Mr pip our jack Russel have a warm greeting.staff very smart and welcoming....room was a bit small but was pleased to see a dog bed and bowls ready for pip..(no doggy treats bag though as described on the site.) clean and tidy. luved all the decor.. breakfast very good.plenty of choices to cater for every diet...made use of the dog sitting service with joszeph which worked out very well..I was worried but pip was fine..he had a great time...very nice touch if a birthday card for me and a cake sent up with our room service...look forward to returning soon..staff definitely made the stay memorable.",5,2019,01,07
105,Post Christmas treat,"We booked here for our Christmas treat instead of spending money on thing for one another that we don’t really need. What an amazing small luxury hotel this is, quintessentially British, superb service all members of staff dressed impeccably but with a very informal friendly manner. Hotel is adorned with fine art and portraits, floors are beautifully carpeted or are marble, the main bar is superb, very elegant and comfortable offering a range of cocktails, fine wines and spirits, in the evening a pianist plays. Rooms are well equipped and comfortable. The main restaurant “Butlers” serves fine cuisine in elegant surroundings. 

Overall this is a superb luxury hotel in the heart of Mayfair that won’t break the bank, of course if you wish you can certainly go wild and spurge, but you can also have a wonderful stay, dine on delicious food and drink on a budget and still be looked after by the very attentive staff and treated like royalty.

Wonderful.",5,2019,01,06
105,Th Chesterfield Mayfair,"This hotel is one out of a storybook. The hotel staff always go above and beyond and try to fully accommodate guests in any capacity. The rooms are gorgeous and large for a London hotel. We asked for a fridge to be placed in the room and they asked what we would like it to be filled with. When we told the front desk our request, they said they would make it happen, which they did. It was perfect! The full English Breakfast was outstanding! I highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2019,01,06
105,Great hotel in a great location!,"Couldn't have picked a better hotel in a better location.  Very-very walkable.  The room was a bit on the small side but was more than adequate.  Great shower pressure!!  The ""free"" breakfast could have been better, but it did the job.",5,2019,01,05
105,"Outstanding Service, Wonderful Honeymoon","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in December while on the first leg of our Christmas honeymoon. Our experience was outstanding. From check in to check out, the staff were professional, helpful, and personable. On our first night, we were so touched when the front desk sent up a bottle of champagne and dessert. We also enjoyed their room service full English breakfast and a delicious dinner in the restaurant. The hotel itself has the feel of a classic private club with rich woods, fabrics, and leather. Everything had character and charm. We will most certainly be returning in the future!",5,2019,01,04
105,Nice hotel close to oxford street ,"We stayed at room 520 for 3 nights during new year. Our booking was made through Costco.
The room is extremely small. The floors were squeaky and bathroom very tight. 
However the hotel staff makes up for all of that. Housekeeping was very nice, and we enjoyed the surprises everyday chocolate, aroma therapy for shower. 
The room service was so prompt. 
The breakfast spread was very huge and nice.
We enjoyed the afternoon tea service. The afternoon tea service was complementary for us and we presented the voucher upon arrival to the restaurant. However, after the tea service the lady presented us with the bill!! We had to clarify that which was not pleasant. As a result we skipped the complimentary 3 course dinner that we had here.

",3,2019,01,03
105,Wonderful stay,"Immaculate rooms, comfortable beds, delicious food, a warm and welcoming staff and delightful decor made our stay at the Chesterfield a true delight.  Joe in particular was so helpful - we really appreciated him.",5,2019,01,03
105,Pre-Christmas Stay,"This was a Christmas treat for us to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair. The location is ideal for walking to the underground (Green Park is the closet). Sheperd Market is around the corner with great restaurants, pubs and shops. There is a wonderful little all-day breakfast place close by too (can't remember the name!).  They place is decorated for Christmas which had a lovely feel.  We didn't use any of the facilities (restaurants, bar, etc.). The hot chocolate in the foyer was a nice touch.  The staff were courteous and helpful. We booked our room through Expedia and I believe in doing so, we got an okay room (certainly nothing like any of the room photos). The room was a standard double. Bed was comfortable. We pre-paid for the room but the hotel then also holds a 55GBP per night ""deposit"" from your credit card.",4,2019,01,03
105,Return visit to Chesterfield Mayfair,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair and it was even better than before.  We had outstanding service from the moment we arrived and were warmly greeted. The bar is charming, well equipped, and friendly service The rooms and public areas are beautifully decorated, and the hotel is on a quiet Mayfair street convenient for easy walks to Piccadilly, Green Park, Hyde Park, Bond Street, and other attractions. There is excellent dining and shopping nearby (especially in Shepherd Market). Great location and service. Fine for romantic couples or for friends.

The accessibility questions ask if there's an automatic door: there isn't a need for one since there's always a doorman.",5,2019,01,01
105,Does it live up to the Mayfair Standard ?,"I visited this hotel for a Christmas Afternoon Tea with my family and if I'm honest it had a lovely ambiance and the staff gave amazing service . This was not a typical afternoon tea , in my opinion it was nice but not outstanding . I would visit this hotel again for sure but not for the afternoon tea . If you do consider visiting and trying out the afternoon tea , you definitely should and bring children if have them as they do give you free sweets !",4,2019,01,01
105,Perfect stay for the holiday!,"To stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair is to be treated a bit like royalty.  From the welcoming doormen and front desk concierge, we had a warm, friendly, and professional welcome to a beautiful hotel, bar, and restaurant.  All the staff are very nice and service was top-notch!  The rooms are clean, very English “boutique” feel to us three Americans.  The bathrooms are spotless and the beds are comfortable (got a good night’s sleep all seven nights!).  The morning breakfast buffets were a yummy and filling way to start our days of touring the fabulous city of London.  The hotel was decorated for Christmas with a large gingerbread house replica of the hotel, big Christmas tree, and a live Santa Clause in the foyer Christmas Day!  What a treat!  Our (queen) rooms were large enough with two closets and a place to set a suitcase or two.  Never had any problems while staying at The Chesterfield and would definitely stay again!",5,2018,12,31
105,Very charming and clean,What a nice hotel in downtown London! The room was small but it is in Mayfair where the space probably is valued by per square inch.

The room was warm.,5,2018,12,30
105,Advent time in London,"My Family and I were here at first week of Dec.
We had a such a wonderful time, location was very convenient and the food was very delicious as well  ... from the first moment all the staff were really kind and helpful ( at the reception was a Hungarian girl who helped us a lot... and In the restaurant was the other girl from Ukraine who always welcomed us warmly. The room was cozy and cleaned as well.
We just loved every moment, recommend highly this hotel to everyone.
I hope we will be back soon!",5,2018,12,30
105,Great Small Hotel.,Choose it purely based on price for location. It was way better then expected. Brilliant staff and cozy atmosphere. The rooms are small and the bathrooms smaller but it’s all clean and feels welcoming and homely. Cleaners came in daily and doorman was so helpful and genuinely a nice guy. Great for getting around London as the location is spot on. Would definitely use again.,5,2018,12,30
105,Christmas treat,"Wow what a fantastic hotel. Amazing staff, beautifully decorated, the welcome from staff was second to none. All the staff are so polite and have time to talk to their guests. We had a lovely dinner in the Butler Restaurant and a delicious breakfast. We returned to the hotel to have Winter Wonderland Afternoon tea is was outstanding. The bar staff were so very welcoming and the range of drinks and cocktails was fantastic. Our room was spotless as was the rest of the hotel . It was a wonderful stay and I have already been thinking about my return visit. Set in the heart of Mayfair it certainly is on my list for next year.",5,2018,12,30
105,one of the best place to rest and to start to visit London,"One of the London's best 4 stars hotel.

Located in Mayfair, at 10 minutes to walk to Picadilly.
Nice and frendly decorated rooms and public areas.
All rooms are beautifully designed in a genuine way.
The rooms and all around are as clean as possible.

Superior King room offers a very warm and roomy space.
Very comfortable king bed with a very soft mattress.
Heating system/air conditioning works very well and as silent as possible.

Breakfast very good, indeed. 
You may enjoy dinner in the hotel restaurant. 
They have a gourmet a la carte restaurant there. 
The chef prepares every evening a selective and creative cuisine.
They have a good choice of local and international wine.

We met there a very kind, helpful and polite staff. Common sense and bona fide are at their home.
The receptionists were very kind, we were delighted to find they had the answers and directions for any question or request.
The management of the hotel is well done. 

Definitely we will come back there and I advise everyone to try this amazing place.
ON A SCALE FROM 1 TO 10 WE GIVE TO THIS HOTEL AND RESTAURANT:  9.50",4,2018,12,28
105,can only recommend it !,"Located in Mayfair, a few steps from Green park and Hyde Park.
The rooms where clean, bathroom, though a little bit small, did the job.
There is also a turn down service.
Breakfast, excellent, we also had dinner one evening, we didnt regret it.
Staff was also nice.
best of it, it remains quiet cheap compared to some other hotels in London.",5,2018,12,28
105,Relaxing Christmas stay,"My wife and I stayed for two nights with our 7 month old son on 18th / 19th Dec. We had a terrific time and were treated really well by the Chesterfield staff. The room was very comfortable and had a cot for our son. The food was delicious especially the breakfast and our Christmas dinner. Some staff members that were particularly helpful were:
Adriana, Denisa, Mariuza, Darren, Paolo. 
Thanks for a lovely time.",5,2018,12,28
105,Gin tasting at the Chesterfield,"I’ve been enjoying Gin and thought it’d be fun to find a bit more about this wonderful spirit. I reserved a “Gin Tasting” experience for myself and husband in the Terrace Bar with the talented mixologist Adrian. It was wonderful! Adrian is very knowledgeable and provided us with just the right amount of information about what we were tasting. The subtle differences were surprising and delicious. I recommend you give it a try if you are staying at the delightful Chesterfield or in the Mayfair area. My husband, who is usually not a Gin drinker confessed that he’d been converted although he has reserved a tasting with Adrian this evening for a Scotch tasting... a switch from his usual Bourbon preference.

105,"Great location, old world charm, great staff","We stayed here two weeks ago (December 2018)  occupying two rooms, for 4 people, 
The hotel is located in a beautiful neighborhood, close to shops, restaurants, and in a safe upscale area.
The staff is super friendly, and always offering assistance.  Doorman always offering umbrellas, getting a cab in time, and cheerful. 
Decor is rich and very English, which is the true charm of the place.  
Rooms are small with barely enough room to walk around the desk and beds, but you will have adequate space to sleep, hang your clothes, or sit down to put on your shoes.  Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are also small, but clean and updated.  Breakfast which is included in the daily rate is good.  You can use the buffet or order your own breakfast.    If you like to experience the ""real feel"" of London, try this hotel.",4,2018,12,25
105,great!!,"this was a great hotel. the staff were really sweet, the rooms were very nice & cozy, plus the room service was amazing!! it’s in a great location as well. we got little treats on our pillows each morning which was great. ",5,2018,12,23
105,Amazing!,"I came for dinner at the chesterfield on Wednesday. We were sat in the lovely restaurant which has been tastefully decorated for the time of year. My waiter was Fiachra who introduced the menu and explained that days carving trolley. He was very knowledgeable about all the dishes and showed a great deal of enthusiasm. He also helped me pick out a wine that would go with my &nbsp;meal. The food was incredible and so delicious I couldn’t wait for my next bite and was sad when I finished. As I was only in London for one night this was the best experience I could have possibly have asked for, everything was wow. I shall be returning in the new year with my family.",5,2018,12,20
105,My Best experience in London,"I came to the bar on Thursday with my work colleagues for a few drinks as a little Christmas thank you. The bar was very busy but the service was great we never felt over looked. Siebe was our waiter and was brilliant in helping us pick out some gins from the huge selection. I went for the Brockmans gin which I have since bought a bottle for home. All my colleagues were blown away by our little find. The drinks, service and food was all impeccable. We shall be coming more often to try more of what the Chesterfield has to offer.",5,2018,12,20
105,Stunning,What a fabulous hotel this is.   Full of old chArm London elegance.  The staff are lovely.  The rooms are elegant and have everything you would require.   Breakfast was amazing. Great location in the centre of town.,5,2018,12,17
105,A very old and distinguished little hotel,"Peaceful, nice, good service, in a very good neighborhood,  next to major attractions in town.  Naturally it has not major services such as food,like the new giant modern hotels, but it is cosy and comfortable. For years I stayed there, since it had a very good cost/benefit relation. After remodeled prices increase, but still is not expensive. A pleasant walk can be done in the surrounding areal Very recommended for a quick business stay or a romantic couple to enjoy peace and quietness. ",4,2018,12,17
105,Amazing stay,"Stayed for a couple of days in this hotel and felt like it was too less!
Extremely friendly staff.. Very helpful and the services along with the amenities were truly excellent!.. Breakfast was excellent with variety of dishes to choose from!! 
Also the location of the hotel is perfect!.. Highly recommended ",5,2018,12,16
105,Excellent services and location,Beautiful British decor. Friendly check in staff and doorman.  Good house keeping.  Quality 4-day stay.  Full amenities that fits business needs. Partner with a fitness nearby.  Location is superb. Breakfast is good with lots of selection.  Highly recommended. ,5,2018,12,16
105,After pleasant stay huge disappointment with response to issue,"I stayed at the Chesterfield with my wife as a night away for her B'day, hotel was pleasant and old world charm. To save time and effort i booked valet parking, when my car was returned to me the following day there was significant damage to my car (passenger door) resulting in several thousands of pounds worth of damage. Had my wife not been with me i would have driven away unaware as the damage was on the passenger door as the valet had failed to mention any incident. I took the issue calmly as accidents happen and even the concierge commented on this. When I took the car in to have the work inspected by a specialist he confirmed that the damage was caused not by a car but by it being scraped against a coloured bollard/post and (most disappointingly)  it would have been impossible for the driver not to be aware due to nature of damage. It then took several weeks and numerous chasing emails with various excuses as to why it was taking so long, eventually the hotel did admit liability and agreed to pay for repairs. At my own expense and inconvenience i then had to make 3*80 mile round trips to sort issue and take time off work. Following the work there was an outstanding balance i settled which the hotel didn't respond to the repairers request for payment. No compensation, I even paid for the valet parking. Given i had bought the car for my wife a few weeks before was hardly the end to the weekend we had wanted....  PS the one person who did seem to genuinely to want to resolve  was Darren Briggs Head Concierge, maybe some of his colleagues could take note on his approach to customer care.",1,2018,12,14
105,Delighful Hotel with Impecable Service,"After a long flight from across the pond, and a challenge getting to the hotel through the Brexit demonstration, this was a real gem in the Mayfair area of London. We were only there one evening and would have enjoyed spending another night there to explore the neighborhood that seemed to have lots of wonderful shops and restaurants.  As you can expect in London, the room was small, but very comfortable with a good-sized bathroom.  The service was excellent and available to provide recommendations and assistance as needed.  Definitely a place to stay when we return.",5,2018,12,12
105,Absolutely Amazing - a very special stay!,"Previously I have written about how every year my Mum and I venture to London in search of its treasures. Five-star hotels, Michelin star restaurants, amazing shopping and phenomenal high teas! We call it Paddington Day. It’s a once a year spoil. Mother and daughter time. This year we celebrated our 6th Paddington Day...

For the third year running, we chose the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (for good reason). Although not technically a five-star hotel, the service, exquisite & charming decor and personal touches surpasses the best hotels in London. 

Our room is always beautifully decorated with beautiful furniture and finishing touches. The bar area is fantastic with ambient lighting, big comfortable couches and excellent drinks and snacks... Breakfasts are also delicious and varied. A menu offering cooked breakfasts and a delicious buffet. 

I could go on and on but I have to stop talking about the hotel (even though beautiful) and focus on the Chesterfield Mayfairs biggest asset - their staff! The smiles, friendliness, warm greetings, professionalism and care shown by the Chesterfield staff is beyond what you will find anywhere else. 

This year at breakfast we were greeted by the receptionist Barbara with a thoughtful, beautifully wrapped Paddington Day gift, all themed with Paddington Bear to celebrate our occasion. She had remembered our story about Paddington Day and with the hotel so kindly offeelse my Mum and I this gift that made us feel so special and remembered. Talk about a thoughtful gesture. We were blown away! It’s the personal touches at the Mayfair that you won’t get anywhere else.  Thank you Mayfair and thank you Barbara for your attention to detail, warmth, care and professionalism. You know how to make your guests feel special. In fact all the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair are all friendly, attentive and caring. When it comes to service not only do they get it right but go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and special.

Our last Paddington Day night after the theatre, it was like coming home after a cold night. We grabbed our free hot chocolate in the reception, entered our room after a turndown service complete with another small gift on our pillows.

I lay my head on the beautiful Egyptian cotton pillow, planning our next trip to the Chesterfield Mayfair.

You can't go wrong here! 

",5,2018,12,12
105,Nice stay,"Had a lovely time at The Chesterfield Hotel. I live in Los Angeles and typically stay in larger, higher end hotels. The Chesterfield is a very reasonably priced hotel in a fantastic area of London-Mayfair. The room was quite small and the bathroom tiny (standard King) but had everything I needed. I was traveling alone so it had ample space but would have been too tight if I was with my husband. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bar charming and comfortable. The dining room could use updating, looking a bit tired. I will recommend this hotel to friends and family looking for a well priced, nice boutique hotel. ",4,2018,12,11
105,Quaint Hotel in gem location,"Spent two nights in this hotel with my daughter 
Fabulous location, short walk to major attractions 
Rooms were quaint and cosy
Bar had a nice ambiance, piano player added to this
Special mention to Joe who was always helpful, obliging and pleasant during our stay
Would definitely stay at the Chesterfield when in London next time !",4,2018,12,09
105,Amazing stay at Chesterfield!,"Lovely hotel in a good location. The location was in such a way that I was able to access to different places in London that I wished for. It is within walking distance of many attractions.The staffs were gracious, welcoming and services in all areas were excellent. The food was great and the dining was in a grand style. 

Had a lovely stay at Chesterfield. I would definitely recommend this hotel and return myself. A fabulous place! ",5,2018,12,09
105,Excellent stay,"A very well operated hotel....minutes from Piccadilly, Bond Street and the west end sights.We stayed in The Berkeley suite for a 3 night stay and absolutely loved it!
A beautifully furnished room... plush gold striped fabric covered walls...rich blue and gold carpet..thick velvet drapes...interesting pieces of furniture...well fitted marble bathroom with high quality towels and toiletries...a very comfortable place to stay. Downstairs was just as plush...we did not eat in the hotel as we had previous dining reservations but we would have had no hesitation eating here as the restaurant and menu looked extremely inviting.  Lobby and reception staff were delightful and very helpful.....Housekeeping was to a very high standard..If you want an individual high quality hotel in a quiet street in the heart of the west end...this is the place for you.
We hope to return.....",5,2018,12,08
105,Still Good,"We are fans of hotels of the Red Carnation Group and over time have stayed in a number of them and have recently stayed at the  Chesterfield again having not been there for some time and on the whole the experience was fine.  However we feel it maybe slightly losing the polish we have become to expect, the check in was fine, just that, no pleasantries, maybe a smile and some information eg what time breakfast is served etc all too robotic. Our room was comfortable if slightly cramped, however showing serious signs of wear & tear, the shower leaked and flooded the floor and a tap was broken and the lighting in the room for reading was poor.
On the plus side overall it still is a very nice property, a nice bar area,  an excellent breakfast with great selection and thank you to the excellent concierge gentleman for assisting us on check out sorry did not get your name but was from Sicily.
Would we return? Probably as the location for us very convenient for our reasons for visiting London.",4,2018,12,07
105,Festive afternoon Tea,"A delicious tea served with charm and courtesy. We were welcomed, seated and served a delicious tea bought to celebrate my son's birthday. The service was excellent and I would recommend this to anyone! Thank you to Rafcal our waiter who went above and beyond the call of duty and definitely made the event a special occasion.",5,2018,12,06
105,Afternoon tea,What a wonderful way to spend a Sunday . Afternoon tea with friends was probably the highlight of my weekend in London. The hotel is intimate with amazing character and you feel at home from the minute you step inside the door -This was largely due to the staff. They provided attention and service that was discrete but outstanding. Fiachra served our table and introduced me to licorice tea and the most divine pistachio treat. I observed other staff Mauricio and Alejandro and their wonderful interaction with children. This was an experience to be repeated.,5,2018,12,05
105,First Class!,"Stayed at the Chesterfield many times with consistently high customer care levels. The hotel is in a great, effluent  location within reach of many top landmarks and transport links. Obviously not a budget hotel but you get what you pay for.. quality!",5,2018,12,04
105,Civil wedding ceremony,"We had a small and intimate civil wedding ceremony at this venue. Despite the fact that we were on a tight budget, the events and catering team left no stone unturned to provide an excellent service, from the start till the end! Many thanks to Kornelia from the events team, and Spartaco and his catering team for a flawless service on the day - nothing was too much an ask and we had a very warm welcome and great service. We were offered the salon to get ready and store our belongings by the events team, as we were not staying at the hotel, which was of immense help. I had requested the events team to ensure there would be a mirror in the room on the day, as i would be getting my hair done - although the mirror was not there when we arrived, this was quickly sorted, and the team ensured that as a bride i was stress free! One of our friends had prepared a surprise video for us, and Spartaco's team ensured that that a tv screen was made available in the Library (where we held the ceremony), without any fuss. I was also told by my guests that before the ceremony started, the whole Chesterfield team worked seamlessly to ensure everyone, especially the groom, was relaxed and stress free. The decoration and setting was spot on - i am usually extremely meticulous and fussy but i can find no fault with the team. 
Another thing that impressed me was that when we arrived at the venue, in an Uber which parked across the venue, the doorman and porter came straightaway towards us and asked if we were coming to the hotel (it was not immediately obvious as we were parked further down) and offered assistance with our belongings.
Would definitely go back and could not recommend enough - great value for money for the location and excellent service :)",5,2018,12,04
105,Magical !,"This was my first visit to The Chesterfield hotel but it certainly won’t be my last. What a wonderful hotel, close to Green Park tube station, in a quiet location, but still so much part of the Christmas atmosphere. The hotel oozes Christmas spirit from the moment you step inside the front door, complimentary hot chocolate in the foyer to add to the very warm welcome. The Winter Wonderland Afternoon Tea on Sunday afternoon was a very special experience, wonderful food and exceptional service added to by the lovely background singer. Such a selection of food on offer! The Brie and ham hock sandwich was my particular favourite, closely followed by the superb pistachio cake. Special thanks to Spartaco, Ieva and Deniso for looking after us so well and making it a truly memorable experience.",5,2018,12,03
105,The Chesterfield: One of a Kind! ,"The Chesterfield Mayfair truly is top class! The location is perfect and only a short walk from Green Park station, which is ideal at this time of year if you want to be right in the centre of all the Christmas festivities! The moment you walk through the front door you are greeted with friendly faces and warm smiles and this can be said for the staff throughout the whole hotel! 
The highlight of my trip though, had to be the Winter Wonderland Afternoon tea! The Chocolate Yule log was to die for and I have to say a special thanks to Tony and Miruna for looking after us so well! I will definitely be back and this could be the start of a new annual Christmas tradition!! 
",5,2018,12,02
105,Exceptional service,"We stayed recently to celebrate my Mother's 80th and Father's 89th birthday, the staff throughout were exceptionally charming, helpful and friendly. We very much appreciated the special attention, treats, upgrades and cards for my parents; so much attention to detail. 
Rooms are luxurious and well appointed, decor sumptuous and stylish. Breakfast is a wonderful spread of continental choices and quality hot dishes cooked to order.
Hopefully we will return for the next milestone birthday!",5,2018,11,30
105,Wonderful and Welcoming Hotel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of our favorite hotels!  This was our second stay at and we cannot say enough good things about our experience.  The staff is so welcoming and friendly.  We especially enjoyed Joszef and Paolo who greeted us each time we returned to the hotel putting a smile on our face.  We also enjoyed the bartender James who was friendly and cordial and handled a busy evening very well.

The location is great-in a quiet neighborhood yet convenient to Hyde Park and shopping.  The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds are very comfortable.
The breakfast has a nice selection of made to order selections and a continental buffet with friendly and helpful service.  

The only negative we would have is that the shower splashes out getting the entire floor wet.",5,2018,11,28
105,Long weekend,"From the minute we arrived to our leaving four days later everyone at the Chesterfield did their utmost to make our visit to London a great success especially as I was on crutches.
Your hotel,in which everything is five star is a credit to you all.
Many thanks John and Carole 

",5,2018,11,26
105,Best Hotel in London,"My experience here was suburb and this has become my absolute first choice of accommodation in London.  Mayfair is the nicest location in London in my opening, and that is were this hotel is.  Although, it has very English traditional style, it is perfectly intact and well maintained.  Service as well as concierge are excellent.  Food is also great.",5,2018,11,26
105,What a great find,We stayed 4 nights and can' t say enough about their service.  We had to change one of our tours and they even called the tour and got it changed for us. In addition Elliot managed to ship some things home for us.  Every little detail is handled with ease.,5,2018,11,24
105,Thankyou for making my friends wedding day magical,"I attended my best friends wedding a few weeks ago and I have to say how amazing all of the staff were in making their day so magical from start to finish there was a personal and family approach with everything,  the venue is beautiful and it was such a lovely experience. I had the pleasure of meeting Spartaco and Erik who personally assisted all of our needs on the day with kindness and care, Thankyou both for making our experience at the chesterfield so welcoming you are a credit to the hotel.",5,2018,11,21
105,Excellent,"We stayed here recently and I couldn't fault this hotel ! 

Exceptional customer service from all members of staff but both Letitia and Lois went above and beyond our expectations.

The hotel is in a perfect location, situated in the heart of Mayfair and close to many excellent restaurants. 

The bar is a great place to relax on an evening and enjoy the live music. 

Our room was beautiful and we cannot wait to return! 
",5,2018,11,20
105,Lovely hotel,"It is a beautiful old building and the hotel is lovely. The staff is friendly and very helpful.  Special mention goes to Joe who could not have been nicer or more on the ball. It is literally a minute from Berkeley Square, and not much more to Oxford Street, Regent Street etc.",5,2018,11,20
105,Just Perfect!,"We again had the pleasure of staying at this superb hotel  recently. The staff are so genuinely  warm and friendly. You can see they love working here,The breakfast is sublime, the resident pianist in the bar  is an absolute joy. We hope to return very soon",5,2018,11,19
105,Very small rooms,"Staff are very nice and the hotel is in a great location. My only complaint was the size of the room. Very small and the double bed took up most of the room - if you were sitting at the desk working your chair was right against the bed. Bathroom was tiny - you could shave, sit on the toilet and have a bath at the same time. For the amount paid I would expect a larger room. Very disappointing. They also advertise how nice the library is _ I never got to see it as there was a function on all the time I was there. Will not stay there again.",2,2018,11,19
105,Perfect!!,So the entire experience was enchanting… Breakfast included is extremely nice. Staff extremely welcoming especially Joe!   Received nothing short of superior friendly service.  Just a few blocks from Berkeley Square.,5,2018,11,17
105,Just what we were looking for!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 3 nights in late October. I was looking for a hotel where we could truly get a British experience. This hotel totally delivered. It is in a beautiful neighborhood, yet walking distance to tons of restaurants, shops and the Tube.  The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good every morning. We did not have dinner at the hotel but had drinks in the Pub, which was very enjoyable. The service is great at this hotel as well. This will definitely be my go-to hotel when traveling to London in the future.",5,2018,11,16
105,I have never been more impressed with a staff!,"From the room (feeling like the perfect London Experience) to the AMAZING staff and the beautiful surprises in our room every evening (we were there celebrating birthdays).  This hotel is by far my favorite- I plan to stay here for years to come.  I thank Elliot, Antonio, Karolis, Paolo and the entire staff for all of their help in making it the most amazing London Adventure",5,2018,11,14
105,The London Adventure ,"With a playfully historic decor, the only thing better than the cocktails and service were being judged by the ominously lit busts of famous composers from the classical and romantic eras. Being awfully American, we truly appreciated being welcomed by the professional, skilled, and patient staff manning the bar. Adrian, Sebie, and Dario were forced to deal with us most every evening of our 6 night stay. Dario was very attentive and helpful as was Sebie, quickly picking up on our humor. Adrian’s old-fashioneds were fantastic, he also whipped up specialty cocktails depending on our mood and killed the molecular cocktails. 

Overall the service was wonderful and we will surely pop into the bar on our next visit in the area. ",5,2018,11,13
105,Adrian and Terrace Bar staff are amazing!,"We came to the Chesterfield for business for about a week in November. We would find ourselves in the Terrace Bar downstairs after our work events with our friends. The bar staff (and, frankly, all the employees at the hotel) were kind, courteous and very fun! Adrian and Dario were especially great and kept us entertained with great stories and excellent drinks/food. Overall, the hotel is amazing and the staff are extremely accommodating. I would absolutely recommend to anyone!",5,2018,11,13
105,Traditional and wonderful,"To get your dose of classic British style and service, stay at this lovely hotel. We had to wait for maybe 15 min after their 2 pm check-in, and they felt so bad that they upgraded our superior room to an executive suite, and comped us drinks at the bar.  Speaking of the bar, traditional with terrific drinks menu and competent bartenders. Room was beautiful and quiet, bed was exceptional. Highly recommended!",5,2018,11,13
105,Too short,"We stayed one night before flying out, very nice hotel. Excellent bell service and front desk. Location is very good and easy to get around London.  Everything as good as we could hope or better. We will return ",5,2018,11,12
105,The Best,The staff was outstanding. The hotel exudes sophisticated English charm. The room while small was lovely. The bedding very comfortable and cozy. The location- Mayfair is my favorite- walking distance to so so much. I have stayed here a  number of times before and will definitely stay again. Be sure to visit Shepherds Market for great restaurants.,5,2018,11,12
105,A+ Customer Service,"The first time we visited London, we stayed with a tour group at a very corporate hotel.  This time, we came on our own for an NFL game and stayed at this gem of a hotel.  The customer service was amazing; we got so much personal attention and assistance from the concierges, the valets, etc.  They helped us so much and made our visit so much easier.  We thought our room was very comfortable, the room service was exceptional (perhaps the best we've ever had at a hotel), and the breakfasts and dinners we had were scrumptious.  We also had afternoon tea, which was very special and you should make sure not to miss.  One afternoon there was a jazz quartet playing in the bar, and they were fantastic!  We found the hotel's location to be very convenient, because we were very close to lots of restaurants, Buckingham Palace/Hyde Park, Oxford Street shopping, and the Green Park stop on the Underground.    We would come back here in a heartbeat; we loved every minute!  Thank you!",5,2018,11,12
105,Too good not to review,"Perfect location. It is within walking distance to many of the great places to visit in London.  An easy walk as well to the Green Park station  to catch the underground.  The room was not huge, but beautifully appointed, useable space for a change; fresh tea, coffee, biscuits each morning.  Staff is warm, welcoming and helpful from the front desk to the bar, doormen, and those who care for the room.  I doubt we would stay anywhere else on return to London.  Thanks to all for a wonderful stay.  Hopefully, we will be able to come back again!",5,2018,11,10
105,What a special place. Amazing family afternoon tea,We visited the hotel today for afternoon tea. It was my daughters 8th birthday. What a special experience. The team went above and beyond to make the experience special. The waiting staff were excellent and even presented her and her sister with a Teddy bear each. What a lovely gesture. I would definitely recommend this for a special birthday celebration for adults and children. They really do their best to make it special,5,2018,11,10
105,A True Gem in the Mayfair District of London,"We stayed in a lovely room entitled ""The Study"". It was simply unique and brought forth ""old world London"".  The walls were lined with faux book shelves!!!   The bed was a very comfortable king bed with luxurious linens.  Great Bathroom with lovely towels and toiletries.  The staff from the front desk, the doormen, the restaurant and bar to housekeepers were so helpful and very friendly.  We loved the story behind the ""red carnation hotels"" and will certainly stay again in this great hotel chain.  Honestly they do treat you like family!!!!",5,2018,11,07
105,Amazing! Wonderful British experience with top notch service!,"We spent eight nights at the Chesterfield and couldn't have hoped for a better experience. First shout out goes to the staff.  We found ourselves in the Terrace Bar every night.  Our bartender/mixologist Adrian always made us feel special--made us feel like we were his best customers.  I was always greeted with a handshake; I felt like he was a friend, not an employee.  This personalized touch truly enhanced our experience.  We participated in the Gin and Tonic Experience and the Whisky Nosing and Tasting, in which Adrian sat with us at a private table and explained the how to appreciate these spirits.  I certainly recommend these experiences.  

When Adrian was absent, James was there to make sure we were provided a top notch experience.  Very proper and professional, James always made sure we were taken care of and provided the treatment you would hope to feel in the Mayfair section of London.  He always remembered our preferred drinks--and I should add he makes phenomenal drinks!

The morning breakfast staff was also wonderful.  Every morning I was greeted by name and everyone went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.  All members of the staff were constantly asking if there was anything we required, how we were enjoying our stay, what we've done and what we planned on doing.  We were often given recommendations based on our itinerary, and I will say it helped us discover places we would otherwise not have discovered that turned out to be amazing.  

Upon entering or exiting the premises, we were always provided the warmest of welcomes.  Antonio, our doorman, always welcomed us with a smile, was always friendly, and always pointing us in the right direction.  It was always a pleasure coming and going.  

The hotel itself provided an amazing atmosphere.  Between the decor and the staff, we were provided a very upper class experience.  Every room is very ornate.  The rooms are not the biggest but most rooms in London aren't.  That said, the size was just fine for the two of us.  The Terrace Bar has a very sophisticated feel, complete with a piano player daily to set the mood.  I also recommend their Afternoon Tea.  The tea room provides a very unique feel and the food is fantastic!  The staff were always dressed, mostly in tuxedos; the doorman complete with a top hat.  Very classy!

Every night we returned to our room we were always found a pleasant surprise.  Whether it was some chocolates or chocolate covered strawberries, it was always a nice discovery.

The location is perfect: a few minute walk to Green Park Station (from there you can easily get anywhere in the city).  I certainly hope to return to London in the near future.  I have no reason to consider any other location than the Chesterfield Mayfair.  I believe the experience provided is well worth the value.  I look forward to my return!",5,2018,11,06
105,Great Stay at a Great Hotel,It was in the heart of London. Classic.  Elegant and great bar service.  If you get a chance try the Twigglets and enjoy a Manhatan on the rocks.  Very convenient to all the main attractions and my son and I had a wonderful time.,5,2018,11,06
105,Visit for business meeting only,First time  at Chesterfield and impressed by the decor and  friendly staff.  We had  a meeting room area  which was quite adequate and a buffet sandwich style lunch. I would certainly consider staying here if overnight in London in future and would love to sample dinner and breakfast given the reviews!,4,2018,11,06
105,"Amazing, once again!",This hotel is the best Hotel I’ve stayed in London. I paid extra to check in early and they knew who I was just as I walked to the desk - magic maybe? Ha! I had eggs Benedict in the morning and sampled their new menu which included items such as coconut soup and beautifully presented scallops - delicious. I feel like Hotel restaurants do not get enough credit so if you have the chance perhaps on your first evening do try the butlers restaurant. Staff were amazing and made me feel special - thank you.,5,2018,11,02
105,Lovely hotel,"Great location and fantastic staff. We stayed the night before the royal parks half and asked if we could have a late check out which they accommodated and also they stored our bags afterwards. We were also offered a very hearty good luck just before we left for the race. 
Our room was clean and had everything we needed.",5,2018,11,02
105,Home away from home,"I travel to London for business and it’s rare to find a business equipped hotel that also makes you feel so at home. I was able to commute to my meetings in the city quite easily and the staff all remembered my name which astonished me. They have free WiFi, 24 hour menu for those late nights, a great restaurant (had one business meeting) and very well trained staff. Hotel business done right",5,2018,11,01
105,Amazing Hotel!!,I do my research ! I looked high and low and narrowed it down to this hotel and the Montague on the gardens which also happens to be part of the red carnation collection. I stayed here because of the fact that it was closer to the places I wanted to visit but also because of the positive reviews online. They did not disappoint everything was as i thought it would be but even better. fantastic warm welcome from Sanae who gave me a gorgeous girly room but also prepared a little pot of ginger tea for me one evening as I was not feeling well. Thanks for everything Sanae and the chesterfield family,5,2018,11,01
105,The GEM of London!!!!,"This hotel is all you need if you looking for relaxation, good food and world class service. My friend recommended this hotel to me and I can gladly say that I was not disappointed. From the doorman, to my check-in and getting to my room, I felt like a Royal as the welcoming experience was so genuine. The hotel is perfectly situated in London Mayfair and the closest tube station, bus stops, restaurants, parks and Buckingham Place is in walk in distance. The Chesterfield team is amazing. A special mention to Letitia and her  incredible team for the amazing hospitality. I will definitely be back soon and next this time I am not traveling alone. This was simply A Home Away From Home Experience!!!! ",5,2018,11,01
105,Incredible stay!,I’m so glad I found the Chesterfield Mayfair! The location absolutely cannot be beat. It’s situated in one of London’s most beautiful neighbors close to major sights and restaurants. The staff and hospitality is top notch. We had the African Safari Suite and it was perfect in every sense! I wouldn’t think of staying anywhere else when we return. ,5,2018,11,01
105,My great time at this hotel,Stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend to celebrate both our birthdays ! They were all so kind to us and even sent a little plate with two cupcakes and two separate birthday cards - now that’s a really nice little touch. We thought everything was beautiful in the hotel from the public areas to the rooms. Thanks for a great birthday stay.,5,2018,11,01
105,AMAZING!!! as was Letitia in Guest Services!!,"Home away from Home!! Just spent 5 FABULOUS days at The Chesterfield and really didn't want to leave! When one has someone as special as Letitia Managing Guest Services, why would you want to?
Everyone could not have been more helpful, yet Letitia made us feel  extra SPECIAL!! She had that ""magic"" to make us feel like VIP's in her down to earth and professional fashion! When we missed our flight home after visiting friends for the weekend..we didn't even consider another hotel option..we called The Chesterfield immediately and were welcomed back with open arms! From the Gentleman at the front doors to the warm reception staff to the old world glamour of the chic bar..it was all just perfect... Thank you to all who we had the pleasure of meeting at this little gem..we will be back!!",5,2018,10,30
105,Charming ,"A wonderful stay in the Chesterfield, it was everything that we had hoped for. Genuinely warm and hospitality staff, great rooms and  great location.
Already planning our next visit. 
Many thanks to all - Greg ",5,2018,10,30
105,Fabulous Hotel indeed!,What a special hotel! No spa is probably why they rank 4 stars but I wouldn’t stay anywhere else after being here. Stayed in a king room over looking the quiet street.  All the rooms are different so they do give you the option to choose if you are organised and do this in advance. I had my breakfast granted complimentary because I booked direct instead of through a third party - you don’t want to miss out on this breakfast or this hotel. Look nowhere else!,5,2018,10,30
105,A London Favourite!,"This hotel has become my new favourite and I will now not stay anywhere else! Every single staff member really treats you with a personalised service and makes you feel as if you're in a home away from home. The doorman Antonino gave me such a warm welcome when I arrived to check in and the receptionist Sanae gave me a beautiful room which was very clean and traditional in decor. I hope to visit the hotel again soon so I can try the afternoon tea, it looks delicious! The hotel itself is in a perfect location if you love to do a bit of shopping, only about 10 mins walk from Oxford St.",5,2018,10,30
105,Loved it,"One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in and that says a lot as I frequent at the ritz and Flemings mayfair. They have something special here, sure rooms are a little smaller but the service is the biggest and most genuine in London. In the U.K even",5,2018,10,30
105,A lovely hidden gem,My stay at chesterfield was an amazing experience. The service and quality of food was superb! I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. They have the best afternoon tea in town-a must try for anyone visiting. Will be back here soon x,5,2018,10,30
105,Amazing!!!,"Oasis in mayfair with a very cool bar that feels like a private club. Innovative cocktails. We stayed in a newly refurbished room it still smelt new, this is a British Hotel with all the modern furnishings. Sky channels meant none of those hefty prices to watch a movie. The front desk was extremely friendly without being overbearing- seems to be great training of staff.",5,2018,10,30
105,Lovely place,"Staff are fantastic ! We received such a warm welcome and when it was time to leave we were genuinely sad. We travel to hotels around the world and this was honestly one of the most genuine hospitality we have witnessed for a while. From the front desk to the blonde housekeeping manager who spoke to us: everyone was so friendly. About the building: the building has a lot of history they even handed me a piece of paper talking about he history of the chesterfield when I asked, we had crisp white sheets and towels, comfortable mattress, cool quirky design and very quiet. Decided to have dinner one evening the scallops had a great presentation and sort of melted in my mouth. Overall 10/10 for the chesterfield",5,2018,10,30
105,The Mayfair experience!,What a beautiful stay we had! Stayed on the Mayfair weekend package which really helped having that later check out included. All were excellent on the front desk and especially in room service as we ordered that quite a few times - great menu. Would definitely stay here again when we next visit London,5,2018,10,30
105,Great great Hotel and break away.,Visited London for a break away. I wanted a central hotel but nothing too noisy and busy. Chose the hotel for its location and British quaintness- I was delighted with my choice of Hotel. I went to watch a few shows in the West end - Book of Mormon (hilarious) as well as kinky boots. The concierge recommended shows close to the area and helped me get taxis wherever I needed to go. Very nice room on the 5th floor had been refurbished was nice and airy and sunshine streamed through in the morning as I read the paper and had my breakfast delivered in bed. Very nice stay in the perfect location,5,2018,10,29
105,Awesome Stay,"We really loved our stay in mayfair. Very reasonably priced for what you get in the heart of london, close to everything we needed in London. The staff were superb and our room was well maintained. 5 stars",5,2018,10,29
105,Dance Choreographer,"Alright first of all this place is legit amazing stayed here for 3 nights it’s very close to the city. Awesome location. Staff super friendly and funny. I needed a late check out and they extended it to 2pm which I needed badly due to my flight details very thankful for the assist on that one. 

Front desk has what I now call HsH Lol - Hotel Super Heros. Thank to Letitia and everyone at the friend desk for taking such good care of of me. My next trip I am definitely going back and this time for longer - such a home away from home and I loved it.",5,2018,10,29
105,Lovely stay,"This hotel is ranked 4 stars but their service is really 9 stars. The staff go out of their way to ensure you have all you need. They recommended a little area around the corner for food as we had eaten in the hotel 2 nights in a row and the friendly door man jozeph actually walked us there because my mother is directionally challenged! They had great martinis and the pianist was quite nice to listen to each evening after a long day of exploring london. We returned to the hotel and had a nice cooling glass of lemonade offered to us, perfect after a long day! Not quite ready for hot chocolate so this lemonade was so nice. Thank you we will definitely be back.",5,2018,10,29
105,A Hidden Gem ,"I was in London to watch the american football at wembley when i found this little gem hidden away on a back street in mayfair ,very freindly staff & the best breakfast ive ever had are just two of the many reasons why i will be back again I booked a single room but the very helpfull Sanae on reception upgraded me to a bigger King bedded room when she noticed how tall i am to help me enjoy my stay even more superb .",5,2018,10,29
105,Amazing Hotel,"The most helpful staff in mayfair ! Stayed to celebrate an anniversary and we were wished happy anniversary on check in, by the guest Services Manager, in the restaurant and even when we left ! We are glad we picked this hotel for our special celebration. They even gave us a card and two cupcake plates to congratulate us. We stayed in a king room
Which had all we needed including tea and coffee making facilities. The bar was nice with live music and one of the nights I think it was Wednesday had a whole jazz band but we were out that evening. Overall great hotel.",5,2018,10,29
105,Home away from home,"If you're looking for comfort and style in one then look no further. This hotel has all the comforts of home with the classic old English style. Stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday and was overwhelmed at the fuss which was made. Staff all over the hotel knew and were wishing me happy birthday. All the way from the front desk to the restaurant. 

Room was large and comfortable with great amenities. Shopping (a girls best friend) was only a stone's throw away, local tube station and bus stops within a few minutes walk.

Thanks to all the staff at the Chesterfield you will definitely be seeing me again!!!",5,2018,10,29
105,Can’t wait to return,Stayed in this magnificent property. We arrived early and the front desk put our room on priority with the housekeepers and we really appreciated this. They took care of ya throughout our stay and the food was excellent. We will definitely return,5,2018,10,29
105,What a pleasant stay,"I attended an event at the Dorchester but didn’t really want to pay the Dorchester prices. Looked on trip advisor and found this gem of a hotel - I had a cocktail with my husband before the event and they were carefully crafted. We got the room for £320 including full English breakfast and were even pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary upgrade on check in - thank you! Sanae checked us in and not only was she friendly she even offered to walk us up to the room which we politely declined. The breakfast was a vast spread of all you could want for breakfast: cheese, fruit, salmon and even little blueberry muffins. What a fantastic one night in the chesterfield - we were so comfortable we didn’t even want to go to the Dorchester! We will be back again.",5,2018,10,29
105,Very nice,"This hotel is a gem in the heart of mayfair. I usually stay at the Flemings around he corner and wanted something different. The hotel is typically British and as soon as you walk in it’s marble floors, an enchanting bar straight ahead and friendly smiles from the front desk. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a glass of lemonade from a friendly young lady who also welcomed me to the hotel. I stayed on the 7th floor in a blue room which was beautiful and well appointed. I’ll be back",5,2018,10,29
105,Mrs,"Stayed here for one night with my partner and the hotel was fantastic. Very friendly check in from Sanae who was a delight and even described the room to be before I went up. Thank you for making my stay so enjoyable, breakfast was again fantastic - had it in the room as I had to rush to work. Thank you",5,2018,10,29
105,Amazing hotel with great service.,I recently started for 5 nights at the chesterfield mayfair Hotel with my daughter. When we arrived our room was not ready but they were so efficient at storing our luggage while we explored london. We returned to our beautiful twin room with the luggage waiting in the room. The front desk and lobby manager were very friendly and took interest in us everyday. We enjoyed a few drinks in the bar each evening and had breakfast included in the package - it’s real breakfast too with an a la carte menu and all. We will definitely return to this fantastic hotel sometime in the near future.,5,2018,10,29
105,"Stay here, skip the others","In a two week trip, I stayed in every type of British hotel/inn and I would certainly say this was head and shoulders above the rest. Skip the big hotels (did those too) as this gives you a more personal feel without getting in your business. Great, comfortable luxurious rooms and a tasty breakfast down. Service and location are above and beyond and you’ll end your trip feeling taken care of.",5,2018,10,28
105,Great stay,"We are repeat visitors to this great hotel which is truly a London experience.  What makes it special is the staff and the attention they give their guests.  They really care.  On this trip it was my wife's Birthday and they made it very special,  complete with a Birthday card signed by the staff.  We will look forward to our next  stay.",5,2018,10,27
105,Wonderful Experience!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for the first time in October.  We were greeted with an unexpected upgrade to a beautiful suite!  The room was very clean and spacious with lovely amenities.  The best part of our stay was the wonderful staff.  Front desk, Bellmen, Housekeeping, Restaurant & Bar servers were all welcoming, helpful, friendly and provided excellent service!  The location of the Chesterfield is perfect...within walking distance of all the major attractions in Westminster including St. James Park, Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Big Ben...etc.  Our only regret is that we didn't have time to attend the Chesterfield's afternoon tea.  Next time!   We'd have a hard time staying anywhere else.",5,2018,10,26
105,Afternoon Delight,"How do you make this English classic stand out from the rest..
Easy, go to the Chesterfield Mayfair and see how a quality establishment does it.
From the start we were greeted well and offered our table quickly. A great selection of teas were on offer and other options explained.
The afternoon Tea was superb fresh and delicious with unlimited replacements on offer, so much so we needed a take away box for the ride home. This along with a large bag of sweets and a bear for both my daughter's and a cake made for us to celebrate our 25th made this a highlight of our visit to London..
If you are In the City book this you won't be sorry",5,2018,10,25
105,Around the world whiskey tasting,"My friend and I went to the around the world whiskey tasting. The setting was great, but best of al was the knowledge imparted by Adriaiu the bar tender who talked us through the tasting process and explained the different methods of each individual whiskey.

We tasted some great options, but it was Adriaiu's friendly demeanour and knowledge that really made the experience enjoyable.",5,2018,10,25
105,Fantastic hotel,"One of my favourite hotels in London. Your made to feel very welcome from start to finish.
Exceptional food and service that never disappoints and what makes a great hotel.

Rooms were spacious and comfortable, will be back...",5,2018,10,23
105,Wedding at Chesterfield Mayfair  Hotel,"Thank you very much for making this beautiful evening happen.The food was delicious, the service was excellent, the whole evening turned out to be better than we expected actually. And both the library and the royal suite looked fabulous. The event manager Kornelia looked after every detail from start to finish, and both her and Spartacus were extremely helpful on the day of the event.

Rafal and Edirlan",5,2018,10,23
105,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"I had originally booked a different hotel and changed my mind after reading mixed reviews. So glad I did as this place is fantastic!

Booked afternoon tea at the Chesterfield hotel to celebrate my wedding anniversary. What a fantastic find in London! The staff were so friendly and helpful continually throughout the afternoon. We had the sweet shop theme afternoon tea. It was beautifully presented starting with a pink lemonade shot. There was a great choice of fresh, tasty sandwiches, delicious scones and the cakes were all based around your old favourite sweet shop flavours- Coca Cola, pear drops, liquorice all sorts and more( don’t want to spoil it for you). The food and drinks were unlimited throughout and we even finished with a bag of sweeties from the trolley to take home. 

We will definitely return as the staff, food and service were outstanding.

",5,2018,10,23
105,Cocktails were banging,"We spent all evening in the bar and it was lush. Lovely man on the piano and great cocktails, we even asked for strawberry daiquiris which weren't on the menu but Adrian catered for us any way and then offered to make passionfruit and grape daiquiris which were even better. I liked all the staff and all the drinks, it was a really nice time",5,2018,10,21
105,Afternoon tea,"Beautiful place, delicious food and the most attentive service I have ever had. Thank you Maurizia, Loris, Ieva and Harry for the most memorable and the very best afternoon tea experience on our London holidays. Natalie from Ukraine",5,2018,10,20
105,Fabulous stay,We stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary and the staff were so thoughtful and lovely. When the check in staff heard that it was our anniversary not only did we get a free upgrade (to the executive suite no less!) but they also sent up some cupcakes and a card that all the staff had signed which made us feel really welcome and added to the fantastic time we had over the weekend,5,2018,10,20
105,Excellent all the way around!,We loved our stay at The Chesterfield!  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel room was your normal European size but very clean. The bathroom was roomy with a bathtub shower combination. We enjoyed the afternoon tea on our first day which was delicious. We ate dinner in their bar area and enjoyed their steak sandwich so much we went there again the next night. Our booking included breakfast which opens at 7:00am but because we had to leave shortly after 7:00 for a tour the hotel allowed us to preorder our breakfast with the menu you hang on your door the night before and it was delivered promptly at 6:30 as requested with no additional fee. Beautiful hotel!  Enjoy!!,5,2018,10,19
105,Splendid 40th Birthday Tea!,"Last Sunday we celebrated our daughter's 40th birthday with a splendid tea at The Chesterfield Hotel.. Butler's Restaurant was the perfect setting and we were welcomed warmly by the wonderful staff.  There were 10 of us, (6 Adults & 4 Children) and we were shown to our beautifully laid table.  The first treat were the pink lemonade shots, presented in a bowl of steamy dry ice and topped with sherbet flying saucers.  Spectacular!  The delicious sandwiches, scones and cakes arrived, stylishly served on tiered stands and all tastes and requirements were catered for, including a dairy-free option for one which we had requested in advance, but could have ordered on the day. There was a vast choice of teas to drink and the children really enjoyed their hot chocolate drinks.

Added to all this was the Sweet Shop theme of the afternoon and all the children (and most of the adults), gleefully gathered around 'The Candy Man' for bags of sweets in old-fashioned stripey bags. Finally came the birthday muffin with a candle for our daughter to blow out while we all sang Happy Birthday, waiting staff too! A wonderful and memorable afternoon was had by all and we would certainly visit Butler's Restaurant at The Chesterfield Hotel again and would heartily recommend it to anyone who would like to have a truly lovely experience.  Thank you to everyone who helped to make our afternoon tea so special.",5,2018,10,18
105,Quintessential British Charm,"After looking at many hotels for this trip of a lifetime, I'm so incredibly glad that we chose this one.  The staff was incredible to us, the hotel has the perfect amount of luxury and our room, while a bit cozy, was elegant and perfectly British. While located on a quiet street in Mayfair, it is in a great location to be close to many attractions including Hyde Park, Oxford Street and Buckingham Palace. I would chose this hotel a 100 times over and recommend anyone to stay there who wants a stylish and accommodating dose of English Charm.",5,2018,10,15
105,Great traditional British hospitality,"Head down to the Chesterfield, if you want a nice traditional and authentic British hospitality.  The breakfast is superb and fresh.  They also serve very good traditional English tea with scones, savouries, etc. to complete a very British experience. The location is also excellent with minutes walk to hyde park and oxford shopping street.",5,2018,10,15
105,Unfriendly front desk staff who lie!,"We checked in to this hotel for one night. The check in girl did not smile once, even though we were talkative and engaging with her. Yes she asked us what we had planned but she was literally like a robot.  
Then she wanted a credit card for  ""extras"".  We told her that there won't be any extras, we will barely actually be at the hotel other than to sleep the one night, as we had a lot planned. After trying to persuade us that we had to leave credit card details and my husband insisting that no we don't, at this point she tore up the key card with Room 414 written on it, binned it, then got another card out and disappeared out the back (no explanation where she was going). She came back a few moments later, still no explanation what she was doing, tapped on her computer then wrote Room 204 on the key card. When I challenged her and asked why our room was changed because we'd refused to give our credit card details, she blatantly lied and said ""this computer is very slow, there is already someone in that room, so I have to put you in another room"".  Sorry but that's total B******t!! At this point we are thinking ""whatever"" as we really won't be there very much anyway. She asked if we wanted help with our luggage, but no thanks we literally had one small bag. So she pointed and told us where the lift is   I then had to ask her where to get breakfast in the morning and what time it is served. Which she explained. It was one of the worst slowest, rudest check ins we have every experienced, considering we'd paid iit all up front before we'd arrived. We have stayed in a lot of hotels around the world and honestly cannot remember being blatantly lied to by the check in staff ever!
So up to our room we go. The Superior King bedroom was bijou and the bathroom was very small. When you used the shower (standing in the bath) the floor and the toilet got soaked. The bed was very uncomfortable, no mattress topper, just a hard sprung mattress and the view out the window didn't exist, just the inner atrium.
Fast forward to breakfast the next morning, again greeted by someone who doesn't smile! Seriously? A smile goes such a long way. Makes you feel welcome, or am I asking too much?!  I ordered poached eggs on toast.  The toast was soggy wet, not from butter because that wasn't even on there, it was wet from where the eggs had been placed straight onto the toast without drying off first.  I showed it to the waiter and he pulled a face because he could see what I was saying and rushed off to get me some more toast.
All I can say is thank goodness we were only there one night and thank goodness I'd used Hotels.com vouchers to pay for the majority of the room and not paid the full £285 for that!
One positive it's a great location, but the area is flooded with hotels, so you don't have to stay here. Honestly I have written many many reviews on here and not ever had to complain about anything like this before.  We really are not the fussy obnoxious clients that I can imagine these hotels get,we're just normal people who don't like complaining.but feel this time it's necessary.  ",2,2018,10,14
105,Great experience ,"The hotel was amazing and the room was incredible. We had a very relaxing stay and the stay were very kind and accommodating.

The staff throughout the entire hotel are amazing doorman, front desk, housekeeping, room service & the restaurant. Great teamwork and we’ll train.

The breakfast is definitely one of the best in London.

Darren & Tyler.",5,2018,10,13
105,Fantastic spot ,"Great service at this semi-boutique place in a lovely neighborhood.  Service is top notch.   Rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  The in-hotel bar and restaurant are nice.   

Easy walk from the Green Park Station, which requires one line change to connect to Paddington and Heathrow Express.  The nearby area of Shepard’s Market is a good place for drinks and food with at least a dozen pubs and restaurants.  And a slightly longer but still easy walk to the bustling business area of St James, Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. ",5,2018,10,12
105,Business dinner event,Kornelia's assistance was great throughout from the organising of menus to the placecards. Dinner was perfect. Service was slick. Would definitely use again. Food was also very good and served in good time. Thank you,5,2018,10,12
105,Excellent Place to Stay in London,"We love the Chesterfield Mayfair. We have stayed there four times over the years and have enjoyed every visit. The bar with live piano music nightly is a highlight. The location is perfect, easy walking distance to Hyde and Green Park, also New Bond Street shopping. The staff is great, they remember our names every time we stay and we hadn't been there in several years.",5,2018,10,10
105,Afternoon Tea ,"From start to finish the Sweet Shop Afternoon was fantastic. Myself and my daughter visited last week and we had one of the loveliest afternoon teas, the sandwiches and cakes were delicious and a very good variety of choice of teas, I had the fruit salad tea! 
I especially liked that they did a children’s menu with the same theme. The service was 10/10, we were made to feel so welcome as soon as we sat down.
You also get a token at the end of the tea which you can use at the Sweetshop Stall where the Candy Man gives you a bag of sweets, a lovely touch.
I would definitely visit again and would recommend highly ",5,2018,10,09
105,"Location, location, location","Spent 6 nights at this great hotel. Location is unparalleled.

Friendly service and good amenities. Lots of restaurants nearby and easy walking to a multitude of tourist attractions. Shopping on Oxford Street a 10 minute walk if that is your thing.",5,2018,10,08
105,Amazing,"We attended the Chesterfield on Thursday for a gin tasting experience.
Amazing!!

James served us and was absolutely amazing.
His knowledge and attentiveness made the evening truly spectacular and we can't wait to come back.

Another fabulous Chesterfield experience.",5,2018,10,05
105,Excelente,"Recently returned from a few nights at the chesterfield and I have to say it was the best London experience I’ve ever had. The hotel old English style but with all the modern needs. I went to the bar on every night and it has the best atmosphere. The piano player is great playing songs you know and some classics. The drinks are also great I was lucky to be there when they were creating some new drinks and they were incredible. The drink I fell in love with is the cucumber gin cooler such a great drink. All the staff I encountered were great always happy to help and smiling, friendly. I can’t wait to return.",5,2018,10,05
105,Terrific hotel in Mayfair,"We recently spent 6 nights at the Chesterfield and were very sad to leave.  The staff at this lovely hotel continuously went out of their way to make us feel special and were extremely helpful to us in planning our London adventures, particularly Karolis.  The food in the hotel was top notch, the rooms spotless, and the Chesterfield's location made for easy travel everywhere we wanted to go.  We will most definitely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair the next time we are in London!",5,2018,10,05
105,Wonderful experience in a perfect location,"First class hotel in every aspect, very nice people eager to help you promptly and pleasantly, great rooms. Breakfast was excellent - high quality food at the buffet or order from the menu. The lounge was lively and fun with live music. Important for me was the location - safe neighborhood for woman travelling alone, close to the tube and bus stations, cabs at the ready. A very old pub, The Punchbowl, is nearby and worth a visit. First class experience, worth the splurge for me.",5,2018,10,05
105,Great hotel in an excellent area of London,Our four night stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair was wonderful from the beginning to the end. The hotel has all of the amenities. Good pubs and restaurants nearby.  Tube station within a few minutes of walking makes it easy to get around London to see its many attractions.  Being close to Piccadilly St makes it pleasant and close walking distance to the palaces and parks. We have stayed at a number of hotels in London and this is one of the best.,5,2018,10,04
105,Renee Booth,"I would like to say that this is one of the VERY best Hotels I have ever stayed in. We were welcomed by Joseph - such a helpful happy man - hewas a pleasure. Our rooms were stunning - so English & “old school”. Was like going back in time. The whole Hotel is beautifully decorated with excellent taste. Even though it is difficult to only mention certain staff members - as all the staff were great - I would just like to say thank you to Barbora in the bar who served us numerous cuppacino’s with delicious biscuits & snacks at lunch time. It was good to meet Letitia, a fellow Zimbabwean. She was so welcoming & really great. She looked after us impeccably!!! Thank you Letitia & ALL the other great staff members. I understand there is a process to get Star ratings & this Hotel is 4 star - I FIRMLY believe it should be made an exception & given 5 stars!!
Thank you again & can’t wait to be staying at The Chesterfield again.

Renee",5,2018,10,04

Thanks to James for our journey - we will certainly continue our Whisky trek. Very happy to recommend.",5,2018,10,02

The staff was so terrific even before our visit they were extremely helpful so service is a huge priority for them . Cheers Joan and Gordon Clack ,  Canada",5,2018,10,01
105,Great hotel in Mayfair,A couple days in London before a cruise. Found this hotel through Trip Advisor. Consistently good ratings. They were right. From the start when they called us by name when we first arrived to when we left and felt like we were leaving family it was first class. Great but smallish Bar. Room was very comfortable. We ate to dinners at the bar. Tried different gin & tonics. Start to finish everything was great. Location made walking everywhere easy. ,5,2018,09,29
105,Great,I’ve just returned from what has to have been the best hotel experience I’ve ever had. I came to the terrace bar on Wednesday evening which is their gin and jazz night. We were introduced to the special gin and jazz menu that they have. I ordered the sweet syncopation which was awesome. It comes with the best chocolate dipped strawberries I’ve ever tasted. I also received some complimentary canapés especially for gin and jazz night. My waiter Alberto was great nothing was too much and made my experience so special. I have to mention the band they have in for this evening are wonderful. They play such great music really sets a brilliant atmosphere. I shall return soon with more people.,5,2018,09,27
105,Perfect,"We spent the weekend in London celebrating my husbands birthday. Excellent location for walking to plenty of restaurants and bars. The hotel is traditional, old style and very comfortable. We had quite a small room overlooking an internal courtyard but it was fine as we didn't spend much time in our  room.  Breakfast was very special, on day one I had poached eggs, sounds simple, but was fabulous and we both had kippers  on our second morning, oh my, they were the best we have ever tasted. They melted in your mouth. Divine.  We had a lovely time and all the staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2018,09,26
105,Perfect!! ,On Sunday I came to the bar with my girlfriend for a drink before we went out to dinner and we were so happy we came. Our waiter was James and he was great he helped us pick out our cocktails and also helped us with our directions to our restaurant. The cocktails we had were the cucumber gin cooler and the English mint julep and they were incredible. We wished we could have spent more time with you but while we were there you made our night. We will come back in the near future and cannot wait to do so.,5,2018,09,24
105,Crummy,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is the Red Carnation group’s first hotel in London; since it’s rehabbed opening they’ve opened five more and clearly have poured capital into the more recent acquisitions at the Chesterfield’s expense.  Prefer Knightsbridge but had to be in Mayfair this trip, used to stay at the big names but prefer small hotels in my dotage and 47 Park Street is now a Marriott condo (the world really is going to the dogs) so tried for first time recently.  Its good location, competent but slow service bar and friendly front desk staff is all it has going for it.  The pretentious portrait of The Earl Chesterfield hanging in the lobby was clearly embarrassed.  Or maybe it just needed restoration.  The remainder of staff was mediocre, some downright strange.   A doorman for example who lectured me that I should not have arranged my own airport pick-up, the hotel does that.  And repeated it.  Guess he wanted his cut.  A porter who reminded me of Dracula’s pal Renfield followed me around the lobby every time I walked through believing I should tip him for the creepy privilege.  Maids who could not have cared less.   Cuisine:  Classic London prawns in pink sauce were rock hard.  Smoked salmon thickly sliced and leathery.  Overdone rice, rubbery eggs.  Literally threadbare carpeting in some places including the main stairway to the lobby, all of it needing a good steam cleaning and a shoebox room that needed a good dusting.",2,2018,09,22
105,Perfect from start to finish,"As we were arrived we were greeted with a smile and let us help you and that was the story of our stay.  Aleksandra, a trainee, was one of the best reception desk employees that have met in my travels. The room was well appointed and always kept extremely clean. The bar and restaurant service was also top notch and dinner was excellent.  In my travels back to London I will be staying here once again",5,2018,09,22
105,"Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs....","We count ourselves lucky to be able to treat ourselves occasionally, and this stay proved to be simply fantastic. The reviews led us here and I am so glad that they did, words from me cannot add any more, just perhaps continue to heap praise on such a wonderful hotel.
This beautiful old building is simply stunning, it has charm and warmth and a quality that sets it apart. But of course it is people that are the core of any great experience and the staff here are superb. Friendly and professional, they made us feel like royalty right from the start, literally.
We will be eternally grateful for the little time that we spent here and cherish the memories always. Thank you all.",5,2018,09,21
105,....and a second...,"Night in London after the Mercure experience. Old style hotel in a very quiet neighbourhood. Very nice service and before you go to bed they serves some little stuff to eat (very little sandwiches), fruits and it was yummy. Nice employee and a drink at the bar was offered. The doors are old style as well and when someone is moving in the corridor you might think the person cross your room. But again, old style living but in style.",4,2018,09,20
105,Great location in Mayfair,"Been here before - just never reviewed it apparently. This is the go-to property in Mayfair- you won’t find better. Room was impeccable in every respect. I was in London for a meeting which was walking distance so it was perfect for my needs. Food in the Butler restaurant was excellent. Skipped afternoon tea but met some people at the Terrace bar who were apparently quite impressed. Stayed 1 night, executive suite. Will be back.",5,2018,09,19
105,A delightful experience ,"This was a wonderful stay. The location in Mayfair could not have been better, within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Green Park and Hyde Park, Piccadilly and Covent Garden. The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. The included breakfast was excellent and cooked to order. Our King bedroom was on the small side but very comfortable with a very well designed bathroom. Elevators tiny.  Expensive except when compared to other quality London properties, which make it seem quite reasonable. We recommend it highly. ",5,2018,09,19
105,Excellent,On Sunday we came for afternoon tea and it was incredible. I’ve never seen such detail and care put in to this. The cakes looked like a replica of the sweets they were based on and they tasted like them too. Our waiter was Rafca and was brilliant always smiling always happy. Always attentive and made sure we were topped up. On the way out there’s a huge sweet cart which if your having the afternoon tea you can take some home with you. The sweets are a selection of classics which really took me back to my childhood. Cannot wait to return.&nbsp;,5,2018,09,19
105,Lovely place,"Myself and my mother came for afternoon tea on Saturday. It had been a long time wish of my mother’s to do afternoon tea in a posh London hotel and we were definitely not disappointed. We chose the chesterfield as we both have a sweet tooth and this afternoon tea seemed like a dream and it was. We taken aback to our childhoods. The welcome drink was incredible we loved the flying saucers, our waiter was the ever smiling Denisa and she was awesome. She explained everything to us the whole afternoon tea and was so helpful when we needed to decide our teas. They have a large Old fashioned sweet cart with a huge selection of sweets and it was so hard not eat them all. But we took a selection bag home with us, which was all packaged for us by the candy man. We loved it so much we will be back with our extended family. You really made my mums day thank you Chestesfield.",5,2018,09,18
105,Second stay and there will be more.,"Our Travel Agent, Jackie, recommended this hotel a few years ago to my mother, sister and me.  Upon returning to London, this time with my husband, I did not hesitate to book into this fabulous hotel again.  Truly, I'm not sure it could be any more perfect - the incredible location, the wonderful staff, the pretty rooms, the peace and quiet, and food.....well, a person can go on and on.  The charm of this hotel cannot be overstated.  It is truly a jewel.",5,2018,09,17
105,Perfect place to stay ,"Beyond the fantastic location and very nice authentically English (but not tired) decor, this charming hotel is staffed with the most kind, professional and helpful individuals I’ve ever experienced.  The restaurant is also beautiful with perfect breakfast and the most amazing afternoon tea and candy man experience.  I consider this to be one of the best value for money hotels in England.  We will be back!",5,2018,09,16
105,Great Hotel,"Spent several days in London ,and my mother booked this for my wife and my self ,as she told us she would stay only at the chesterfield and its the only hotel to stay in London. Great rooms ,superb service ,and a very good breakfast (my mother always told me if you ask how much it costs ,you cant afford it )",5,2018,09,13
105,Magnificent English Charm,"Spent 4 nights at the Chesterfield. Far nicer than staying at a modern glass hotel. Stayed in the Phillipe suite large, roomy and comfortable. Room service overnight is limited to sandwiches. The Butlers restaurant had a great breakfast every day. Being in Mayfair it was a central place for our day trips through London. Close to the theatres for our night out.  Lots of restaurants close by for a meal. Many ways to get around London from here. Caught taxis from right in front, never waited more than a few minutes. Addison Lee hire cars arrived on time and very courteous, actually cheaper than a taxi. The tube let us get farther afield easily.  I will be staying here again next time I visit London.",5,2018,09,13
105,Perfect!,"We stayed for a week in early August based on Trip Advisor reviews from last February. The hotel lived up to all expectations. It's a boutique hotel in one of the loveliest neighborhoods in London, within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster, the Thames, National Gallery, Royal Academy, Hyde Park -- and much, much more if you're really a walker. The lobby is elegantly appointed and the staff could not have been more gracious -- everyone from the front desk to the restaurant, bar, and house keeping. The beautiful room we had on the 3rd floor was not ginormous, but certainly large by London standards and with a wonderful bed -- and the bathroom petite, but elegant as well. Facing away from the street, the room was very quiet though just steps from many lively restaurants and shops. We did not pay for breakfast (who can start out the day feeling peppy when weighed down by a Full English anyway?) because it was better (and helped save $ for fancier dinners) to go to the Starbucks several blocks away and enjoy coffee and carbs and people watching. We did have dinner in the hotel one night. It was pricey but lovely, classy, delicious. We entertained friends in the beautiful bar on several occasions, plus had a High Tea one afternoon which was (also pricey) perfection. There's a 'library' just off the lobby (remember, this was a large home in the 19th century) where you can request your drinks be delivered. We rode the elevator often, but more often used the wide, carpeted staircase to go up and down. The beds were turned down every evening while we were out, with chocolates or other treats left on the pillow. Only prob -- sometimes the turn-down knock came as early as 6:30 pm while we were still dressing to go out for the evening. They need to come a bit later (thanks). All-in-all, it would be great to just live in the Chesterfield. We got an outrageously reasonable price by booking & paying for the room 6 months in advance on hotels.com. Do that and enjoy this place even more. Next time, we will stay for a month rather than just a week.",5,2018,09,13
105,Excellent ,"2nd stay and as just as we had remembered but better!
Great location, restaurant, rooms and staff.  
Stayed 3 nights, and will definitely return when in London.
I must mention Barbora and wish I could have had a proper chat.. 
Adrian also behind the bar.  Recommend the whisky tasting.
All staff were quite lovely.
Will recommend to all and hats off to this wonderful Red Carnation Hotel in Mayfair!

",5,2018,09,13
105,Great Staff,"The most outstanding thing about this hotel was the level of professionalism and genuine helpfulness of the staff. Very comfortable room, excellent decor and a high standard of cleanliness .  We attended the matinee of 'The King and I', then returned to the hotel for pre-dinner cocktails in the delightful piano bar. The quality of the entertainment was excellent and the champagne cocktails are wonderful. The restaurant was elegant and the food delightful. The Maitre D'hotel made us feel like we were the only guests having dinner.  We had a lovely anniversary.",5,2018,09,12
105,Private dining,"The whole experience with The Chesterfield Mayfair was a pleasure - from initial enquiry to event, they were a delight to work with.  Professional, prompt and went above and beyond expectations to ensure everything went smoothly.  It was an important Board dinner, and to hear good comments from all the Board members today was not only a relief, but a pleasure.  I can't thank the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel enough for their assistance with this event.",5,2018,09,12
105,Hotel Chesterfield Mayfair,"I came in to the chesterfield on Wednesday night as I had heard about there gin and jazz nights from a colleague and was eager to try for myself. I have to say you’ll not be disappointed, there’s a special menu of cocktails just for gin and jazz and they are incredible I had the drink and jive and it was brilliant there’s popping candy on the rim (a long time personal favourite sweet of mine) each table was served with special canapés for the evening only which are delicious. Our waiter siebe was great taking good care of us and so friendly. The band are so good playing classics songs and that you’ll know and some that open your minds to music you may have never heard before. I have told all my friends, family and colleagues about this and they can’t wait to try it either.",5,2018,09,12
105,Fantastic,On Saturday I came for afternoon tea with my husband. We are both a bit old school and loved the fact the afternoon tea is based around old sweets which really took us back to our childhood. Our minds were blown by the incredible welcome drink that smokes and looks like the flying saucers are about to take off. Our waitress ieva was so knowledgeable about all the sweets and so attentive keeping our teas topped up and making sure we always had enough food. We will be returning soon and look forward to it very much.,5,2018,09,11
105,Top,Wow wow wow. That’s all I can say about our experience at the chesterfield. The afternoon tea is scrumptious and never ending. The sweet trolly is such a wonderful touch and full of all time favourites. All the staff are friendly and approachable they look like they have fun while working. Our waitress Denisa was non different happy to help us with our choice of teas and attentive. We had a visit from the candy man which I thought was awesome especially for the kids. Everyone was taking pictures with him. Kind of like a Willie Wonka feel about him. We shall be returning with our friends very soon.,5,2018,09,11
105,Great service,"I came to the Chesterfield with my family for my parents wedding aniversary drinks. We were in the bar and it was a fantastic start to our London experience. I ordered the chilli and chocolate negroni and all I can say is wow. Our waiter Adrian was amazing, he helped my parents pick out some wine and was happy to help in every way he could. We were given some complimentarynibbles and also my parents were given a special anniversary plate. I can't say anything bad about our experience it was truly incredible and I'd like to thank them for making my parents day so extra special.",5,2018,09,09
105,Afternoon tea,"We booked the afternoon tea as a last ""date day"" before our wedding and we were so pleased we did. The service is impeccable, the food great and the atmosphere lovely. The retro sweets theme is very well executed and the sweet trolley a lovely addition. My husband has been to several afternoon teas in London (Fortnum and Mason and Harvey Nichols among others) and said this was the best one by far! Don't miss it!",5,2018,09,09
105,Nice stay,"This was my first stay at this hotel, as there was a conference I was attending taking place nearby. The location is really good with plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The staff were great, especially at reception and they were really helpful with various things that I needed. I also thought the breakfast staff were very good. Really friendly and attentive. The single occupancy room I was given was really small, even by London standards. There was literally no space whatsoever aside from the bed and it felt rather clautrophobic. I decided to pay for an upgrade to a nicer room, but to be honest for anyone looking for single occupancy I think I would probably look elsewhere.",4,2018,09,07
105,lovely afternoon tea,"First class experience, staff couldn't do enough to please, professional yet friendly. Set in the orangery with a sweet shop theme it was unique to others I've had. The food was non stop, everything replenished if you could eat it all, complete with a sweetie goody bag to take home it was very good value. Would highly recommend",5,2018,09,06
105,Great Find,"Stayed here for one night in August 2018. Lovely hotel, decor is 1920's themed - lots of fun. Best air conditioning I've ever come across in any hotel bedroom. Had a double room, bathrooom had a huge roundtop bath tub with intriguing jet shower. Hot breakfast was perfect and there was good choice at the breakfast buffet also. Location wise it couldn't be better - easy to get to from Gatwick (I suppose anywhere in London is really), but perfect for us as we were going to a show in Prince of Wales Theatre and needed to stay around Mayfair and Covent Garden - all within walking distance. The hotel itself is on a back street so not noisy, Hyde Park on its doorstep, hard to fault really. Look forward to staying here again.",5,2018,09,06
105,An English gem in Mayfair ,"Great staff, great food, perfect location. Very welcoming and beautifully furnished. 
Luxurious rooms. Great atmosphere.The afternoon tea is a must experience. We will stay again when stopping by London.",5,2018,09,05
105,A bit more flash than substance,"It's a good hotel at a good price. But IMHO, there is too much effort making it appear expensive and not enough attention to detail. With all the marble in the bathroom, for example, the faucets didn't quite work and the shower splashed water everywhere. The room is heavily mirrored and the opposite of homey. The prints on the walls were painfully fake. And one of two elevators was out of service when we arrived. But hey, it's still a good hotel in a great location and you may very well enjoy all the flash.",4,2018,09,04
105,A Bit of Old England,"Classic, gracious charm. Went there on my first trip to London in 1992 and went back in 2018. Outstanding. Rooms are renovated and customer service is the name of the game. Great location. In walking distance from just about anywhere you want to go.",5,2018,09,03
105,Classic Luxury,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for one night prior and 2 nights post our 25th wedding anniversary cruise. We loved this hotel. The service is absolutely wonderful as is the food in Butler's, the Tavern Bar and room service. The 2 rooms were lovely and the beds very comfortable. We had a number of requests for assistance because of my husband's recent surgery and therefore we had to cancel some plans and had some difficulties with transfers arranged independently. The staff especially concierge Elliott helped us in each situation with kindness and aplomb. This will definitely be our first choice when we return to London.",5,2018,09,02
105,You are very well cared for,"My wife wanted the 'English experience' while in London on holiday. I chose the Chesterfield based on the reviews, price, and location.  Service is king here in this beautiful hotel.  After being met by Antonio, the top-hatted doorman, you are instantly assisted with every little thing. The room was good-sized for a European hotel.  The bath was small, but adequate for one, and was dominated by a huge soaking tub.  After a day spent walking, riding and standing, that was a welcome end to the evening.  One thing we did miss was a mini fridge to store our refreshments in.

Gregory (the concierge) was able to provide tickets to whatever we needed, including a same day performance of ""Strictly Ballroom"" and Buckingham Palace the night before as we weren't aware we needed them. He was also helpful with directions and transportation suggestions to our various destinations.

Definitely recommend paying a little more for this first-class experience.

One final note. Many of the London hotels we looked at had a good percentage of recent ( <1yr) reviews noting a lack of/broken air conditioning.  As we were visiting in August, that was a key consideration. The Chesterfield had a lower incidence of that and we remained quietly comfotable through our entire stay.",5,2018,09,02
105,The best choice for staying in London,"I recently stayed in this beautiful hotel with my husband. It was his first stay in London and the Chesterfield staff made it really memorable. We had a lovely room on the fourth floor overlooking the main road, which was surprisingly quiet. The breakfast in the morning was great, the best egg Benedict I ever had. We also got to try the afternoon tea on one of the days which was also delicious. Our waiter Rafcar was very attentive and polite and took great care of us even though he been constantly chased by the children in the restaurant as he was dressed as a Candyman. 

Can't praise the hotel staff enough, from the check in with Roberta until the departure. Everyone was so wonderful, I wish I remembered all the names.",5,2018,09,01
105,A beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair,I had the pleasure of attending a conference at this hotel and was impressed by the exemplary service and friendly atmosphere. The hotel staff were always on hand to assist with our needs and the food over the 3 days was impressive. A huge thank you to the team at the Chesterfield Mayfair.,5,2018,08,30
105,"Classic, historic, wonderful small hotel in Mayfair","A wonderful place to stay in Mayfair.  Really a small, boutique hotel.  Service level beyond comparison.  Very nice rooms.  Amenities you rarely see.  A heated marble floor in the bathroom (adjustable, of course), to give but one example.  Robes, slippers, wonderful linens and nicest towels I've ever found in a hotel.  Including Four Seasons and other very high end places I have stayed.  A member of the Red Carnation Group, and proud of that (for good reason).  Real orchids all over the restaurant, and elsewhere in the common areas.  Someone here knows how to grow orchids!  Get a package that includes breakfast in the hotel's excellent restaurant.  Yes, it is in London and yes it does have an excellent restaurant.  We even had dinner there one night!  We paid 250 English Pounds per night, including breakfast.  Actually a very good value for what you get. The staff couldn't be nicer.  Very friendly, very helpful.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2018,08,30
105,The very best Hotel in Lodon,"What a superlative experience ! 
Right from the location in central London to Service (top notch & going out of the way to please guests) to every element big or small. The Design is very English and the rooms are very tastefully decorated. Loved my stay and surely coming back for my family holiday soon ...",5,2018,08,30
105,excellent,"Visited for one night and stayed in room 220. Rather strangely this is actually within the building next door, but no problem. Its fairly small, but high ceiling. Nice bathroom, but unused by me. Noisy neighbours flushing loos during night was not great. It is expensive, but you wont get much cheap in Mayfair! The bar bills were very expensive, but this is a hotel not a bar. Small breakfast portions, given that brekkie is £15 a pop. Thats the negatives. The positives are friendly and very helpful staff. Clean rooms, corridors and restaurant. They love having dogs at this hotel and we found many people to talk to its very cosmopolitan, hospitable and charming. I'd recommend this hotel as its easy to get to and we found parking easy too.",5,2018,08,29
105,The best hotel in London!,"This hotel is five stars.  Everything was perfect during our stay.  The staff is excellent!  We chose a Boomers Package on their website which included the room category, taxes, English Breakfast daily, and a fifty pound food credit.  Upon arrival they upgraded us to a suite, due to it being our anniversary.  In our room were cupcakes and an anniversary greeting in chocolate.  The location is very upscale and safe.  It's just a short walk from Green Park.  I used to stay at The Berners which was a traditional London hotel.  This outshined that completely!",5,2018,08,29
105,Great hotel and met best guide in London,"Beautiful hotel, top of the line service.  Rooms are clean and welcoming.  Bathrooms are very nice and shower is great.  The bed is super comfortable and great after a long day of seeing the sights.  The location is  perfect and accessible to everywhere you want to be.  
The lobby bar also is great with wonderful service.  It was there we were introduced to Sir Henry, a local legend who made our trip extra special with his advice, knowledge and planning.
Here’s to The Chesterfield Mayfair and Sir Henry 👍🏼",5,2018,08,29
105,Excellent Hotel - Excellent Service - Excellent Staff,"I decided to celebrate my 60th Birthday with a night in London and chose the Chesterfield in Mayfair. On arrival at the hotel after exiting the taxi the doorman welcomed me with a smile and helped with my overnight luggage. The receptionist greeted me with a warm welcome and advised me that as it was a special birthday my room had been upgraded to a junior suite, which I thought was a very nice gesture. Dinner was booked in their Butlers restaurant, the food, service, and all members of staff were nothing short of excellent, if you are stopping at the hotel the restaurant is a must. The junior suite (room 528) was spacious, quiet, and very comfortable. Our stay at the Chesterfield was a birthday to remember and I would recommend this hotel not only for it's location, but the staff that represent the hotel are the best I have experienced in over 30 years of travelling around the world. I will certainly be returning for another celebration.",5,2018,08,28
105,Family Get Together,"We stayed  at The Chesterfield and booked 12 rooms for ourselves and family members who travelled from Manchester Spain and Holland .
Check in was extremely efficient and no problems at all considering we had so many people in our party .
Rooms were all comfortable and well furnished , bed linen was lovely also rooms very clean throughout the hotel .
The bar area was very relaxing and welcoming and all staff very attentive , bar meals were excellent .
We all had breakfast together in the conservatory , menu choice was excellent and nothing too much trouble for anybody .

Check out was very smooth , and would certainly recommend this hotel to anybody visiting London .
It is in a great location and not at all stuffy like some hotels , 
Everybody seems very happy and courteous and we look forward to our next stay.",5,2018,08,28
105,Exceptional,"We visited the Chesterfield for Afternoon Tea for my daughter’s 8th birthday, as a surprise. I had high expectations after looking at all the reviews online and I was absolutely blown away by the kindness and service from the staff. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel special and to make sure we were having a good time. The sandwiches, the tea and the mouthwatering cakes were all divine. They even brought out a little cupcake with a candle in and sang Happy Birthday and gave my daughter and son a teddybear. Perfect in every way. ",5,2018,08,28
105,Great space for a conference,"The team was excellent - very attentive, and we enjoyed high quality catering and superb amenities for a 2-day conference. The location is great - very central, and next to Green Park. I'd recommend this hotel as a business venue and I hope I get to stay there another time!",5,2018,08,28
105,Nice stay,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a quaint, cozy  and luxurious hotel . Though we arrived in time
For check in, we had to wait for around 15
Minutes before our room was ready. However,  the reception was very apologetic about the wait and made sure we were comfortable while waiting. The room and bathroom were comfortable and clean. It was my daughter’s birthday so we booked for an afternoon tea which, being quite popular, we had to wait around 30 mins for to be seated despite our prior booking. The wait, however, was worth it because the service was excellent. When we went to the room, cupcakes and a handwritten birthday card from the management and staff of the hotel was waiting for my daughter. It was a wonderful experience for us since we were away from home at the time and it was just the two of us celebrating her 18th birthday.",5,2018,08,27
105,"Superior Service, Great Location, Wonderful Staff","I was in London for a conference and had the pleasure to stay at the hotel. Firstly, the staff is so caring and wonderful.

Excellent service, rich buffet breakfast and  an elegant bar to have a traditional cup of tea or drinks late at night.The location is just superb, near top restaurants and boutiques.",4,2018,08,26
105,Excellent,"Stayed here for one night it was so perfect I didn’t want to leave. You know when you enter an establishment and it just feels right: that’s how I felt here. All the front office staff were so friendly, my room beautiful and the quick breakfast that I had the next day was simply scrumptious. I’ll be back and for longer this time !",5,2018,08,26
105,A small gem in the heart of Mayfair,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair recently and I have to say that I have been amazed by the quality of the establishment, the comfort of the room, the excellent breakfast. Dinner was delicious, Loris and the team being very attentive.
From the moment you arrive to the day you depart, the staff and the service have been wonderful. Front desk team amazing and the little goodies left in the room were an excellent touch.
We will definitely be coming back.",5,2018,08,26
105,Very pleased with our first visit,This was our first time to stay in Mayfair and we were very pleased with our hotel choice.  Lots of history but modern conveniences at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Food and service was outstanding.  We will definitely stay there again.,5,2018,08,26
105,Thank you from Canada !,"I recently visited and stayed in a beautiful room on the 5th floor ! Eryk was professional and funny when he delivered the room service tray, i ordered my steak well done and it was cooked beautifilly. I had dinner in the restaurant the next day Loris took great care of me and recommended something as i did not like fish..... he was superb and knowledgeable ! Elliot helped me find my way to gatwick airport and was an all round helpful person. This hotel is lovely ! Everyone was so friendly.... the hotel was beautiful, centrally located. I must not forget dear Adrian and Alberto in the bar who recommended a lovely gin and tonic. What a fine line of staff -  well done management ! Hope to be back in this beautiful hotel again.",5,2018,08,26
105,Beyond expectations,This was our 17th visit to what we regard as our second home in London. This time we brought two dear friends to celebrate their wedding anniversary which was their first time at the Chesterfield. They loved every minute of their visit in this quintessential best of British hotels and we were stunned to be upgraded to a Suite each on check in which was a lovely surprise and made our friends stay even more special. The staff as always were caring and attentive which made the whole stay memorable.,5,2018,08,25
105,Absolutely fabulous ,"Luxury from hot flannels and orange juice when you arrive. The club room we stayed in was super very modern. The beds are so comfy. Excellent facilities in room heated floor, kettle, microwave all lovely. Would recommend for location to stations and handy for me as traveled as a single parent .
Staff can’t do any more to help. ",5,2018,08,25
105,Exquisitely British ,"This hotel is by far one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in, with a touch of British class reserved for royalty. I loved my room, which was spacious, comfortable and perfectly set with a view of Dartmouth House. The level of service offered is beyond expectations with staff always attentive to my every need and all with the warmest smile. I can’t wait to go back and thank you Chesterfield team. ",5,2018,08,24
105,Honeymoon Stay,We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for our honeymoon in mid-August. The location is exceptional and walkable to the Green Park tube station. It’s walkable to all the famous sights in London. Safe and secure location with an amazing staff. Highly recommended!,5,2018,08,23
105,The finest hotel...period.,"All things considered, this is the finest hotel I have ever stayed in.  Everything fits together, starting with a wonderfully attentive trained staff in every department:  The rooms, the hallways, the concierges, the breakfast, the lobby, the doormen, etc. etc.  I don't think any detail was overlooked.
The staff made our trip to London delightful.  We will look to stay in other ""Red Carnation""  hotels.",5,2018,08,22
105,Luxury and a great location,"This was my second time staying here. And I loved it even more the second time than the first. While it is an older hotel, the staff is amazing. I never opened an exterior door, they serve coffee and tea in the lobby if you wake up early from jet leg, and the beds are extremely company.

It is just a short walk from the Green Park tube station, Buckingham palace, Whitehall, Fortnum and Mason and all of the lovely shops along Piccadilly.

Yes, there are many big chains in London that have lovely rooms, but if you want a true British feel this is the place to stay",5,2018,08,21
105,CHARMING AND AUTHENTIC,"Great experience, best location and charming, warm and inviting atmosphere.
Would love to return to enjoy the professional and accommodating service of this fine establishment.  (visited this wonderful hotel in the fall of 2010)",5,2018,08,21
105,Amazing.  Simply amazing.,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield this past week.   We arrived on Monday the 13th of August, 2018. and departed Sunday the 19th of August. We were in London to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. 
There isn’t enough time or space to tell you how wonderful our experience was.  We were greeted at the door by kind and helpful young men. Joe was amazing and helpful.  
 We were checked in and helped by an amazing front desk staff.   The check in and check out pricess was smooth and easy.  
Letitia made sure we felt as if we were in her home as special guests.  She was such a special part of our trip. We feel like we made many new friends. Thank you for this special place. We will be back.",5,2018,08,20
105,Afternoon Tea,"I came for an Afternoon Tea with friends and the whole experience was fantastic. We were seated by the lovely Andriana. I had a gluten free option and she looked after us very well. The level of customer service was brilliant and we even got some sweets to take home, which was an amazing addition to the the lovely experience.",5,2018,08,20
105,5th visit,This was our 5th annual trip to The Cheterfield hotel Mayfair. I will always stay here as the attention to detail is second to none. Every member of staff goes the extra mile to help and please .The minute you walk in the door to start your stay till the moment you leave is delightful.,5,2018,08,20
105,Girls day out for my friends 5yr old daughters birthday,"Afternoon tea at the Chesterfield was amazing, all staff from doorman to serving staff were so friendly and welcoming. Loris looked after us and he made us all feel very special, especially my friends daughter. He address her as the head of the table and she didn't stop smiling the whole time we were there, the food was lovely and great choice of teas. Cakes were so yummy, the theme was The Original Sweet Shop and the flavours were spot on. We had lots of extra sandwiches and cakes and we weren't rushed, spent a lovely time enjoying the live music and lovely surroundings. To finish off the experience we visited the sweet cart, the sweet seller was on a break but Loris did a great job standing in for him. Would I go again?? yes I can't wait to go back and after being told about the Christmas theme I am excited to go back.",5,2018,08,20
105,"As always, Superb! The Best afternoon Tea on the Planet!","My Wife and I visited here for afternoon Tea to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. This is the hotel we were actually held our wedding reception 2 years ago and have visited many many times now for afternoon Tea.
Once again absolutely fantastic!
We have been to lots and lots of different places for afternoon Tea and this place is always miles ahead in service and quality. 
The current them is Ye Olde Sweet shop complete with a candyman and sweet trolley weighing out pick and mix sweets, a great idea well executed!
All I can say is if you are considering booking this hotel for afternoon Tea please do so as you will not be disappointed at all.
A massive thank you to all the staff and especially to Sam who organised our Wedding reception 2 years ago. Please can you pass on our thanks to her for the Champagne as it was such a kind gesture.
See you all soon at the Chesterfield which is now starting to feel like a home from home for us!",5,2018,08,19
105,English Charm,"We picked this hotel as we wanted the Old English Charm experience on our first visit to London, and were not disappointed it is a charming hotel, with excellent staff who are  very attentive.  Only one thing is we would have liked a fridge in our room, but many European hotels do not offer this, and we survived just fine.  Rooms are lovely and of course clean.  Hotel is in an excellent location, so you can walk to local attractions but also quick access to the Metro at Green Park.  We took picks and videos and posted on fb, and again our friends and family are keen to stay at this hotel.  We would stay again and highly recommend.",5,2018,08,19
105,Trip of a Lifetime to London!,"Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  I prepaid and reserved it about  6 months ago and so it was quite reasonable.  Communication was very good pre stay.  Lovely clean room and bathroom, air conditioning was great as London had just come off of a heat wave.  Great location, close to everything.  Breakfast was wonderful.  I loved the quiet, classic feel of the hotel.  The only negatives:  not much storage for clothing or bathroom essentials.  I compensated by asking for the removal of some glass trays and extra fru fru things that just took up room in the bathroom and also the main room which helped.  Also the bed wasn't as firm as we'd like.  However we loved the controls on the bed for lights, fan, and shades.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2018,08,18
105,Great hotel in great location,"The Chesterfield was our welcomed home on our recent trip to London. The location is perfect for exploring the city and is within walking distance of the tube station and many main attractions. The staff were all great - very friendly, helpful and polite.  The doorman knew us by name within minutes of our arrival.  He would even run down the street to hail us a taxi!  The breakfast was excellent - great choice, cooked well and the breakfast room was lovely. The bar staff in the evenings was great as well (although note that you have to put an order in for the famous molecular cocktails in advance as they are not always available and we missed out on this.) Our room was a good size for London, but was still a little cramped as the walls were angled (the room was not square).  Our view was of an ugly rooftop and an air conditioning unit which was not ideal, but in the heatwave were were happy to have the AC!  Again, i would ask for a room facing the main road. All in a great hotel in the heart of the city.  We will return.",4,2018,08,16
105,Phenomenal,"We had an incredible stay at the Chesterfield.

My husband booked this as a surprise treat and we both felt incredibly well looked after. 

We arrived early as we were going to see a show and Letitia kindly arranged for our luggage to be looked after as our room wasn't yet ready.

Upon our return we found out our room had been upgraded, which was a lovely surprise. When we entered our suite it had been beautifully decorated with rose petals throughout. My husband had also arranged for there to be flowers and champagne in our room which were both perfect. There was a box of delicious chocolates, some chocolate dipped strawberries and a cake and a voucher for cocktails in the bar area.

We stayed in the garden suite and the classical decor was tasteful and quaint. The suite was of a good size with a seating area by the windows. The complimentary toiletries were Elemis. 

Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and approachable. Especially Letitia who has the brightest smile!

We had dinner in the hotel restaurant where the staff treat you like family and our meal was delicious. The lady who saw us to our table was very welcoming and our waiter also.

We both opted to have a cooked breakfast so were unable to do justice to the other items available but they all looked fantastic and there was a large range of items to choose from.

From arrival to check out we had a magical time and felt incredibly blessed to have such a wonderful stay. Thank you",5,2018,08,15
105,Malcolm,I stayed at the Chesterfield last weekend was as amazing as ever always good to see familiar faces still there especially Carolina in Butlers to greet you in the morning with a healthy glass of beetroot juice to Darren and his team on concierge. Keep up the brilliant work.,5,2018,08,15
105,The Most Magical Wedding Thanks To The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel - 11th August 2018,"I want to thank the staff and all involved in the preparation and day of celebrations for my wedding on the 11th August 2018. The chesterfield super-seeded my expectations. I have never experienced such politeness and efficiency - this was cascaded to me by my friends and family also. 
Austeja, our wedding coordinator, was my first point of contact from When i first made enquiries regarding availability at the hotel to host my wedding. Before even securing the date with any kind of deposit Austeja responded to all my questions patiently and carefully. Austeja was able to secure us deals and discounts which made the process more welcoming. I compare this to other hotels and establishments I made enquiries with and nothing compared to how responsive and helpful Austeja was. When we came to visit the hotel for the first time she showed my husband and I the grounds and made us feel at ease and immediately got us excited about the prospect of our wedding taking place there. It was an easy choice to make. Over the next 8 months Austeja responded almost instantly to hundreds of my emails to minor questions to repeated questions to the necessary ones. If Austeja was not in the office she would tell me in advance that she would be away and we would still have another port of call responding to us quickly! I know she was often reading my emails whilst on leave and would tell me everything she was doing as soon as she was back. 
Coming to the hotel for the actual wedding was like a dream. I was surprised with an upgrade to my room from a standard room to the bridal suite- to say this put me at ease is an understatement- I cried with pure happiness and gratitude. I was treated like a princess, spoken to with such respect and care and I could see all were genuinely happy and excited for me. 
Austeja ensured that great deals were provided to my friends and family who were staying at the hotel the night of the wedding. Breakfast in the conservatory, a private space just for my guests was also provided the following morning and again staff were so incredibly helpful and patient. 
The surprises before, during and after the wedding touched my heart so much. Champagne, cards, rose tea to calm my nerves, cake..... this was not just a hotel to hold my wedding, this was an experience, a service beyond what I had asked or paid for. My husband and I will be back to the hotel for years to come to celebrate anniversaries. We are so grateful to all of you for your genuine hospitality. You have created a truly special experience and hotel. 
Thank you so much. 
Mr and Mrs Shaw x",5,2018,08,15
105,A magnificent flagship for London. Timeless!,"I stayed her a decade ago on Buisness due to the location. This was the first time I had returned to this part of London. Well it didn't disappoint. They still have the traditional footman to meet you from your car, its a blast from the passed and put a smile on my face every time. Its situated in a prime part of the city, nothing is more than a short walk away. The rooms are perfectly appointment. I would highly recommend getting a suit. they are enormous, and exquisitely appointed. I don't think there is a London hotel to rival the luxury or service. The food is also superb. I will make sure I don't leave it so long next time.",5,2018,08,15
105,Pretty Good Experience,"We had a 3 night stay in the extremely pleasant Phillipe Suite.
Housekeeping staff were excellent and flexible, reception were professional and attentive  and the hotel is located in my opinion- the best area of London.

I found the Continental Breakfast choice to be limited, the toast and tea were served cold but that is a First World Problem and it did not ruin the stay.

Concierge were at hand with advice, door staff with a brolly and weather forecast too!

All in all a pretty good option but not the best...

Only one thing bothered me during our stay-
My wife required her coat from our car which had been valet parked, she enquired as to how to obtain it at the reception desk. Put simply the response was ""It's in the car park, I'll have to walk and get it"" and a look of - I am not walking to your car to get the coat-
My wife did not expect him too but she did expect a solution, taxi? Directions?.
My wife intended to pay any expenses and accompany him but the sole response was as unhelpfull as you could get! 
My wife thought, come on, give me a solution, give me the details and I'll go and get it but no, the chap just turned away to give something else his better served attention.

London is unindated with good hotels charging £500 plus per night, most are good and worth the money but it is strange how sometimes it is the bad points that linger in ones memory.

Thank you all concerned.",5,2018,08,14
105,Wonderful!,"My wife and I stayed three nights at the Chesterfield last week.  We've visited London many times over the years and stayed at many hotels.  This is the best! 

It is right in the middle of Mayfair and within walking distance of many of London's attractions.  It is a short walk to Shepherds Market which is a lovely, quiet area with some great restaurants and a long and interesting history.

All the staff we met at the Chesterfield were friendly, helpful and professional.  Checking in and checking out was efficient.  Our room was clean, attractive, relaxing  and very quiet - no traffic noise and no noise from within the hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room had everything you could expect from an excellent hotel.  Breakfasts were splendid!  

This is a hotel that has obviously worked very hard to get its service to customers exactly right; all the details have been thought about carefully.  This is not part of a big chain of swish, modern, mass-market hotels.  This hotel has a history, substance, charm, quality and character.  You can get cheaper and you can get (much) more expensive hotel accommodation In London; I'm not sure you could get much better.",5,2018,08,13
105,A cut above the rest,"Not only is this hotel extraordinarily beautiful and very comfortable, you are welcomed into the beautiful marble foyer as though the staff's favorite guest has returned. My room was beautifully appointed, with a gorgeous marble bath. Each night my bed was turned down, with a chocolate on my pillow. The Chesterfield is conveniently located to dining and nightlife and beautiful streets to stroll, yet nestled on a quiet street of gorgeous front doors and exquisite architecture. Tea at The Chesterfield is top notch. the sandwiches were perfection and the champagne flowed. The pastries were colorful and tasted as good as they looked. We went to the bar/lounge afterward to listen to the piano player. Wonderful way to pass the afternoon away before dinner. The staff is professional and caring and look to make your stay memorable and positive.  The only thing about my stay that made me sad was when it was time to leave. You can pay much more for an exquisite hotel with a professional staff, but at The Chesterfield you don't have to. Loved every moment of my stay. Hope to return soon.",5,2018,08,10
105,Excellent,Myself and my wife came for afternoon tea for our anniversary on Thursday. We loved every minute of it. The staff were so friendly and attentive our waiter Eryk was fantastic. We loved the selection of teas and the cakes so much we kept asking for more! They truly blew us away when they came out with a special anniversary cupcake plate and the candyman gave my wife a red carnation flower. Her smile hasn’t subsided since this moment. We will definitely be back.,5,2018,08,10
105,Nice place. Top ↑,"I came for afternoon tea on Friday with my family and we had a fantastic time. It was nice hot day and Laura the &nbsp;fantastic hostess sat us in the conservatory which was light but also cool. The afternoon tea started with an incredible looking and tasting drink that had flying saucers and smoke ( I’m sure they were actually flying) the afternoon tea it’s self was never ending if we wanted more they bought it, we must have had 3 plates of the delectable sandwiches. The scones were great soft, warm and served with home made jam. We loved this experience so much. We will be back soon",5,2018,08,10
105,So nice ,I came to the chesterfield bar on Wednesday as I had heard about your gin and jazz nights and I was not disappointed. The jazz band is incredible playing songs you know and some you may not. It’s such a relaxing and warm atmosphere. They have a special selection of cocktails that they do especially for this night only I chose the drink and jive and it lived up to the hype our waiter Adrian gave it. It came with popping candy on the rim of the glass and it smoked and bubbles as they used dry ice. Then came some special canapés that again were just for this evening only. I was totally spell bound and blown away. Thank you chesterfield I’ll be coming back very soon.,5,2018,08,10
105,Excellent location ,"We arrived on a very warm day in London. The air conditioning was a welcome reprieve. Our room was compact, but provided everything we needed. The bed linens were lovely and the bed was very comfy. 
The location  near Shepherd Market worked out great for dining options. The concierge provided great info on best way to reach Kew Gardens.  We ended our stay with great cocktails in the bar. Great overall experience.",4,2018,08,09
105,Summer Stay in July,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 7 nights.  It was wonderful.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Karolis was especially helpful in providing information, recommendations and arranging tickets.  The tickets he found for the Phantom of the Opera were fantastic.  The room was clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed coming in each night and having a glass of wine to relax from the day while listening to the piano music.  Loved the complimentary snack provided in the bar as well.  The staff was superb.  It definitely is a great central location for all the tourist sites and shopping.  We will return to enjoy the hotel again.",5,2018,08,07
105,Cool!,On Monday I came to the bar at the chesterfield and I was so pleased I did. The staff are so friendly and welcoming my waiter Adrian was attentive and helpful always with a smile. I ordered the fish and chips and it was huge but my goodness it was the best ever. The batter crispy and fish so fresh. No where will ever compete to this now. My drink was the lychee martini and it was so refreshing and delicious. I cannot wait to return with my friends and family.,5,2018,08,07
105,Mayfair and Hyde Park await.....,"We just spent a few days at the Chesterfield Hotel on the front and back ends of a cruise.  It was my first time for all of this; though several times in London.  The boutique hotel has a welcome from curbside and throughout.  Our plane landed early; so, they tried to ready our stunning, sunfilled room while re explored the fun, upscale neighborhood.  The Red Carnation is known for award-winning culinary experiences.  Our breakfast featured an astounding array of quality foods, such as homemade multiseeded avocado toast, flavorful lox, light, crisp Belgian waffle, omelettes to order, and on and on.  The bar has live jazz on weeknights, and crafted cocktails you'll love.

The level of service is amazing!  The team as a whole is dedicated to pleasing in all directions. Behind every highly functioning team is a skilled, inspiring, motivating manager.  This person can see steps ahead, while facillitating in the immediate.  Letitia Chihambakwe is this person.  Her style, purposeful direction, and leadership talents are a twenty on a ten scale.  This just carries over to everyone.    

I'll surely park my bags at 35 Charles Street my next trip.",5,2018,08,07
105,Excellent,"Located in the heart of London, 15 min walk from Buckingham Palace and 10 min walk from Piccadilly street. The room is small but very clean and stylish. The best breakfast experience ever. We'll be back.",5,2018,08,07
105,Meeting business partner ,"The interior design was respectable. The atmosphere was one that suggested that the hotel caters to those from the upper ilk. The waitress was very attentive. The tea was good. 

The location is close to Green Park station so it is easy to locate (about a 5 minutes walk). The building is in a prime area so crime is reduced. There is security at the entrance and throughout the facility. ",4,2018,08,06
105,Not up to scratch,"Although we were accommodated at almost midnight ,having just arrived from Dubai(when an apartment booked for £10 K in Farm street Mayfair through Home and Away turned out to be a hovel)
We were greeted with friendly professionalism and efficiency by the porters and front desk
My room was minute ,had no mini bar or cold water and one could barely manoever around the bed but
The linnen was fresh and crisp ,a high standard 
My son had an unfortunate experience with the cold tap not working in the shower was scalded and his air conditioning wasn’t working properly which was an issue with London cooking at 35 degrees centigrade
Breakfast was dissapointing as the eggs Benedict was served Cold and the buns stale.
All in all we were so tired and happy to have somewhere clean and comfortable after the disastrous apartment in Farm Street .
when compared to the superior standard of the Atlantis hotel in Dubai where we had just stayed ,it fell short  in every way.
Probably every hotel does though!!!",3,2018,08,06
105,Charming English Hotel,"There were so many hotel choices for our first time in London it was overwhelming! But after narrowing down the neighborhood we kept coming back to the Chesterfield Mayfair and I’m so glad we decided to book. The hotel is absolutely charming from the outside located on a quiet neighborhood corner across from a small park. The lobby is charming along with the friendly doormen and staff. The concierge was extremely helpful with our day trips to Windsor and Cambridge. Centrally located we walked nearly everywhere! However the underground is conveniently nearby. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean, the bathroom was a good size the bedroom was small but the king sized bed was perfect! (typical size for Europe) We enjoyed the English breakfast every morning along with bubbles and snacks in the lounge in the evenings they provided live piano music and had a jazz ensemble on Wednesday nights. my husband tried the whisky tasting and we splurged on their desserts! The shopping was incredible on nearby Bond street. We  had a fabulous stay and hope to return someday.",5,2018,08,06
105,10/10,I recently stayed for a few nights at the chesterfield for business. I was leaving at 7:30 am every morning and I’d like to thank Barbora and Alberto on the bar for making my morning coffees for me to take away with me. They were so happy and friendly. They made sure I had my coffee just the way I like it every day. Everyone here was so helpful for my requests and stopped at nothing to help me. Thank you for such a great stay,5,2018,08,06
105,A perfect stay again !,"This was our tenth visit to the Chesterfield and as always they went above and beyond to make both of us feel pampered. This time we went for our anniversary and Mrs. Chihambakwe was kind enough to upgrade us to a junior suite which was gorgeous, moreover there were also a lot of nice attentions that show that they want their regular guests to feel at home. I would also like to mention that their new afternoon tea is a must try, even better than the previous one ! We also ate at the restaurant two times and even if we missed Loris, Etienne was so great and so kind we felt we were spoiled.

Of course we will be back for Christmas !",5,2018,08,06
105,London trip ,"Gorgeous hotel with very attentive staff.  They really take great care of their guests.  The food alone is worth a visit.  It is centrally located near major attractions and monuments.  If you are looking for an elegant hotel where you feel pampered, this is the place for you.",5,2018,08,05
105,Awesome,"On Wednesday I came to the Chestesfield with some work colleagues as we had heard about your gin and jazz nights. We were totally mind blown. The jazz band were beyond amazing the special cocktails they do for this night are genius. I picked the drink and jive and I couldn’t believe what arrived it came with a little dry ice stick in it and it made the cocktail bubble and smoke, presentation was brilliant( loved the popping candy). Our waiter was Alberto and he was great he bought round some special gin and jazz canapés that also smoked we were so intrigued that by the time we got to eating them it had stopped smoking!! I will be telling all my friends and Colleagues about this amazing hotel, you will see us again.",5,2018,08,05
105,Great experience!!!,On Sunday I came with my son and daughter for afternoon tea. Our waiter was Fiachra he was great he couldn’t possibly have done any more for us. My son had chocolate milkshake and my daughter had a strawberry one. They loved the fact the you could do a smaller version of the afternoon tea for them with child friendly sandwiches!! The best part for my son was the floating flying saucer drink and my daughter loved your sweet trolly I think she wants it at home now! Thank you again Fiachra and we will be back very soon,5,2018,08,05
105,the best afternoon,"Myself and some friends came for afternoon tea on Saturday and I have to say it was the best afternoon tea I’ve ever had. The staff were attentive without being intrusive, always with a smile. A special thank you must go to our waiter Valerij as he was just brilliant. The selection of teas was incredible I didn’t know so many existed!! There were 6 of us and half of us chose the fruit salad tea and the other half the dancing dragon. The afternoon tea it’s self was incredible the scones soft and warm the sandwiches fresh and so morish. I have to say the sweet trolly really took me back to my childhood. I can’t wait to return!!",5,2018,08,05
105,Superb cocktails and service,"My husband and I came to the Chesterfield for a pre dinner drink on Friday and it was fab! The staff were so helpful and smiling. The all looked like they love working there. We both ordered the Chesterfield Martini which comes with a shot of champagne, and what a great choice that was!The selection of nibbles was great, especially the olives. Our waiter, Adrian, was so attentive and such a delight. Chesterfield you really made our day, we will be back soon",5,2018,08,05
105,A brilliant stay in London,"Stayed in a suite for our family holiday this August. Our visit was absolutely delightful. There is not much that I could complain about. The service was very good and professional. Our dining experience was enjoyable, and the food was well prepared. The location within in Mayfair itself is perfect for visiting the city as it is a central location to many other neighborhoods. Additionally, the hotel has an affiliation with a gym that is a 5 minutes walk from the hotel. I enjoyed using it--convenient with good facilities to train in. My entire experience was quite enjoyable.",5,2018,08,04
105,Literally Almost Perfect,"Two of my daughters (ages 21 & 16) and I stayed 4 nights in a small suite. The experience is classic British hotel at its best. The room was lushly decorated, spacious, and quite elegant. Bathroom was luxurious and well appointed. Great room for a very fair price given the location in London, which is just about as central as your can find but still on a very peaceful street. Excellent accommodations.

With the exception of the doormen, who seem to get distracted at times, the service is quite good. It may not be up to the most discriminating standards, but it certainly tries. Everyone is good humored and prompt. That includes room service for both tea and food. We used it several times and never waited more than 5-10 minutes. Some of the staff need a little smoothing around the edges, but for the most part the service is lovely.

We also had a breakfast package, which is very much worth it. There are a good variety of options and at 22£ per person if you can get it included, it is a very good deal.

If you're looking for a very elegant 4-star hotel experience in a fantastic location at a fair price this is certainly the place. Highly recommended. Can't wait to return.",5,2018,08,04
105,A step back in time,"A delightful boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The Chesterfield maintains a charm and personality of a bygone age. The rooms are small as in most hotels with such a long history but they are well maintained , comfortable and have all the main amenities. Breakfast is very good and varied and the staff are most helpful. It is really a step back in time especially when you arrive and a quartet are playing in the bar area. Overseas visitors will love the charm and atmosphere that the Chesterfield conveys to its patrons.",5,2018,08,02
105,Great Meeting Room,"Visited for a work away day. We booked the Library meeting room.

Everybody was very impressed.

Very good, affordable venue with food and drinks served throughout the day.

Breakfast and lunch were both of a good quality. 

Would definitely recommend.",5,2018,08,02
105,"Unique, Stylish... Amazing","The Chesterfield was perfect in every way - gorgeous decor, friendly faces with amazing food and drink. Letitia, who checked us in was super helpful quick and polite - made us feel very welcome and arranged for our bags to be taken up to the room. Although we were early to check in we were made to feel very welcome. We stayed in the African suite, with leopard carpet, plush bedding and all the amenities that you need for a great nights stay - the carpet sounds outrageous but it totally worked with the rest of the hotel.

The bar is a comfortable setting to have a quiet drink with friends and family, excellent menu and totally recommend the bar food - especially the sharing platters - perfect if you don’t want anything too heavy. We were served by Lukas who looked after us really well, was super polite and helpful (especially when you’re not quite sure which lovely drink to choose from) He explained the gin experience that the chesterfield offers and totally want to go back to try that out. 

Breakfast was again an easy, relaxed experience with large buffet selection and extensive menu. The Chesterfield is in great walking distance of Oxford St, Green park and lots of other local attractions.

I stayed here for my birthday, after coming back from dinner there was a little cake and a signed card from the team working that day. The hotel made me smile lots. 

It’s luxury with a capital L.",5,2018,07,31
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"This is the second time I’ve stayed in a red carnation hotel and it didn’t disappoint. It’s a beautiful hotel, in a perfect location to explore London. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, they went out of their way to help us make the most of a short stay. If I get the chance to come back I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again and explore what the hotel has to offer, let alone London!",5,2018,07,31
105,Amazing Experince,"Stayed at the hotel 2 weeks ago, what a wonderful place, concierge Karolis made our stay starting from restaurant recommendation, tours and different tips for sightseeing, always smiling and willing assist",5,2018,07,31
105,Original Sweetshop afternoon Tea,"The hotel were very accommodating for our group of 20 ladies who booked an afternoon tea to celebrate our friends forthcoming wedding.  As our group grew larger, the hotel offered us private dining in the library and laid the table out with a white tablecloth, white covers on chairs with a gold bow and silver candelabras on the tables, this was not requested but offered by the hotel which I thought was amazing, the room looked lovely on arrival.  The sandwiches were very good, a good variety and they catered for vegetarian options.  The cakes were delicious and based on the theme of 'Original Sweetshop' we all came away suitably stuffed with cake and sandwiches! Hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating, we couldn't have chosen a better venue! Many thanks to all involved, a nice afternoon tea was had by all!",5,2018,07,31
105,Great Experience,"Beautiful hotel, super clean and great costumer service. Joszef the doorman was always very helpful and friendly. Harry at the front desk answered any questions we called about. The afternoon tea was yummy and perfect for children as well.",5,2018,07,29
105,Comfortable Compact Central Chesterfield,"We stayed here during the first week of Wimbledon primarily for the central location and good reviews. All in all we enjoyed our visit. The room was compact but had every amenity and Housekeeping kept it in immaculate condition. Beds were comfortable, A/C was welcome during London's heatwave and adjoining noise level minimal.  A few minor hiccups meant only four stars...( Concierge's lack of travel knowledge to Wimbledon, Caesar salad in Dining Room inedible, no space in bar prior to dinner, ) Traditional ambience.",4,2018,07,29
105,Wonderful Afternoon Tea!,"The Original Sweetshop Afternoon Tea was the perfect place for my friend's belated birthday present - thanks to looking for a place which provided gluten free etc.via a blog!
If you want an afternoon tea with a difference, then this is the place! The service is impeccable, the selection of cakes and sandwiches totally delicious and we both had a bag of sweets we chose at the sweteshop before we left.  
I'm definitely going to return in the  next few months!",5,2018,07,28
105,Fantastic hotel in Mayfair,"Our family (boy 16, girl 13) recently stayed at this excellent hotel in London (two rooms).  We had a great experience. The location is hard to beat — right in the heart of London and a short walk to the Green Park tube station.  Our package came with a tasty breakfast every morning. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (Jozsef, the bellhop, was particularly so). The rooms were clean and comfortable. And the rooms were affordable by London standards.  All in all, I would highly recommend. ",5,2018,07,28
105,Plusses and minuses but overall a great stay.,"Upon arrival late about 21:00 on 8/13 we were greeted by a couple of very unpleasant and just downright nasty employees at the from desk. The inappropriate attitude continue the next morning and the following evening, luckily after that we didn't have to see those employees for the following two evenings. 

I have to say that with such a negative reception our entire party was very concerned about our choice of hotel. Fortunately things changed. The rest of the staff were a pleasure to deal with polite, helpful and cheery this included front desk, restaurant and maids. 

The rooms are a bit small, but the beds are extremely comfortable, with luxurious sheets that make sleep a pleasure. And the shower was so pleasant I probably waisted to much time in the bath. And if you are considering the breakfast, it's a definite yes. Great selection and wonderful service.

I suppose after ignoring the rocky start, the rest of the stay was a pleasure.",5,2018,07,28
105,Great bar and service!!,"Myself and a colleague of mine came for a drink and some food in your bar on Saturday. We were blown away by the attentive service and the friendly staff. Our waiter Adrian was knowledgeable and helped us choose our drinks. I ordered the cucumber gin cooler which was so refreshing and wonderfully made(I could have had 10) and my colleague had a Chestesfield Martini which comes with a shot champagne!! We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks. The food well what can I say. It has to have been the best fish and chips we have ever had. The presentation on the big slate was incredible never seen anything like it. We enjoy immensely our time at the chesterfield, we will definitely be back!!!",5,2018,07,28
105,Amazing ,"

105,Pamper Yourself at this hotel,"I booked this hotel as part of a package through Costco Travel.  Included in my package were daily breakfast, 3 course dinner for 2, and high tea for 2.  We enjoyed every meal at the Butler Restaurant, with it's excellent service and food.  High tea was so lovely and very filling.  The service from the staff from the moment of check in was above and beyond.  I booked this trip for my birthday and a cupcake and card and fruit was waiting in my room!  Bottles of water and a treat each night on the pillow (pillow spray, chocolate, bath salts) were all appreciated.  Our room was the Music room and it was so fun and quiet (be sure to look in every closet!)   I can't say enough about the wonderful staff who attended to our every need and made us feel so welcome in London.  The location is excellent.  We walked to Green Park station for the Tube, down to Fortnum and Mason's, and PIccadilly Circus.",5,2018,07,23
105,Amazing Hotel with wonderful customer service!,"First of all I want to say Jozef and Ben were absolutely amazing!  Jozef greeted us with the most friendly smile and made us feel like we were family.  This was my first time to London and the Hotel, ambiance and staff made my experience absolutely lovely!  I loved the decor, the English breakfast (which was my first ever)  and I loved everything about it :)  Ever time we would leave, Ben would be there to say goodbye and then our favorite staff member Jozef literally would grab a map and guide us in every direction we needed to go.  I highly recommend this Hotel for anyone who appreciates the culture of London.",5,2018,07,23
105,The Chesterfield is affordable luxury in the heart of Mayfair ,"When in London, I love staying near Green Park tube because it’s convenient to every place I want to go. The problem is limited hotel rooms near Green Park, and those hotel rooms are expensive. The Chesterfield Mayfair gave me the luxury treatment from check in. My room was not ready at noon. I left my bags, and went out. Upon my return, not only was my room ready, but my bags had already been brought up. The room was comfortable and well furnished. Ac helped us beat the UK’s heat wave. A firm king bed let me sleep like royalty. Breakfast was delicious, including made to order entrees. I want to come back again.",5,2018,07,23
105,Amazing Hotel and Completely British,From the warm smiled greeting from Jozeph upon arrival and throughout our whole stay this Hotel and staff were 5 star.  The property is beautiful and no detail is missed.  My girlfriend and stayed in the study room which I would definitely suggest if you want a Sherlock Holmes feel to your stay. We had an amazing time and the hotel is in a perfect central area for some of the city's major attractions.  We will be back for sure. Thank you Jozeph and everyone that made our stay absolutely perfect.,5,2018,07,23
105,Superb afternoon tea,I came with my girlfriend for a birthday treat to the chesterfield for afternoon tea. We were totally blown away by them. Everything was fantastic especially the service from our waiters panos and Alex (The twins) I couldn’t tell them apart!! The afternoon tea was perfect they really made my birthday! The candy man came and sang happy birthday to me and gave me a cupcake with happy birthday decorations. I was so overwhelmed but the smile was so large I’m still smiling now. Thank you chesterfield.,5,2018,07,22
105,Excellent,"Myself and my daughter came for afternoon tea on Friday . We really enjoyed it. 
Our waiter Eryk explained that it was only the first week that they were running this afternoon tea. My goodness what a treat it was! The sandwiches are brilliant, the scones were warm and soft. I was really happy that they where child friendly and did a smaller version for my daughter, she loved it so much. We took home some of the sweets they have on display on a cart. We will be recommending this to our friends. 
Thank you so much.",5,2018,07,22
105,Delightful afternoon tea at the Chesterfield,Myself and my friends came for the chesterfields afternoon tea. When we arrived we were greeted with a smile and seated at a beautiful table in their conservatory. As it was a sunny day the room was beautiful. We were then given a shock as they bought to the table a welcome drink that seemed to be flying up in the clouds. It was a topped with flying saucer candy and was smoking we had great fun playing with the smoke. Then came the afternoon tea and what can I say but wow. It was delectable our waiter Denisa was a delight nothing was too much to ask for. Will definitely come here again.,5,2018,07,22
105,Best afternoon tea ever!,My family and I came for afternoon tea on Wednesday and we were delighted we chose the chesterfield as everything was incredible. My personal favourite part was the sweet trolley which has a huge selection of sweets that we get 50g as part of the afternoon tea!!! Our waitress was maurizie and she was great always with a smile and everything about this experience was fantastic. We will be back!,5,2018,07,22
105,Superb as always,"Spent another lovely evening in the bar at the Chesterfield. It was absolutely top drawer as always. We wouldn't go anywhere else when in London. Alberto behind the bar is excellent, reminds me of my favourite uncle.",5,2018,07,22
105,Great location and lovely decor,"Stayed here for 8 nights, great location, lovely decor, sufficient facilities and amenities but mixed reviews on staff.

Location was great, 5-10 minutes walk to green park station depending on your walking pace, Hyde Park is very near as well if you fancy a jog. Decoration is classic but nothing is torn or worn, which allows the hotel to keep the traditional flavour without sacrificing any functionality or aesthetic qualities. There is no gym in the hotel, but they do provide you a entrance pass to a Fitness First Gym nearby. 

The terrace bar is great for a few drinks with friends or alone. Nice decor and vibe, the choices of drinks are plenty and snacks are served along as well. I haven't tried The Butler's Restaurant but I imagine the food to be good as I did ordered in room dining a couple of times and it turned out quite good. 

The service from staffs are generally very good although I did mentioned that I have a mixed review with staffs services/attitude. I must stress that this is a personal experience and should by no means be taken as a impression towards all the staffs. There is actually only one staff that I'd like to mention on this issue, Mr Edmund. Mr Edmund typically works night shift, or rather those are typically the times that I will see him. He wasn't the friendliest man around to ask questions(on separate occasions) as he can get a little inpatient, and I don't care attitude. Maybe it is the late hours, which is why I still gave them the benefit of the doubt and rated service a 5/5, because the other staffs are generally outstanding.

I'd like to pass my highest compliments to 2 staffs. Steven at Bar and Antonio (in room dining?) they were both very friendly and helpful throughout my stay, I pass on my many thanks.

Overall, Chesterfield Mayfair is a good place to stay when in London and I will return when in town.",5,2018,07,20
105,Afternoon tea,"My sister,daughter and I booked for an afternoon tea. The staff are very welcoming and greeted us with nice smiles. It was our first time to try the afternoon tea and we were not disappointed. They explained everything on what to have and always asked us if everything’s ok. The sandwiches and cakes are delicious especially the chocolate scone.
We were all happy and satisfied costumers. I’m highly recommend this hotel if you want to have an afternoon tea. 

Kind regards

105,"Lovely hotel, amazing staff, great location","We were in London for only two days at the end of a three week trip. We booked here for somewhere that would be easy and a little luxurious at the end of our holiday. This place did not disappoint.
The room was lovely, with a super comfortable bed and bathroom with bath. 
The staff were amazing, nothing too much trouble. We caught taxis (when we weren't walking places) and this hotel was perfect as there was always a line of them outside the door. 
Mayfair was a great neighbourhood to stay in. Very close to everything.
We would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay again.",5,2018,07,18
105,since 15 years ago,"I ate in this restaurant since 15 years ago and I can be pretty sure that is one of the must incredible and delicious experience in my life

105,Great hotel - great location - super staff,"My wife and I ended a European trip (Baltic cruise) with 4 nights in London and chose the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Firstly, location is perfect.  5 minute walk to the subway and 10-15 minute walk to Piccadilly, Oxford, Buckingham Palace, Westminster and Knightsbridge (all different directions, of course).  Room was very nice (we chose a medium size room so it wasn't huge but the bathroom was huge marble and tile with separate bath and shower).  2 standouts from the trip:  we needed a dinner reservation on a Saturday night and only thought of it on Friday night.  The concierge (Darren) truly went out of his way to find us exactly what we were looking for (after much effort as all the best Asian restos were booked) on Saturday morning while we were enjoying ourselves watching the changing of the guard at Buckingham.  Truly the type of personal service that is so hard to find these days.  Also, a call-out to their restaurant....had a great continental breakfast and sat in their adjoining sun room which was quite beautiful....not to be missed.
We will definitely be coming back!",5,2018,07,17
105,Afternoon tea,"My friends & I visited the Chesterfield Hotel for afternoon tea on Saturday afternoon.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed & the staff were delightful. They couldn't do enough for us.  I would highly recommend them.",5,2018,07,16
105,Fantastic afternoon !,"I was taken here for my birthday gift to have the Gin  Experience and Afternoon Tea. James Cravitz led our Gin experience and what an experience it was. He was so knowledgeable about it all and also added humour and laughter and we all had a fab time, trying new Gins and being told about the right tonics and garnishes to make the Gin extra special. We then went to the restaurant for afternoon tea and that was also exceptional, beautiful food which was topped up regularly, Champagne and the most wonderful array of yummy cakes served by exceptional staff. A great afternoon and we will recommend to people and also return for another go! Thank you to all the staff for making it a day to remember.",5,2018,07,15
105,EXcellent GIn and Afternoon Tea,"Just spent a lovely afternoon with family as birthday gifts, having the GIn Experience presented by the very knowlgeable James, it was fun and very informative and went back to basics with different gins.  We had the Premium Experience and certainly recommend.   IT took around one hour and we followed up with champagne afternoon tea, scrumpy cakes and sandwiches, as much as we could eat.   All the staff we encountered were pleaseant and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.  IF you want a GIn Experience go to the Chesterfield and ask for James....this is different to others offered in other hotels.",5,2018,07,14
105,Great time ,"Last month we spent 9 days at The Chesterfield.   This hotel in the best location in London is wonderful.    The staff was always friendly and helpful.   They helped us with any question we had.    We enjoyed the bar every night and sometimes at lunch. Room service and guest services were also great 
Thank you for a wonderful stay in London

105,A hotel to return to,"Very comfortable and  ideally situated within easy walking distance to SoHo, Oxford street, Piccadily, Green Park and Hyde Park. Excellent service. Particularly helpful and friendly staff. Excellent breakfast. I really enjoyed my stay.",5,2018,07,13
105,Recent visit,The Chesterfield is a lovely hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  The service is excellent and the rooms albeit small are very well appointed. The restaurant is very good and the bar one of my favorites.  A true oasis in busy Mayfair.,5,2018,07,09
105,This hotel is a favourite,We recently stayed at The Chesterfield and could not fault it. Great location.The staff were helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We were very spoilt with lovely little extra touches and surprises that helped to make our wedding anniversary extra special. Lovely bar to relax in after a busy day with the pianist playing in the background. We highly recommend The Chesterfield and will be back.,5,2018,07,09
105,Superior service time and again,"We just finished up a 3 week trip in Europe where we stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels in three different countries. At both the beginning and end of our journey, we stayed at The Chesterfield. Our conclusion: nothing can compete with the service and comfort offered by the amazing staff at The Chesterfield.    They pride themselves on attention to every detail as shown by the unbelievable attendants, high quality linens, early morning coffee, fabulous food, bar room music and drinks - we could go on and on. A special thanks to the night manager Hani and attendant August who are always there with night time service or extra help to get us through our California jet lag. And a shout out to all of the bellmen for their incredible and always professional service (and thank you George and Adrian for handling those dreadfully heavy bags with a smile as we left for the airport).  We truly appreciate the first class service extended by all of the employees at The Chesterfield.  It is why we have come back time and time again - and will continue to do so.",5,2018,07,08
105,Extremely luxurious and posh ,"Lovely hotel with extremely polite staff! It has a great location in a very luxurious part of London, and is within walking distance of everything. Great towels, amazing pillows and a very comfy bed. Only problem was that the bed was way to short for us, especially for my husband who is almost 2 m tall. He slept with his feet dangling in the air. The hotel style is very British, and you really get the London vibe when staying here. Loved the jazz evening as well! 

The hotel is highly recommended - especially if you are not very tall ;-) ",4,2018,07,07
105,What luxery,"We stayed at this hotel for the start of our honeymoon, you are greeted by a doorman opening your taxi door and showed in to the hotel, staff very nice, food was excellent, cocktail lounge was lovely with the little aperitif starters, room was fantastic. Close to Hyde park so had lovely afternoon walk there.",5,2018,07,07
105,Excellent,"Stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for 9nights in June 2018. It was an awesome stay with excellent service. Being a botique hotel the rooms were a little small but with a great English feel. Loved the staff who were extremly helpful. Turn down service was great with a token of surprise in the room daily. I thank the team who ensured we have a comfortable stay. I'm forgetting the lady's name but she was really sweet and understanding. She personally came to our room to check if everything was ok. 

The location is also just perfect. You might just bump into some celebrity while walking on the streets... as I did. Loved the pretty red carnations at the main entrance. 

The breakfast was great too. They serve breakfast in your room as well...just incase you are lazy to step down (as I was) with no additional charge. They are very popular for the afternoon tea and the famous fish and chips. 

Overall had a great pleasant stay. Thank you Chesterfield team for the wonderful memories. ",5,2018,07,06
105,Loved the Chesterfield!,"Location, location, location!  Food and service were great!  Everyone very friendly and helpful.  And great value in 4 nights for the price of 3. Only change I would make next time is a larger room.  And 4 sunny days in London!",5,2018,07,06
105,A great neighborhood!,"Our room at the Chesterfield was perfect for two friends travelling together. The lounge bar had great ambience and perfect for a cocktail before dinner. The breakfast each morning was excellent with many delicious choices. We ate dinner our first evening in the dining room and the food was quite well prepared. There were many restaurants within walking distance in eclectic neighborhoods. The tube was just a short walk away. Overall a great location, comfortable room and wonderful staff!",5,2018,07,04
105,Elegant and friendly,"We have stayed many times at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We like the location, rooms, food, and bar. This time we interrupted our stay and revisited Cambridge, then resumed our stay at the Mayfair.  The concierge and reception people were extraordinarily helpful. They suggested ways to get to and return from The Rolling Stones concert as well as other excursions. In every instance,  we felt valued and taken care of in a friendly and helpful way. And the sheets are cool and infinitely luxurious. ",5,2018,07,02
105,Return visit in every way as good as the first,"Have you ever been somewhere, really enjoyed it and returned to be disappointed? Not at the Chesterfield. This is a lovely, more traditionally styled Mayfair hotel. The service at every level is excellent, staff are very welcoming and professional in discharging their duties.  The bed had fabulous bedding, so soft and inviting, in fact the bed itself was extremely comfortable. The room was well serviced, had a kettle etc and a nice touch is providing a cafetière. The toiletries were fine, but not to my particular taste. Big fluffy towels, slippers for him and her, thick bathrobes ensure one's comfort. All in all, highly recommended. I'll definitely use The Chesterfield again. ",5,2018,06,28
105,LOVELY HOTEL WITH AMAZING SERVICE,"My husband and I spent five days at the Chesterfield Mayfair and we were absolutely delighted with the location -- the hotel is in walking distance from several metro stations, Soho, Picadilly.  Taxis in London are really so inexpensive that we just taxied everywhere.  And the service!  WOW -- from the doormen to the reception staff to the housekeeping department to the waitstaff in the restaurants.  Everyone was so helpful and friendly and really seemed to care about the guests loving their hotel.  WHICH WE DID!!!!!.  The hotel management really knows how to make guests feel welcome and catered to in an unassuming way.  The breakfast was amazing - we got to order from the breakfast menu as well as indulge in the buffet.  Housekeeping never had to be called -- we could leave the do not disturb sign out all day and go for dinner in the evening and upon our return the room would be made up.  Reception was ALWAYS helpful in answering questions about direction and concierge was helpful in suggesting itineraries.  The bed and pillows were heavenly - can't remember the last time I slept so well.
The only negative thing I can say is that the room was very small as was the bathroom.  We did not have a good view from the window - we looked out at rooftops and air conditioning units.  We asked to be moved and the second room was not much better.  But this is Europe and they just don't have the same large rooms that even a Holiday Inn will have in the States.  It takes getting used to but did not detract from my 5 stars because everything else was really perfect.  We certainly will be back but book a suite instead of a regular room and ask for a room that looks out over Charles Street rather than rooftops.",5,2018,06,26
105,Warm and welcoming,"As travellers with a dog finding a suitable hotel is often a challenge. The Chesterfield Mayfair staff are old hands at making dog lovers/travellers feel right at home and nothing is too much trouble. Ideally located for Parks, Berkley Sq just two minutes away and Green Park only five or six minutes - this hotel is well positioned. Comfortable well appointed rooms, very friendly service and very good food and beverage facilities. A hotel we will return to more and more.",5,2018,06,25
105,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Staff and Location","My wife and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary.  Our room, location and service at the hotel were perfect.   We stayed in one of the junior suites, and it had plenty of room and was very well appointed.  Our rate also came with breakfast each morning.  We also really enjoyed the gin and scotch tasting experience our last night there.  The individual who led this was very friendly and informative.  We will definitely stay there again.",5,2018,06,24
105,Best place to stay in london,"My wife and I were in London to see the Rolling Stones and we stayed here for four nights.  So many good choices in London it was hard to pick but I'm so glad we chose The Chesterfield Mayfair.  I loved this hotel.  Very elegant yet relaxed at the same time.  We really liked the location.  Room was very comfortable.  Really friendly staff, excellent service, enjoyed the restaurant, loved the bar.  We always made a point to have our last few drinks in the bar each night.  Open late when many pubs close early.  I can't say enough about the bar manager James.  He was very good at his job and made everyone in bar feel like a friend.  All the staff we encountered were excellent.  I definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again the next time I visit London.",5,2018,06,23
105,"Great hotel, service and location!","On the recommendation of our travel agent, we booked a 5-night stay at The Chesterfield. We booked a junior suite and an adjoining room.  Even before we arrived, this hotel was helpful and responsive. I emailed the concierge before our arrival and booked restaurants and shows.  The rooms were spacious, clean and elegantly appointed.  Service was exceptional.  Breakfast was included in our plan it it was plentiful - lattes were great. What a great location - walking distance to Buckingham Palace and all the shops in Picadilly Circus.  We will go back. It's not easy to find a good hotel overseas if you haven't been to a city before. We will definitely go back.",5,2018,06,22
105,Perfect in every way!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from June 15-19, 2018 and it was fabulous! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, concierge mapped out a walking tour for us, our rooms were impeccable, room service offered a wide variety and was timely, and afternoon tea was delicious and all you can eat! One of the highlights of our trip! The hotel is centrally located to all of the sights and amazing restaurants. We walked everywhere! We will definitely return to London and only stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel. A true feel of London, a gem for sure!

105,Excellent hotel,"Was staying last weekend and can say probably the best place ever been,starting from the hotel room to the restaurant and bar, dinner in Buttler’s reataurant was amazing,had Gin experience,which could highly recommend to everyone,absolutely fantastic.",5,2018,06,17
105,"Grace, Elegance & Charm, in the Heart of Mayfair","Going back many years, we had stayed at the lovely Chesterfield in Mayfair. Then, we got a flat, around the corner for about 6 of our trips, and finally settled on a hotel, right on Park Lane. After about 10 years of staying there, we felt that it was getting tired, so chose The Chesterfield, once again, and after many years.

Well, arriving was like we had stayed with them, for those intervening years. We were greeted, and treated,  like family members, returning from a 15 year journey, and back “home.” The staff treated us, as royalty, and that was greatly appreciated.

The Chesterfield, part of the Red Carnation Group, is a quaint, classic, intimate and charming hotel. It is small, and that is a large part of its charm.

Going way, way back, we had stopped into The Chesterfield, to gather information, for an upcoming stay. Even then, they treated us well, and showed us all around the property, of which they were rightly proud. With 2-3 stays, we did enjoy the property, and even dined there, after we had a flat a few blocks away. It was probably too long, between our last stay, and then the most recent one, at least as far as we were concerned..

We booked our suite, and were assigned the Duchess Suite, 429. This suite is in an adjoining building, and attached to the main structure. As with many older, and historic inns in London, The Chesterfield has expanded over time, and adjacent buildings have been incorporated. Such was 429. While we were on the 4th floor, we were in part of that adjacent building, and, as it turned out, about 4 steps lower, than where the lifts (elevators) put us out, on the “4th Floor.” No issues, but a slight elevational change.

We had booked The Chesterfield limo pickup from LHR, and that service (including the return to LHR) was perfect. I would highly recommend it. The driver, in both directions had a lovely Mercedes Benz S-Class, and as my wife had just received her 2018 version in the USA, we got to compare, and take notes. I had stood firm, and made sure that my wife’s car had the “special” rear seat package. The Chesterfield car had that too. The limo service was without flaw, on any aspect.

We were greeted, as I mentioned, as though we had been staying at The Chesterfield for all of those years. How they recognized us, upon entry, is still a mystery. Even the doormen welcomed us by name! Uncanny, to say the least.

Our suite was basically three rooms: an ample bedroom, with a comfortable King bed (very comfortable, and especially by European standards), a large bathroom with a walk-in shower (my wife has artificial hips, so a major plus), and then a living room, and the hallway, including the entrance. All aspects of this room were great, and very, very comfortable. We lacked for nothing.

The only aspect of our suite, with which I had an issue, was a creaky floor. However, we heard nothing from the rooms above us, and hope that anyone below us, also heard nothing. This might have been totally local, or at least I hope so. Still, in such an old, and historic building, a creaky floor is probably a very minor issue. I just made sure to “tip-toe” about, so as to not disturb anyone below us.

Our suite overlooked Charles St, and being on the 4th floor, we did not have what I would call a “view.” Still, that was not an issue, but then there was one issue – it seems that many folk, with loud, and exotic autos, love to race up and down Charles St. On a few nights, this went on far too long. While I love the sound of a Lamborghini Diablo’s exhaust note, not while I am trying to sleep! Beyond the few exotic cars, we heard almost zero other street noise. Again, a minor quibble, and probably more to do with Central London’s noise policies, than the hotel, itself. Beyond that, the stay was perfect, and in every way.

We dined at Butler’s, on-property, for several breakfasts, and then once for dinner. We visited the bar, plus the Afternoon Tea room, on several occasions. The staff seemed to keep notes of our wine/Champagne orders in the bar, as they often had our previous choices ready, as we walked in.  This was excellent, personalized service, and greatly appreciated. During our stay, we spent a fair amount of time in the lovely common areas, and I got a tour of the various meeting rooms, as my wife often hosts her UK board for meetings at our London hotel. All such spaces were lovely, accommodating, and attractive, having the feel of a very nice “country club,” or maybe a “city club?”

The location, in the heart of Mayfair is ideal, and so very much is but steps away. Over the last 20 years, we have stayed in Mayfair, and love the area. Within but steps, there are probably 6 Michelin-starred restaurants, and bars/pubs to suit every need/desire. While we tend to spend our dining time at the “upper-end” of the spectrum, there are many, more modest dining opportunities, and again, only a block, or two from The Chesterfield.

This was just a perfect stay, and even if the charming, historic hotel did not win our hearts (again), the wonderful staff certainly would have. Everywhere, there were great little touches, like a decanter of Sherry in the room w/ two stems, a fruit bowl, and around the common areas, lovely floral arrangements. We will definitely be back, and probably for our November trip.",5,2018,06,16
105,Old School London Elegance,This hotel epitomizes the height of London elegance and luxury.  It is located in the fashionable Mayfair district with easy access to many points of interest. The rooms combine luxury with modern conveniences.  The hotel offers an outstanding and generous tea.  The staff is most obliging.  Truly an A-plus experience.,5,2018,06,16
105,Lovely Quiet Hotel with Excellent Service,"We selected The Chesterfield Mayfair based on a recommendation from a friend, who works in London. We fell in love with this beautiful hotel in a quiet neighborhood. Our family was made to feel at home and well-taken care of from the moment we arrived. Every staff member was professional and friendly. The rooms were comfortable, immaculately clean, and so charming. We had two rooms since we traveled with our 18 year old twins. The reservation area ensured that our rooms were directly across the hall from one another, as requested. Breakfast was included in our rate, and the breakfast was excellent and so convenient before our days of touring. We highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair and cannot wait to return!",5,2018,06,16
105,"Atmosphere, Location, and Wonderful Staff!","We felt very valued and spoiled. The breakfast was well prepared and served. Two mornings we had to leave very early, and wonderful care packages given to us as we left. Our room was very comfortable and the amenities 1st class.The door men and desk agents were very helpful. We will be back for a longer stay next time!",5,2018,06,13
105,"Beautiful, welcoming hotel","Three generations of our family stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in early June, and
all enjoyed our visit immensely. The hotel is beautiful and elegant but also warm and
welcoming. Each member of the staff met guests with a smile and a positive
attitude, and the people at the front desk were especially helpful answering questions and making suggestions. Don't miss the breakfast - a fantastic start to a day in London.",5,2018,06,13
105,Wonderful week in June ,"This is a classic British hotel with superb service, food and drinks.  My only, and I mean only, complaint is the shower situation in the room.  Old, slow and difficult to adjust.  Otherwise this is a wonderful experience in a great location. Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,12
105,Amazing!!!!,"I took my husband here on the first weekend in June, it was a treat for his 40th birthday. Such a lovely hotel with beautiful surroundings in a fantastic location. We booked Benares for dinner which was just at the end of the street. We had lunch at the hotel bar I had a club sandwich and my husband had the bone marrow burger both were excellent. We then had booked in for a gin tasting with James. This wasn’t what I was expecting at all it totally exceeding my expectations. I thought it would just be a couple of pre mixed drinks to taste but it was all individual bottles of gin and mixers and you tasted it all from the straight gin, to the tonic on its own then with it all mixed together with whatever botanicals we were going to add. We also learnt about every one we were drinking and the history of gin. I highly recommend this experience. James also organised for there to be a surprise cake treat for my husband as it was a special birthday he went above and beyond and made it a fantastic experience. The decor is very traditional which we loved rooms were lovely and clean, and again had another birthday cake surprise in the room too along with a signed birthday card from all of the staff. I really felt like they tried to make it special for him. We opted for room service for breakfast and was all really tasty and fresh check out was at 12 so we got to lounge around for a few hours before we had to leave. Thank you for making it a wonderful birthday for my husband!  ",5,2018,06,12
105,Mrs Alliston,"We would like to say thankyou for making our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair so comfortable and welcoming. As this was our 3rd stay here it's needless to say we would certainly come back again.
As we were celebrating our Golden Wedding Anniversary they made our stay extra special.",5,2018,06,11
105,Lovely hotel in a great location,"This is our second time of staying at the Chesterfield.  It's a great hotel that is in a handy location for seeing the sights around London.  The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.  Everything is done to a high standard at this hotel including breakfast.  We would highly recommend staying here, you won't be disappointed.",5,2018,06,11
105,Amazing Stay,Definetely one of the best stays I've had in a hotel. Beautiful hotel with amazing service from the staff. The rooms were lovely and extremly comfortable. I'll definetley be coming back in the future!,5,2018,06,10
105,"Small hotel, but terrific location and great housekeeping!","We had room 608 and friends booked there after we did (we were part of a 31-person group following a 12-night cruise) for a total of 10 rooms booked.

Turn down service was great. Got delicious chocolate covered wafers at turn down the first night and a facial spray the second night, and when I left the housekeeper a note letting her know that I loved the chocolates at turn down, she left us a bunch of them that night.  She also put my husband’s pajamas on the bed at turn down and left the movie room service menu on the bed and waters with glasses on the nightstands. 

Are to leave towels for changing in the tub, which is a long and narrow tub with a movable piece of glass to get into the shower with the other half open to the bathroom.

There are two closets and the left one had a terrible mildew smell (made me gag) but the right one (that was a safe on the ground) was fine.  One had an iron. Both had both wooden and nice padded hangers.  Nice heavy robes behind yh  bathroom door and thick padded slippers (in two sizes) inthe closet.  Try to use those slippers as the bed (which has a drawer under it) goes all the way down to the floor with no toe space and I kept banging it with my toe. 

No refrigerator in room. Coffee making stuff is in a cabinet under the TV. A friend didn't want it taking up space on the furniture and they gave her free coffees from their restaurant.

The TV had a weird remote where we had to hit the power button and then Sky  button and then TV button and then the number one. 

Very small elevators so some couples in our group had to split up to get upstairs with luggage.

Live pianist in the bar at night. Gorgeous room for afternoon tea and another room for breakfast. 

Live red carnations in a vase in the bathroom (this hotel is apparently part of the Red Carnation chain).

Registration workers and bell hops were all very good. 

A letter was left on our bed on Friday night telling us about late nights at the museum (most are on Fridays and we didn’t see this till we got back to go to bed) and other weekend doings, which was a nice touch though more information (such as a list of museums and their hours that weekend) would have been helpful. 

They delivered right to our room gifts and letters friends left me at the front desk. 

Quiet room. 

Check for deals. We booked through Booking.com and got the same rate as friends who booked through Expedia I think and got the same rate but their rate included breakfast (which would have been an additional 22 pounds each on each day so worth quite a bit had we ever eaten there) and a 50 pound voucher to use at the hotel!",4,2018,06,10
105,Wonderful visit,"We stayed at this hotel as we wanted a hotel near the Ritz as we were having a meal there to celebrate our anniversary. We loved this hotel from the moment we walked in, wonderful staff, so friendly and helpful. It's decor is lovely and from another period in time, and it's kept to a very high standard. We had room 401which was very nice, had everything you could want from a hotel room, spotlessly clean and the bed was so comfortable. We had a drink at the bar, the barman was very friendly, the decor again was lovely and the chairs and stools were all very comfortable. It's got a lovely terrace area and it's very popular for afternoon tea. The breakfast was so good, a wonderful selection, the staff were so attentive, made our visit so special, we could not have wanted a better hotel to stay in for our anniversary treat. Check out was very quick and easy, we signed their book, we would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a special place to stay in London that is central to so much. Thank you for a wonderful stay. ",5,2018,06,10
105,Afternoon Tea,"I had an afternoon tea few days ago and I was really impressed about the excellent service of Adriana and Panos, very friendly and professional. Also the food was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!",5,2018,06,10
105,Tranquillity and quality in central location,As a first timer in London I wanted a hotel not far from sights . Also I wanted a full English experience . This hotel is in walking distance to Buckingham palace and a short walk from  Underground  station with direct connection to Heathrow . Still it is in a quiet street wich is valuable after a busy day in London . My room was right over the main  entrance . Still it was very quiet with very little traffic outside  . The style in the hotell is truly English . Furniture and everything else is of high quality and style . Service and food also very good . Will stay again .,4,2018,06,09
105,Miss Malina,"An amazing Afternoon tea experience - the service and food were excellent I absolutely love it. I highly recommend this place, thank you to Spartaco and Panos for a wonderful service! What a beautiful venue!",5,2018,06,09
105,Nice traditional place downtown,"The Chesterfield is located in the heart of Mayfair, say you can easily walk from the hôtel to visit London or find some restaurants for diner.
The hôtel is kind of very traditional old England style, but rooms are not worn-out. Rooms’ size is not big but usual in London.
Service is ok.
So well located, clean, traditional, that’s it.",4,2018,06,09
105,High Tea at it's Best,"My family had a tea reservations at the Chesterfield for 2:15 but we got there early  and asked if we could be seated. The entire staff were so nice to find us the perfect table.
This is a beautiful tea room, with flowers and orchids around all the tables.
Our waitress was great, and explained what their tea service included.
Their tea was well worth the price. Also my family brought along our dog and all the employees wanted to make him comfy,  with a dog bowl and bed.",5,2018,06,06
105,Highlight of Honeymoon,"My husband and I returned to The Chesterfield for our honeymoon after we stayed here in January of 2017 when we got engaged. For this trip we stayed here for 4 nights total and will never stay anywhere else while visiting London. 
Our favorite way to wind down a night after exploring the city is to sit at the bar and enjoy a pint. James is spectacular! 
The rooms are all wonderful, we have stayed in a few now and no matter where you stay you feel comfortable and at home. The entire staff are well trained and truly care about your experience. We split up our trip- London 2 nights, Scotland 6 and then London for 2 more nights. As we headed back to London we knew our trip was coming to an end but could not wait to be back at our home away from home. The Chesterfield is just so special. 
If you are having trouble making a decision on where to stay do yourself a favor and just go ahead and book here! You won't regret it!",5,2018,06,05
105,A very nice place to stay,"Only stayed here one night due to the cost, but it was very enjoyable. The room was comfortable and the amenities were very nice. If I had to nitpick, I would say that the AC was a bit under-powered, but since the weather was good, it was a non-issue. The bed, pillows, and everything in the bathroom were all very satisfactory. All the staff were friendly, and the location was convenient. Would stay here again if looking for a place to drop a little extra money on a nicer hotel room.",5,2018,06,04
105,Beyond Best,"There are many wonderful hotels in London, but none better than the Chesterfield Mayfair.  We decided to conclude a recent three week holiday, touring Europe, with a four day stay in London.  As is my usual practice we stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  

My travel companion, a seasoned traveller like myself and frequent visitor to London, usually stays at the better known and more expensive London hotels.  She cautiously accepted my recommendation to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Upon our arrival she was won over in minutes.  After an early flight from Amsterdam we arrived at the hotel at 11:30 a.m., exhausted and grumpy.  Three weeks of travelling from city to city was taking its toll.   Recognizing our “weary traveller” they quickly cleaned and prepared a room for us while we waited in the lounge drinking early morning tea.  Well I drank tea.  My friend had a gin and tonic.  We were on Amsterdam time so  for her it was 1 p.m.  within thirty minutes they presented us with a room key, several hours before their standard check-in time.  The lounge at the hotel is wonderful for people watching, and that includes their gregarious wait staff, so we stayed a bit longer, enjoying a delicious bar room lunch beforeI went up to check the room.  It was a bit smaller than we wanted and included only a bath.  We wanted a walk-in shower.  They happened to have one of their beautiful suites available so we upgraded and since it was a “last minute” change they gave it to us for only a moderate increase in rate and ,of course, moved our luggage for a second time,p while we finished off in the lounge.  The lounge became our resting spot at the end of each day’s adventures.   

On day two the lounge was our dinner spot, having their exceptional fish and chips.  The best in the city.

Whether it was getting directions, ordering a taxi or booking dinner reservations they were helpful, quick and friendly.  A big part of enjoying one’s stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair is interacting with their wonderful staff.  While everyone is exceptional their Maître d’ is exceptional.  Witty, wise and with a hint of mischevious we watched him turn a “first time” afternoon tea, for some ladies from Texas, into a truly memorable experience.  For us it was his perfect choice of wine to accompany a superb beef Wellington.  We may return just for that dish.  

While in London we did our traditional shopping at Harrods, Fortnam and Mason and a couple of shops with local designers. — all within walking distance — and spent our evenings at the theatre, the best remained our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.

And if all that isn’t enough to recommend it, — even the windows in our room opened!

If you want antiseptic modern don’t go to this hotel.  If you want a hotel for a bunch of boisterous children this is likely not your best choice, although I think that they likely have a few tricks up their sleeve to win over even the youngest of guests.  If you want the best of sophisticated, traditional British style and service you can do no better than the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2018,06,03
105,Great Location!,"We stayed here for 3 nights on the back end of a 2 week vacation to Europe.  Fro the moment we stepped out of our car, we felt welcomed.  Everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maid service was very friendly.  The rooms are nice and comfortable.  We ate at their Butlers Restaurant 3 times for breakfast and 1 time for dinner.  The wait staff was very attentive to during our meals. I recommend the fish and chips as they were very good.  Shepherds Market is in very close proximity and has several great places to eat.  I highly recommend staying here. ",5,2018,06,03
105,My Special Place in London.,"What an amazing find the Chesterfield was for me when I first discovered it back in 1996, and I have been coming back almost every year since, when I'm in London.  I love the décor of the hotel . . . the rooms, the bar, the tearoom . . . everything is so pleasant & welcoming.  The staff is a real delight; they are so attentive that you would think you were the only guest they had. What ever request you present to them, they somehow always come through. The charm of the hotel is not just the beauty of the décor and cleanliness, the fantastic staff make this hotel a real gem!!",5,2018,06,02
105,Amazing stay in a beautiful hotel filled with character in the centre of Mayfair,"My girlfriend and I stayed in a wonderful suite in the Chesterfield while in London for a weekend. The staff were courteous, helpful and provided a fantastic service. The bar area was a great place to relax before heading out to see the city and included a gin tasting menu which one of the bar staff talked us through, explaining the history and origins of the gins we were tasting which really added to the experience. Breakfast in the morning was a highlight with table service and plenty of delicious options. 

We had a very special stay and I wouldn't hesitate to book again for our next trip.",5,2018,06,01
105,Great stay!,"What a wonderful hotel from start to finish! Really have to commend the front desk team, especially Sanae for being so warm and welcoming. I loved my room, the breakfasts, the location. What a lovely little hotel.",5,2018,05,31
105,Fantastice Stay!!,I stayed here a few weeks ago with my partner. The Front Desk Team won me over as soon as we walked in. We were greeted by a very friendly lady named Letitia who even addressed us by name during our whole stay. The drinks in the bar were amazing along with the afternoon tea :) Will definitely return to this charming little gem :),5,2018,05,31
105,"Great staff, perfect location ","Recently celebrated my birthday with a beautiful meal in the Chesterfield Mayfair with friends. The service was fantastic with great attentive staff, our waiter Panos was so helpful it was only at the end of the meal being presented with my birthday candle dessert did I realize his identical twin brother Alex was serving the table also. It wasn’t the wine that made me see double. The menu has a great selection and food top notch.Whenever entertaining visitors in London the Chesterfield is always the first port of call due to its Ideal Mayfair location",5,2018,05,30
105,Lovely setting,I spent a night there last year and was really impressed by the service and interior design. An overall great experience. I really enjoyed the food and intimate nature of the interior space. It did not feel like a typical hotel stay by any means,5,2018,05,29
105,This hotel should be 5 Stars!!!,"Outstanding customer service from all levels of staff.  Beautifully decorated rooms and the most comfortable beds ever! Probably the best sleep I've ever had in all the hotels I've stayed in.  Very hard to fault this hotel, I know I'll be returning very soon. Highly recommended! Thank you so much hotel staff :)",5,2018,05,29
105,Simply amazing,The service is great the stuff is very very friendly and make the customer feel very comfotable I loved every single bit of it...most definitely going to go back there soon...such a lovely experience...,5,2018,05,29
105,A home away from home,"From the moment I walked through the doors, I felt welcomed and very well attended to. Staff was very helpful, rooms were more than comfortable and best of all breakfast was delicious. Definitely visiting again.",5,2018,05,28
105,Wonderful hotel,"I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Hotel, Mayfair, wonderful staff who can't do enough to help, beautiful hotel in a prime location, excellent breakfast. We will be back on our next rip to London.",5,2018,05,28
105,"Excellent location, very pleasant stay","The hotel benefits from a great location. Soho, Belgravia, Covent garden and other locations are accessible by feet in 15 minutes or so, perfect when the weather is nice. Typical british style hotel, great staff, all in all the prices are honest (considering the location). Rooms are a bit small but very confortable and nicely decorated.
We spent a very nice week there.",5,2018,05,27
105,Treated Like Royalty,"We had the amazing opportunity to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair for a week during the Royal Wedding.  Harry and Meghan couldnt have been treated better than we were.  Yes, the rooms are beautifully decorated with their plush fabric walls and luxurious linens and towels.  Yes, the hotel is immaculate - even the flowers have nary a single browned leaf. Yes, the hotel is within walking distance to the tube and a cab is at the door in under a moment.  All true.  But it is the attention to detail and the service from the staff that sets this place apart.  Karolis and Darren at the concierge desk will assist you with tickets to anywhere (be certain to inquire about senior discounts if over aged 60 and applicable).  Joe in the lobby will greet you daily and ask if you have any needs - he will rsvp on your behalf, contact housekeeping for more pillows, tell the concierge where you need to go - you name it.  Want to watch the Royal Wedding in the bar area?  Be prepared for a drink named for the occasion and the beautiful and lovely Barbara and Sabrina to serve you with warmth and friendliness. They will bring you complimentary snacks. You liked them?  Here is a complimentary bag for you.  It isn't just the lovely ladies.  There was a wonderful young man working there who knew we loved the wedding, so he brought me a complimentary set of 6 champagne flutes with the royal insignia.  Its the little touches - immediate reply to emails, turndown service includes facial mist to keep you refreshed,a lovely brownie on the eve of your last night, being greeted like the staff came in just to see you, make you feel like family, and tend to your every wish.  Just think it and before you can say it, they have anticipated it.  We have been to London countless times, but in the future, there will be no other place we will stay.  Chesterfield Mayfair is our home away from home.",5,2018,05,26
105,Lunch at a First Class restaurant,"The restaurant in this hotel is an oasis of calm in the busy West End. Service is exemplary. The food is close to perfection. I love their Cobb Salad with the chef’s own dressing. The place, like the hotel, reeks of understated class. Yes, it’s pricy but you get what you psy for.",5,2018,05,26
105,Trip review,"Excellent service, quality and comfort away from home. Enjoyed all the amenities, friendly staff as well as the proximity to all the main central parts of London in particular Oxford Circus, Mayfair and Hyde park.",5,2018,05,25
105,Great old hotel in the heart of Mayfair London,"My wife and I stayed here for 7 days in May when the spring flowers were in full bloom.  We are a relatively young hip couple who enjoy modern things, but the Chesterfield Mayfair takes one back in time.  A small quaint and very charming hotel.  The floors creak, the upholstery is museum and the cutlery is antique, but everything is maintained very well.  Service was wonderful and personal, including the too friendly doormen.  It feels like a comfy bed & breakfast experience from the 1800's.  Breakfast, by the way, was fantastic with a simple buffet and wonderful hot dishes to order.  Given its moderate price, we will now make it our hotel of choice.  Only downside for us was no gym or spa but we spent so many hours walking that we had exercise enough.  We chose the hotel because my wife wanted a real classic British experience and we sure got it.  It's nice staying in hotels that represent the culture which one is visiting.  Room was not big but big enough for us and our two large suitcases.  Showers were strong and piping hot.  Bathroom was a bit small and only able to accommodate one person at a time, but then again my wife never wants me in there with her in any case.",5,2018,05,25
105,Nice hotel with a very British feel,Chesterfield Mayfair is a charming hotel situated in the heart of Mayfair. A short walk to Park Green tube station & Buckingham Palace. Covent Gardens and Picadilly Circus were also a very walkable distance away.  Onsite bar was excellent and made a gin & tonic drinker out of my wife. The front desk and doormen were quick to grab taxis for our party of four.  A bevy of restaurants and pubs are located nearby.,4,2018,05,23
105,Needs an update,"Excellent location and absolutely top-notch service. But, and it is a big ""but"", the rooms are small and the furnishings and fittings are tired.  It needs an update.  

Our room was comfortable but so small we could not keep our bags open so we could access belongings when we needed them.  We had to continually hoist the bags up onto the beds to open them.  Closets were too small to open the bags and there was no space in the room for them.  For the price I'd expect more.  I will say they lay out a superb breakfast.

I feel bad criticising the place since the staff was so wonderful.  It appears to me that ownership is coasting on the strength of their service, their location and brand name while avoiding the cost of updating.  Perhaps smart business in the short run but I think I'll stay elsewhere next visit.",4,2018,05,23
105,Whisky tasting ,"Had a very pleasant afternoon tasting 4 Scottish whiskies guided through their taste, smell etc by James a very well informed and pleasant young man a great experience at a very friendly hotel that felt relaxed and informal and although I haven’t stayed there I could see it would be a great place to stay while visiting London and for sightseeing ",5,2018,05,23
105,Loved everything about this hotel!,"From the moment we arrived I loved this hotel. The staff were so welcoming and professional. Checking in was hassle free. The décor is absolutely delightful throughout. Our room was traditional and quaint. We opted for breakfast in our room the following morning and it was delivered promptly by a courteous member of staff. The food was delicious and plentiful. Everything you could want from cooked food, to fruit and pastries. Absolutely faultless. On checking out we were made aware that the hotel is in fact dog friendly - something we were thrilled to hear! We will definitely be returning to this gem of a hotel, and bringing our pooch too. It is a really charming place, close to lovely restaurants and all you need is in walkable distance. The thing that really stood out to us was the high level of customer service. It is fantastic to go somewhere and for the staff to seem happy to be at work. We look forward to our next visit!",5,2018,05,22
105,Lunch on,"Lunch time. Excellent food, very polite staff attention and a fantastic recommended after lunch experience with their whisky test called ""whisky nosing"", tutorialized by Ms. Sabrina, thanks for this great time.",5,2018,05,22
105,Amazing ,"Stayed here weekend 19th May . This hotel is fantastic in every way! The staff are professional whilst friendly, nothing is too much trouble and always have a smile for you. Made you feel very welcome and comfortable. Little touches made  all the difference. Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone, will definitely stay there again .  ",5,2018,05,20
105,Great location but interior can use an update,"The hotel is nicely located in walking distance from several key sites.  However, the interior left more to be desired.  It was definitely Old English which I guess is part of it's charm and appeal but it could desperately benefit from a little refurbishment and updating especially in the bathrooms.  The doors slammed shut quite a bit and the floors creaked.  I guess I just expected a little more elegance from a hotel in Mayfair.",3,2018,05,19
105,London Gem,"This was our fourth visit to the Chesterfield and it never disappoints.  It is a small hotel in Mayfair on a quiet street, within walking distance to restaurants, shopping, some theater and the underground.  It has an elegant, British feel to it with a wonderful staff that is friendly and helpful.

The room we had was on the small side but beautifully furnished.  Storage space was more than adequate for a week’s stay and the bathroom had everything you needed including an excellent rain shower and large, soft luxurious towels.  Turndown service was provided every night with fresh towels, a general straightening of your room and treats left on your pillow.

Our room rate did not include breakfast, which is available in a very handsome restaurant and is quite pricey.  However, there are so many places that serve breakfast within a 5 minute walk of the hotel that this should not be an issue.  Shepherds Market is around the corner with several excellent choices.  One morning, we had to leave especially early for a tour and when we entered the lobby, complimentary croissants and coffee were laid out for early risers.

With so many hotels available in London, we obviously wouldn’t keep going back to the same place if we weren’t totally satisfied.  I have little doubt that, should we return to London, we will stay here again.",5,2018,05,19
105,Whisky tasting with james,"James was amazing! So knowledgeable and enthusiastic! He knows everything there is to know about whisky! The Japanese one was amazing!  Highly recommend this! The chesterfield Mayfair is beautiful and the atmosphere incredible, it is the day before Prince Harry’s weddings and they have created a special cocktail! YUM! Go whisky tasting at the Chesterfield and ask for James!!",5,2018,05,18
105,Whiskey tasting,"Came here for the whiskey tasting - James was amazing, tells the stories and diversity of the whiskeys so well from canada to Scotland to japan. If you’re into your whiskeys go here and ask for the experience from James.",5,2018,05,18
105,Look no further,"The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London is the finest boutique hotel you will find in the UK. You feel as if you are treasured guests in a wealthy Brit's home. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated. The staff is genuinely helpful and efficient in every way. The hotel bar has a comfortable, warm atmosphere with wonderfully professional bar service. Even the hotel restaurant is superb -- food and service. With 50 years of travel I can say this is my favorite hotel anywhere. Don't miss an opportunity to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",4,2018,05,16
105,Beautiful hotel and excellent service,"The hotel is absolutely stunning with remarkable decoration and ambience.

The service provided by the staff is impeccable and they are always looking after you. 

I visited the bar today and Adrian, one of the lovely staff members of this great hotel, made sure a comfortable place to work and charge my laptop while providing an excellent service that the Chesterfield Mayfair is famous for.",5,2018,05,15
105,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Just checked out after a three nights stay at The Chesterfield. It's a small charming hotel and like all the previous comments, it's close to everything that many visitors to London want to see or do. It's perfect being so central yet incredibly quiet. 
Our rooms were ideal for us as we rarely stay in our room for long but we could say that the bathroom was slightly small but that isn't a problem for us
The dining room was relaxing and beautifully presented whilst the array of breakfast was more than enough. We opted of full English twice during our stay, it wasn't the best breakfast I've eaten - the bacon was hard and overcooked but the plates weren't heated and generally the food was luke warm but again that's fine
However we did raise an eyebrow when one of the staff got out the carpet cleaner and started hoovering the dining room whilst we were eating. Fair play, she did ask us did we mind her cleaning around us, what can you say - as she had already done one side of the restaurant. This was 11.10am I do understand that as they do offer a late breakfast at the weekends, it might be a rush to then organise the room for lunch, but it's not relaxing or tasteful someone cleaning around you, it makes you feel like you're in the way
Any case, it would not put me off from staying here again as everything and everyone at the hotel was delightful",4,2018,05,15
105,"Super stay, super staff","Let me start off my review of the Chesterfield Mayfair by mentioning that I have relatives in the hotel industry, in another part of the U.K, so I have some understanding of the presentation and mechanics of a well-run hotel (my relatives are not involved with the Red Carnation Hotel chain . . . as a personal disclaimer).  The location of this hotel is great--one has access to all of the sights and venues of Mayfair and Piccadilly.  The street address is quiet--away from the hustle-and-bustle of Piccadilly and Oxford Streets.  The Front Door and Reception Staff are friendly and accommodating; the Bar and Dining Staff are warm and show attention to detail; and the Housekeeping Staff do  a fine job maintaining the 100 or so rooms.  The hallmarks of the Chesterfield Mayfair are:  1) very good value for price, and 2) a staff that works very well together and translates that esprit de corps into taking care of guests.  While the hotel bills itself as a 4-star category hotel, it rates up a notch . . . a 4-and-a-half star category.  Yes, you can stay in a 5-star property like the Ritz or another venerable 5-star property around the corner on Mount Street; however, if you are looking for a boutique-size hotel with a welcoming household . . . this is the best choice in Mayfair, hands down!",5,2018,05,14
105,"Fantastic stay in the heart of Mayfair, London","Both myself and my fiancée were in awe with the service and care we received from the Chesterfield staff. From the ease of booking process to the friendly face of Beth at reception it was one of the most (if not the most) wonderful stay we have experienced in the UK.

Not only was our booking representative, Kornelia, extremely attentive when taking our booking but she took the time to understand our reasons for staying (it was an important celebration for us) and ensured there was some really thoughtful gifts  to greet us upon arrival. She also kindly organised gin tasting that eve which was given by Fiachra – a wonderful gent who was articulate, attentive and who gave us an unparalleled experience in gin tasting.

I have already recommended the Chesterfield to 6 of my friends and my partner has also boasted of your hotel to at least 8 of his work colleagues!

At the Chesterfield we received flawless service and the client experience was exceptional .

We will certainly be back!""",5,2018,05,14
105,"Great, classic British Hotel!","Loved the hotel stay. Ieva, Loris, Laura, Roula, and Rafcar helped us and were excellent. Miss it already! Breakfast included, which was a huge plus. Stayed in ""The Study,"" a very cool library-themed room.",5,2018,05,13

105,Outstanding British Experience,My wife and I celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary at the Chesterfield and they pulled out all the stops to make it a memorable experience.  100% recommend it!

Staff amazing esp at front desk",5,2018,05,10
105,Impressive hotel with great location,"Stunning hotel: beautvully decorated inside, the rooms are comfortable, clean and grand. Personal is very polite and helpful. Got a very nice compliment from the hotel on the birthday day! Location is very central but on a quiet nice street. 
The overall combination: style, quality, location, rooms exterior (very fresh  lookin!) and price is very difficult to find in central London!",5,2018,05,10
105,Fab afternoon tea!,"My husband and I had a lovely champagne afternoon tea in Chesterfield's conservatory. The ambience is beautiful, the employees were friendly and attentive, and the food was delightful! Definitely recommended and I'll come back again",5,2018,05,09
105,City Break,"The hotel was in impeccable order on arrival. Staff were extremely polite and welcoming. 
Our room was not available at check in time, but our bags were promptly taken off us and stowed and complimentary drinks / bar snacks were provided as compensation (the delay was no more than 5 minutes). 

We didn't spend a great deal of time in the hotel but it was more than expected.

Thanks",5,2018,05,09

105,Best afternoon tea!,"Just wanted to leave a review to say how impressed I was with the Willy Wonka Tea we attended on Saturday. Was so impressed with everything from start to finish! We arrived 40 mins early to make sure we had enough time to find the hotel and instead of waiting for our reservation the receptionist was happy to bring it forward. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially Laura and Lori! We came for my friends birthday and we were genuinely made to feel like nothing was too much trouble. The afternoon tea was incredible and we were so impressed with all the little touched. Thank you for a lovely afternoon!",5,2018,05,08
105,Terrific hotel in Mayfair," The reception on arrival is friendly, helpful and professional; the room is airy and not too small; the breakfast is sumptuous; the bar offers fine wine by the glass as well as ok late night food. Close to Green Park, Piccadilly, theatres, some good restaurants and the National Gallery ",5,2018,05,07
105,Absolutely superb,"This is our second stay at the Chesterfield and it was again a delight from start to finish.  Our room was quiet and exceptionally comfortable. The restaurant and bar excellent. What however elevates this hotel above and beyond its rivals is its staff.  It is so refreshing to stay at a place where everyone takes such pride in what they do and are genuinely helpful, warm and friendly, with none of that passive-aggressive obsequiousness that passes for service in many other establishments.  A real gem of a place and one we have no hesitating in recommending to anyone.",5,2018,05,06
105,Best Hotel in Mayfair,"Although my wife and I have stayed in other Mayfair hotels, this was our first stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  Saying we were impressed would be putting it mildly.  First of all, its location on a quiet street just off Berkeley Square is absolutely perfect.  It is in a serene neighborhood that is just a few blocks from Green Park tube station.  Shepherd Market was also an easy stroll from the hotel.  Our room was comfortable and well-appointed with a window that partially opened.  After staying in hot London hotel rooms that felt hermetically sealed, we were thrilled to be able to let cool breezes into our room.  Unlike some older London hotel accommodations, our room had several convenient power outlets for hair dryers and electronics.  One reason we chose The Chesterfield Mayfair was the value for money.  We paid less than we have at other area hotels, AND we had a full breakfast included.  My wife had Eggs Benedict every morning as she swore they were the best she had ever eaten.   An important reason for staying at a luxury hotel is the quality of the staff.  From management to the reception staff to the restaurant servers, the service was exemplary.  Of special note was Letitia, the Guest Services Manager, who made it a point to greet us personally as we checked in, and then topped it off by sending us a personal hand-written note welcoming us to the hotel.  Chloe, who checked us in at reception, was charming as well as efficient.  Finally, Antonio from room service introduced himself when he delivered an unexpected complimentary fruit tray.  The Chesterfield Mayfair is the perfect hotel to pamper yourself at a reasonable cost.  My wife and I can see no reason to stay anywhere else in Mayfair.",5,2018,05,04
105,Excellent - Above and Beyond,"We stayed at the Chesterfield recently and have nothing but praise. The hotel and the location are ideal, but what made the difference for us were the staff. At check in we were warmly welcomed and John helped me download and print some awkward concert tickets. The bar staff and waiters we friendly and helpful. Upon our return, we found that we had left our toiletry bag there. I called the hotel and the switchboard operator was possibly the most helpful person I've ever encountered. Together with Elliot the concierge they located the bag and mailed it to us.
Nothing but praise, the Chesterfield will definitely be on our agenda again",5,2018,05,04
105,London vacation,"Had a great trip to London! The staff @ the Chesterfield Mayfair was helpful and kind! Quaint British hotel that enhanced our experience. Highly recommend! Also, recommend the hotel breakfast; great start to busy sightseeing days.",5,2018,05,03
105,Best hotel ever,"I stayed with my family and everything was perfect.  My son and daughter had beds set up at the other side of our suites with mini bath robes !  We had breakfast sent to the room and the lady who delivered it was ever so gracious.  The facilities were perfect, everything clean and they genuinely cared about my children offering them a milkshake voucher on check in! My son has a nut allergy and the voucher did not forget to remind us to let them know of allergies so this hotel has really thought of everything!  My 10 year old son said ‘’ Mum this is the best hotel we have been to!’’ and I am glad we stayed here. Thank you for taking great care of me and my family

105,Beautiful experience,Wonderful staff who were all very friendly! From the moment I walked in my bags were ushered off me like I was royalty. Beth was so welcoming and a delight to speak to on check in. My room was not ready and she simply whisked me away to the terrace bar where I had a lovely gin and tonic - they have a shelf full of just gin! My room only took 30 minutes longer and even as I walked up to the room the housekeeping staff in the Hall smiled and wished me a lovely stay. Top class definitely somewhere im staying again,5,2018,04,30

This is a hidden gem at an exceptional value.,5,2018,04,29
105,Wonderful stay ,"My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for one night to celebrate my ‘significant’ birthday.  From the moment we checked in to check out, every member of staff we met were friendly, helpful, courteous and attentive to our needs.  Our room was beautiful and spotlessly clean.  We enjoyed the hotel’s weekly gin and jazz night in the terrace bar.  Gin-fantastic menu, with our drinks being served with a canapé tray which was replaced numerous times during the evening.  The band played happy birthday to me and presented me with a little birthday cupcake in addition to the cake and card left in our room for me.............lovely personal touch.  At the time of booking we were given a £50 dining voucher which we used for room service breakfast the next morning.  All in all a wonderful stay at another Red Carnation hotel.  ",5,2018,04,29
105,Exquisite,"Stayed at the hotel and everyone was a delight ! Dined in the restaurant had the scallops with sea weed and the Dover sole - absolute perfection. My room was well appointed and had all i needed. Staff were polite without being overbearing. Clean linen, good location oh and the breakfast! The breakfast was quite spectacular- thank you for being so perfect Chesterfield!",5,2018,04,29

105,AMAZING STAY,"Stayed a few days at Chesterfield for business and it was absolutely fantastic. Hotel itself is small and intimate and is ideally located to access some of londons best tourist attractions. I finally got to see Buckingham palace which is a short walking distance away then followed it up with a jog around green park and Hyde park. The rooms where very clean (linen and towels was clean fresh and new, bathroom was clean and shower was easy to use and powerful). Staff were extremely helpful and engaging from the second I entered the hotel and provided me with helpful information about the local area. The food was absolutely divine, had their steak and it was cooked to perfection, continental breakfast was on point, wine list was extensive and the bar was great with an amazing ambience. Overall this was a five star experience and I would definitely be coming back.",5,2018,04,25
105,Perfection and top class,"If you are looking at experiencing London in top class fashion then there is no where better to stay! The service and staff are incredible, the facilities are top class. I can't wait to come back again!",5,2018,04,25

105,Ideal Location,On a short trip to London we stayed here for one night in a classic double room. Nice location with plenty of things to do and see within easy walking distance. A small hotel with a friendly atmosphere. We were staying on Avios points so had the room for “free”. We therefore chose to eat out for breakfast and dinner.,4,2018,04,23
105,Loved it...,I really loved my 3day stay at Chesterfield Mayfair. The service was remarkable and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  The decor in the rooms was state of the art and the rooms were very clean. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2018,04,23
105,Hidden Jewel,Fabulous intimate hotel that captures the feel and essence of London. Our stay in London began and ended with this amazing hotel. It is unlike any other hotel in the world. The staff made us feel like royalty. We recommend the Chesterfield as a wonderful destination!,5,2018,04,23
105,A Delightful Sanctuary in Mayfair,"Where does one start to describe such a pleasant stay in The Chesterfield?

It begins right as you step out of the taxi to be met by the doorman with a genuine friendly smile. The reception staff are equally charming, as are all the impeccably trainee staff.  The decor with those romantic red Carnations and an old world feel about the place, induces a feeling of calm and relaxation.  

Our room, the Dartmouth Suite, was light and airy. Very comfortable. 

We come to London about once a year and I would like to think that we shall be staying at the Chesterfield again.",5,2018,04,23
105,Warm and inviting haven in the heart of Mayfair,"If you want to stay in a hotel that exudes old world charm in the heart of London this is as close to perfect as you're likely to get.  The staff were helpful and welcoming; our room was well-appointed with a lovely comfortable bed.  Even though the hotel is so centrally located, the rooms are really quiet.  I would definitely stay here again if we return to London!",5,2018,04,23
105,The best and most personal service!!,"The best overall long stay I've had at any Hotel.  All staff, beds, rooms, bathrooms, housekeeping, restaurant, bar made me feel wanted and appreciated every minute I was there.  Highly recommend.  Also, outstanding central location to everything.",5,2018,04,22
105,I will recommend The Chesterfield to all of my friends and loved ones!,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 8 nights on a mother-daughter trip to London with my nine-year old.  The hotel was so charming - just as depicted in the pictures online.  However, it was the staff that really made the hotel so special.  They went out of their way to make our stay memorable. My daughter felt like she had died and gone to heaven as the staff really went to extra mild to get to know us and make our visit very special. Words can’t convey how surprised we were when we got back to our room after a long day at the Harry Potter studio tours to an over the top, too generous presentation of Harry Potter themed gifts!
We feel so lucky to have found such a special place and we can’t say enough good things about this fabulous hotel.  I have only been home for a couple of weeks and I have already recommended the Chesterfield Mayfair to three different people and am planning on booking it for my next visit to London. 
I could not have picked a better place to stay.  In addition to the fabulous staff, it was in a great location - safe, clean and with easy access to several tube lines. It is within walking distance of great restaurants and parks.",5,2018,04,22
105,Enjoyed every minute! ,"Myself and my friend stayed recently and absolutely loved it! The room was amazing, clean and tidy and the bed was soooo comfortable. All the staff just couldn’t do enough for you and made you feel special. The room service was very yummy and the hotel is local to some great social places. 

Highly recommend!

105,Birthday afternoon tea traar,"Whilst staying in the London for my girlfriends birthday, the only thing she wanted to do was go for an afternoon tea (she didn’t know we were going to London, anywhere would do).

After extensive research into Afternoon teas in London I decided to book at this hotel for a couple of reasons: 

1) Price - I’m not paying £60+ for an afternoon tea at a ‘name’ hotel.

2) Sandwiches on choice - a normal selection of sandwiches were on offer.

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greated by friendly, smiley faces.  We were directed to the dining area, everyone said good afternoon too,  and were seated in the conservatory ( I did email ahead and request this and I had a response saying they’d try but couldn’t guarantee it, which i was more than happy with).

We were taken to our table but a waiter that as the afternoon went on we were very impressed with.  Apologies if incorrect but I think his name was Valerij.  He then gave us the menus.  While we decided what to have, we were given a cranberry popping candy which was delicious.

After a short wait he came back across and we ordered the afternoon tea, we requested no salmon sandwiches, with a glass of champagne. 

The food was delivered to our table by I think, Ieva.  She offered to explain what each item was, but we declined. Also our tea was poured for us.  We noticed the salmon sandwiches were there but we were not too bothered, so carried on anyway.   Valerij, came across, apologised and replaced the sandwiches with more and no salmon.  

Sandwiches:
Perfect finger sandwiches, lovely fillings, good quality bread.

Scones:
Wow! We live in Devon but these were probably some of the best scones we have ever had.

Pastries:
Again a delicious selection; the lemon cheesecake was perfection!

Service:
Overall the service was pretty much perfect; there was a slight issue whereby upon asking for another pot of tea, the waiter said he’d pour it, I said don’t worry, he said it’s his job...then proceeded to pour some of it across the table and onto my plates.  He apologised and said he was new and he’ll get someone else, along came Valerij and replaced my plate and cleaned up.  Some people, I would expect, would kick up a fuss, however, i am a realistic person and mistakes can happen.

Refills?
I read on line that there were free refills; I can confirm this is true and a fantastic bonus service -  this includes the food!!!

We noticed that the staff came out wishing happy birthday to a young girl; my girlfriend (whose birthday it was) said you better not have, I said i wish I had!  

We then asked for the bill; the staff again came out and were singing happy birthday; this time to my girlfriend!  They brought a cupcake with a candle and a red carnation was presented perfectly by Valerij.  She was very embarrassed as that is her as a person, but again showed exceptional customer service from the hotel as I only mentioned it in passing in an email.

Overall:
A truly fantastic afternoon tea and one i wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.  A special mention to the exceptional service afforded to us by Ieva and particularly Valerij (apologies if I have the names incorrect).

Thank you ",5,2018,04,22
105,Excellent!!,"What a beautiful charming hotel.
The staff were very welcoming and the room(was a bit small)  but super clean and tidy. 
The location was perfect for me and my meetings in central London. 
Highly recommended ",4,2018,04,21
105,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE,"Our room was a"" classic"" which apparently meant small and drab.  The bathroom is cramped with no outlet for the hairdryer or other styling tools.  Doors are constantly being banged along the hallway.  Breakfast service was excruciatingly slow, the coffee terrible.  But I must say the staff was polite and very helpful.  But why leave a tiny box of bath salts on pillows when the tub hardly invites one to linger!  (I think the hotel just had them laying around and decided to get rid of them.)",3,2018,04,20
105,Great stay.,"I was familiar with the very convenient area.  My regular hotel was not available. The TripAdvisor reviews were excellent for the Chesterfield Mayfair.  What a nice discovery!   Charming and typical hôtel, very kind and helpful staff, great experience in the dining room.  We will definitely go back.",5,2018,04,20
105,Perfectly Situated Luxury British Charmer,"If you are looking for old style refined British luxury in Mayfair and don't want to pay a crazy price this hotel is an excellent choice. The whole place exudes a sense of refined quality and class. The breakfast area provides the perfect ambience to start the day, and at days end there is a small but charming bar that perfectly fits the mood of the hotel. Rooms are super comfortable, though this being London you need to go up a couple of price levels if, like me you need a bit of space. Staff are friendly and efficient and everything is absolutely spotless. A well run and inviting hotel in the heart of Mayfair. I loved staying here. Highly recommend.",5,2018,04,20
105,Fabulous upmarket London Hotel in great location,"Our high expectations of this exclusive boutique hotel were easily met and indeed exceeded!
Great service from all personnel, rooms were cleaned superbly, and we ( and our visiting friends from Berkshire) were very impressed with the complimentary biscuits provided ( twice!) with our coffee order.
We felt like we were valued friends rather than just paying clients.
We have no reservations in recommending this fine establishment to all our Australian friends.

105,Charming,"The Chesterfield at Mayfair is a beautiful hotel with an abundance of charm and old world character. The service was excellent and the location perfect for central London. While the room was small it was perfectly formed and very clean, with good amenities. We had friends join us for coffee in the bar and were pleasantly surprised to be served plates of complimentary brownies and biscuits, this was a really nice touch. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,19
105,Fabulous Hotel,"My teenage Son and I stayed 4 nights at The Chesterfield in April. The service at the front desk, the bar and restaurant was wonderful. The room was great for us - we had 2 beds. The location is great. Would definitely go back there.",5,2018,04,18
105,Traditional luxury and superb service!,"We spent 3 nights here in April for a short break; the position of the hotel is great for walking to Green Park tube, Picadilly, Bond Street, Regent Street and several landmarks such as Hyde Park, Royal Academy and Buckingham Palace. From the moment we arrived, the service was great, we got there 3 hours before check in to leave our bags, but the room was ready. We had the Music Room, a luxurious and quirky room, with musical notes on the walls of the bathroom and a huge roll top bath with surround shower. Every item you want to find was there, dressing gowns, slippers, toiletries, tea tray, biscuits, selection of waters, stationery equipment and all replenished twice a day. The bed was so comfortable, with best quality monogrammed linen and towels. A lovely lady came each evening to turn down the bed while we were out and leave biscuits on our pillow. We only had breakfast at the hotel as we like to dine out, but there was a comprehensive cold buffet with everything you could want including fresh fruit salad, as well as a wide cooked menu, served at your table and freshly prepared in the kitchen. The dining room staff were the best we have ever had in terms of politeness, cheerfulnesss and attentiveness. The decor was traditional and luxurious in the common areas, not everyone's cup of tea if you like sleek and modern with loads of marble, but we loved it and it was very well maintained. The doorman and concierge were always in attendance to open doors and call a taxi or just give directions. All in all we were extremely pleased with our choice and would definitely recommend it to others.",5,2018,04,17
105,"Excellent location, and excellent hotel.","This hotel is in a great location, just off Berkely Square in Mayfair (just north of Picadilly and Green Park station), and is, as usual with Red Carnation hotels in my experience, extremely well appointed, and well run, with charming and efficient staff.  Considering the price for a single room, in the mid-$200s, this was a bargain.  My room was a little on the small side, but was beautifully furnished, and the bathroom was lovely.  Breakfast was extensive, and service very friendly, if slightly haphazard.  All in all a very pleasant overnight stay.",5,2018,04,16
105,Yet another great stay,"The Chesterfield Hotel is perfect for a London trip whether business or pleasure. The room,service,decor and location are first class.

105,"Luxurious and traditional hotel, great service","Great service at this hotel. The staff is very helpful, a bit formal but they do have a good sense of humour. Rooms are very ""English"" with textile wallpaper and all but nice and quiet. Wonderful breakfast. We had a afternoon tea on one day and it was very good. Great bar with a wide selection of gin & tonics.",4,2018,04,15
105,"The Best , Most Luxurious Hotel in London.","The Chesterfield Hotel is by far the most luxurious hotel in London we have stayed in. The staff made us feel extremely welcome and their outstanding friendly service really made us feel at home from the moment we arrived. We stayed for 3 nights to celebrate our anniversary and could not have felt more spoilt from flowers and chocolates placed in our room to early evening canapés and an anniversary card signed by all the staff personally together with an anniversary cake.
Breakfasts were excellent and we had an exceptional afternoon tea , the best we have ever had.
Thank you to all the staff for such a wonderful stay with such friendly ,welcoming service.",5,2018,04,15

105,A (5 star) Home Away From Home ,"My wife, newborn baby and myself were fortunate enough to spend 3 nights at this lonely hotel. The staff could not be friendlier and more accommodating. Helping us with early check in (when it was available), luggage, taxis, umbrellas etc, all at their suggestions. Traveling with a newborn was made easy with a beautiful cot and organic baby hamper in the room. On our last night our baby even received a little Paddington Bear from management! 

Aside from all this, extremely comfortable rooms (best bed ever!), great location and excellent breakfast. A winner for a stay in one of the world's greatest cities! ",5,2018,04,14
105,Excellent hotel,"Great friendly staff, comfortable, clean, super location; what more needs to be said!!! Cozy and comfy with a super bar! The front desk is great at making reservations and/or checking flights, etc. The doormen are super at helping with baggage and cabs. An all around excellent hotel, but with a very slow chef and kitchen staff - the only drawback to an otherwise good restaurant.",5,2018,04,14
105,"Chesterfield Hotel, Mayfair",I stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel on Friday 6th April 2018. Another exquisite experience in the best hotel in London. I was extremely pleased with the service I received. In particular from Adrianna who helped me to my table and was on hand throughout my dining experience but also to Roberta who checked me out on my departure and was very warm and approachable. The experience was without a doubt the high standard of hospitality I have to come to expect of the Chesterfield hotel. I will definitely be staying there again.,5,2018,04,10
105,Weekend break,We decided to treat ourselves to a nice stay in London for a friends birthday. The reviews were very promising and you couldn’t find anything wrong with the staff for politeness and helpfulness. The room was fine as we only had the basic. At breakfast there was a good selection of food on offer from the buffet and the eggs benedict was particularly good but the full English was a little disappointing. That being said I think I would stay here again. Very pleasant. ,4,2018,04,10
105,Nice Hotel,"Pros:
Good location 
Diligent and helpful multinational staff.
Good WiFi, quiet room.
Rooms clean and well appointed.
Cons:
Rooms and bathrooms are small
Windows do not open.
Not that close to the Green park tube station",4,2018,04,09
105,High Class discreet dining,A discreet location in the heart of Mayfair near to Berkeley Square. Dining Room felt quiet and intimate even though every table occupied. Excellent attentive and flexible service from a menu with a good range of choice. Good quality champagne and an interesting wine selection from which we chose a fine Lebanese red.,4,2018,04,09
105,Best London Hotel,Been to London many times over the years but this hotel is by far the best. For a truly authentic London experience a stay at The Chesterfield is a must. The staff are incredibly friendly especially Sarah Walsh the Assistant General Manager who was incredibly courteous and accommodating. We will definitely be back!,5,2018,04,09
105,Excellent Luncheon,"Lunch here most weeks, excellent friendly service provided by Spartaco and his team, I have very specific and challenging dietary requirements and Spartaco ensures these are catered for admirably!!  Can't praise highly enough.",5,2018,04,09
105,Good value in Mayfair with  Childcare link,For a family gathering we booked four rooms and had no complaints about any of them. Resrvations staff were helpful in getting the right rooms for us and the reception team was very wecoming Indeed each room was well equipped with everything you could need and the beds were really comfortable.Importantly for us it has a link with a child-minding service and so we were able to arrange trustworthy care for children whilst aduklts went fout or dinner  Breakfast was a full table service with some buffet items. Excellent value at the time of year we went and would be our first choice in future for family occasions,5,2018,04,08
105,Macallan Whiskey & Chocolate Experience,"Had a great afternoon yesterday with David from the Chesterfield who guided us through 4 superb Macallan Whiskey measurings with some gorgeous chocolates to alongside them. Amazing experience and simply incredible tastings.

Thanks David",5,2018,04,08
105,"Excellent service and food, but in need of some refurbishment","We stayed for two nights in a King room for leisure purposes. This was our fifth stay at this hotel. 

Door and front desk staff
We arrived very early (at approximately 10.30 am) and we understand that because of this the usual opening of our taxi door, taking cases out of the taxi and escorting to the front desk was not in place. The check-in and -out process was efficient and the front desk contacted us on our mobile at around 12.30 pm to inform us that our room was ready. Our cases were also stored on our day of departure and staff were always available to move luggage into rooms, etc. This is good service.

Room and bathroom
We were initially allocated ‘The study’, but requested another room because we found the décor to be rather dark, dated and dreary. The relevant section manager dealt with our request immediately and we were allocated a choice of two much brighter rooms. The porter helped with the luggage and the room switch carried out efficiently and without fuss. 

Our new room (308) was a recently refurbished room, but we did have some reservations whether the standard of décor was befitting of The Chesterfield that we have got to know over the years and the freshening up of the bathroom was uninspired and in need of starting from scratch. 

Gin and tonic experience
This was carried out professionally and effectively – three great pairings and lots of information provided. 

Dinner in Butler’s Restaurant
We had an excellent three course meal from the set menu on one evening. The service throughout the meal was touching on the best we have experienced in any restaurant. The £50 dining credit (received when booking through the hotels website) and the option of three courses for £34 makes the bottom line a much sweeter pill to swallow.

Breakfast
This is usually one of the highlights of our stay, and once again it did not disappoint. The quality of the food (hot dishes freshly prepared to order and the cold buffet) is notably good and the service, led by the manager was friendly and efficient. A suitably relaxing start to the day. 

We stay here for two reasons. 
Firstly, the great location – within walking distance of the main shopping areas, the West End, Green Park and Hyde Park Corner etc. The streets of Mayfair (including Shepherd’s Market) are also quiet and safe for leisurely walks and some rather glamorous and ostentatious window shopping. 
Secondly, this is a service orientated hotel. 

We have no qualms in recommending this hotel, especially for the more mature guests who prefer ‘old school’ and discerning guests in search of personal service and attention. However, we do have some reservations, namely the wear and tear which is beginning to show on some of the fittings and furniture and the rather dated décor – especially when the exorbitant cost of rooms at certain times of year are borne in mind. The suites here are sumptuous and spacious, decorated to a high quality, but guests need to beware that their expectations might not be fulfilled if allocated the more basic entry-level classic rooms.",4,2018,04,08
105,Wonderful afternoon tea on Easter Sunday,"We had afternoon tea to celebrate my son's 8th birthday party. The hotel itself was grand and impressive. The staff were outstanding, especially Laura, Etiene and Fiachra. Attentive but not overly so, helpful, friendly and warm. They made it very special for my son. The price was very reasonable. The food was great. Overall a lovely afternoon spent and we'd go back.",5,2018,04,05
105,A touch of real class.,"My trip was a one night stay travelling from & back to Scotland with an evening event nearby the hotel.  The greeting at the door and reception set the standard, which was high, and the rest of my stay was very comfortable indeed.  Travelling solo for business can be a pain but this hotel makes you feel a bit special and appreciated.  It ain't cheap but it was well worth every penny.  i awoke refreshed, had an excellent breakfast and tackled the train ride home in good humour.  I'll be back.",5,2018,04,04
105,Great Location Hotel +  British Style Decoration,"I stayed 2 nights with Wife and Kids. Very well located, clean and with spacy rooms. Staff was friendly and overall nothing to complain, was a good stay. The only think that I didnt like was the decoration, Bristish Style, that is something that I personally dont like, but it is what it is.",4,2018,04,03
105,Wonderful play to stay while visiting London,"Nelya Moreau-Blanc and her aunt Nataliya,
Period of stay 3-19-2018 to 3-27-2018

We stayed at the Chesterfield for our trip. The location of the hotel is in the heart of city. The hotel is clean and provides u great hospitality. Our room was lovely! We were sad to leave this amazing hotel. Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed in.  Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff. The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible and the restaurant manager Loris and restaurant hostess Andriana deserves a special thanks from us. The service was at the top of the level. The food was delicious. They made our great mornings, evenings here, which obviously also added up to the experience.

The atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to me. All respect for the hotel staff who does a great job here; a true sample of excellent hospitality! .I'll recommend this hotel to everyone they won’t regret. 

Thank you 
Regards, 
Nelya Moreau-Blanc and her aunt Nataliya",5,2018,04,02
105,"Old world excellent service, attention to detail and superb dining","I spent recently a total of 10 days at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff is attentive and very helpful without being overbearing. The two rooms I had in succession (I left for a different trip inbetween) were pleasant, well lighted and fairly large.
Butler's restaurant is a gem: the Maître d', Mr. Loris Lucini, runs a tight operation and his staff is perfectly reponsive. I ate most of my meals there and the menu with daily specials from the carving table, along with the à la carte choices which changed often, made for a varied and satisfying selection. Enthusiastically recommended.       ",5,2018,04,02
105,"great location, extra clean, lots of personality","The location is so convenient. The service is just great. And so charming ! this place has kept its authentic charm, so when on a touristic trip is just great ! 
The only thing I would change would be the water faucets : it takes a while to find the proper adjustment for a temperature that is neither burning nor chilling (and then you don't turn it off - this increases the water consumption !).
The breakfast is also very good !! the restaurant is a bit expensive so we did not get a chance to spend our 50£ credit....",5,2018,04,02
105,Lovely 3 Night Stay,"My husband and I stayed in the Chesterfield for 3 nights. The location is great-walkable to St James Park and Buckingham Palace, but also close to the tube. We were upgraded to a King room, which was plenty of room for two people. We had breakfast in their restaurant every morning, which was plenty to eat and efficient before a day of sightseeing. Everything about the hotel was exceptional-the doorman always offered to order a cab as we left, the front desk was very helpful, and the maid service did a great job. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through London.",5,2018,04,02
105,Wonderful hotel for travelling couple,"This hotel was just spot on. I had written in our original booking (5 months earlier) that it was our anniversary and the staff hand wrote a happy anniversary card and left a cupcake in our room on the first night! The rooms are extremely comfortable and updated, the staff is the best and most thoughtful I've ever experienced. 

Afternoon tea is a must, especially if it's around Christmas. The Christmas tea was one of my husbands favorite things we did while in London. 

If ever back in London, we will undoubtedly be back at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2018,03,29
105,Afternoon tea for a birthday party -- all the people I love PLUS my dog!!!!,"I haven't been so pleasantly surprised in my life. The restaurant is great -- all the napiery and drapiery you could wish for, for a special occasion. The menu -- good and varied, reasonably priced -- for the centre of London. However, every time we (my husband and me, we live alone) go out, the reproachful look on our dog's face tugs at my heart. So having an option of celebrating my birthday with my husband, friends and the dog made it very special indeed. However, the complete knock-out was the fact that I could bring my dog along. I was grateful as it was but WAIT, it gets better!!!! -- not only was it possible in the theoretically dog-friendly London (which, in practice, is anything but consistent on that score) but they had a dog menue, paw prints and all. Could you believe it? 'Bowl-licking catch of the day' got me in stitches -- along with half of the restaurant's clientelle, busily instagramming the whole development. Plus the water bowl, plus the doggy bed, plus the special treat -- I couldn't believe my eyes. And the price for that was well within the reasonable parameters for something so caring and innovative. The team -- Laura, Panos and Alex -- were exceptional: attentive, highly ptofessional and with a good sense of humour. I will recommend anyone to book your special day there -- you'll not be sorry!!!!",5,2018,03,29
105,Superb,"We stayed at theCchesterfield for 3 nights with friends in early March and had such a wonderful experience. We booked directly with the hotel as they offered to match rates and included a 50 pounds credit that we could use for food during the stay. We were out for lunch or at shows most days, but always enjoyed our evenings in the bar and our breakfasts in the restaurant which were delicious. A great selection of continental buffet items and fresh juices and then hot breakfasts which you order to your table. We had a lot of fun trying to work out who our waiter was going to be each morning as they have identical twins working in the restaurant, Alex and Panos I think they were called. They were very polite and friendly, as were all the staff. We didn’t spend much time in our rooms, however the double rooms we had were recently refurbished apparently and had plenty of room for two people and had a well appointed bathroom with great toiletries. We wouldn’t hesitate to return.",5,2018,03,28
105,"Best in London, Mayfair!","My experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair was exceptional. Great value overall from service, room, food and amenities. This boutique hotel makes you feel like family from the moment you step inside. The service is uber-prompt and always includes a smile! A special shout-out to Beth at front desk, Lordes from in-room dining, and Sabrina in the bar - you are all ROCK STARS and clearly love what you do. Look no further, book this property and let any cares fade away. Home away from home! ",5,2018,03,28
105,Location and amazing staff,"In our first trip to London, we stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for three nights from 14th-17th March and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The hotel is in a great location, not far from Green Park with easy access to the rest of London via Green Park tube. Easy to walk to almost everything, the staff is all absolutely fantastic, very attentive to all needs and very friendly. At the Restaurant the food was delicious and they offer a breakfast that was a real treat with a great selection of hot and cold food. Also the bar has a lovely relaxed atmosphere I will recommend the hotel to everybody; definitely we will come back to the hotel whenever we decide to come back to London.",5,2018,03,27
105,Fantastic afternoon tea at the chesterfield,"We had a fantastic afternoon tea at the chesterfield. I had a table of 5 people for me, my children, my friend and her daughter and had such a lovely afternoon being waited on by the friendliest staff. They were so welcoming and relaxed which put my children at ease immediately and were so accommodating when catering for the children’s different tastes. Their afternoon tea is themed on Willy wonka so they do a variation of traditional drinks and pastries to try and emulate the idea of the chocolate factory. They are truly delicious and the theme works perfectly for the children. I would like to express my thanks to Laura, Loris and his team for looking after us all so well. We will definitely be back.",5,2018,03,27
105,Wedding,"We had our wedding at the Chesterfield on Sunday 25 March.  We cannot rate the hotel and staff highly enough.  Kornelia was oustanding with helping us plan the day and nothing we asked for was ever a problem.  Spartaco was also amazing on the day, providing an excellent service to us and our guests.  We had the most amazing day.  ",5,2018,03,26
105,Location and great people,"Very good hotel with reasonable prices 
Close to main London attractions 
Very professional and friendly reception staff 
Good restaurant on main floor for dinner and breakfast 
Also have a bar with nice atmosphere

105,A wonderful stay!,"We spent another wonderful week at the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was our fourth stay in the hotel and as usual it was perfect! The staff is very nice especially Ms Letitia     ZChihambakwe who is always nice and helpful. Delicious breakfast and meals in Butlers Restaurant. I hope we will be back soon. It is our most favourite hotel in London.

105,Brilliant stay,"Brilliant stay
 
I stayed at the Chesterfield for the first time back in February and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi at the front door, to the moment I left, the staff couldn’t do enough for me. They were jumping over themselves to open doors for me and always offering me assistance, not in an overbearing way though, just being friendly and attentive. We were only there for the weekend, but we felt right at home, just with a massive breakfast buffet and the biggest, most comfortable bed ever. I can’t wait to return whenever we are back in London.",5,2018,03,23
105,Fantastic stay at this wonderful Hotel.,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for two nights from 20th-22nd March and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. On arrival at check-in I happened to mention that we were in London celebrating our 37th wedding Anniversary, almost immediately out of the blue we were informed by John who was completing the paperwork that we were going to be upgraded to a junior suite a lovely and most appreciated surprise. As the room was free and ready we were able to check in and go to the room straight away. We were given the Safari Suite which has an African theme and we really loved it, the space and cleanliness of the room and bathroom was first class and we both said what a fantastic start to our break this was. We dined in the Butler Restaurant in the hotel on our first night and we had a beautiful meal , the staff were excellent and again word had spread that it was our Anniversary and we were treated to a glass of Champagne before our meal another lovely touch. Breakfast was another treat with more than enough food on offer the buffet and then the hot meal was superb.
I must mention John at reception who went above and beyond to help us and nothing was a bother or too much trouble. All of the staff , conscierge and waiting staff all deserve a mention . I think you will get the idea from my review that we were delighted with our stay and can not recommend thisHotel to anyone contemplating a London stay, the location is perfect as well with everything close by and accessible .",5,2018,03,23
105,David Wasmuth,"Stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for 2 nights earlier in March and I have to say what an absolute Gem of a hotel! 
    The staff are all absolutely fantastic, very attentive to all needs and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and always greeted with a smile.                                                                                  
    Our room was fantastic also! Very clean and well decorated, the bed and pillows were so comfortable! Very important to us.
    We dined in the restaurant one evening and the food was superb, could not be faulted and good value for money.
    The hotel is very close to the Piccadilly Road so close to great shopping and Piccadilly Circus. We saw a show on Shaftesbury Avenue which is only a 15 minute walk from the hotel. 
     Having stayed in a few hotels in London now I have to say The Chesterfield is by far the best we have stayed in!
     Will definitely be going back and would strongly recommend.",5,2018,03,21
105,A very British hotel,Such a lovely hotel. Rooms are quite small but the service is excellent and workers are very friendly. I've stayed the hotel many times as I like the hotel very much. The hotel is near Green Park station and you can walk to Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus. I highly recommend you to stay the hotel.,5,2018,03,21
105,Impeccable,"I have nothing bad to say about my stay there (which, in itself, is an accomplishment on their part). The hotel is really nice and inviting, the location is fantastic and the service was flawless. 
I find it really important a hotel is clean, and everything was spotless (there were carpets everywhere, so it would have clearly shown otherwise). We had breakfast included, and everything served was high-quality and well prepared, both the buffet and the menu. All the personnel was always polite, attentive and helpful without being pushy or overbearing, which is always a plus. 
We didn't have anything to complain about during all of our stay there (and traveling with my parents that's saying A LOT).",5,2018,03,21
105,Wonderful place to stay in central London,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield with our then three month old little baby. The staff were incredibly doting and made every effort to make our stay incredibly comfortable. 
There was a lovely crib in the room, complimentary nappies and baby toiletries. 
Absolutely a home away from home :)",5,2018,03,20
105,Home from home,"If anyone is looking for a place to call home when staying in London then I highly recommend The Chesterfield. Part of Red Carnation Group, a privately owned hotel group, the service is first class. The staff get to know you very easily and the nothing is too much trouble attitude leaves you feeling incredibly well looked after. Rooms are very comfortable and the whole feel is that of a high quality town house.
I have visited this hotel in excess of 60 separate occasions and I wouldn't do that unless I felt at home and looked after. I must single out for some special praise James who runs the lounge bar. He has an excellent manner about him and looks after me and my guests perfectly on every occasion be it business or family and friends that I am with.
Tony, Darren and the team on concierge and Letitia and her colleagues on reception always go the extra mile. They have a great etiquette and chemistry between them. 
Best

105,Our weekend,"My husband and I had a great stay - Thursday to Sunday.  Once again we enjoyed every moment of our time there. I would like to highlight the touching gestures of Letitia Chihambakwe, who sent me and all the women staying at the time a beautiful and meaningful poem and a rose on international women's day. She also treated my husband and I to a very nice bottle of wine. She has a special way of touching guests.",5,2018,03,12
105,60th Birthday treat for Brother......,"Overall our stay was good however ....... when I booked my brother's accommodation in the autumn of 2017 I told the hotel it was a surprise for my Brother's 60th birthday.  The hotel said how nice it was for me to do this for him and that they would do something special for him.  Whilst the room allocated was lovely (the Music Room) I was told that they could not do an 'up-grade' as the hotel was busy.  I did not comment, but felt that as the booking had been made several months earlier the up-grade could have been done, especially as the booking receptionist said ""they would do something special"" for him. The only other negative in a generally comfortable hotel with good staff is that on the two mornings of our stay, the hot breakfasts were brought out before we had finished eating our cereals/starters.  My husband and I stayed two nights and had two breakfasts.  My brother only stayed one night so only one breakfast.  For this to happen both mornings was not good.  Omlettes should be cooked and served straight away.  Ours had to be returned to the kitchen to be kept 'warm' until we were ready.  The young male water appeared again several minutes later - we still had not finished!.  We felt hurried.  It was only 9.20 am on Sunday 25th February - neither was it busy in the restaurant or at the end of the breakfast period. This has never happened in any other hotel we have stayed in and as the dining room was not over-busy at the time it really was unacceptable.  We let it go as we had a guest and did not want any embarrassment, but on check-out we discussed this with the male receptionist who said he would convey our comments to the Restaurant Manager.  He deducted the price of 4 drinks we had in the bar, but that really isn't the point.   Hopefully the Receptionist conveyed our comments.",4,2018,03,12
105,Always excellent,"This is the third time we’ve stayed here, and the 6th  in a ‘Red Carnation’ hotel. There is noting to fault ; rooms, service, decor and location are superb . It’s a shame the people in the room above were noisy, but the hotel is so good, we managed to put up with it!
We have found all the hotels in this chain to be excellent,and reasonable value for the locations. ",5,2018,03,12
105,My absolute favourite hotel in London,"If you like big, impersonal, modern or even minimalist, hotels the gloriously superior Chesterfield Mayfair won't be to your liking.
However, if like me, you appreciate individual character, scrumptious coziness that wraps it's self around you like a luxurious, friendly embrace, The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel is the place for you. 
I could say the staff are the best thing about this hotel or the rooms or the bar or restaurant but the truth is Everything about this hotel is FABULOUS.
I love it - in case you couldn't tell ~ Jane & James Doyle",5,2018,03,12
105,"lovely hotel, close to the city center and everythng london has to offer","nice hotel in the center of london which is nice to walk to almost everyhting, very polite staff and welcoming, i will recomend the hotel to everybody because is nice and within walking distance to many of the prime location in London. surely i will come back to the hotel whenever i decide to come back to london",4,2018,03,12
105,Best Afternoon Tea we have ever had!,"Every Mother’s day myself and my sister treat our Mum to Afternoon Tea in London.  We have been doing this for several years and it has now become a tradition in our family.  We always do lots of research about the best venues and highest reviewed Teas and this year we settled on the Willie Wonka Afternoon Tea at The Chesterfield Mayfair.

The whole experience far outweighs that of any Afternoon Tea we have ever had.  Not only was the food delicious but the staff were incredible.  They were engaging, pleasant, knowledgeable, kind, funny and hospitable.  Nothing was too much and everything they did came with a smile.

I called to confirm the table a couple of months in advance and requested seating in the conservatory.  Whilst they cannot guarantee a table in any preferred location, they made a note and said they would do their best.   With a week to go I needed to rearrange and move the table from 13:30pm to 15:00pm even though it was a busy mother’s day.  They juggled things around, moved my reservation to 15:00pm and still managed to seat us in the conservatory.  

On arrival we were very well cared for from the offset.  The staff continued to wish my mum a happy Mother’s Day and even brought round a cupcake and macaroon donning the words in chocolate.  It was these little touches that made the whole experience well worth the money!  At first were given amazing popping candy drinks prior to our sandwiches and cakes.  Next, the head waiter went around all the tables giving out gobstoppers and later, with a top hat full of golden tickets, which cannot be opened unless bought back to The Chesterfied for another Afternoon tea later in the year.

The staff told us right from the word go that the food was unlimited and should we want any more of anything, all we need do is ask.  Whilst I have been told this at other (more expensive) venues, they can be very standoffish about it and stingy with replacement items.  Not at the Chesterfield!  Whole plates of sandwiches and cakes were delivered to us with smiles.  At one point my sister asked for another amazing chocolate scone, a small fruit tart,  a macaroon and a white chocolate dome and they delivered 7 scones, 3 macaroons, 3 tarts and 3 white chocolate domes.  The staff were just wonderful!

The whole thing, the live pianist, the ambience, the warmth of the staff and the tastiness of the food made this experience perfect.",5,2018,03,12
105,Loved my London trip!!!!!!,"We stayed at the chesterfield for a few nights and had an incredible time. All the staff were extremely courteous, our room was not ready at 14.00 but we were offered a  complimentary drink while we waited and it was ready 15 minutes later. 

The front desk team are extremely friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The room was beautiful and had everything we needed: tea and coffee making facilities, bathrobes, slippers, complimentary water. All the rooms are individually designed I believe, ours was blue in colour. Breakfast was good, we had it in the room so cannot comment on the restaurant. It’s a typically British Hotel we loved it thank you 

Special mention to Roberta and Sanae on the front desk. Thank you all for a lovely stay",5,2018,03,11
105,Birthday trip,"The hotel is in a great location, not far from Green Park with easy access to the rest of London via Green Park tube.

My niece got a teddy bear and a lollipop. Very pleasant atmosphere to the sound of the pianist playing nice music. The food was delicious with sandwiches, cakes... That are served at will. 
Excellent restaurant. I really recommend it.",5,2018,03,10
105,The perfect setting in the heart of London,"We had the most wonderful weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfield. When we checked we were delighted with our spacious room which had the most beautiful interior.

We then visited the bar where the staff could not do enough for us. The food was delicious and we try so really unusual cocktails , which we loved. The bar has a lovely relaxed atmosphere which would tempted you stay for the whole day.  They also offered a gin tasting experience that sounded excellent , we will definitely be back to try that.

Breakfast was a real treat with a great selection of hot and cold food. They also had a selection of healthy options if you were trying to be good . (We weren’t so we tried everything ) 

The location was so handy , we were able to walk to see all the sites and could also walk to the train station to get us back to the airport. 

We had a wonderful stay and couldn’t recommend the hotel enough.",5,2018,03,10
105,Great stay,"Every member of staff go out of their way to make your stay as pleasurable as possible. The hotel is situated in the heart of Mayfair, very handy for the posh shops, Buckingham Palace etc. If you get the chance try the gin or whisky experience, the amazing afternoon tea and visit the beautiful piano bar. Big shout to James for making us feel at home.",5,2018,03,09
105,Londond best hotel,"Quite simply the best hotel in London. A beautiful building in a very smart neighbourhood, but what makes it most special is the staff. Everyone I came into contact with was friendly and helpful, but special mention must go to Chloe from reception, Etienne and Valerij from the restaurant, Antoino from room service, Riza the night maid and especially James in the bar.",5,2018,03,09
105,The Best Hospitality Experience,"From the moment you walk into The Chesterfield Mayfair you can feel the welcoming atmosphere. From the front desk to the restaurant everybody is always smiling and happy to help.

I checked in at the reception with lovely Beth, who kindly explained me the several features of the Hotel. Paolo kindly helped me with my bags and also showed me to my room.

My room was absolutely perfect in every aspect! It was warm, well decorated and there were a lot of tiny special touches that made me feel welcome like chocolates on the pillow, a welcome card, some drinks. It made me feel very appreciated.

I had the pleasure to have dinner and breakfast at the Butlers restaurant where I encountered the most wonderful staff! The hostess always Andriana greeted me at the door with a big smile. Eryk and Valera were the most well trained waiters I have ever came across, and I would like to thank them for being so attentive. But the best example of an attentive service is indubitably Loris. Always checking on me and the service provided. An excellence of employee!
And off course the food was an absolute delicacy. All superb, delicious flavours from dinner to breakfast. Congratulations Chef!

During my stay I also had the chance to visit the Terrace bar. Vlad and James were great bartenders. I had very good cocktails all recommended by James, who amazed me with his vast knowledge. He knew everything about each bottle in the bar, how fantastic! The cocktails were perfectly balanced and always served with a smile. I will surely be back to do a Gin Experience or to enjoy the Gin and Jazz on Wednesday.

There’s no doubt that the standards at The Chesterfield are high and consistent. I was overwhelmed with the cosy feeling of home away from home. I couldn’t ask for anything else, many thanks to all for one the best hospitality experiences I ever had!",5,2018,03,08
105,Gin Experience at Chesterfield Mayfair,"A first for me, and I was impressed. A great way to learn and appreciate the flavours of the modern gin.

Our experience began with at the front door, welcomed by Viktor to the Hotel, we passed through to the dining area where the staff spared no effort in ensuring our afternoon tea was going to be a most pleasant one. Our party included 5 younger children who all seemed to enjoy the milkshakes, the rest of us enjoyed the variety of sandwiches & cream cakes but most of all the most tasty scones with cream & jam that we have enjoyed in a long time. We travelled up from Sussex for our Afternoon Tea experience and can say we were not disappointed. Our thanks go to the staff who ensured we had a most memorable afternoon at the Chesterfield.  On booking we received our Golden Envelopes but you will have to book to find out more..",5,2018,03,05

105,"Superb, great value hotel in a perfect location","Although small (which is typical for London), the rooms are beautifully appointed and lack for no comfort or facility.  The staff could not be more helpful or obliging and the food and beverages are of a high quality.",5,2018,03,03
105,Romantic evening ,"Visited just for one night as a birthday treat for my other half. Had afternoon tea, overnight stay in The Music Room, cocktails in the Terrace Bar and a cracking English breakfast. It’s not cheap (it’s Mayfair in London!!) but the cocktails are still celebrating and we felt welcomed by all the staff. Special thanks to the concierges Darren and Tony. ",5,2018,03,03
105,An Oasis in Mayfair,"Excellent staff. Impeccable rooms. Most comfortable mattress (it would have made a good souvenir).A great central location, minutes walk from Green Park Station.   Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and Oxford St are all within an easy distance. I would highly recommend to anyone staying in London overnight or longer. ",5,2018,03,03
105,Another perfect stay,Stayed with a girlfriend for the night and the location was perfect for us. The bar had a lovely selection of well calculated cocktails which were well crafted. The room was beautiful with fabric walls and it was like going back in time. The breakfast selection was impressive and the staff couldn’t do enough for us - made us feel so welcome and at home - would definitely stay again. 5 stars to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.,5,2018,03,02
105,Gin Tasting ,Had yet another great evening at The Chesterfield last night. We booked a Gin tasting for our friend's 30th! James did an amazing job at explaining each gin's history and botanicals and answering all of our eager questions. You can tell he really knows his gin. All of the G&Ts were delicious and the food we ordered was incredible! Such a great experience. The staff are always friendly and treat you like gold. Will be making many trips back to the Chesterfield Mayfair! Can definitely recommend! ,5,2018,03,02
105,Treat yourself in the bar,"If you are looking for a nice and comfortable place to stay - especially now in the cold winter days - you are absolutely right at the Chesterfield Hotel. 
I already went a few times to hide with a good book in the bar area - in the most cosy armchairs I have ever sat in (a shame I can't take them with me) - and I would always return to enjoy a drink (or two) and have a snack from the bar menu.
The staff are all very welcoming and knowledgeable and answer all the questions you have. Especially James and Sabrina always make my stay and are also happy to have a little chat. The Chesterfield Martini is just delicious and as the Terrace Bar menu describes it to sit back and relax you can exactly do that:)",5,2018,03,01
105,Best hotel in London!,Loved our stay at The Chesterfield! What really makes it the best hotel in London is the staff! Everyone is so friendly and helpful! Special thanks to Letitia and Darren! Will definitely be back soon!,5,2018,03,01
105,Lovely Hotel,"Pleasant stay at the The Chesterfield Mayfair. Close to the best restaurants, all the sites and museums. The food in the restaurant was great taste too! Will highly recommend to friends and family and return to this hotel in a heartbeat! One stuff member (I can't remember her name, she had curly hair) went above and beyond in making sure our stay with my children was very smooth. Traveled from Vancouver, Canada.",5,2018,03,01
105,Lovely place to stay,"We were lucky and spent 2 nights at the chesterfield hotel, all the staff were friendly and welcoming a special thanks to Edga, Sabrina and James. During our stay we tried the Gin experience with James who really does know his Gin he was very knowledgeable and made the hole experience an enjoyable and informative would love to stay again.",5,2018,03,01
105,A lovely hotel in a superb location.,My wife and I have just enjoyed a brilliant three day trip to London staying at The Chesterfield hotel in Mayfair. The hotel itself is in a superb location within walking distance of a huge variety of London's  most famous visitor attractions and shopping areas. The food at the hotel is first class and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had an unforgettable visit and would certainly stay at The Chesterfield again in the future.,5,2018,03,01
105,Great Staff,"Best part of my stay (2nd time) is the bar staff. Realize that sounds strange but after a LONG day, it is great to sit down, have a drink, and enjoy a wonderful staff. Sabrina (aka Mussolini - in a funny way) has been there my last two stays. This last one added Vlad (the impaler). Made the stay absolutely incredible. I regretted the evenings I couldn’t finish with a night cap with this crew. GREAT team!",5,2018,02,28
105,Gin tasting,We went to The Chesterfield a couple weeks ago for a gin tasting with my aunt and uncle in law.  We had a fantastic time and learnt a lot.  James looked after us and answered all our questions.  He was very very knowledgeable.  We did not feel rushed and enjoyed all three gins which were presented to us on a really nice tray with all the botanicals laid out.  It was £30 per person which i think was a bargain for the knowledge and a good selection of different gins and different tonics.  Would recommend.,5,2018,02,28
105,so british !,My wife and I went at the Chesterfield Mayfair for our wedding anniversary and it was so nice. the decoration is so british and the staff is very welcoming. We enjoyed every minute. Its location is near the center. Our stay was perfect. We will definitively come back !,5,2018,02,28
105,Unforgettable treat,"I was lucky to be allocated one of the beautiful suites for a special occasion and my stay was wonderful from start to finish. The hotel is bursting with antiques and opulent  furnishings and although perhaps OTT for some, I enjoyed being immersed in the experience of a period boutique hotel which makes a refreshing change from some of the more minimalist corporate establishments. The suite was perfect, I appreciated the personal touches and the luxury toiletries made bath time feel like a spa day! Despite the air of grandeur which the hotel exudes, the staff were very engaging and attentive and their lack of pomposity made my time at the Chesterfield even more enjoyable . Loris in the restaurant and James in the bar were fun and friendly whilst also demonstrating impressive  knowledge and professionalism and they are clearly proud to be providing great customer service. My fabulous room service breakfast was delivered so cheerfully that it set me up for the whole day.  Thank you to everyone involved, I will remember my Chesterfield experience for a very long time!",5,2018,02,28
105,Fabulous Hotel,"My husband and I were recently lucky enough to stay again at The Chesterfield Mayfair as we were celebrating his birthday. The hotel itself is in a great location being walking distance from Oxford St, Bond St and Jermyn St/Piccadilly. All the staff at this hotel are extremely friendly with big smiles and happy to help with anything.  In particular I would like to mention John for our friendly and efficient check-in, Antonio for his delivery of canapés and champagne for my husband’s birthday and Letitia for always being so happy to help with everything and for her knowledge of the local area. Thank you to everyone for making our weekend so special. Cathy Brown",5,2018,02,27
105,Wonderful Place to stay and eat,"I absolutely grateful to my friend that recommended Chestesfield Mayfair to us, me and my friends went to Afternoon tea!
Amazing... since the receptionist Adriana showed us our table in the conservatory area we just had a amazing time, the waitress Roula with look after us was very professional and every single request we did was received with a smile!
Our other waiter Valero as  well always smiling and checking on us !
The food is out of this world congrats to the Head chef!!
After all we experience we stayed for 3 hours chatting and eating was hard to say good bye!!
 
Well done for the all team ,
Many thanks ",5,2018,02,27
105,Perfect! :),"A great experience! The hotel is very welcoming and the staff very approachable, etienne, roula ... all very friendly and efficient. I am very happy with my stay, I have been very comfortable and they made my stay in London a perfect experience.
THANK YOU :)",5,2018,02,27
105,Great gin experience ,"The bar at the Chesterfield has a gin experience package. It was very reasonably priced and well organised. Introduced us to some new gins and tonic waters. The Martin miller gin with strawberries and Mediterranean tonic was really good - a dash of ground pepper complimented the strawberries nicely. Edgar is the manager and James, Julian and Sabrina were on the bar. Quite a unique experience and a great way to start an evening out in London.",5,2018,02,27
105,Good but not excellent central London hotel,"My wife and I stayed over for a central London wedding and this was in many ways perfect for what we needed. Clean and comfortable, with pleasant and polite staff. I have to say though the room we had (105) was pretty small. The bathroom door can barely open fully due to space. And he humming of generators (our room was at the back) woke us up in the morning. And the TV remote had someke buttons that only worked intermittently. I got the feeling that some of the rooms need a bit of investment. The shower was quite old and dripped. There were electricity sockets with round pins! But overall I would recommend it as a good central London option.",4,2018,02,26
105,Vlad - the bartender with the french touch,I appreciated very much the great atmosphere. A special thanks to the bartender Vlad - the magician with the French touch! He surprises you really with his art to create cocktails and connect people. I will be back!,5,2018,02,26
105,AFTERNOON TEA,"Excellent restaurant, very comfortable and traditional vibe. It was a lovely experience for all of us, from start to finish. The waiters were polite, patient, quick and friendly. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. Having a pianist playing nice music, was a nice touch to the experience - the waiter even surprised my daughter with a bear and lolly pop.",5,2018,02,26
105,Family friendly afternoon tea,"I went to The Chesterfield Mayfair with two girlfriend looking for a relaxing afternoon together. And we had it better than we expected! Beautiful location, relaxing atmosphere, by the sound of the piano.

 The service was impecable! The food was plentiful, with sanduiches being brought out as we wanted. Delicious scones and cakes. All the staff had a great smile on their face and were always willing to help. My friend had her little 8 months old daughter with her and felt really welcomed and taken care of. The baby even got a teddy bear and candy.  

   We really recommend it, specially of you are looking for a more laid back way of experiencing the tradicional english tea! 
",5,2018,02,26
105,Wonderful stay in a great location. ,"We spent 4 nights at this great find in London.  John Canny at front desk greeted us with an exceptional welcome and ensured our special occasion stay was very memorable.  Thank you John. The staff are warm and helpful and the small scale of the hotel ensures a very personal feel. 
All the luxuries are here and the location of the Chesterfield in the heart of Mayfair means you can wander or short taxi to the heart of a great cultural city. ",5,2018,02,26
105,Afternoon tea/wonka themed,"I bought my daughter for the themed willy wonka tea, The doorman was exceptional and looked after our bags for us as soon as we arrived. I would highly recommend the experience, the waiting team were attentive and very polite especially the 2 guys looking after us, we tried a variety of teas as they were unlimited, my favourite was the chocolate tea 😍. The food looked amazing, the bread was hard that is my only negative, everything else was magical ",5,2018,02,26
105,Chocolate and Whiskey pairing,"I bought a chocolate and whiskey pairing as a gift for my hubby for his birthday in December and we went over the weekend. We've never been to The Chesterfield and were really pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambience of the bar area. 
When we advised we had arrived for the tasting, we were immediately greeted by James who advise we could take a seat and he set up our table for our experience. 

It was 4 different Macallan whiskeys paired with 4 different chocolates which were specifically made to pair with the whiskeys, each one different in taste, texture and age. James was really knowledgeable and engaging and really made the experience enjoyable. 

The whole experience lasted around an hour and we loved every minute. While we were sat, there were a few people who were dining at the hotel bar, the food smelt really good so we definitely want to go back again to try it! 

Overall, the Chesterfield was great, the staff were friendly and really accommodating while we were there.",5,2018,02,26
105,An amazing experience,"Where do I begin, the hotel itself is very quiet despite being close to the main road, as soon as we entered it felt like we were in a manor or castle, everyone from the doorman, concierge, waiters you name it were consistently helpful, we also booked (in advance) the butler's restaurant the same evening, and the food was superb and wonderfully presented, just as we thought things could not get any better, the head waiter (sorry we forgot his name) noticed that my wife was pregnant and presented her with a teddy, the room was equally comfortable, quiet and elegant. For breakfast we had a menu, not only the buffet, and believe me you will not go hungry there, pretty much everything you could think of. I wish we were staying longer than one night and hope to return as soon as possible, both of us would like to thank everybody for making our stay one of the most memorable weekends ever.",5,2018,02,26
105,Upscale traditional hotel in heart of Mayfair,"Excellent restaurant, very comfortable rooms, upscale traditional vibe. Location is perfect in heart of Mayfair two block from tube. Near grocery stores and all things central London. Great beds and tons of hot water presssure. Nice French press coffee in rooms. Nice padded fabric walls lend to cozy feel. Good bar with lots of gin-ology flights. Piano player some nights. Appears to have a popular high tea. Full on English breakfast can be included in room rate so watch which rate you book.

Restaurant should make it a priority to accommodate guests with or without reservations - when I asked second time brilliant waiter accommodated me and I had best Beef Wellington ever, but felt it was more luck that I got in than a sense of responsibility to hotel guests - guess I should have made a reservation.   Will come back this time with reservation.  ",5,2018,02,25
105,"Wonderful food, wonderful wine, wonderful service","I took 6 people here as a special thank you dinner in the Butlers restaurant. I was delighted when one person in the party commented that the king scallops with chicken hearts was the best starter he’d ever eaten. My scotch egg starter was easily up there!

We all struggled with the choice for main course some going for the Dover sole meunière and others for the Salmon en croute everyone was thrilled with their choice.

Ruinart rose champagne with our starters and Sancerre Rose with the main complemented our meal and was expertly served by Étienne.

Worth every penny! And highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for something very special.",5,2018,02,25
105,Relaxed welcoming Hotel,"Our first stay at this Hotel chosen largely because we have had good experiences at other Red Carnation Hotels. We stayed for 4 nights late January/early February and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Our room 'superior' room was modest in size but perfectly comfortable. The bathroom was similarly compact but everything was there.

We only ate in the Hotel on one night but had a very enjoyable meal in the restaurant which included one of the best rib eye steaks that I have had in some time.

All the staff whether domestic, front desk, restaurant or bar were welcoming and had high service standards.

We look forward to returning.",5,2018,02,23
105,Impressive service,"I can only say that service is truly impressive at your hotel. My expectations were high because of the comments on Tripadvisor but even so, every staff member met them with flying colors. For example, the person at breakfast on day 2 remembering that we were going to see a show the night before, that is not something you see every day, even in the best hotels. But in fact, what impressed me the most, is the consistency. Simply all of the staff are imbued with delivering excellent customer service. One can feel that this is something that is part of the company culture. Well done !

Another example: I had 2x 50 GBP of food credit. I had expected some haggling about that at checkout because we spent it across 2 rooms and not exactly at 50 each but, no, the 100 GBP had already been fully deducted before me even mentioning it.  

The room we had was not particularly special. Nicely appointed but a bit of a disappointing view. Excellent mattress. The white marble in the bathroom is not really my taste. I am sure if one takes a more expensive room, those concerns can be dealt with. We had the simplest room available.

Again, pick this hotel if you are after fantastic service. You won't be disappointed.",5,2018,02,20
105,Old Fashioned but in a good way,"We stayed here for a weekend treat for my husband as he had previously visited for a meeting and had been impressed by the service.
Its glory is certainly a little faded; our room was on the small size and had no view at all.  It was however clean and the bed was comfortable.
What we did love about the place was the service.  Without exception, every member of staff was friendly and effiicent.  We enjoyed our time in the bar where we sampled several of the gin and tonic combinations!  The pianist was a lovely touch too!
",5,2018,02,19
105,Unparalelled pleasure. You really feel welcome at the Chesterfield.,"We don't want to stay anywhere else in London. Why should we, when this lovely and friendly hotel is a possibility. You step into the most friendly and welcoming atmosphere you can imagine. Lovely rooms, a staff beyond what we have met anywhere else in the World (100+ traveldays per year). Stay here or dont travel. !!",5,2018,02,18
105,Private dinner party & overnight stay ,"I cannot praise this hotel and staff highly enough. Recently had a wonderful private birthday dinner party in the Library;The room is beautiful, food sublime and catered for every whim & the staff were excellent. Must especially thank Kornelia (Events manager) who was incredibly efficient & helpful & always with a smile. I booked 2 rooms to stay overnight which were both quite different but equally fabulous. This boutique hotel has the perfect central London location, luxurious rooms, fantastic food and most importantly at the heart of it all you feel genuinely welcomed by the wonderful staff. I just need another excuse to return! ",5,2018,02,18
105,Charming and Quiet,"This was the best hotel that we had the pleasure of staying in while in Europe, and we stayed in 5 total! The Mayfair district is quiet and charming and the Chesterfield Mayfair goes above and beyond to make their guests comfortable. You can't miss the English breakfast or the afternoon tea - both were highlights of our trip! 
We would gladly stay here again!",5,2018,02,17
105,Beautiful and full of gin! ,"This review is late but better now than never! I came in for a gin experience with my friend and I received such a big warm welcome as soon as I walked in!  I love gin and this felt like a mini awesome lesson on gin.  The bar at this hotel is advanced; these people know their stuff! We were served by a friendly Irish gentleman called Fiachra who was friendly but not intrusive; he gave us time to really enjoy the gin and explained as much as he can about the various gins.  He even quizzed us in the end which was an excellent way to end the tasting.  As soon as you walk into the hotel your coat is whisked off you, we were directed to the bar and nibbles were on the table straight away.  We had giant green olives which were great, I love olives! As soon as they finished the team were so attentive and replenished them straight away.  I will not give away all the details about the gins straight away in this review but it is something you have to try.  We did the premium experience which only costs about £30 for 3 different gins alongside their matching tonic waters.  My favourite was the Martin Millers with the strawberries and the black pepper!  I’ve now become a bit gin obsessed. After the experience we spoke to a friendly gentleman on the front desk from Egypt; Hani! He was such a pleasant man. I also had the pleasure of meeting guests who frequent The Chesterfield and wouldn’t go anywhere else; lovely couple based in the UK and US. I hope to stay at The Chesterfield the next time I am in London!",5,2018,02,16
105,Hidden Gem of mayfair,"I was looking for a place to stay in London that was in the heart of Mayfair and was fortunate enough to find The Chesterfield. As a busy professional, travelling from the USA I was impressed by the amenities of the room. I got a complimentary upgrade to the Garden suite that was amazing. The complimentary mobile phone with its GPS and entertainment recommendations made my short trip to London very efficient. I had everything I needed in the palm of my hands.From the moment I walked in the place exuded luxury, not in an offensive but tasteful way.The staff were all so amazing but  I would like to make a special mention of Ms. Chihambakwe who was charming, courteous and had lots of great suggestions of things to do in the area. I will be back in London later this year and will be sure to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2018,02,16
105,Weekend Away,"Thoroughly enjoyed another weekend stay at this beautiful hotel back in January. 
Perfect location, about a 5 min walk from Sexy Fish where we had a dinner reservation.
Amazing cocktails in the hotel bar and a fabulous breakfast the morning after. 
A massive thank you to Chloe on reception for surprising us with a bottle of champagne and strawberries in our room, to celebrate our recent wedding.
Looking forward to another wonderful stay this weekend to celebrate Valentines Day.
",5,2018,02,14
105,Gin experience ,"Four of us recently visited the Chesterfield Mayfair for a ""Gin Experience"" in their cocktail bar.
It comprised of tasting three superior gins and three superior tonics all matched by the Mixologist called James.
Included in the price there were  a few bar snacks and water.
James would start with the first gin
and talk as through the ins and out 
of it ,what tonic to have and which
extra botanicals to add etc.
Then he would leave us to enjoy our drink before coming back with the next gin.The gin was presented on 
display tablet with ice, samples of the botanicals and stirrer.
We all thought it was an excellent 
evening ,very good value and
James was a superb host.
My only small criticism would be that not all the glasses were “spotlessly crystal clean”
But I’m sure the will be next time we go
",5,2018,02,14
105,Average is the name of the game,"Beautiful interiors throughout the reception, corridors and restaurants, 
Reception staff and doormen were lovely and helpful. Let down by a mediocre “superior” room or not so superior room as it turned out. Followed by a poor breakfast with cold toast and artificial tasting pancakes.",3,2018,02,11
105,Like coming home,"Another wonderful stay in our favourite London hotel. As usual everything was perfect. We were celebrating my wife's birthday, all staff we encountered seemed to have been told and wished her happy birthday, she received a card signed buy some of the staff, a personalised cup cake, a red carnation and felt truly loved.
This time we had two rooms, one on the first floor, one on the fifth. Both were excellent though the 5th floor has obviously been refurbished more frequently. 
It's not easy to single out individual staff members for praise because everyone we encountered was friendly, polite and efficient, but the lovely Letitia is always wonderful, and so is James in the bar. John the pianist is a very talented player and makes the bar a very relaxing place to be. Unfortunately some ill mannered guests felt it was acceptable to have their phones on speaker whilst he was playing which was a shame. Perhaps they should put a sign up asking people not to do this.",5,2018,02,11
105,Fabulous old establishment style hotel,"We were delighted with this hotel, which exceeded our expectations. The staff and the service they provided are a credit to the beautiful and well maintained hotel. Room was lovely as were the bonuses, such as a little birthday cake and card, and the £50 food credit for booking direct. Breakfast was great too. We would definitely stay again.",5,2018,02,10
105,Unforgettable Wedding,"My husband and I had an incredible wedding on 26 Jan with the help of Austeja and all the friendly staff in Chesterfield Mayfair hotel. We really enjoyed ourselves and felt appreciated for the hotel rooms nicely decorated and food served. 

Chesterfield Mayfair hotel is a very good choice for weddings and we've already promised to each other to come back on our 5-year/ 10-year anniversary.

Thanks very much for all the staff in Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. 

Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel 是办婚礼很不错的选择。这里的员工很友好， 负责我们婚礼的Austeja 很专业，不论是在婚礼的场地选择还是其他方面都给我们很多建议。我们在这边办的是一个二十人的小型婚礼，用的一层的Library作为注册场地，二层的大会议厅作为宾客吃饭的场地。正好当天只有我们一场婚礼，Austeja 非常慷慨给我们争取到了一整个会议厅。  
我们结婚的当天是在酒店住下，第二天和朋友一次吃了brunch。特别感谢每一个酒店的工作人员，帮我布置了结婚的场地和酒店房间，还帮我们准了香槟和祝福卡片。没有你们，就没有一场如此难忘的婚礼。
再一次给大家推荐这间酒店，真的是一个很不错的结婚场地/派对场地的选择！",5,2018,02,09
105,The perfect wedding venue!,"My wife and I got married at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in January 2018. We had an intimate ceremony in the Library, followed by a reception in The Royal Suite. We also stayed the evening and had breakfast the following morning in the Butler's Restaurant. 

We were looked after by our dedicated events manager, Austeja all the way from our initial website enquiry to our big day. She was very friendly, professional and provided an extremely high standard of service. She always had time for us, nothing was too much trouble and every request we made was met with enthusiasm and a positive can-do attitude.

She thought of every little detail and undoubtedly spent countless hours behind the scenes to ensure our day would be a roaring success. 

Indeed, it was. Everything ran smoothly and according to plan. We received the royal treatment with early room access, room upgrades and some nice touches for after the wedding. This included congratulatory cards, romantic turn-down with rose petals and champagne. The pre-ceremony canapes and three-course reception meal were simply divine. The servings were generous with no compromise to quality and flavour. Every staff member from reception, concierge to our banqueting team were exemplary in providing exceptional service and making us feel like honoured guests.

We will most certainly be back when in the area and for special occasions.",5,2018,02,07
105,Beautiful Hotel.,We came here for a business conference for the day. Very welcoming and Fantastic customer service especially from Spartaco who was very professional and patient with the IT issues we were having. Thank you again to the Chesterfield Mayfair,5,2018,02,07
105,Beautiful with Inconsistencies,"Yes, this is a very charming immaculate hotel in a great location, so I won't duplicate what others have written. There are some inconsistencies in my 5 night stay that dropped this down a few notches. Turn down service: my friend and I stayed in the same room category across the hall from each other. Every night she received a 'present' on her pillow, I only received it one of the 5 nights. Strange. The Bar: Every evening we had drinks in the beautiful bar. We saw other tables receive little nibbles (we never did) and assumed they were ordered off the menu. On the last night there we received some nibbles and were told they are always complementary. Hmmm, so for the other 4 nights nothing? Again, strange small inconsistencies. Breakfast: the first 3 mornings consistently saw some tables waited on immediately, others had 20+ minute waits to be acknowledged and presented with menu. (As was my case twice) Commiserated on different occasions with other patrons who noticed the same thing. Almost became a spectator sport trying to figure out why some tables were blatantly ignored. Very odd. Seems like breakfast staff are inconsistent in their training as my last morning the service was flawless.",3,2018,02,06
105,Birthday weekend,"My husband had a ‘milestone’ birthday this year, so we decided to get away to London for a long weekend. We booked the Chesterfield for three nights through booking.com, just because we like the look of the hotel, it’s position and because it had great reviews on trip advisor! The hotel is a delightful, boutique hotel which is full of the loveliest people working there. From my initial contact with Charlie in bookings, to the reception staff, the lovely men behind the bar, to the lady who delivered my breakfast this morning, everyone was without fail, personable and polite without being over the top. The little touches were lovely, from the cup cake with a candle and a card from the hotel for my husband,s birthday, to the little extra croissant the lady who delivered my breakfast put on the tray. Everyone wears the signature  red carnation and they feature in many ways throughout the hotel, which is a lovely touch.
My husband and I will certainly be visiting The Chesterfield Mayfair again and look forward to another delightful experience where we were made to feel very welcome. The birthday card said from the Chesterfield Family, and indeed we were made to feel very much at home.",5,2018,02,05
105,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff who made our visit very special.,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield on Mayfair and we can't fault it! During our stay over the weekend we were made to feel very special by all the staff from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was spotless and very spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent, loads of choices. 
On the Saturday evening during our stay my boyfriend proposed to me in the piano bar and I couldn't have asked for a more romantic setting and attentitive staff.  
We would both like to make a special thank you to Tony the concierge and Beth on reception who",5,2018,02,05
105,No place better!,"The Chesterfield Hotel is a very special place.  It combines 5* luxury,  an excellent location with stunning hospitality that exudes warmth.  From the moment we approached the hotel every member of staff, from the doorman to the receptionist made us feel like we were the only guests there.  Nothing was too much trouble and every time we entered or left the hotel we were greeted with a smile and a friendly comment. It was a perfect place to spend a relaxing and luxurious weekend away.",5,2018,02,04
105,Birthday celebration ,"Excellent location and great service
The room was spacious and very clean 
I would definitely stay there again.

The hotel is a five minute walk from Green Park tube station. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. 

The decor of the hotel is traditional but very classy. 

Overall a very enjoyable stay at the chesterfield ",5,2018,02,02
105,Old World Charm with modern conveniences ,"Love this charming hotel, located in the heart of Mayfair. The staff treats everyone as a special guest. The bar is a relaxing place that service a good menu. Good food.  The restaurant is high class and the breakfast is superb. ",5,2018,02,01
105,perfection,"What can one say- if you want a taste of luxury and hospitality 5 star, then this hotel's for you.
My son booked a night for our anniversary and they upgraded us to a suite which was jaw dropping. I felt like royalty! We had a show booked in London but I didn't want to leave the suite it was so fabulous! (obviously did and show was fab too!) on returning from show we found cards and treats to celebrate our 40th anniversary- see photo. Staff SO pleasant and couldn't do enough. If you want to have memories to last a lifetime -then the Chesterfield is for you! Sue and Alan  ",5,2018,02,01
105,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"As the title suggests, we have just had an Afternoon Tea here, and were really impressed. 

The welcome, the service, the tastiness of the food and the pink champagne were all very nice. 

We would definitely return here",5,2018,01,30
105,5*Excellent ,"Stayed in the Chesterfield overnight while visiting London for Afternoon Tea at the Ritz. Could not fault this hotel everything was perfect all the staff were very friendly, helpful and professional nothing was too much trouble. Spotlessly clean lovely decor and in a very central location within easy walking distance for picadilly circus
 The breakfast was amazing so much choice and very nicely presented.
We were also very lucky to have been upgraded to a suite. We were in London celebrating our anniversary so this made it extra special.
It wasn't cheap to stay there but not over the top and well worth it if you were going to  London for a special occasion. I would definitely recommend it to others and stay again.",5,2018,01,29
105,Afternoon Tea - Amazing ,"We love it here, it was a birthday treat from my husband and the food was amazing. They manage to cater for my egg allergy and the service was so good. They gave my children a teddy bear each and Mr. Wonka cake out. Was so lovely. The food kept coming and nothing was too much trouble. So excited to be coming here again in the next few months! ",5,2018,01,29
105,Absolutely brilliant and very English hotel!,"I stayed with my family at the Chesterfield Mayfair for a few nights in January. Our second time at this hotel. It is the best and most memorable hotel I have ever stayed at. English, classy and conservative with a clear ""more is more"" style for everything. Super service in every detail.  And do not think about skipping the breakfast (a la carte of course...).  Located in the middle of London's elegant Mayfair neighborhood. (A convenient walk to the next Rolls Royce and Bugatti dealers around the corner.....!)  
All things considered; very good value. Will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2018,01,29
105,Severely dissapointed,"I have never been so dissapointed with tje Red Carnation brand. It seems there excelent service and reputation that i have grown to love was missing in this hotel.
I have always loved the character type hotels of red carnation but this one overcharges with no delivery to back up the price. From check in to check out it did not do much to redeem itself except for the suite butler.
Most sad was breakfast service and checkout. We struggled to get attention throughout our 4 day stay during breakfast and when we did get service it was done harriedly. This was not a lack of staff just inattentive waiting staff and poor training. On check out we got a trainee who did not provide us with the complimentary water offerred to the guests ahead of us checking out(a standard i am also accustomed to at other red carnation hotels). On request for a water she advised she was out of stock but i could get it at the bar (which was subject to a cost). My simple query was why not get stock from the bar and then provide to departing guests had her startled and after a repeat overheard by a colleague was fulfilled.
Definitely not a repeat despite the great location.",2,2018,01,25
105,Afternoon Tea.,"New Years Day 2018.
Myself & my 2 daughters have made a new tradition that over the Christmas holidays we now treat ourselves to the fantastic Afternoon tea at this Grand Hotel.
It all started when we had my eldest daughters hen party here. Not your normal hen party but as my daughter was pregnant my younger daughter thought it would be something different & so she organised the whole thing. The customer service at the Chesterfield is exemplary they let us decorate the area we my daughters hen in & they just couldn't do enough for us. That hen afternoon tea had the theme of ""Willy Wonker Chocolate afternoon tea"" it was stunning. The different teas, sandwiches, cakes, pastries & traditional scones with jam & clotted cream were out of this world & just kept coming. As soon as the food started going down the waiting staff replaced whatever was missing. The staff are I think some of if not the best I have ever come across, since that event was so successful we have returned on another 2 occasions. Once as part of my Christmas present on New Years Eve 2016 & then again New Years Day 2018. Each time the service & food is stunning. But please don't take my word for it. Experience the experience for yourselves. You will not be disappointed.",5,2018,01,23
105,Afternoon tea with a teist,I booked the afternoon tea with a twist for my wife’s birthday. The twist......Charlie and the Chocolate Factory theme. Upon arrival the staff were friendly and attentive. We were seated and were quickly started off with our afternoon treat. Staff kept the tea flowing and also top ups on the food were good. As I had pre booked and mentions my wife’s birthday she got her own little cake and birthday song! All the food had the theme running through it and tasted fresh. Would definitely go back and is only short walk from the station.,5,2018,01,23
105,One of the best!,"I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel for one night with a friend and it was a delight.  The location is ideal especially for a single female traveller; I felt very safe at night walking through the neighbourhood from Green Park tube station trying to locate the hotel.  I walked into a beautiful marble lobby with carnations in the middle and a very friendly front desk team who checked me in quite efficiently.  I did not have time to go into the terrace bar but it looked like an exclusive private members club with barmen wearing crisp white blazers shaking up what looked like very fancy cocktails.  We stayed in a beautiful room with little touches that all added to the decor.  A beautiful alcove by the window and distressed vintage mirrors.  The gentleman Eryk who served us, he was very friendly and courteous.  I had the catch of the day which was not only aesthetically pleasing but tasty too.  The beds were so comfortable so I missed breakfast the next day as I woke up at 11.00 – I simply made myself some tea using the tea and coffee making facilities before I checked out.  The shower was great and I went home feeling well rested and taken care of.  I would highly recommend this hotel for numerous reasons, every staff member had a smile on their face and the facilities were beautiful and comfortable.  Look no further for your next trip to London!",5,2018,01,21
105,Great Hotel in a wonderful location,This is a very grand English hotel. The rooms are small but this is typical of any central London hotel. The staff were exceptional. Breakfast was served at your table rather than the usual buffet that more modern hotels offer. The bar had a great atmosphere with live music.,5,2018,01,18
105,Cheers to  Chesterfield Mayfair!,"The  English tradition of  high level customer service is alive and well AND incomparable at the Chesterfield. When was the last time  your customer service expectations were exceeded while the bill was affordable?! Not sure how  Red Carnation, the  company that owns the Chesterfield, hires, onboard and trains their team BUT we could all take a lesson; exceptional service from everyone- front desk, maids, room service staff to management.  I'd venture that they all love working for this company. My daughter and I felt pampered by the lovely appointed room ( we saw 4 of them- all wonderful and different), turn down service with notes and amenities, a bathroom do die for,  delightful room service menu  and waiter  to go with it,  helpful staff and clear  legacy and leadership in management.  Details? Comfy bed and pillows,  bathrobes and slippers,  coffee, tea and biscuits,  great bathtub and amenities a window that opens, QUIET and SLEEPABLE.  Awesome neighborhood to walk in and get to places.  I wish I could live here. WELL DONE!",5,2018,01,17
105,A superb weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"My wife and I have just enjoyed a lovely stay at the Chesterfield.  The room/suites are excellent, the food wonderful, but most import is the Customer Service and Customer Satisfaction.  We can only say that all the staff are happy to help and nothing is too much trouble; you are made to feel so relaxed.  This is an exceptional Hotel where old values remain.   Thanks to All.",5,2018,01,15
105,Another Perfect Stay!,"From check in to check out superb service was provided. Breakfast and especially the kippers are sublime, Carolina who has been at the hotel for nearly 30 years is just wonderful and her smile in the morning is infectious. Bar service was as good as ever and we love the pianist who plays in the evening. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and we will be returning hopefully in the summer",5,2018,01,14
105,Afternoon tea at it's best,"Had afternoon tea here with my daughter today and have to say it was just the best experience. Nothing was too much bother for our waitress  Roula she offered us extras  of anything we needed or wanted and helped make the experience what it was. The willy wonka style afternoon tea was so tasty as were the scones and delicious sandwiches.  We even got the leftovers to take away in a box for those not lucky enough to come with us. Highly recommend this as a treat and have the Champagne, You're  worth it!",5,2018,01,13
105,"Classic, comfortable hotel","The Chesterfield Mayfair isn't trying to be something it isn't. It's not trendy or host to a hip bar. It is, however, timelessly comfortable with excellent service and attention to detail. The staff is genuine, courteous, and customer-oriented- always available as well! The rooms are very, very clean and quiet as the walls are fabric lined and gently padded. Spacious bathroom with large tub and hot water, perfect for a soak before climbing into bed with crisp, fresh sheets! Thoughtful touches include an excellent selection of coffee and tea in room, with a proper French press to brew it and biscuits to accompany it, desk with office necessities, and bathrobe and slippers. Turndown service ( a dying out in my opinion) was a wonderful thing to return to at the end of the day.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London. Corporate megalith or boutique and bohemian it is not, but what it does offers in comfort and service makes it a real gem.",5,2018,01,12
105,Terrible experience,"I recently visited The Chesterfield Mayfair and had a terrible experience at this hotel. This is my fifth trip to Europe in the past five years and in my travels I have never felt so unwelcome in a hotel. The staff here are not friendly or warm. I found the doormen and porters to be particularly rude. In fact I felt so unwelcome at this hotel that I used the side door instead of the front door to avoid feeling so uncomfortable.  I have also read this in other trip advisor reviews – seems to be a pattern among some uncomfortable guests. I stayed here over Christmas and I think the hotel is a great location for winter travels around London.   However I am sure there are other hotels in this area that are more inviting, charming and personal. The building itself is fairly rundown, although I have to acknowledge the interior is very ‘old English’ which is beautiful in that time of year. I must also mention the lovely man in the bar who had exceptional customer service  and made incredible drinks.  He was the only one standout member of staff. The breakfast here is average, nothing special at all. The rooms are a decent size but nothing particularly fancy.  As I mentioned earlier this is my fifth trip to Europe in the last five years, each time staying no shorter than four weeks and in that time I have never experienced such lack of personality in a hotel. To put it straight I think if you are a high tipping traveler the staff will fawn over you. However if they do not deem you as a particularly generous tipper they barely make eye contact and acknowledge your presence.  I also noticed when viewing this hotel on TripAdvisor that there are a lot of rave reviews posted by travellers who have only one or two reviews to their name...  to summarise I won’t be back to this hotel and would never recommend it.  I would also like to add that I am not a critical traveller. I have always stayed in beautiful hotels around Europe but this is the hotel I have been most disappointed in.",1,2018,01,12
105,Fantastic birthday afternoon tea,"We visited the Chesterfield with a family group to celebrate a 70th birthday.  Despite being a group of 18 with babies, toddlers and young children, not to mention a host of dietary requirements, we were given a warm welcome and every need was taken care of, including colouring and teddies to keep the children entertained.  The afternoon tea was delicious and beautifully presented, with generous portions, and was well received by all.  The service was outstanding and the staff were attentive and friendly.   We were lucky enough to have use of the private room which was perfect for our needs.  Looking forward to a return visit!",5,2018,01,11
105,Excellence in Mayfair ,"The Chesterfield Hotel is an excellent place to stay!
We had a fantastic gin experience in the bar and James was brilliant, very knowledgeable and witty. I would really recommend this to anyone. All the staff are amazing, very helpful and professional.",5,2018,01,10
105,Something missing ,"This hotel has all the ingredients that you want in a hotel but something is definitely missing for me and it's probably personality and service. It is a reasonably charming hotel in a pretty good location for London, and a location that suited us for a winter visit as we wanted to see Winter Wonderland and the lights in Oxford Street. This hotel was in a good location to walk to everything we wanted to see. I don't know if it was the time of year we were visiting, (Christmas) but there were a lot of American travellers in the hotel,  and the hotel was really geared towards this market. I don't really understand all the reviews about great  service on this site as we didn't feel they provided a particularly good level of service compared to other Hotels in this price range. It took us six telephone calls to the front desk to get our air conditioning made cooler as the hotel rooms were really overheated . We also had to ask for soap and toilet paper on a couple of occasions. I  would really commend the young fellow in the bar who did provide great service and was well trained in customer relations. I found the night porters to be quite rude and dismissive. They also had a number of staff who seem to just stand around in the lobby doing nothing other than walking people's dogs and chatting to each other. Other than that I just feel this hotel is really missing a distinctive personality and charm. It's a serviceable hotel in a reasonably good location, but don't expect much more than that.   I usually revisit hotels when I go back to revisit cities again but this time I will find a new hotel. I just don't get why people rave about this hotel on this site because it just did not live up to the reviews. ",3,2018,01,08
105,Great food!!!!,"If you are looking for a kid friendly hotel, this is the place to go to. It’s bit, beautiful, and the food is great. The service is wonderful, but I really do think anywhere you go in London you will get exceptional service. The employees are always happy to serve you. The rooms are pretty big and clean. The hotel is in a very nice location to. I haven’t had dinner there, so I wouldn’t know what to say about that. But the high tea is delicious. It is very kid friendly food and it’s a nice place to be. It’s classy and chic though. It is also a good place to go to for adults. The service there is very good too. If you are looking for an easy/classic high tea meal, this is a good place to go!  ",4,2018,01,07
105,Impeccable service,"The Chesterfield exceeded my expectations in so many ways.  Enjoyed a post Christmas stay. Upon arrival I was greeted by a beautifully decorated lobby. The front desk employee Chloe was friendly and helpful. Chloe quickly checked me in after a long flight. The room was a typical European size. There was ample closet space and it did not feel cramped despite its small size .  Toiletries were in generous supply and had a delicious scent. Water pressure was supreme. Turn down service each night with bottled water and treats on the pillow. The only complaint about the room was the mattress was uncomfortable. 
I opted for the full English breakfast. It's a must   The dining room is well appointed. Service was attentive. Carolina was a welcome sight every morning. The continental buffet was always restocked. Coffee was strong and plentiful.   
The Chesterfield has made a customer for life.",5,2018,01,05
105,The Perfect Holiday Stay,"From the time we arrived at the Chesterfield Mayfair until we departed for the airport, we could not have had better accommodations.  Our family spent a week here, all 29 of us, and the staff at the Chesterfield made sure that each day was perfect.  It easily became our home away from home with the staff ensuring we had places to spend time together and responding to requests and questions.  The location was perfect and we would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,01,05
105,A London Christmas To Remember,"I was fortunate to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my family for the Christmas holiday! The staff were attentive to every detail, helpful and friendly! The room was stunning and the bathroom spacious. After a long morning of travel to London, we were able to check in early and access our room hours before the scheduled checkin. That is service! We were able to relax and enjoy our surroundings with better ease knowing that we were being taken care of at the Chesterfield Mayfair! 

Located minutes away from the excitement, my husband and I were able to take lovely strolls through London! It was in the perfect location! In the event we needed a Taxi, one was provided almost immediately. 

I can't say enough about this marvelous hotel. Thank you for making this Christmas season unforgettable!",5,2018,01,03
105,Brock family reunion!,"When the Brock family of 29 arrived in London From the US on December 22 for our Dickens Christmas Family reunion... we could never have known how amazing our holiday would be. The entire staff at the Chesterfield welcomed us with such warmth. It was the best home away from home we could have ever hoped for. The rooms were lovely , the food was so beautifully presented and delicious.  The Winter Wonderland Christmas tea ... the best!! The Chesterfield is convenient to everything, perfect location.  We could not recommend more highly!!",5,2018,01,03
105,A magical and truly charming hotel,"I can't say enough about this hotel. As soon as I turned up the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The room was delightful and a proper bath in the bathroom paired with a cleanliness often unseen in the travel industry. This hotel is definitely one of the best I have stayed in in London. Having left the city nearly seven years ago to live in Dubai, the Chesterfield was a tremendous breathe of fresh air away from the mainly super modern hotels of Dubai (many of which are also great). The Gin and Jazz night is a must, set in the very comfortable and infinitely friendly bar off the lobby. You are propelled back into the 1920's with style and a touch of the decadent. A wonderful place filled with wonderful people.",5,2018,01,02
105,Great Hotel in London - Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a very cozy hotel in the quiet, charming area of Mayfair London.  Their customer service is excellent…very sincere, caring, prompt and attentive. Their staff made us feel so welcomed and at home through the duration of our stay in a very thoughtful, personalized way.  Thoughtful surprises included a red stocking with small gifts on our door on Christmas, turning down our bed every evening and leaving sweet treats on our pillows, and a cupcake to celebrate our last evening. To name a few staff members that stood out, Chloe, at the reception desk, was beyond helpful, professional, charming and gracious.  Victor, one of the doormen, was professional and enthusiastic -  a constant friendly face to see coming and going. As for the rooms themselves, I would not classify the rooms as luxurious or large, but cozy, unique, comfortable and very clean, each with their own decorative style.  (In general, we discovered that most hotels in the older sections of London have smaller the average room sizes compared to the US.)  The bedclothes were crisp and fresh! The bathroom was very nice and bright with plenty of hot water and great water pressure. 

Other traveler tips on the surrounding area…The Green Park tube is just minutes away and you will find yourself close to Berkley Square, where you will find Pret A Manger, a great place to grab a nice, healthy lunch that is very reasonably priced.  Although it’s a chain, the food is very fresh and tasty.  You can also acquire a nice breakfast.  We found that that eating at Pret A Manger for lunch allowed us to spend more on pricey dinners - plus, it’s fast, close to The Chesterfield, and close to the tube. There were also some other small, great restaurants nearby as well, particularly one called Iran. The Footman (a pub) is also very close but we didn't have a chance to eat there. There is a historical church nearby that we also recommend visiting called Church of the Immaculate Conception on Farm Street.

Around the corner, a block east is the Mayfair Kitchen (in bottom of the Mayfair Hotel).  This is a great place to have dinner at least one night.  The wait staff and hostess are so welcoming and the tapas style food is amazing. Love the ambience too! Our favorite dessert was the pistachio mango cake in combination with their strawberry ice cream YUM!

In general, the Chesterfield Mayfair felt like a home away from home. We would definitely stay there again highly recommend it!",5,2018,01,01
105,Beautiful hotel and great location ,"This place is amazingly beautiful with wonderful charm. Very close to great shopping and Buckingham Palace without being on a busy street. The rooms are very elegant as well. The only downside was the views weren’t great and the breakfast, while large, was not my cup of tea. We will be staying with them again and you should too!!",4,2018,01,01
105,"Fantastic Hotel not to be missed, definitely one of the best in London","I really love this Hotel, I was working in London for 4 days and really wanted to stay here again. Being in the Hotel industry I can stay wherever as its important to check Hotels out that I am booking regularly, however there is just something so special about this Hotel. The rooms are so comfortable and the beds are just out of this world. The Breakfast has to be one of the best I have ever eaten. Great Bar as well with great Wines. But I think its the staff that make this Hotel so special nothing and I mean nothing is a problem for anyone. Thank you once again for such a great stay.",5,2018,01,01

 Loved the theme and food was amazing. So friendly and kept bring out more food for us and great for children and accommodate them really well and friendly towards kids. Love to go back",5,2017,12,31
105,"Perfect Hotel with a traditional, high standard English experience","Really wonderful stay, with superior service. The staff were friendly, warm and attentive and a pleasure to be around, especially over the festive season. The food was incredible and comes highly recommended. The best fish and chips in England!",5,2017,12,28
105,It's like Mayfair Hotels used to be,"From the moment we arrived until the minute we left, we were continually impressed with the quality and friendliness of the staff. Tucked away in Charles Street Mayfair, it is ideally located for visiting London and sightseeing. The decor is very traditional with a strong feel of past grandeur. If you are into 'Minimalist', this is not for you  - if you like silk covered walls and 'old masters' you will feel at home.

The Room we had was quite small (particularly the bathroom) but was very cosy. Embroidered bed linen and frequent change of Towels and all facilities available in room made for an effortless stay. We will return.",5,2017,12,27
105,Service is Excellent,"This is how hotels should be run. Helpful and resourceful staff, no task too small or large. Most in the Concierge and Front Desk have a ‘take charge’ mindset which is exactly the experience guests expect or anticipate. Dining experience is a pleasant one with Carolina, Rodrigo and the rest of the breakfast team, a need during the mornings. The service at the bar is very good, we also chanced the live jazz band on a Wednesday-lively. Rooms are small but we opted for traditional English decor yet modern facilities, these we got and were happy nevertheless. Will definitely return. Stayed at the 6th floor.",5,2017,12,24
105,What a gem of a beautiful boutique hotel for our ten-day stay in London,"I can't praise this lovely hotel enough in a review.  It would take three reviews to say all the good things about it.  The front desk is lovely and extremely accommodating.  We had breakfast included in our stay, and what a splendid breakfast they supply!  An entire buffet plus cooked items off of a menu.  The hotel was sumptuously decorated for Christmas.  They kindly supplied directions, make recommendations--always clear and excellent.  We were near the very beautiful Berkeley Square park, within walking distance to shopping on Oxford and Regent Streets, Piccadilly Circus art galleries and The Ritz (which was also decorated beautifully for Christmas.  The Chesterfield Mayfair had bottled water downstairs in the lobby for your arrival and for you to take on your day's activities.  Our room was small (two single beds), but beautifully appointed, and kept immaculately clean.  The shower in the bathroom came out of the ceiling, which was both warm and delightful.  I loved the neighborhood in which our hotel was situated.  Charming pubs and shops surrounded.  It was easily accessible to the tube, taxis always waiting outside.  We toured Tower of London for which we took both a tube ride as well as a ferry down the Thames (again, a recommendation from our hotel).  They had a room for afternoon tea beautifully appointed, and a lovely event.  They have a bar with a jazz trio in the afternoons.  I can't say enough lovely things about it, and I very, VERY highly recommend it.  You will completely enjoy your stay here.",5,2017,12,24
105,An excellent place to stay,"It is in an excellent location, within walking distance of main shopping streets, tourist attractions and London's beautiful parks, and yet in a very quiet and pleasant neighborhood. The hotel's atmosphere is that of Victorian England. Rooms very comfortable. All necessary amenities are provided. Splendid breakfast.",5,2017,12,23

105,Wedding Anniversay,"Our daughter rang the hotel prior to our arrival to say this was our anniversary,as a result our room was upgraded and we were on given champagne and cupcakes.This was unexpected but a lovely gesture.Our first visit to the Chesterfield,but will certainly not be our last.The hotel is ideally located for visiting attractions,shopping and transport links.Staff so friendly,nothing to much trouble and music in the bar is truly relaxing.Beds really comfy and all amenities you could want in your room.The Chesterfield is a truly exceptional hotel.Many Thanks",5,2017,12,19
105,Very good place in the heart of London,"All good things about the hotel - location is perfect, close to attractions, subway, restaurants and commerce. The staff is very, very attentive and take a good care of you. The bar serves an afternoon tea of good quality. Will be back someday!
One thing I would recommend - in the shower/ bath there should have some place for you to hang while walking out of the bathtub as the floor is slippery. I can imagine an old person having difficulties here...",5,2017,12,18
105,Anniversary,"Spacious and well appointed room. Comfortable bed and very quiet. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food is excellent. Centrally placed and perfect for shopping in Regent and Oxford Street. Our favourite London hotel.

",5,2017,12,18
105,Where to Stay in London without Breaking the Bank,"My wife and I had a lovely stay during our honeymoon. The staff was courteous and friendly, there were no surprise charges, the room was clean, the shower was terrific, and the food was excellent at both the Afternoon tea and at dinner. That's not to mention the excellent location that was right near the Underground, Picadilly Circus, West End, and Soho.",5,2017,12,15
105,Perfect weekend ,"Our stay at the Chesterfield was perfect from start to finish. We were welcomed by the lovely concierge team and John on reception checked in to a beautiful room. Went down to the bar for a gin, which was Martin Millers with strawberries and black pepper, wonderfully recommended by Fiachra. Later we had room service and watched a film. All the staff in the hotel couldn’t do enough for us, made us feel very special. ",5,2017,12,15
105,Top Anniversary overnight stay ,"Stayed back at the Chesterfield in early October for an overnight anniversary celebration and we were spoilt rotten! Stunning room (Jungle Suite), lovely hand written card from the team and chocolates! Enjoyed a gin in the bar too. Great service and top hotel. Thanks to all. ",5,2017,12,15
105,Where service comes first!,"Just returned from a four night stay at The Chesterfield which was almost perfect. Its clear that service is what the hotel is all about. We had superb service throughout from check in, housekeeping, in the bar and restaurant and from the doormen and concierge. This is the first time I've stayed in a classic 'old fashioned & traditional' London hotel and it was marvelous. The decor is as you would expect - lots of dark wood, leather sofas and chairs and low lighting. The reception (and indeed the Christmas lights and decorations) are red, in keeping with the Red Carnation brand, the classy bar in dark British racing green. The lifts are small but efficient and there are two of them. Our room was a superior and was fairly compact but had everything we needed and was beautifully decorated and furnished. The bed is probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in! The bathroom was also very nice, though again small. The only thing I wasn't keen on was that the shower screen was not very efficient at keeping water from the toilet and bathroom floor! Both frequently got very wet. Bottled water and toiletries were topped up constantly and there was a turn down service.

We ate in the bar once and the sandwiches were very good, the chips even better! There's a good selection of cocktails both traditional and modern as well as the usual wines and spirits. The bar area is very relaxing and they have a pianist most evenings. We only had breakfast in the restaurant and, again, it was excellent with a good choice on the menu. The area, in Mayfair, is superb. Its just a few minutes walk from Green Park underground station and a short walk to Regent Street. There are elegant shops and buildings nearby and a superb Art Deco cinema. 

We loved our stay at The Chesterfield and I can't now imagine staying anywhere else when we return to London.",5,2017,12,14
105,Fantastic Hotel in London/Mayfair,The Chesterfield Mayfair is one the best hotels we have ever stayed in - we come back several times a year and cannot fault it.  The service you receive is truly superb - whether in the beautiful Butlers Restaurant for dinner/afternoon tea or in the bar enjoying an delicious cocktail.  The location is also fantastic - Mayfair is stunning and both Oxford Street and Buckingham Palace are a short stroll away (as are many other attractions and great bars/restaurants)... The rooms all have a beautiful traditional style which we loved (and we have stayed in several different rooms at this stage!).  We can't recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair highly enough.,5,2017,12,14
105,Overrated,"Rooms incredibly small for a “Superior King”. Diner a disappointment as steak was tough and chewy. Staff was pleasant but this hotel is overpriced for the quality you receive.
I had high expectations for this stay and regret having to assign this low rating but it is an honest and sincere one.",2,2017,12,13
105,London’s Best Kept Secret,"Absolutely Perfect! 

This hotel never disappoints. Once again exceptional service, beautiful & comfortable accommodation, great food and a warm friendly atmosphere. 

You can’t beat the experience you will have at the Chesterfield Mayfair. A really special hotel that is perfectly positioned. 

Again - we didn’t want to leave. 

Five star hotels will battle to compete with this level of service! 

Go on book and spoil yourselves!!! ",5,2017,12,11
105,Pre Christmas break,"Another fantastic stay at the chesterfield as it was our 5th stay they sent chocolate dipped strawberries to our room delicious treat also fresh fruit all the staff are wonderful, Sabrina who is in the bar is so lovely really enjoyed chatting to her a great asset to your hotel also the Irish guy whose name I can’t remember,looking forward to our next stay with you ",5,2017,12,11
105,Superb Service - Group Event,"I organised and stayed here last week as part of a group booking of 20 guests. From my initial enquiry to completion of our event the service received was friendly, timely and thorough.  Events Manager, Kornelia, ensured all of our requirements were met and every member of staff encountered during our stay made sure our guests felt welcome, relaxed and looked after (special mention to those who looked after us wonderfully throughout dinner in the conservatory).  In a world where the little things are often overlooked or deemed  unimportant, it was refreshing to note the attention to detail and have our custom valued.  I genuinely wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Chesterfield. Oh and the location is superb too.  ",5,2017,12,11
105,Fantastic Service,"We spent a lovely weekend in an autumn chilled London, but the warmth and service of the staff at Chesterfield made up many fold for the London weather.
By chance we had our 25th wedding anniversary during our stay and the staff surprised us with a fantastic breakfast champagne surprise. They just do the extra which make this a place to return to. Thank you all for the memories created.
Location is perfect for most things in central London.",5,2017,12,09
105,One of the best hotels  in London,"My wife and I have spent the last five days at the Chesterfield for our anniversary.  This hotel treats their guests in a royal manner:  Treats on nightly bases, bed making twice a day, the hotel is immaculate in terms of upkeep and small details from the heated towel rack in the shower to the décor.

We have stayed at the African suite which was spacious with a shower and tub, walk in closet and more.

Upon arrival we received two cupcakes with the writing in chocolate ""happy anniversary"" and personal greeting card signed by the staff. -  these are the small things that make you feel welcome.

The location is amazing, a walking distance to Oxford, Regent, Piccadilly, and Hyde park.

We would most definitely come back and also recommend to our friends.

Thank you Chesterfield!",5,2017,12,07
105,Late one,"Arrived on booked at about midnight. Was found a nice room and crashed. Woke up in the morning scoffed the club sarnie I found lying on bed, went down and had a very agreeable full English.

Nice hotel, nice staff, nice breakfast.

What more do you want?",4,2017,12,07
105,Lovely property in really good location with very good customer service,"The hotel has a really olde world feel and the decorations at Christmas really added to the ambience of this, especially in the breakfast room.
The bedrooms were very nice and it was a lovely touch that they complimentarily upgraded us to a suite because it was a birthday. This suite was very spacious with 2 lovely bathrooms. The bed was really comfy and the linen very luxurious however the room was the prefect temperature which meant that the duvet was too heavy and thus it ended up being too hot. This was our only complaint on the room front- all the other touches including large complimentary bottles of 2 types of water and plentiful toiletries were excellent.
I was sent a lovely birthday cake at turn down service and a birthday card which really were above and beyond what was expected however the card was written out to a Mr Jones - so i think I got the wrong card delivered.
Overall the rooms for London were 5 star.
Breakfast buffet was ample but the  service was a little chaotic as it was so busy, literally every table was full. We ordered cooked breakfasts from the menu and received 3 but our friend had to wait 10 minutes for hers to be served by which point we were finished. The beans were cold and the black pudding so over cooked that that it was solid. For the price paid for breakfast we felt it was too much for what we received, hence why we have knocked one star off, otherwise for this hotel and the standard of staff and facilities we would have awarded 5 stars.",4,2017,12,06
105,Perfect wedding venue,"My husband and I were married at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel on 24 November, 2017 in an intimate ceremony with immediate family members. 
From my initial check-in the night before the wedding until we left the morning following, my husband and I were made to feel special and like honored guests. The hotel staff went out of their way to make every detail of our stay and the wedding perfect. 
I was greeted in my room with a lovely congratulatory card, edible treats and a bottle of champagne. The next morning, the event planner met with me first thing to go over the day's schedule and checked in frequently to ensure there was nothing I needed. 
Once the wedding event began, the staff were instrumental in making sure that each component of the day ran smoothly and according to plan. They did everything so graciously and provided exemplary service!
One of our guests had a small child and there was a little package of goodies left in their hotel room for him, which was greatly appreciated. 
Our entire day and wedding occasion were perfect and a lot of that is thanks to the Chesterfield. They were absolutely wonderful to work with and delight throughout the entire planning process.",5,2017,12,05
105,A well run hotel in a great location,"While the rooms are typically small for London Hotels, the service and location are excellent.  The decor is very well done and the rooms are well laid out and very convenient.  The price was very competitive for this quality of hotels.",5,2017,12,04
105,Thanksgiving in London,"Our second stay at this perfectly located, comfortable and charming hotel with a wonderful and caring staff.   The entire concierge team, especially Tony and Elliott, were extremely helpful and a pleasure to engage with. What makes this hotel special is the entire staff, from front desk, housekeeping, room service,  as well as  the excellent restaurant and bar. The Red Carnation hotels are all great- we've stayed at three so far. We highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair!!!",5,2017,11,30
105,A beautiful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in June as part of a business/pleasure trip.
Our room was lovely and the breakfasts were delightful, with delicious food and gracious service. We needed some help with train reservations and the front desk helped us tremendously. Everyone we encountered had a smile on his or her face.  We are looking forward to returning next summer.",5,2017,11,28
105,GREAT LOCATION AND GREAT STAFF,"We have stayed at this lovely hotel before and I am pleased to say it keeps improving. From the moment you arrive your are made to feel welcome. The hotel has an excellent bar, the rooms are very well fitted out with everything you need. On top of all this you are right in heart Mayfair. Thank you Chesterfield for a lovely stay and see you again soon.",5,2017,11,28
105,Gin Tasting Experience,"Myself and 3 friends spent the afternoon for the gin tasting experience and had a wonderful time. Knowledgable staff and fantastic atmosphere, would definitely recommend booking to others and return ourselves",5,2017,11,27
105,Excellent baby friendly hotel ,"We stayed here for my brother in laws wedding. So baby friendly. Provided a robe and slippers for my little boy when we arrived to the room, along with a teddy bear and then in the bathroom products for him to use in the bath. They were so helpful when we needed milk as well. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2017,11,26
105,"Fantastic service, courteous staff","You made by first stay in your hotel a special and a memorable one. Every staff member is extremely polite and caring. Wonderful breakfast with warm dishes, your eggs Benedict / Royale is the best. The attention given throughout my 5 night stay during the dinner at the Butlers Restaurant is memorable. Farewell cupcake personally delivered to the room in the previous evening made it special. 

Nice hotel, good location, well trained extremely courteous staff. Well worth the money.

Please keep it up and thank you for making my stay a nice one.",5,2017,11,25
105,Tea,Our 2nd visit to the Mayfair for tea and again the two an a half hours flew by- staff extremely courteous the food/sweets were outstanding! A must for any visitor-the hotel itself is magnificent! The various teas offered were exemplary everything served especially teas were done in the ‘’ old’’ manor-well done,5,2017,11,23
105,Another Wonderful Stay at the Chesterfield,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield for our wedding anniversary after an absolutely superb initial visit and we are delighted to say that we were not disappointed!  
The room, the staff and the food are all absolutely excellent -  we cannot recommend the Chesterfield enough!  On both occasions the staff went above and beyond to ensure we felt valued and welcome.  In fact, we would go as far as to say no other London hotel which we have stayed in (and that includes some well known 5*s) makes us feel so special.  Antonio, for all the care you took of us, thank you so much.  You were wonderful! And the lovely Chloe on reception was so welcoming and friendly.   
We can't wait to visit our Chesterfield family again!",5,2017,11,22
105,Charming hotel with great service,"We stayed at this hotel for 8 days as part of a group attending theater. The facility is beautifully decorated and comfortable. The staff at the entrance and front desk are extremely friendly and helpful. They made every effort to make our stay a good experience. The room was well-appointed with a comfortable bed and nice seating.  Our only complaints about it were that the closet and drawer spaces were smaller than we would have liked, and the temperature in the room was difficult to control. The bar and restaurant were very good and more than expected from a hotel that size. The food was good and the bar was well-stocked. The bartenders and servers were very attentive and helpful.",5,2017,11,21
105,Excellent dinner,"Thank you very much indeed for the recent dinner at your hotel. The service and food at The Chesterfield was excellent  and we loved the library (so thank you for the suggestion). I will be definitely be using you again and thank you again, a very professional and enjoyable experience.",5,2017,11,21
105,As English as could be. Lovely cozy Winter experience. Breakfast is worth it,"The hotel's location is unsuperable, the decoration, as English as could be, which was yet another attraction of the trip.

Every detail was so carefully handled that made the stay even more enjoyable, namely the smooth bed linen, the shower with abundant flow of water, the little chocolates and the room service.

Breakfast deserves a special mention as it is remarkable for several reasons. In first place for the  selection of high-standard cheese, cold cuts, and natural juices. In second place for the cooked to order dishes. The benedict/Royale eggs were very good and the cooking point of poached eggs was simply perfect. Lastly the attentive menmbers of staff assisted us with everything we needed",5,2017,11,20
105,Excellence from beginning to end,"I stayed at this hotel, as a treat, during visit to London.... and treat it certainly was!!! The service was excellent from beginning to end. Smooth check in, very helpful information from the Concierge. The room was really comfortable; the bathroom large and the bed beyond dreamy (I could have stayed in there all day!!). The bar is so lovely; sadly didn't have time to do the Gin Experience- definitely next time!! The location is perfect, definitely the place to stay if you want to be in the ❤️ Of Mayfair- perfect.",5,2017,11,19
105,PERFECT,At last found the perfect London hotel. Small excellent service good food and comfortable. The location is good if you want to be in the Bond Street area and it is possible to walk to Soho and the theatres it takes about 15 minutes.,5,2017,11,18
105,Superlative experience,"Where to start?

From the moment we arrived in this incredible little hotel, we found the entire experience to be absolutely outstanding.

Our check-in was easy, quick and the wonderful staff showed us to our room soon after we arrived. After being in the room for a few minutes, I queried whether we had been given a Superior Room (as we had booked via Expedia.com) and called down to reception to check. Let me say upfront that there wasn't anything wrong with the room, it was just not what I had seen as per the pictures when we booked.
Immediately, we were invited to view two other available rooms and were told that we needed to be completely satisfied with the room as we were staying for 6 nights. One of ladies from reception, Sanae (I hope I've got that right) showed me another room in the corner of the 4th floor which I fell in love with immediately and we were moved there within five minutes.
After a mere query of the room, we were made to feel like royalty and it wasn't met with anything other than genuine concern that we were happy with our room. I really appreciated this and the swift way that they handled the situation.

Our room was lovely, spacious enough for us to really enjoy being in the room and not treat it as just a base for us to sleep and leave our things.
Every night with the turndown service, a little surprise is left on the pillows (not just chocolates) which we felt really went above and beyond what we had expected. The towels are 100% Egyptian cotton, the amenities are luxurious and the beds and linen are incredibly comfortable to sleep on. We had blackout curtains in our room which really helped to get a good nights sleep too.

Food:
The breakfast was 17.5 for a continental which we had on most days. There is a selection of yoghurts, delicious granolas, pastries, smoked salmon, cheeses and other delicious bits and bobs. For 22.00  pounds you can elect to have the continental as well as a hot breakfast too.
I found the continental offered more than enough, and their granola is possibly the nicest I've ever had.

I had the afternoon tea on one day, this was absolutely delicious. It came with a glass of Brut Lanson Champagne, I believe that one could also select the Rose. A beautifully presented 3-layer stand made its way to my table ladened with delicious sandwiches, two types of scones with homemade Raspberry jam and clotted cream, and a final layer with a selection of cakes and pastries. It also came with a tea (I chose the Moroccan Mint Green tea) but there are easily ten to choose from. The cost of this came to a very reasonable 45.00 pounds - reasonable considering what you get in the afternoon tea, and compared to other ""big name"" afternoon teas in the area.

I had lunch on another day, and was warmly greeted by the staff and seated at a table nearby. I chose to try the Brie and Cep risotto, which was melt in your mouth delicious and packed full of flavour. The Risotto itself was cooked to perfection, being a dish that is more often than not overcooked in many restaurants.

We also opted to try their in-room dining on one day, and decided on the Bea Tollman's Chicken Noodle Soup. The clear broth-like soup arrived at our door 20 minutes later, beautifully presented with some delicious bread rolls and butter. Room service is often an area that falls down in hotels, either with the presentation or the taste in general. This wasn't the case at all in The Chesterfield.

We ate at The Terrace Bar too, and their sandwiches and burgers are mouthwatering too. This is clearly a buzzing little bar which often saw businessmen having a drink after work, ladies in formal dresses having a drink before dinner, a wonderful band dressed in black tie to entertain the patrons. Their drinks selection is great, we found ourselves indulging in many gin cocktails over the duration of our stay.

In short, their food and drinks are outstanding, We didn't have a bad meal during our stay. In fact, as someone who considers themselves to be a foodie, I'd say the food was truly outstanding. 

Environmentally Friendly:
I loved the fact that the hotel is environmentally friendly and green.
They are rated highly on this point and guests are encouraged to conserve energy by turning off lights when they leave, and sheets and towelling are only changed when guests request it to be. They have a bee hive on their roof which means that they make their own delicious honey on the premises too.
 
Service:
This is truly where I feel The Chesterfield Mayfair has hit the nail on the head. You can visit beautiful hotels anywhere in the world, and they are still lovely hotels to stay in, however if the service is not up to scratch, it really doesn't matter what it looks like in my opinion.
The staff at The Chesterfield are in a league of their own.
From the doormen who greeted us everyday as we came and went, to the staff who serviced our rooms, to Julian and Chris (amongst others) in The Terrace Bar, to Caterina who waited on us at breakfast. Each and every single staff member we came into contact with were genuinely friendly and wonderful to chat to. I'm not a chatty person, in fact I'd probably say I avoid dealing with people where possible. However I found myself in really interesting conversations with so many of the staff here, because they were genuinely curious about where we were going, where we came from, what we thought of this or that and it wasn't ever forced conversation - it was like chatting to long lost friends. 
I would really like to highlight and commend each and every staff member of The Chesterfield for being so wonderful at their jobs and so wonderful to deal with on every level.

Location:
The hotel is located in the beautiful and central suburb of Mayfair. I walked almost everywhere and found that it was close to pretty much everything.
My husband took cabs to various places whilst he was working, and also commented on how centrally located we were.
Hyde Park is a five minute walk, Oxford and Regent Street are a leisurely ten minute walk.

Overall:
This hotel is set apart by the staff and the details for me.
Being served loose tea in fine china, with a silver tea sieve, the Egyptian Cotton bath sheets, the surprises left on our pillows every night, leather drinks coasters, being serenaded by a piano at almost every turn, a smile around every corner, amongst many many other things.

If you are considering hotels in London, stop looking, you've found it.",5,2017,11,18
105,Treated like Royalty,"My third stay at this incredible hotel & I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. From the initial booking to checkout, EVERY member of the staff tended to our every need. Such a perfect location, this hotel provides elegance and comfort. All of their dining venues offer delicious choices and Dominic and his staff anticipate your needs and preferences. Everyone at Reception is warm and welcoming - you even get a phone call when your room is ready. After returning from sightseeing, they asked how we enjoyed our day out- it was like coming home each day. Housekeeping kept us wonderfully comfortable - the hotel is spectacularly clean. And no review would be complete without mentioning Tony - the most kind and caring concierge you could ask for - a true British gentleman indeed!",5,2017,11,17
105,Incredible Old Boutique Hotel,"This lovely hotel in the Mayfair area of London that borders Hyde Park is quintessentially old English.  The doormen are in long coats, hats, and gloves, opening the doors with a big grin and proper manners.  All the staff were incredibly friendly, and room service prompt and accurate.  The breakfast buffet was quite varied, and the Terrace Bar is a great place for a nightcap before heading to bed.  As somebody who has owned an interior design business, I was fascinated that every wall in the hotel; and I mean every wall, was fabric, not paint.  The wine list is wonderful and the portions of food generous.  It is a great little historical oasis and walkable to the many shops and restaurants in Mayfair, as well as Oxford Street and Christopher's Place.",5,2017,11,16
105,Favorite Hotel,"I really love this hotel and the people there. Fantastic building, the rooms are very very nice. The service is amazing and the location is perfect. This was my fourth visit to this hotel and looking forward to the next opportunity to visit again. The dining room is excellent with perfect service.",5,2017,11,16
105,Great Hotel,"I've stayed at the Chesterfield twice before and always find my experience to be excellent.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and the accommodations very good, especially considering the location.",5,2017,11,16
105,Excellent! ,"All were excellent. Food was delicious, well presented and service was excellent. Staff were so attentive and helpful. They offer a good selection of wine and staff seems to know their stuff when quizzed on the vintages - another bonus! 

Location is ideal for a great evening. Will certainly visit again! ",5,2017,11,15
105,"BEST HOTEL STAFF & LOCATION, COMFY BEDS QUIET LOCATION","First time here, quiet location close to everything, easy to get O2, shopping, theaters, etc
Comfortable clean beds, choice of pillow types, room service and menu available late evening . I did not use their restaurant but nice to know if needed it was available as was room service.
Must recognize 2 strong customer focused employees who made the trip wonderful ::

Each morning this lovely woman ensured daily breakfast in bed orders 100% perfect, delivered at the requested time into the room, confirming if anything else was needed, etc. always with a positive greeting and warm welcoming smile. What a way to start the day! On the last day I noted her name tag and hope my memory correct - Langes . Thank you Langes for your caring and positive welcoming attitude. Your pleasing personality and efforts really made a positive difference each morning and for the entire stay!
On my last day my cell phone was not working, when I returned that evening and confirmed wakeup call at Reception des, the gentleman, whose name I do not know, but was from the Ukraine, promptly fixed my Apple I phone problem! Great to be able to receive messages before checking out the next morning. Thank you!
The Concerge reception staff and housekeeping staff all helpful.
Only slight surprise- When I emailed hotel asking should I pack an umbrella, I was surprised to be told yes, but it was not necessary, they have umbrellas to loan out.
I liked getting away from the hustle bustle noise by the hotel, and appreciated not hearing traffic each evening when going to sleep.
Only complaint was some guests noisy late at nigh. I did not receive 1 wakeup call requested late Saturday evening but it may have been due to telephone system problem?   
Very small elevator was not a problem and did not hear it from my room.",5,2017,11,14
105,Birthday Weekend,"My husband booked us a one night stay at The Chesterfield as part of my birthday weekend away and it was lovely. 

The room was very traditional and “English”, it wasn’t like anywhere we have stayed before so it made a nice change to the modern-style hotels we usually stay at. The bed was really comfortable, there was a huge TV in the room, tea and coffee making facilities etc... everything you would expect to find. 

Location is great - about a five minute walk from Green Park station, ten minutes from Buckingham Palace, lots to see and do very near by. 

Breakfast was brilliant, so many choices! We also had afternoon tea which was delicious, definitely recommend. ",5,2017,11,13
105,Perfect home away from home,Second time staying in this delightful and charming hotel. The details in the room are beautiful and the staff are beyond compare. I don't know how I could possibly stay anywhere else in the future visits to London!,5,2017,11,13
105,Quintessentially English,Having mainly stayed in big modern Asian hotels for the past 25 years it was a delight to step back to an old London hotel. Comfortable rooms with a warm ambience and attentive staff. Good restaurant for both dinner and breakfast. Would have liked to have stayed longer.,4,2017,11,13
105,At home in London,"An award winning staff makes you feel at home. The warm rich atmosphere adds to your comfort. Breakfast is fantastic. the quality and diversity of the food makes dining a pleasure. This holds true for dinner as well. The excellent location in Mayfairputs you within walking distance of great shopping, Hyde park and other London attractions",5,2017,11,12
105,Hard to fault.,"Great location, great staff, and comfortable rooms - there is not a lot not to like about this property. When we checked in the first room we were given had a noisy ventilation fan outside the window (there's something not to like) - a quick chat had us moved to another room and (for us at least) the problem was solved. The room was well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast was exceptional - a combination of good food and exceptional service really did set us up for the rest of the day.",4,2017,11,10
105,Our perfect wedding,"From the moment we booked our wedding to the time we checked out, we received the most professional, friendly and personal service that we could have wished for. 

Our contacts, first Sam and later Cornelia were so helpful and accommodating, with nothing being too much trouble, including arranging the bridal bouquet and making the cake. We also had plenty of choices for our guests to pre order food for our evening dinner. 

All of our guests stayed at the hotel, who also faultlessly arranged parking, one with quite late notice, and we were upgraded to the African Suite, which was very thoughtful and ensured that we had plenty of space to get ready.

We held the ceremony in the Library, and then had drinks and canapés in a reserved area in the bar whilst the room was prepared for our private dinner. The table looked beautiful and everything was served faultlessly.

Everyone also had a lovely breakfast in the restaurant the next morning.
 
The whole experience was completely stress free, everything that was requested was delivered without us once having to ask or chase up. Throughout, staff were always on hand to seamlessly guide us through the day, which meant that rather than having to think or worry about what was supposed to be happening, we could just focus on enjoying our wedding day.

It was sad to finally have to check out, but a big thanks to Sam, Cornelia and all the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair for making our wedding so special.",5,2017,11,10
105,Best hotel in London?,"Unbelievably great staff, wonderful service and a fabulous location.  The Chesterfield is always our first choice when staying in London.  The rooms are beautifully appointed though quite small, but this is London.  We’ve not eaten dinner here, but the breakfast is superb and the bar a joy to visit.  Thoroughly recommended. ",5,2017,11,09
105,"Exceptional service, as always!","We use 'The Chesterfield Hotel' for meetings and are confident that every time we do, the day and event will run smoothly and efficiently. 
The staff can not do enough and nothing is too much to ask! 
The lunch is always superb and is offered either in the room or the restaurant. You can completely cater the day to you and they will accommodate for your needs.

A special thank you to Kornelia who makes the booking so easy and to all other members of staff on the day who run around bringing us whatever we want!",5,2017,11,09
105,Anniversary stay,"My husband and I visited London for our anniversary and decided to stay at this hotel. The hotel was quaint and beautiful. The staff were very attentive. The hotel has the perfect balance of old charm and modern amenities.

We ate dinner in Butlers one of the evenings and the food and service was spectacular. We also had breakfast in Butlers each morning. The service was not at the same level as it was during dinner, but it was much busier at breakfast time. 

The bar area was also nice and the bartenders were friendly. 

One of the best things about this hotel is it’s location. We were able to walk to every attraction we wanted to see. 

We would stay here again on a return trip. ",5,2017,11,08
105,"""Another great stay at the Chesterfield""","We cannot say enough nice things about the Chesterfield. This past June marked our tenth annual London vacation stay at the hotel. It is good to know that some things in life can always be counted on --- like the warm welcome by the front desk and bell staff, who alway seem to remember our family, the pleasure of an extra dry martini in their elegant bar listening to  John Hudson on the piano who will play all of our favorites, and the high quality of service throughout the hotel.  It is like coming home, only better.

A special shout out to the evening staff and especially Hani, the night manager, for the friendship and service he has extended to our family for so many years,",5,2017,11,08
105,Chesterfield Mayfair garners top honors as one of my London favorites,"The entire hotel staff exceeded expectations as we experienced such wonderful, warm, friendly service with a high level of attention to detail. The Butlers Restaurant experience was top notch, from the breakfast offerings to the superb fine dining at dinnertime. I particularly loved Bea’s signature dishes, ranking this as the best meal during my stay in  London. The location was ideal, on a quieter street but within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, pubs and tube and bus stations. It was easy to locate, noted by the signature red awnings, beckoning us back to our home away from home. Our room was very quaint (code - small) however the luxurious accommodations more than made up for the room size.",5,2017,11,07
105,Superb Service and Gracious Accommodations,"From the moment we arrived, we were greeted and treated warmly and with professionalism. The breakfast each morning in the restaurant provided us with energy and nourishment for a full day on the town.  Clearly, all on the staff care about their guests.",5,2017,11,07
105,Overnight stay,"We went to an event in Mayfair which was finishing late, we didn't want to leave our dog behind at home overnight, but thankfully Chesterfield accepts dogs.  We were very pleased with the location of the hotel (5 mins walk from the event), The room was very comfortable, even provided a bed for our dog and dinner/water bowls!  We would certainly stay at Chesterfield again. Breakfast was plentiful, attentive service. Staff friendly and helpful.",5,2017,11,07
105,"Hard to fault, exactly what you would expect from ths style of hotel...","The Chesterfield is a beautiful hotel, the service was excellent, the staff went out of their way to be helpful and it provided an excellent base for our visit to London from a great central location. The surroundings of leather seats, marble floors and oak panelling oozes quality and tradition and the breakfast was excellent.

If I had any criticism it would be that the room we stayed in wasn't huge, but it was still clean and comfortable all the same. 

Finally the room rate was very competitive and all in I would absoluelty recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a traditional hotel in the centre of London.",5,2017,11,06
105,Lovely English Hotel with Great Charm,"My recent stay at the Chesterfield was wonderful.  EVERYONE from the concierge to housekeeping to the wait staff in the dining room couldn't have been nicer.  The rooms have great charm, the food in the dining hall was excellent but really the staff  is what made our stay so nice.  Also, great location within walking distance to many restaurants and sites.",5,2017,11,06
105,Practically perfect - Staff is exceptionally kind and thorough,"We had a 3 night stay and thought the hotel exceptional. The room, staff and amenities were definitely all 5-star. The only downside was that the hotel seemed under-staffed. We booked tea one afternoon and once we were served, the 3 staff people entirely disappeared. There were only 5 other tables and it took us about 45 minutes to flag someone down to ask to have our hot water refreshed for tea. The water arrived another 45 minutes later. We contemplated at one point asking the piano player if he could find someone for us. On our way up to our room, we overheard the front desk clerk calling around to find someone to take a drink order for a group who had been waiting a very long time. Possibly they were short-staffed due to circumstances outside their control. Everything else was absolutely great.

Overall, this is a gorgeous hotel and should not be missed!",4,2017,11,06
105,Memories,"We have fond memories of visits to the Kensington from our past visits so we dropped by for a drink in the lobby piano bar late one evening and so this comment refers only to the bar area.   The place is just as we remembered it, cozy, old world and British.  London has changed much in the past 10 years, but classic English elegance can still be found here at the Kensington. There was a very charming gentleman on the piano which created an excellent ambiance for a late drink.  Our server Sabrina was engaging and friendly, contributing very much to more good memories here.",4,2017,11,05
105,Can't wait to return!,"My sister-in-law and I were there for a week with a group from Rhode Island, USA.  From beginning to end, we found the ambience, service, facilities, and food to be top-notch. Loved the red carnations in the lobby, in our rooms and on our breakfast trays. Look forward to returning here and also trying other Red Carnation hotels.",5,2017,11,04
105,london in october,"The Best London Hotel that I have experienced...
Very Clean and Comfortable...
Restaurant and Lounge excellent food, friendly and accommodating staff...
Very Professional and Friendly Staff...

105,A class Act at the Chesterfield,A great location on a quiet street and only a ten minute walk to Green Park underground close also for tour buses and a lovely walk through the park to either Westminster or Buckingham Palace. The rooms were were of a very high standard whilst the bar and restraunt displayed the same high standards food was excellent all the staff were friendly and helpful from the doorman to the desk management  a really relaxing break in a marvellous  hotel,5,2017,11,04
105,Wonderful birthday weekend!,"There was only one hotel where my wife wanted to celebrate her birthday and it was the Chesterfield. The weekend was wonderful and the hotel went out of their way to make everything special. The room was beautiful, the bar cosy with a pianist and the breakfasts amazing. The Chesterfield is classy throughout but the staff make it. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Patricia in particular was a delight going to great lengths to make my wife’s birthday memorable showing such care. Just a special hotel in a perfect location.",5,2017,11,03
105,Surprise birthday treat for my sister. ,"So I took my sister away to London for a surprise birthday treat at the end of August and I really wanted an extra special and pampering hotel as she was in the early stages of pregnancy. This hotel did not disappoint! We both absolutely loved it. Perfect location in London, all of the staff were so lovey, helpful and welcoming. They went above and beyond for us. It was the comfiest bed ever we wish we had booked extra nights. A truly lovely stay and we cannot wait to stay there hopefully very soon again. 

Sophie Bridle ",5,2017,11,03
105,Beautiful London Hotel,In a semi-quiet neighborhood.  Lovely hotel.  Kind people.  We felt as if we were being spoiled!  Amazing service!  Every need was catered to.  Bellman was fast each time to get us taxis.  Flowers in our room to welcome our first visit to London!,5,2017,11,01
105,Grumpy man,"This hotel is brilliant , lovely breakfast , plenty of everything to eat , staff couldnt do enough for you , comfy bedroom , everthing you need in room , nice and quiet , lovely bar , staff at desk paticularly ! Very helpfull .in a lovely area of london , would go back tmrw if i could , highly recommend :-):-):-)",5,2017,10,31
105,Amazing service!,"This is such a lovely hotel with the best people working there! We booked a car service from the airport through the hotel and were picked up in a gorgeous car by such a nice man (I wish I’d written down his name), which really set the tone for our stay. 

We got in a bit before check in time, but they watched our bags and sent us to the bar for a complimentary cocktail while we waited. While chatting with one of the employees, Giorgy, who’d been standing with our bags, I mentioned not being able to use my flat iron because of the voltage or something, and he had a converter brought up to our room by the time we got in! Then he went out of his way to say hello as we would pass through the lobby each day. He was awesome.

We paid ahead to have breakfast included with our room, and I highly recommend that. The breakfast area is lovely and they have a lot of items to choose from. They will do anything they’re able to in order to accommodate you. We loved our server, Carolina. She was so attentive and was able to juggle all of her tables with ease. We looked forward to sitting in her section. And she also got to know what we liked, as far as coffee, etc. She was just really kind and great at her job.  

Every employee we encountered was great and made it difficult to return home to the real world! We would absolutely stay there again next trip to London.",5,2017,10,30
105,Wonderful 95th birthday tea party for my mother!,"The staff at the Chesterfield were absolutely wonderful.  I cannot begin to tell you how helpful they were - I had the upmost confidence in them from the moment I arrived.
The room looked beautiful, the tea was delicious & it was very touching to have a last minute birthday cake provided.  Thank you so much to everyone!  
My mother had a very enjoyable time, as did all the guests (we had 35 for tea).
I will recommend The Chesterfield without hesitation & hope we have some other milestones to celebrate with you in the future.",5,2017,10,30
105,A welcoming return to a reliably civilized boutique hotel.,"My wife and I have stayed at the Chesterfield a number of times over the years and have returned, with pleasure.  This stay seemed marked by a particularly helpful staff in the restaurant.  No going through the motions - they clearly cared about the needs of their guests/diners.  We are not particularly ""high-maintenance""; however, one evening we had to be off to the theatre before we had the opportunity to indulge in dessert.  They kindly offered to have the desserts brought to the lounge upon our return - after the restaurant had closed for the evening.  Just another example of a spirit of genuine hospitality.  In addition - great location near Berkeley Square/Mayfair - our favorite haunts. Rooms are on the small side; however, this is in keeping with the European standard.  They are comfortable and well-appointed...not cramped.",5,2017,10,26
105,Quintessentially British,"An abundance of chintz attests to a quintessentially British hotel that only a South African owner could achieve with such remarkable success. Much loved by Americans, this hotel has a family feel with an exceptionally high level of service delivered with understated intimacy. In short, perfect.",5,2017,10,26
105,Should be five stars,"We have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair whenever we can while visiting London.  With each stay they seem to up the level of the facilities and their service.  We noticed improvements to our bathroom fixtures on this visit.  The staff have always been outstanding and that continues.  Housekeeping is immaculate.  Small touches like real cloth towels in the public restrooms and canapes delivered to a suite enhance the experience.  We need to make special mention of John Hudson who plays the piano most nights in the bar.  John plays ""standards"" with great style and keeps us coming back to the bar to enjoy a cocktail and his playing.  On our last visit a jazz night was added with John leading a quartet.  Breakfast continues to be a highlight of any stay at the Chesterfield.  The hotel's Mayfair location is an oasis of serenity in the busy city but just steps away from attractions like Buckingham Palace and public transportation at Green Park.  Shepherd Market is one block away and houses several very good restaurants as well as pubs.",5,2017,10,25
105,Afternoon tea ... splendid,"Last Sunday my two young daughters aged 9 and 5 took their mother for Afternoon Tea.

What a marvellous experience.

A warm welcome was followed up by an early round of popping candy cranberry drinks that were truly appreciated.

Then came the food ..... delicious and enticing.  I am more of a savoury person so loved the sandwiches which were ordered three times. The girls enjoyed their plates and given that they have a sweet tooth .... more like sweet jaws .... they even had more sandwiches. 

The patisserie went down a treat and the appreciation of my family was evident. 

The varieties of tea available was extensive. I recommend the Chesterfield Blend.

Service was impeccable. Neither intrusive nor invisible. We were asked if everything was ok, if we wanted anything more, our daughters were treated royally. 

We were also entertained by Willy Wonka who the girls loved. 

Afternoon Tea here caters very well for families, children are openly welcomed. The Butlers Room is wonderful and is perfect. 

I have read other reviews here and I am more than pleased to add my piece. And like many other reviewers we are going back!

Thank you Chesterfield for a lovely experience!!!!😀",5,2017,10,25
105,Perfect anniversary treat. Wonderful staff and lots of special treats!,"I treated my parents to a night at The Chesterfield for their 45th wedding anniversary. After having visited the Terrace Bar many times and enjoying impeccable service from the lovely staff, I knew it would be the perfect anniversary gift for them spend the night there. They were not disappointed. The Chesterfield offers all the little luxuries and attention to detail that you would expect from a hotel of this standard, all delivered by the most wonderful staff, who manage to achieve the perfect balance between being both professional and genuinely friendly. My parents were very warmly welcomed and really bowled over by all the special little treats they received over the course of their stay. They also enjoyed an excellent dinner and breakfast in Butlers Restaurant. We'd definitely recommend The Chesterfield as a home-away-from-home experience in a luxury Mayfair setting. Many thanks to all who helped to make it such a great stay!",5,2017,10,25
105,London 101,"First , London is an amazing metropolis. Mayfair is a terrific location and The Chesterfield is an absolutely great hotel. First class. very traditional. Everything from the front desk to the dining room to our room (706) was very proper and friendly. Sooooo clean. Loved getting the bed turned down at night.Great English breakfast. We had dinner in the Hotel one evening and it just seemed very special. Can't say enough about CM",5,2017,10,24
105,Great Hotel with a great staff,"We just spent five days at the Chesterfield.  London has  many nice hotels and the Chesterfield is definitely one of them.  What stands out for us is the staff throughout the hotel.  At the front desk, in the dining room to the staff who make up the rooms, they all make you feel truly welcome.  I would be remiss is I didn't single out James and Sabrina in the bar.  They do a great job and helped make our stay a delight.",5,2017,10,23
105,Impeccable service ,"Lovely stay with impeccable service and facilities fashioning a typically British traditional hotel. Location stands out in being close to great spots and offering a myriad of options for dining, cultural exhibitions and shopping, to name but a few, suiting different tastes and priorities. ",4,2017,10,23
105,Lovely afternoon tea,"Already arranging to go back! Food and service was lovely! Would definitely recommend especially if you have children, I have been to other London hotels who have children’s afternoon tea but this one is by far the best. The staff were lovely with the children and we felt that we were wanted there and I didn’t have to keep telling my daughter to be quiet all the time!  Food was lovely and staff kept bringing more and not making us feel bad for asking for more like in other places. 
Very friendly staff - excellent afternoon 

Thank you 😊 ",5,2017,10,21
105,Extremely run down and old fashioned,"The communal areas (reception, dining room and bar) are really tatty and tired.  The rooms are passable at best - small and a bit claustrophobic.  Even a supposed king bed wouldn't take two large people.  Breakfast OK, but staff a bit clueless.

Crazy money (ca.£300 per night) for what it is.  Only worth more like £150 per night.",2,2017,10,21
105,Delicious afternoon tea,"We had a party of eight for tea here and couldn't fault it. Staff were most attentive and friendly, the food was delicious- plenty of savoury sandwiches, freshly made; tasty cakes, and little extra surprises brought round from time to time. They catered for vegetarian, dairy-free and large appetites. As the plates emptied we were brought refills and the live piano created a very pleasant atmosphere. We were even given boxes to take home the sandwiches and cakes we hadn't managed to eat.",5,2017,10,21
105,Afternoon Tea,Three of us went here for afternoon tea. The hotel is very clean and smart with fabric in the walls. We were asked if any dietary requirements and they explained the teas and sandwiches. The sandwiches were lovely and we had extras with no problems. The tea was lovely with tea leaves and a strainer. We had four pots! The scones were nice and had chocolate scones as well. We were given extra cream. The cakes on top were different but tasty. Staff were very friendly and polite. We did not have to wait for anything. Nice touch was a golden ticket and gobstopper. Also it was nice that we were not rushed at all. Would return. ,5,2017,10,21
105,A little GEM,"We stayed for two nights recently whilst visiting some of the sites in London.What a find from arriving to leaving we encountered first class personal service and felt part of the hotel family and ""not just a guest"". Every member of staff or should I say team treated us as VIPs which is something that their competitors can learn from.
The room was comfortable and newly decorated and we enjoyed the tea/coffee making facilities in the room.
Breakfast was excellent with a tremendous choice of both hot and cold food. We did not have an evening meal in the hotel as we had been invited to the House of Commons for dinner but if the quality of the breakfast is an indicator we will do upon our next visit.
Thank you to all the team receptionists,concierge,waiters and not forgetting the room cleaning lady for making our stay memorable.
We will certainly stay here again when we next visit London. What a GEM.",5,2017,10,21
105,Lovely Hotel in Mayfair!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for 4 nights in September to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The staff was especially kind and courteous and went out of their way to make us feel welcome -- even sending up cupcakes and a card for our anniversary.  We stayed in an executive king room and although it was snug, there was room for everything and the bathroom was surprisingly large for an older hotel.  We did not eat in the restaurant, but did have a late dinner in the bar one evening and room service another.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  We especially enjoyed the pianist in the bar.  If we get a chance to return to London, the Chesterfield will be on the top of our list of places to stay.",5,2017,10,20
105,What a great find !,"We normally stay elsewhere when in Mayfair, but we thought we would try "" The Chesterfield"".

What a great find, the bar area is lovely, there was a pianist playing in the corner and was such a lovely ambiance. We did not eat as we were eating at another restaurant nearby.

The room was lovely and the staff are very helpful and warm. More of a personal touch than the big hotel chains.

We will definitely come here now when we stay in the area.",4,2017,10,20
105,Home away from home,"JUST returned from 5 excellent nights at The Chesterfield Hotel. The Hotel and its' welcoming charm is inviting enough but the staff - the entire staff -  makes you feel like you're coming home after a hard day of business or sightseeing. Their warmth makes it the perfect place to stay. James and Sabrina in the Bar area and Manuel in the dining room in the morning made a point to deliver their services with real personality. We love that! 
We hope to get back for another visit sooner than later.",5,2017,10,19
105,Wonderful Visit,"We spent four nights at The Chesterfield because the location was perfect to visit the sites we were interested in seeing. Mayfair is a wonderful neighborhood to browse around. But staying at the hotel was one of the best parts!  The bedding, the tub, the turn down service, the coffee press in the room...The service was the best I’ve ever experienced in a hotel. It was posh Old English but not stuffy. The staff was so available, friendly and helpful. The concierge provided us with all the information and help we needed to see the city. The lounge was so relaxing with a great pianist. It’s a lovely property very well maintained and I highly recommend it!!",5,2017,10,18
105,A hidden gem!,"This lovely hotel is tucked behind the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly and in the heart of Mayfair. It's a quiet, elegant and lovely place. The staff are polite, engaged, smiling and never stuffy or snobbish. Staying here you really feel like you are in an English hotel and not a corporate establishment. The restaurant was lovely and the food excellent. I can't wait to stay here again.",5,2017,10,17
105,Chesterfield Hotel the Best,"I stay at the Chesterfield Hotel at least twice a year...it's my first choice of a hotel to stay in when visiting London....there are many reasons for my choice, great safe location, food, all the wonderful employees that I come in contact with at every stay are what ensures my excellent vacation.......let's face it that's why I'm here!!!!!!",5,2017,10,17
105,First time stay,Great location and a wonderful staff. Very comfortable and classy without being too formal. Would stay there again for sure.Loved the breakfast and the room. We were in the Music Room. I understand that all the rooms are different.Very unique,5,2017,10,16
105,So good we decided to return ,We booked this hotel 2 months before our 4 week trip to the uk from Australia on check in everything was perfect nice room polite and friendly staff had 8 perfect nights great food and drinks in the bar listening to the fantastically good pianist playing in the bar so we decided to return for 3 nights in one of their beautiful suites before we flew back home and after a long drive back from Scotland to be greeted by the doorman by name by name welcoming us back then checking  in with the wonderfully understanding Roberta our bags sent to our room we are now sat back in the bar my wife hit the nail on the head when she said it’s like being back with your family with the wonderful waitress Sabrina serving us with her great wit and banter and perfect cocktails and food so looking forward to our 3 nights here will post final review when we return to Australia ,5,2017,10,14
105,Love this hotel,had a lovely stay at the Chesterfield.  Room couldn't have been better and the staff were terrific.  So friendly and helpful.  Great location as we walked everywhere we wanted to go.  Definitely recommend this hotel as a perfect spot in London.,5,2017,10,13
105,"Superior accommodations, incredible service!","This was our first visit to London, and I would absolutely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again. The rooms and accommodations were luxurious and well-maintained. On this trip we were celebrating our anniversary, and we entered our room to find a delightful anniversary dessert AND a card ACTUALLY SIGNED by the WHOLE STAFF!

We visited the hotel restaurant for breakfast every morning and for one three-course dinner. Every meal was excellent. We also had high tea here, which was overwhelmingly delightful and memorable. 

The staff was more than accommodating at every turn. They were helpful with recommendations, loaner outlet converters, and assistance at every opportunity. It was wonderful to be wholly and truly comfortable, and trusting that everyone is really interested in making sure all guests are comfortable! 

I really can't say enough; everything from the excellent location to the smiling staff to the fresh flowers in the bathroom felt like pieces of a puzzle that make the Chesterfield Mayfair the ideal choice.",5,2017,10,12
105,They know their trade. Great hotel,"This is a great hotel. Top service in all aspects. The details in the room are really appreciated. The restaurant is top quality. 
Only a detail with room 215 (firstassigned): is close to the air conditioning compressors. We requested a change in room that was inmediatelly made.",5,2017,10,11
105,Old world comfort and service,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is an ideally located classic hotel that emphasizes service and comfort. Our room was lovely, elegant and with a nice bathroom, the hotel itself was historical yet intimate, and the reception by the staff as well as the service is perfect. From check in to check out we felt taken care of and relaxed in this urban oasis. The only slight negative is the breakfast, but more because it didn't quite match the high class of the hotel as a whole rather than because it wasn't good. Altogether a very enjoyable experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for a smaller classic hotel in London for a more personal touch. ",5,2017,10,10
105,Best afternoon tea I think I've ever had !!,"Oh my god we had the best afternoon tea today! 
DEFINITELY recommend it: 

you start out with a little drink 🍹 cranberry soda n popping candy! Then you can chose which set you want, we got the non-champagne one which is FREE FLOW of tea ☕️ AND food 🍰(sandwiches scones and a ton of cakes). & at the end the waiter (who was super friendly) makes you pic a ""golden ticket"" which is a secret prize (anything from a discount there to a night's stay at the hotel!) n gives you free gobstoppers 😋 all that for 38£. Which I think is quite affordable considering it was like ""open bar"" of food n tea! 

Check out my photos @christelleeex on IG ! ",5,2017,10,09
105,"Great service, lovely hotel","We stayed here for 4 nights in September and it was nothing short of fantastic. This is a hotel that knows how to make their guests happy. We loved the location in Mayfair, it was close to everything we needed including the tube. The service was faultless, right down to the sanitised tv remote! On our last day here we indulged in the hotel's willy wonka themed afternoon tea and it was the perfect finish to our stay. Add on to this the fantastic concierge who had our taxi to the airport waiting, and we pretty much floated out of the hotel. It was the perfect end to our trip.",5,2017,10,09
105,Lee and Mary Lou We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived.,"We are in the hotel/restaurant business for over 40 years and travel frequently. We were impressed with the quality of service, overall cleanliness and the friendly atmosphere of the hotel. It exceeded expectations you would expect from a downtown boutique, classic four star hotel. We had the opportunity to use the restaurant and lounge  which also exceeded expectations for a fine dining establishment. On the Gin and Jazz night we ate off the lounge menu, had featured drinks and thoroughly enjoyed the jazz group. The hotel location is within easy walking distance to the city buses, the subway and the step on-step off tour buses. We felt safe in this neighborhood. Can't wait for a return trip!",5,2017,10,07
105,Felt unwelcome.,"This was our eighth trip to Europe & we chose this hotel based primarily on the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. Sadly, we can not say we had the same experience. We arrived on Sunday at about 0930 hrs., after a long overnight flight. Our room was not ready & we did not expect it to be. However, we were hopeful because so many people had said they had gotten in their rooms upon early arrivals. We left the hotel & returned at about 1400 hrs. We were told that we had been given a free room upgrade, which was very nice. The room was very nice, however, the shower was challenging. I am only 6'1"" but the shower head came to the middle of my forehead. In order to take a shower, I had to crouch down & twist my body to rinse off. Try doing this seven days in a row. The hotel is in a perfect location, close to everything. We used the bar & the service was excellent, as were the drinks & food. We did not eat at the restaurant.

Now for the bad part. Upon check-in, we were asked if we wanted a daily newspaper. We said that we did. We were told we would have a copy of the Times delivered each day. We were there for seven days & received exactly zero newspapers. Please don't tell me that I should have called the front desk. It is not my responsibility to chase your employees around to get them to keep their promises. On each of the first two nights, we returned to find that our room keys had been de-activated. We had to go back down six floors to get someone to re-activate them. One time is a mistake. Twice is a pattern. On another occasion, even though we had left our wet, dirty towels in the bath tub, as directed, we came back to find that housekeeping had hung our still wet, dirty towels, on the towel rack for us to re-use. We had to call down to get fresh towels brought up.

These are mistakes that can be excused as human error. What can not be excused as human error is the rude, condescending looks we were given daily by both staff & guests. Let me be clear. We have stayed in five star hotels all over the world. We can afford to stay anywhere we choose. This is not bragging. It is merely meant to stress my point. We don't dress to impress. We dress for comfort. Which means, jeans, sneakers, etc. Because we don't dress like we can afford to stay in five star hotels, apparently your staff & other guests assumed that we didn't belong there. When we would come & go each day, no one from the staff as much as said ""hello"". They would glance at us & look away when we caught them staring. We found we received the same quizzical looks from the other hotel guests who were gathered in the lobby. It got so bad that by the third day we stopped using the main door by the front desk & started going in & out of the door in the rear of the lobby so we could go directly to the elevators. The final straw occurred mid week. We returned to the hotel, after dark, & walked downstairs to the business center to check our e-mail. One of the front desk employees ran out from behind the desk & down the stairs to see what we were doing. When he saw us on the computer, he changed directions & went the other way. This was so insulting, that had we not paid the full week in advance we would have checked out & gone to another hotel.

Under the category of ""adding insult to injury"", during the week we noticed that other guests had received pastries marked ""bon voyage"" on their last nights. We did not. Was this an oversight? I don't know. 

The bottom line is that we will not be returning to your hotel. And we will not recommend it to anyone who asks.",3,2017,10,06
105,The country in London,"Obviously in London one has a wide choice of hotels, ranging from the rancid to the one-percenter class, but if you love the glorious country house hotels scattered across the English countryside, then the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel should be the place for you.  It has that impeccable polite service, the quietude, and luxurious ambiance redolent of a by-gone age.  Alternatively, one could imagine you are staying in a private club that has retained all of its original flavor and mood.  

Of particular appreciation should be its location, nestled in the stillness of Mayfair (adjacent to the Saudi Embassy no less, but hopefully not a turn-off) yet just a lovely short walk to the bustle of Piccadilly Street.  After a day of steaming around the rather mind-boggling commotion and excitement of London, it is so refreshing to return to the calm of the Chesterfield neighborhood - a detox zone.

The Red Carnation Group (owners) have gone to great lengths to make every aspect of the hotel inviting, relaxing, and elegant but without stuffiness or the tiredness of lesser hotels seeking the same atmosphere.  The premises have an interesting aristocratic history and that can be felt even with the conversion to a hotel, with floors that sometimes creak, and hallways on different elevations.  It feels like old London, not some polished corporate vision of what a grand hotel should reflect.  

The rooms, and I assume ours was representative, are beautifully furnished, containing every amenity and extras one could hope to find in a five star hotel.  The bed was superb and the ventilation service was fully modern and functional.  It was a room to live in, not just sleep.  

Similar attention was paid to the public rooms, from the embracing bar to the restaurant and lobby.  Mind you, though, there is no grand lobby; rather a exceedingly comfortable, lovingly decorated area that sets the tone for the remainder of the hotel.

Staff at all levels were attentive, helpful, and provided unintrusive yet prompt service.  no matter the calling.  One felt welcomed and appreciated, from the room attendants, to the general manger Mr. Lake.  

The Chesterfield is the place to return to again and again.  Thanks to all for making our stay so delightful.",5,2017,10,05
105,Week End Break,"My Wife and I had a short stay in London and Stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel and absolutely  no regrets Staff all was very pleasant, Food was good bar had a good feel to it  good selection of drinks beer wines ect",4,2017,10,04
105,Weekend in london,Visited London for the weekend staying in the wonderful chesterfield hotel.  The staff were brilliant big shout to James in the bar and the wonderful loris in the restaurant what a star he was. Good food lovely staff gorgeous hotel .,5,2017,10,03
105,Charlie and The Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea,"A truly fantastic experience from the minute we entered to the minute we left! We were 2 ladies and 4 girls aged 8-12 for some very special celebrations and we couldn't have picked a better place! The service was faultless, in fact we were looked after so well and made to feel very special. We were spoilt for choice with the variety of teas and milkshakes - ofcourse a glass of champagne whilst choosing helps! The cakes and sandwiches were delicious - with such an array and plentiful in quantity. The hotel has a very traditional British ambiance and decor and we felt very indulged, however it was such great value for money! Have recommended it to so many people and we will be back ourselves!",5,2017,10,02
105,One very fine hotel,"Stayed here for just over a week and absolutely no regrets - a truly great hotel. Location is a two minute walk from Berkley Square and a 7 or 8 minute walk to Green Park tube station so good spot for exploring London. Room was most comfortable with all the typical amenities plus a few others (the coffee press produced one great cup of coffee). One point  of note was the fact that even though this is an old property , the temperature control in the room was first rate. Staff were helpful and responded very quickly to a couple of requests that we had - no other property has come even close to the response speed we observed here. There were also a number of little surprises during our stay such as fresh cookies one evening that made this hotel stand out.
Regrettably we did not find the dining room, only used for breakfast, to be equal to the remainder of the property. Overall it was ok but just did not excel the way the remainder of the property did although oatmeal with a shot of whiskey was a good way to start the day!
Certainly a first rate sport worth strong consideration for a stay in London.",5,2017,10,01
105,Wonderful hotel!,"Our first trip to London and we picked a nice hotel in a good location. Small rooms, but comfy beds and cushy slippers were a plus. There is complimentary bottled water in the room as well. The bathroom is small as well, but clean. The buffet breakfast was very good. The pancakes and waffles weren't up to american standards, but the staff went out of their way to get you anything you wanted. (see picture of scrambled eggs :-) It's in a good location as well, although you will need to catch a cab to a lot of the sights. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,10,01
105,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,My sister in law took me for afternoon tea for my birthday and it was absolutely fantastic. We arrived a little early but they took us straight through to our table. The service was attentive and we felt very well looked after. The food was wonderful and we were offered extra sandwiches that went down a treat. And special shout out to Lois for making me feel really special on my birthday :-D,5,2017,10,01
105,Excellent hotel in Mayfair,"This is the perfect small hotel in Mayfair. It is close to Shepard's Market and we could walk to most attractions and shopping. The decor is lovely and very English.  It has an excellent restaurant, a cosy bar with piano entertainment and jazz nights and a lovely room for tea.   Our junior suite was comfortable and fully equipped.  The staff is outstanding and very eager to help you.  A gem of a hotel!!",5,2017,09,30
105,Elegant and Reasonable London Hotel Close to everything,"The location was close to restaurants within walking distance all with different types of foods. Very close the main attractions a short Black Cab trip away.  The Mayfair area is opulent and very nice and safe. Hop on and Off was close by to do the city tours.

The boutique hotel had a very nice restaurant, and the lobby very pretty and staff  and 
attentive. Very old fashion English style.

The room we chose was priced in the middle and was set up very nice, as always a little smaller than US hotel rooms. But perfect. Room services was excellent.",5,2017,09,29
105,Afternoon tea ,"A group of 8 friends and I attended the Chesterfield for afternoon tea. We had unfortunately lost a few of our group but the restaurant staff accommodated us without any problems. 
The staff were very attentive and couldn't have done any more for us. We weren't rushed and had a wonderful time. 
The small touches really made the afternoon. 
Thank you Chesterfield 
We'll be back  ",5,2017,09,29
105,Classy and friendly,"We stayed here after a cruise to see the sights of London.  It is located in a quiet neighborhood,close to some shops, restaurants and pubs.  We could walk to Hyde Park and Westminster Abbey. The food in the hotel restaurant was very good.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.",5,2017,09,29
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair is a gem in the lovely Mayfair section of London!,"My husband & I recently celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at the lovely Chesterfield Mayfair! It's a quaint boutique style hotel situated on a quiet street in Mayfair. The location is ideal for touring on foot as we did all the major attractions in central London. However one could easily take a cab or use the Tube to get around. The staff go out of their way to accommodate guests and are always pleasant and friendly. We especially enjoyed being greeted every morning by a most gracious Miss Laura Stone, who showed us to our table. She is such a lovely person and we enjoyed our conversations with her each day. You really can't go wrong with this hotel! The staff pride themselves on being attentive to their guests! ",5,2017,09,28
105,Our Favorite in London,"Will return here with pleasure. Great service, restaurant, bar, live jazz piano, and a great location. You can walk to some great pubs and restaurants as the area is in a very cool historic zone. The nearby square has some excellent restaurants and a feel of Olde Europe. A four night stay wish could have been longer.",5,2017,09,26
105,Elegance,"A delightful, small hotel in a quiet neighborhood. The furnishings were lovely and comfortable.  The Chesterfield was quiet and welcoming.  Very nice staff and helpful as well.  A definite to stay here again.",5,2017,09,24
105,Afternoon tea,Fantastic afternoon tea and service ..nothing was too much trouble for the very attentive staff ..teas were lovely as were the sandwiches cakes sorbets and fruit..I'm vegan was catered for lovely..it would have been that little bit extra special if there had been a cake or pastry on offer ..the surroundings are lovely ..we thoroughly enjoyed and would definately recommend ,5,2017,09,24
105,Amazing Willy Wonka Experience,"These guys could not have been more accommodating, pleasant, or amazing. My six year old daughter is really into all things Charlie and Willy Wonka at the moment. We missed the normal operating hours for the tea service, and when I called they set up a special service for us off hours! Eryk and the manager could not have been more fun, attentive, or sweet from when we walked in until we left. They gave her the absolute special treatment. We had a little incident with my daughter mixing fizzy lifting drinks and a milkshake, and they cleaned up, did not skip a beat, or get frustrated. 

Definitely will come again and recommend.",5,2017,09,24
105,Wedding night heaveb,"Thank you to all the staff at The Chesterfield for making our wedding night so special. Despite a little confusion over the booking to begin with, every guest attending our wedding was treated like royalty and the rooms were stunning. We were upgraded to the Stanhope Suite for our wedding night which is a fantastic and beautiful room. Even the Junior Suite I stayed in the evening before was large in size and stunning. Breakfast was lovely and as an aside the afternoon tea (which we had a few weeks previously) is well worth it! Endless tasty food and lovely tea. Thank you!",5,2017,09,24
105,Unforgetable family weekend ,We decided to celebrate our round birthday in a special way to have a special memories about it. Staying in Chesterfield hotel was the best chois and we all had enjoyable time and memories for life. All the staff made us to feel that it was a special day for us by decorating our beautiful room and singing birthday song for us in the restaurant. We even had a unexpectet birthday cake. Special thanks to Loris. Excellent service and very friendly and higly professional staff. Without doubd the bedst hotel we stayed in.,5,2017,09,23
105,Quaint and great location,"Spent a night in hotel and will return.  Old world charm, lively but sophisticated bar and comfortable bed. Definitely one of Londons better hotels.

I only stayed one night and didn't eat breakfast so can't comment further.  Next time !!",4,2017,09,22
105,THE BEST HOTEL,"The service was impeccable. The food was delicious - lovely breakfast, lovely afternoon tea, lovely room service. The hotel itself is gorgeous, classy, and stylish and is located right in the middle of the best part of London. Staying there was something I will have to repeat before too long because it was just too nice. Highly highly recommend!",5,2017,09,18
105,Simply First Class,"The Chesterfield is simply first rate, all the way. It is old world British charm with impeccable service. It is a Doorman that is Johnny on the spot to open the door and ask if you need anything. It is a helpful and friendly Front Desk Staff that addresses you by name....always. It is a bar where the Servers and Bartenders wear suit and tie and the Piano Player is wearing a Tux. My wife and I forgot some valuable jewelry that we discovered missing upon or return to the US. I called the hotel and Head Concierge Darren went above and beyond to retrieve these pieces and assure that they would be Fed Ex express to us. First rate service!!
The rooms are a good size and well appointed, bathrooms also good enough size with nice amenities. Only small issue, it is an older hotel so the rooms to pick up some noise from the surrounding areas.
The hotel is located in Mayfair which is a wonderful location. Very upscale neighborhood with some local Pubs and restaurants within five minute walk.Green Park Tube station just 5 minute walk. Buckingham Palace short scenic walk through the park. Major attractions of Big Ben, Westminster 15-20 minute walk away. Bond Street shopping 10 minutes away.
It is rare for me to say this but this Hotel is simply a must stay. DO NOT HESITATE TO BOOK THERE!",5,2017,09,16
105,Perfect End to England Trip,"Hotel is wonderfully decorated with modern amenities. Location is a short walk from Green Park station as well as a lovely walk through said park to Buckingham Palace. Staff were exceptional and accommodating. I booked the Gin & Tonic Experience with James, and I must say it was the highlight of the trip with his knowledge, guidance through the tastings, and humor. Additionally, listening to the pianist John throughout the night was a treat. The rest of the bar staff were equally friendly, so my partner and I were always looking forward to an evening of drinks back at the hotel - our temporary home away from home.",5,2017,09,13
105,Afternoon Delights,We took our tween/teen daughters here for their very first London tea. They loved it. The food was overwhelmingly delicious and the girls and our family couldn't have been happier. No request was too big and we stuffed ourselves silly. Our next London trip will include tea at the Chesterfield. One special note: one of our party is a vegan and they were very accommodating to our requests!,5,2017,09,12
105,Nice relaxing weekend in a lovely Hotel,"It was birthday weekend, and chose the Chesterfield Mayfair, what a charming hotel in an oasis of London, the staff were friendly and helpful , our keycard didn't work and immediately the receptionist was up to our room to sort it out, before this when checking in it was mentioned in conversation that it was my birthday..""happy birthday was the reply"", thought nothing of it after, then when arriving back to our room in the evening was small cake with fork on a plate with 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' written in chocolate on the plate rim and a card signed by all the staff!!!!!...what a lovely thing to do, thank you so much!!! it made my lovely weekend  even better.....we will be back!!!!",5,2017,09,11
105,Home away from home.,"The hotel is very beautiful, the rooms are very clean, and the restaurant is delightful.  But what sets the Chesterfield apart is the service.  Everyone treats you so special that I thought maybe they had me confused with someone else. The longer your stay, the more difficult it will be to check out.  So make sure you come back often.  We were made to feel as if we owned the place.   Thank you Chesterfield staff!
",5,2017,09,10
105,Quaint old small English hotel,"A friend of my sister recommended this hotel, we love it. The staff do everything that's possible to fulfill your demands, quiet out of the way location. But it is walking distance to my attractions, it is just off the main streets. The restaurant is first class and the lounge is also staffed by the friendliest staff. Loris the restaurant Manager was great when we had dinner and the food excellent.",5,2017,09,09
105,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Visited here with my daughter for afternoon tea. The setting is very tranquil.  The staff in the restaurant and in the hotel itself were courteous and helpful creating a relaxing atmosphere. The sandwiches, cakes and scones were beautifully presented and very tasty. There was an extensive choice of drinks too. A lovely experience.",5,2017,09,09
105,Lovely hotel ," A very nice hotel with nice decorations touch
The room is a little small as well the bathroom but i general this is most of London city center but of course not all..

I stayed y for 2 nights. Well i like the hotel and it's recommended.",5,2017,09,06
105,"At The Chesterfield Mayfair you are treated as a valued guest, in a classic and classy high-end British hotel...","The Chesterfield Mayfair is THE hotel to stay at if you're after a classic and classy high-quality very British hotel in the most central yet quiet location in London. Here, you are treated as a valued guest and not just another number passing through. The highest standards in every aspect of the hotel's operation is their aim, and they more than succeed. Nothing is too small an issue for them to be concerned. All of the staff are exemplary in their manner, kindness and politeness. The rooms are beautiful, elegant, classically modern and fitted-out to provide every convenience, and they are always spotless. I've now stayed here for the past seven years and will stay at no other hotel in London. It's one of those very rare hotels that really does become your home away from home.

Charles Street runs off the bottom of Berkeley Square, and so the location is within easy walking distance to all of central London's attractions ... Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and the shops of Knightsbridge, such as Harrods, in one direction, Buckingham Palace in another, Piccadilly and the theatre district and shops such as Fortnum & Mason in another, and the shopping precincts of Regent and Oxford Streets with high end retailers such as Selfridges in another. You are right in the middle of everything, and can walk without worrying about public transport or taxis. And in just a couple of minutes walk you will find cafes and pubs, such as those in quaint Shepherd Market or on tranquil Berkeley Square.",5,2017,09,06
105,Birthday Celebrations ,"Have stayed in here in the past and as always been blown away by the service. You are not just treated as a guest but as a member of the family from the welcome at reception by Roberta, to Jade and James in the bar. Even the Good Morning greetings by House Keeping make it truly special. We don't like to rave too much about this place as we like to keep it all to ourselves. We were recently introduced to the General Manager Adam who made us very welcome with my card in the room and a cupcake and a birthday message. We look forward to our next visit. ",5,2017,09,05
105,Never Staying Anywhere Else!,"Everything about the Chesterfield is brilliant. My husband and I couldnt have asked for a better second wedding anniversary. The staff was kind, helpful, and sincere; multiple people signed an anniversary card for us with the loveliest wishes, and we received a gift of sweets when we returned to the hotel after an evening out. 

It took me a very long time to find a hotel that was well situated and that didn't break the bank. The Chesterfield delivered on all accounts. It sits on a quiet street in Mayfair, but is only a few blocks in either direction from the bustle of Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace Gardens, Green Park, Hyde Park, Wellington Arch, and Berkeley Square. Best of all, it is a 5-10 minute walk to Green Park tube station, where you can pick up main lines to other London sights (i.e., the Victoria Line, the Jubilee Line, and the Piccadilly Line). It is one stop away from Baker Street and the Sherlock Holmes Museum; one stop from Westminster, Parliament, Big Ben, and the London Eye; one stop from Embankment Pier, where we picked up a fantastic jazz dinner cruise on the Thames; and one stop to Victoria Station and the Apollo Theatre. It is easy to reach from many of the train stations, but we ordered a taxi to take us to King's Cross rather than fight rush-hour tube traffic. 

The hotel itself is decorated in rich colors and patterns - reds, deep blues, rich greens, paisely, stripes, and gold - and the temperature control in the room worked wonderfully. 
Each hallway, floor, and room has a distinct personality. There is a small glass cabinet with lovely jewelry (much of it vintage-looking and gorgeous) heading to the restaurant. The bar was open late and produced wonderful cocktails to close out the evening. We were not able to try the restaurant, but it was a struggle to leave each morning with the delicious smells wafting down the downstairs hallway. That said, we ordered a late meal from room service and the chips were to die for! The bed in our room was large, and the mattress was firm and comfortable. The bathroom was bright; the water pressure was spot-on; and the floor was heated. 

We felt so well cared for at the Chesterfield, and I was sad to leave after two nights. We cannot wait to return!",5,2017,09,04
105,Lovely stay,"We chose to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair for our first trip to London.  It was simply wonderful.  The room was a bit smaller than we are used to, but it was spotless and very comfortable.  The staff can't be beat.  Everyone we interacted with was efficient, helpful, and personable.  The location was perfect for sightseeing ",5,2017,09,04
105,Exceeded expectations,"This was a 5 star service experience from the moment of arrival!  Charlie at the front desk was efficient during check-in and very patient when answering our questions.  Bellman Adrian brought our bags up to the room.  He took the time to explain the room features and amenities.  Great start!  Hotel is in a good location within walking distance of Buckingham Palace.  Our booking through Costco included daily breakfast and a dinner voucher.  A gentleman named Loris is the Restaurant Manager.  He and his staff provided OUTSTANDING service!  Interacting with Loris and his team of professionals made us feel like English royalty!!!  The food was excellent and we especially enjoyed the cobb salad and honeycomb vanilla ice cream.  Dinner service was a bit slow during our first night, so Loris offered us a free entrée if we decided to return the following evening.  We did and had a great experience.  When Loris delivered the bill for my signature, I noticed that we were charged for all items except the entrée. I asked about this and Loris explained that the dinner voucher is only good for the first night.  This was clearly my fault as I did not read the information correctly.  At check-out Charlie explained that the hotel decided to credit back part of our dinner and room service expenditures due to the voucher misunderstanding.  This generous offer only served to reinforce our positive experience.  We will definitely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair during future visits to London!!!",5,2017,09,04
105,Overnight stay,We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for one night before we went to Paris for a long weekend. So reviewing it is pretty hard as it's only 12 or so hours we actually stayed. But overall it was very clean and the staff were extremely helpful and polite. ,4,2017,09,04
105,OMG build me a permanent room here please,This is home away from home.  Just fabulous all go round.  They were so accommodating and the service far outweighs any hotel in London.  Forget the Ritz- stay here!  Everything is so beautiful; so perfect.  Price is nothing when you search for that perfect stay to make your holiday wonderful.,5,2017,09,03
105,"Great location, wonderful stay","Hotel was in a great location, only a short walk to Green Park Station. Not far from a great selection of restaurants and bars. Room was perfect size, amenities also excellent. Staff very friendly and willing to answer any questions. ",5,2017,09,03
105,London Gem for Comfort & Service,"Well, I've found my London home.  The staff is attentive, helpful and friendly (front desk - hello Malvina).  My well-appointed room was ready in the morning when I arrived and large.  Here's what you need to know:  get the breakfast included because it is lovely (smoked salmon, avocado toast and whatever you want from the menu).  It is close to great shopping (Fortnum & Mason, Cath Kidston's largest store). Be sure to walk through the park to Buckingham Palace around dusk - it is magical.  This will be my London home.",5,2017,09,02
105,Stunning Hotel with outstanding service,"High expectations being a Red Carnation hotel and they certainly lived up to all expections. The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood with lovely pubs close by and close walking distance to Buckingham Place and then a bit of a walk onto Westminster Bridge and Big Ben. 
The rooms may be a little smaller to what I'm used to but with BIG personality. I just love the traditional feel of this Hotel and most of all the staff attention to detail and the little touching you have throughout your stay make it all seem less and making you feel so special. 
Breakfast is beautiful and special and again the staff we just wonderful and the turn down service was very cute and special. 
Thank you for my wonderful experience and setting expectations so high for other hotels I will stay at in the future.",5,2017,09,01
105,Best boutique hotel in London,"From the moment you arrive you are treated like an important guest by a very friendly and professional staff who are eager to assist. In particular the front desk manager was outstanding. The rooms in general are very small, but we had a suite which was extremely comfortable, clean and well appointed. The selection at breakfast, which was included, was excellent and of good quality. Afternoon tea in the conservatory was a special treat.(Unless you are really hungry ask for the Devon tea which is more modest in quantity and price). Dinner was as good as it gets, especially the Dover Sole. The staff is well trained, efficient and skilled.  If you like fish and chips the hotels rendition was exceptional. 
We highly recommend this hotel and note that at present if you stay for 3 nights you only pay for two!",5,2017,09,01
105,Afternoon Tea,"What can I say? This is our second visit and it never fails to disappoint. I think it gets better and better. Staff are so helpful and polite. The food is absolutely amazing! The milkshakes are to die for. My children enjoyed their Charlie and the chocolate style afternoon tea very much. I have an egg allergy and they catered so well for me. I was so happy. I've been to a lot of afternoon teas in London and half the time they don't cater for me. This is definitely one of the best. I can't fault the food or service, my husband enjoyed it too. As we were ready to go, the waiter asked if the children wanted to take some wonka bars home! What a lovely treat. We will definitely be back. Thank you all for making our family day so enjoyable. ",5,2017,08,31
105,Post Cruise,"Great character old world charm Hotel with superb staff. Conveniently located in Mayfair, close to some great restaurants and minutes from Buckingham Palace.  Staff treats all guest like royalty, and beyond expectations in making our stay wonderful.  This is what all Hotels should be like!!!!",5,2017,08,30
105,Utterly charming & immaculate!,"This was our 2nd time at the Chesterfield and we literally wouldn't stay anywhere else. We stayed in the African suite with our daughter in an adjoining double room in our own little alcove. Both rooms different but utterly charming! The hotel is lovely...a step back in time. Everyone is so helpful. You can't stand still for 30 seconds without someone asking to assist you. The bar is just gorgeous and so welcoming. And the bartenders, Freddy and Finacra are so personal....they remember your preferences, sociable and are eager to help. The entire hotel is immaculate and totally up to date. Our bath even had a whirlpool. Any needs in your room are solved literally in minutes. Centrally located and close to the tube. If you want personalized service and a haven from the hustle of London, this is the hotel where you'll be happy.",5,2017,08,29
105,In the Middle,"I often stay in London and like to try out different hotels. I would say this hotel is fairly good value for money. 

When I stayed most guest were American Tourists which added a little to the bar scene at night

If you book, make sure your room in on the upper floors and not an inward facing room. 

Staff were great, room in good shape. Overall a good middle priced hotel",4,2017,08,29
105,Old charm,"It's so convenient - in the middle of Mayfair - what else you can ask for.! It offers a real old world charm , like ""step back in time "". 
I love the lobby, the atmosphere there is so nice that I actually spent some time sitting there and watching ppl coming and going..
Malvina at the reception desk was exceptionally helpful!",5,2017,08,29
105,good hotel,"Stayed at this hotel in a suite for one night and found it to be very nice the staff were friendly and helpful the location is spot on for everything a person wants on visiting London breakfast was very good and plentiful. I had one gripe about the room I stayed it is thatthe shower cubicle is really quite small which is a shame compared with the rest of luxury around you, would i stay here again yes I would have no problem staying here again.",4,2017,08,28
105,Old world comfortable hotel in the quiet part of the West End,"We stayed at The Chesterfield for 3 nights as part of a 70+ group visit, so the hotel was chosen for us by the organisers. We were very glad it was. Whilst a lot smaller than the bigger names and ritzier reputation hotels around the corner on Park Lane, The Chesterfield held some real olde world charm for us. It's location is adjacent to Shepherds Market and close to a number of old English Pubs serving real ale. There was also a brace of smaller restaurants that would not usually attract tourist trade. All good reasons for splashing out upwards of 250 pounds a night for the privilege of staying there.

The best points I remember about The Chesterfield were the top hatted doorman - once he know our faces he would be at the ready with a greeting, opening the door for us and assisting with luggage in and out as well as  local directions. The Gin Experience at the bar - they were too busy to do it for me as it needs time to taste and savour the 3 types in a suite of different gins with their explanations. However I was not to be disappointed as I just bought 2 of the 3 and had my own tasting session without the guidance of the bar staff.

The bed was comfortable - no complaints there and the tea making facilities were excellent too. The free Wifi that worked well, a desk and office type chair all made it easy for me to catch up with my emails and check out our day trips to The V&A Museum, a London Walk from Picadilly Circus, the Borough Markets area and of course an early morning walk around Hyde Park after breakfast.

All in all we loved it and, should we ever return to England and include a weekend in London, The Chesterfield would be on the top of my list and damn the expense!",5,2017,08,27
105,Afternoon tea,"One word....WOW!!! What an experience for children and big children alike! The food was amazing, lovely to have different sandwiches to the usual afternoon teas elsewhere and the cakes and scones were delicious and you could tell the inspiration from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Great to be able to ask for more when the plate was empty! The children's afternoon tea was also a wow factor and my kids were delighted! Service was fun and attentive and nothing was too much for the great waiters and waitresses, my children absolutely loved the little sweetie extras that kept being given! I would totally recommend for families and couples (adults with a sense of fun and wanting an experience would definitely love this!). Worth every penny and some!!",5,2017,08,26
105,Excellent ,"Stayed here for two nights as part of my Mum's 75th Birthday celebrations.  A handwritten card and decorated cupcake was delivered to our room which was a nice touch.

The hotel is in a great location with a traditional feel to it but what sets it apart is the excellent level of customer service.  
All of the staff we met made us feel very welcome and were attentive and friendly.

We dined in the restaurant and the food, service and ambience were faultless.
The bar had plenty of choice and the complimentary nibbles were lovely.

Our room was quiet and very comfortable.  Room service was good and housekeeping immaculate.

We had to wait for 10 minutes to be seated for breakfast on the second morning of our stay but aside from this, breakfast was excellent; great choice and service.

I'd particularly like to recommend the doormen and concierge who were all so very pleasant and helpful.

The good reviews are well deserved and if you are looking for a relaxing, friendly hotel that makes guests feel special then this is the place to go!",5,2017,08,24
105,"Wonderful stay in a beautiful, comfortable, historic hotel","My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel in August 2017 and it was fabulous.  What makes this hotel special is the staff, who are without exception gracious, accommodating, and incredibly effective.  The room was beautifully appointed, our room looked out onto a very quiet street, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was just right.  The bar is lovely; we had lunch there with some friends one day, and drinks at night. In the evening there was a wonderful pianist... the music was fun and at a level where we could comfortably carry on a conversation.  Downstairs, the lobby is lovely, with a very authentic, historic feel.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone  and would be thrilled to stay there again.",5,2017,08,24
105,Holiday in London stay,"Fantastic hotel. Can't say enough about the staff. They were attentive, responsive and always there with a smile and helping hand.

Perfect smaller hotel, our room was well appointed, extremely clean and above all quite. The air conditioner was so quite you forget it's on. 

We eat breakfast every morning, delightful after the first day we looked forward to seeing the restaurant staff. Afternoon tea was just as delightful.

Highly recommend  ",5,2017,08,24
105,Simply divine,"One of the best hotels we’ve stayed in, if not the best.

The bar snacks are great, I loved the Popcorn Chicken; especially with a Breakfast Martini.

The restaurant is truly great, the food is fresh and the staff could not do more to help.  I would recommend the Sole Meuniere.

Being in Mayfair, it’s easy to get to all the places you need to see.  We love to walk, however if you want a Taxi the hotel will shout one down for you.

The hotel room we had was well furnished exactly as you would expect.  We took breakfast in the room every day and as far as I know at no extra cost.",5,2017,08,23
105,100% Delightful,"We recently spent seven nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and every moment was wonderful. The Mayfair neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. The hotel seems old-fashioned in a good way, which we loved, but not ""old."" We ate dinner at Butler's Restaurant one evening and it was really delicious and the service was impeccable. Every morning we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast which was both items from the buffet as well as any menu items we desired. Very generous and everything was delicious. We regretted not checking out the afternoon tea in the dining room, but ran out of time unfortunately.

The rooms are very elegant and old-fashioned (again, in a good way) and unique, as opposed to a cookie cutter room in a chain hotel. There was complete and complimentary tea service with both tea and coffee, milk, cookies, tea kettle, etc. As well, there was complimentary bottles of water restocked each day. I could go on and on.

The people working at the front desk bent over backwards to make sure our needs were met.

Just can't say enough about the hotel, its service, and the neighborhood. Highly recommended!",5,2017,08,22
105,Celebration,"My wife and I have just returned from celebrating our Ruby Wedding Anniversary with family and friends at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  We have stayed at four of the Red Carnation Hotels in recent years and always found that they provide exceptional service which we appreciate.  We chose to celebrate at The Chesterfield Mayfair because of the location and the wonderful reception we received from the events team when we visited to see their conference rooms.  We planned the event with Kornelia, the Events Sales Executive, who was most helpful and professional with her advice.  

We had done all our planning but it is up to the hotel’s team to make the event work and it did superbly.  We had a Champagne Reception with canapés in the Library where we viewed a short movie, which Alex and his team were most helpful with, before they took us to the Charles Suite for the Dinner.  There were 31 guests, ranging in age from 3 to, like us, 60+, and everyone was beautifully looked after during the evening and thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food.  We could not be more pleased with the celebration and the response of all the guests to the hotel and its staff.

We are so pleased that we chose The Chesterfield Mayfair.  All the Red Carnation Hotels are wonderful but our special night could not have been any better and we are so grateful.   Thank you to everyone involved especially Kornelia for the planning and Alex and his team for the night itself.",5,2017,08,22
105,Great find given the many choices available.,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield last week with our elder son, his wife and two young children (7&5), during a trip to see the Lion King,
All of the staff were exceptional, friendly and helpful and the attention to detail for our grandchildren was superb (special bedding with teddy logos, special bathrobes with logos, teddy on the bed at turndown, sweets and special childrens' toiletries in the bathroom).
I have read other reviews which complain of small rooms, our room (King Bed) was acceptably large, as was the bathroom, and very comfortable, and quiet.
We only used the restaurant for breakfast and must admit that it wasn't exceptional (compared with other London hotels in which we have stayed). There was a difficulty in coping with 6 individual orders for cooked breakfast and portion size was disappointing. The bar is outstanding, with great choices and excellent staff.
Location is ideal for seeing London.",4,2017,08,22
105,Intimate Wedding,"While we are based in the U.S., we chose to get married in Westminster in a small family ceremony of just over 20 people. In addition to the challenge of organizing a wedding from across the ocean, we also found it difficult to locate a suitable venue given the small size of our party. A number of venues were either ill-suited or made it very clear they had no interest in such a small wedding. However, we were fortunate enough to contact the Chesterfield who could not have done more to make our day perfect. They were incredibly responsive- getting on phone calls and Skype video chats with us throughout he process. Additionally, any request we had for them was invariably met with, sure-no problem (when you are organizing a wedding this is a godsend). The staff, especially Sam who was our primary contact, were fantastic and the day itself went without hitch. We had our wedding ceremony in the library and our reception in the conservatory and both were laid out beautifully. The food was wonderful, the staff were available and accommodating and everything had a classical London theme which is what were looking for. We wholeheartedly recommend considering the Chesterfield for anyone looking for an intimate, classical central London wedding.",5,2017,08,21
105,"Tired ""old girl""","After passing the Chesterfield for over 25 years we decided it was time to ""give it a try"". Staff wonderful - rooms very very small and bathrooms even smaller. Breakfast a disappointment. Buffet pathetic compared to others and pastry lacking.  Location is great!  You can walk everywhere. We come here every year. Would we come back to the Chesterfield - only for a drink at their wonderful bar.

",3,2017,08,21
105,Afternoon tea ,"Just back from a lovely afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my 5 year old. The tea was Charlie and the chocolate themed, I have to say the chocolate scones were all of our favourites and I wouldn't have thought cream and jam would go with chocolate scones but they do.
We didn't like bubblegum eclairs but worth trying. The piano music was lovely and the person dressed as Willy Wonka was a great touch and my daughter had her first gobstopper which she loved.
I think it was a great themed afternoon tea, staff are lovely and we will be back later in the year with are envelope to see if we won anything.
I read reports about dry sandwiches ect and no offer of refills. We did not experience this, all sandwiches were lovely and we couldn't have a refill as we were to full ! We got to take some scones home as we didn't ask for extras.
Def recommend as a afternoon tea to go to with kids.",5,2017,08,20
105,One of my best experiences! ,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel during a long week-end in July and we highly recommend it ! Not only is the location very convenient for tourism but we felt so welcomed by the crew during our stay that it was as though we were a part of the city life...  Also, the style and decoration of the room is what you expect from a typically English hotel. So all of this provided a true ""London experience"" which I never had the pleasure to live, despite my numerous stays in the city. 
Other small but nice things : 
- The bed is so comfortable we had to struggle to get out in the morning...
- And so we were almost late for breakfast, but the team was so understanding they let us sit down as if we had all the time in the world... 
- By the way, breakfast was very complete and delicious and, again, we were delighted to have it in an authentic English style but with very high range products. Definitely worth waking up for ! 
In a few words, it really met our expectations and we considered it a perfect week-end get-away. ",5,2017,08,20
105,One of the best ,"Everything about our stay here was great. Checked off every box - service, location, cleanliness, etc etc. This is a five star hotel with very reasonable prices. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer! ",5,2017,08,19
105,Best of London,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The room was beautiful, the housekeeping staff was amazing, and the bellmen and front desk staff including Charlie were fantastic. If I return to London again, it will definitely be The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel for us.",5,2017,08,19
105,Wonderful afternoon tea!!! ,"I was planning to visit Chesterfield Hotel for afternoon tea for a really long time now, and it finally happened! 
Took my Mum there and we had a blast. We felt like princesses since the moment we stepped in, till the moment we left. The atmosphere is so uplifting and #FeelGood type. The room where the afternoon tea is served is so beautiful that you might want to take a picture of every corner over there. It's full of green plants, flowers, glass roof. .. Like in a fairytale. Staff is increadibly attentive. Our main server was Eryk. Hi FIVE! Such a professional as all of the rest of Chesterfield hotel staff. 
Thank you team for a perfect afternoon with my Mom! 
",5,2017,08,19
105,Fantastic Afternoon Tea!,"Myself, my Mother and Grandma visited the Chesterfield for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed afternoon tea for my birthday and it was fantastic! The experience was recommended by Freddy who works within the hotel and I know that Libby works within the kitchen preparing the delicious food. A gentleman called Loris tended to our every need and made us feel very welcome! A younger gentlemen who I was informed was quite new within the establishment was called Panos, he served us also and he was very attentive and professional. Overall a great experience and will be back for a third time with my golden ticket, highly recommended! ",5,2017,08,19
105,First trip to London,"It was my first trip to London. This charming hotel was exactly how I envisioned a London stay to be. The service was impeccable. We were celebrating a birthday, and received a bottle of very nice champagne, a cupcake, and a birthday card signed by the staff. Very thoughtful. We had been traveling for 16 days when we arrived at this hotel with our giant suitcases. My only complaint and it's not really a complaint, is our suitcases were too big for the closet and too big for under the bed, so that made for some interesting maneuvering around the room with them right there. However, all the awesome other things far outweighed this little concern. I'd like to give a shout out to Laura in the restaurant. She was the most delightful and pleasant person. I explained I was looking for a particular serving piece they had, and she offered to try and find one for me, and took my contact info. She went way above and beyond, and is a true asset to this hotel. We loved that the hotel was in a quiet area, yet close to restaurants and shops...as well as the train. Taxis were always available. Would definitely stay here again should we find ourselves back in London. This place left a lasting impression and will always remain one of our best memories of our stay. ",5,2017,08,18
105,"Oh, to be there still!","The only problem was the ratings!  Top was a 10 and I wanted to give this wonderful place a""1,000!"" From the front door to any other spot in the hotel was fantastic. The front desk. Perfect. The bar with my personal white jacked guys. Great The dining room and breakfast goodies were exemplary. Afternoon tea a dream for all. LOVE this hotel and ALL staff.",5,2017,08,17
105,Spectacular,"We stayed @ the Chesterfield Mayfair prior to joining our coach tour of Britain & it certainly set the bar high. No other hotel we have stayed at can compare to the Chesterfield!
Lovely appointed rooms with every comfort anticipated. Luxurious bathtubs! Friendly & helpful staff always ready to give directions, answer questions or hail a cab! Perfect location for exploring. Will definitely stay here again.
There were 6 of us, had 3 rooms & each room was unique.",5,2017,08,16
105,Excellent event management and lovely stay,"We had our wedding reception here and we're glad we chose this place.  It gave us such peace of mind to see everything prepared well and then to see the wedding reception run without any hiccups. It certainly made the evening much more enjoyable and memorable.

We really enjoyed having a complementary bridal suite for the evening; it meant we could relax and recover a bit every now and then, and then easily walk back into the event. All our requests were handled very well and communication was very good throughout to ensure everything met our expectations.

Overall we have been very happy to have chosen Chesterfield Mayfair for our wedding reception and are quite happy to recommend the venue.",5,2017,08,16
105,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is lovely and the staff very professional.  We had a lot of places we wanted to visit and the staff was very helpful with directions, tickets, time of operation, etc.  Very convenient to Buckingham Palace and the Underground subway system.  We will definitely come back!",5,2017,08,12
105,I don't quite get it....,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield four nights in July.  While it is a very nice hotel, I don't quite understand the outstanding reviews this hotel receives.  Please do not misunderstand me, it is a very nice hotel, and I may stay there again on my next visit to London, but our experience, while fine, was not quite the same as others seem to have.

I will affirm the wonderful breakfast offered and the evening dining was also pleasant the one night we ate at the hotel restaurant.  Every evening we did go to the bar--which is quite small-and enjoyed cocktails but we never found the service beyond what one would expect in a hotel of this level.  (For example, while I won't go into deep details, I requested a rubber bath mat to be delivered to my room due to a recent leg injury which made getting into and out of a slippery tub difficult.  It took three requests, including one face to face at reception, to finally have a mat delivered to the room.)

We booked a king room which was quite ""compact"" to put it nicely.  I know hotel rooms in cities like London, New York, or Hong Kong are small, (and I've stayed in them all), I must say I was surprised at the small size of this one.  The bathroom was modernized and fine.  Housekeeping was very good, including turn down service.

The location of the hotel provides for quiet, but access to the tube and other services a bit more challenging.  The doormen were most accommodating flagging down taxis, which often required them running around the corner down to a busier street.  There is a small neighborhood area that has several local restaurants and pubs two blocks away which was fun to explore and enjoy.",4,2017,08,11
105,Great service defines this hotel,"Hospitality as it should be! I have stayed, dinner and drank here several times. The staff remember me and what I have ordered. I get a warm welcome which is gratefully received. I'm sure you'll like it!",5,2017,08,10
105,Wonderful stay!,"Stayed with family (parents + 3 girls) for 5 nights during July 2017
We booked 3 rooms (2 doubles and 1 single) and were very satisfied by all the amenities and services offered by this fantastic and charming boutique hotel, set in peaceful and pleasant mayfair
Service was very professional and helpful
Breakfast was top notch with plenty of options for vegetarian like us
Location fantastic. Walking distance to Soho, Covent garden, Marylebone and Parks

Definitely recommended!",5,2017,08,10
105,Amazing boutique hotel in London!,"We absolutely loved our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair! The staff was incredibly helpful and kind. Breakfast was wonderful; we felt taken care of and it was always a highlight of the day. Our classic double room was beautifully decorated, very clean, and quiet. The hotel is in a great location to access attractions, restaurants, and the tube. I would 100% stay here again next time we are in London. Don't hesitate, and book this hotel!",5,2017,08,10
105,"A wonderful , peaceful nights rest was experienced.","My wife and I stayed three nights in a junior suite, after travelling from New Zealand.
We found the Chesterfield to be a wonderful , grand hotel, which was most welcoming from the moment we arrived at the entrance.
The Chesterfield , encourages guests to book directly which we did.
The Chesterfield rewards with three and four night,stay packages, with healthy discounts, if you fully prepay,which we enjoyed.
I must also add, that just prior to arrival we were offered an upgrade at a most attractive tariff increase, which we accepted, thank you Chesterfield.
I must add though, be sure to know before arrival, just what the tariff / cost  is for the upgraded room / suite is................knowing the full and total nightly tariff.

Overall the location and convenience of staying here is superb.
For those arriving from Heathrow airport, taking the Heathrow Express and then taking the short taxi ride to the hotel is a very good option.

Thank you all at the Chesterfield, from very happy New Zealand  guests.",5,2017,08,08

105,Great 'English' Hotel in Mayfair,"Stayed here in june 17 for 3 nights with my wife. It's in a good location, just off Park Lane and Picadilly, and opposite Hyde Park.The room was surprisingly well proportioned for a London hotel. There was no bar fridge, otherwise everything was fine - plenty of hangers in the wardrobe. All of the staff we came across were friendly, helpful and courteous. We never ate in the restaurant so can't comment on the food, although we did have a few drinks in the very comfortable bar. There are plenty of restaurants / bars  at the bottom of the road, under the arch. The French one was particularly good - apart from the eye watering prices of some of the wine.",5,2017,08,07
105,"Old school charm, decor and professional staff","Easy good check-in.  Decent prices.

Professional and friendly staff.
Classic old school decor and charm.

Rooms are a little dated in some areas near air vents but quite comfortable beds with good linens.  

Favorite is the heated bathroom floors.
Standard breakfast.
Great location for tourists and 5 minutes to the tube",4,2017,08,07
105,Perfect weekend,"We would like to thank everyone at the Chesterfield Mayfair for making our stay truly memorable.

We will definitely be back and recommending your hotel.
Thanks again.",5,2017,08,07
105,Amazing in May!,"Stayed for 8 days in May 2017 and absolutely loved this hotel and the staff. Concierge's were so helpful with theater and sight seeing reservations.

Thank you for an excellent stay!

105,Another feather in the cap.... ,"I discovered the Red Carnation Hotels group 2 years ago at Christmas with a stay at Hotel 41 - the team their redefined my view on what a hotel should be - simply exceptional. This was my first time at the sister hotel The Chesterfield however, and I would say another very good property in the RCH collection. The Chesterfield may to be to everyone's taste - boutique and carries a more traditional British style and decor  - but for me this is great and a perfect compliment to being back in London. The hotel itself has a great location in Mayfair - easy distance to the theatres, Piccadilly and surrounds but set back just enough to be private and quiet. While the hotel itself has not yet got to the standard (and perhaps it's not intended to) of 41 and The Milestone (it's just a tiny little bit less refined but the price point reflects this), the thing that stands out above any other hotel group I've stayed in are how good the team are.  All people you would want to call friends - charming, engaging and go out of their way to look after you. They really make a huge difference at this rate and standard. Special mention to Letitia who checked us in - what a superstar and thank you for looking after us - and the rest of the team we met just as good. Credit to the philosophy of the owners (Tollman family) and the rest of the management team. ",5,2017,08,05
105,Best kept secret in Mayfair,"What a surprise, good value, excellent friendly service and our room was so charming.   The restaurant is very good with its lovely atmosphere and excellent food. We lived in London for three years and now visit the city-- this hotel will be our new home away from home.",5,2017,08,05
105,A Gem of a Hotel,"Our stay at the Chesterfield, Mayfair was most enjoyable.  The staff were, without exception, friendly, welcoming and helpful; a real credit to this beautiful hotel.  Our classic room was delightful and the meals in the restaurant to a high standard.",5,2017,08,04
105,Service is the key,"It was like we were in old time England. The service from start to finish was excellent. I had read good reviews about the service when we decide to pick this hotel but they didn't come closet to expressing the quality of care we received when we were there. from the door man to the check in to the maid service all were very efficient, courteous, and quick to serve when asked and sometimes before you asked. they had water in the rooms, and left little gifts every evening on your pillow(don't know if I should have mentioned this because it was a wonderful surprise). I am 60 years old and of all the traveling we have done, this is the first hotel that actually read our special request for a low floor room, and went our of their way to find one; to the extent that they actually upgraded our room from a queen to a king in order to locate us on a lower level. As for location it was great. We walked to Picaddilly Circus, and to Regent street easily and there was a great little group of restaurants and shops a block away, with even a small grocery store, Shepards Square I believe the name was. the area was very nice and safe, and there were parks, and bus stops everywhere. Taxi's were always at the front door so we never had to wait for one if needed, and there was a fantastic piano player in the pub in the hotel and even had a jazz nite while we were there. Just can't say enough about it. If we ever go back to London, this is where we are staying.",5,2017,08,03
105,Posh place in Mayfair,This is a wonderful classic hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Close to everything around with an underground station nearby for easy access to everything. The service is great and the room is most elegant. We had a wonderful time here.,5,2017,08,02
105,A lovely short break in central London,"We stayed in the Chesterfield for two nights on a short visit to London.  The whole stay was excellent, from the warm welcome at receptiion, the pre-dinner drinks (a new gin and tonic experience, with thanks to Fiachra), a lovely dinner, with great service from Loris, breakfast as good as we have ever had, and an efficient checkout from John on reception.  The room was a good size, and beautifully furnished.  We look forward to future visits to this great hotel.",5,2017,08,02
105,Afternoon tea,"We visited for afternoon tea on a Saturday for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is very nice, very classic inside with a pianist playing throughout some of our sitting.

The staff were very friendly and the afternoon tea was lovely. We were offered as many sandwiches as we liked and were brought a second plate full of our favourites.

The restaurant is a little dark for my liking, it's very easy to feel sleepy in there. However, they did also have a lovely light conservatory where some people were seated. If you have a choice, I would choose to eat in there. 

The cakes were yummy, we had more than enough for 2 people. The chocolate scones  were especially good with little gooey chocolate chips inside. 

As it was our anniversary we were given a flower and extra cakes with a little message, which was a very nice touch. Although having already eaten a plate full of sweets, we definitely couldn't manage to eat them! All in all very nice.",4,2017,07,30

105,We absolutely loved our stay in London.,"The staff of the Chesterfield Mayfair were warm, friendly and very helpful in planning our stay in London. It has a typical British atmosphere which is what we were looking for in our hotel selection. The rooms were extremely comfortable. Centrally located in Mayfair and in a residential area it is near Picadilly and transportation. Great breakfast. They also have an afternoon tea. It is also near Shepard Market, an area of terrific restaurants. We would definitely return to this hotel or any associated hotel owned by this hotel group.",5,2017,07,29

105,Attention to details and comfort at the Chesterfield..,"I must say i was very impressed by the service and the amenities, and the surroundings and decor of the Chesterfield. The room we had was nicely appointed. I wish it had been a bit larger for the record but what can i say.. money talks. But the room we had on the 3rd or fourth floor was quiet and lovely. Bathroom had the best tub ever.. I could have been six feet tall. I took a bath every night! And they provided good quality bath salts too.! Breakfast that was included was varied and tasty, and delivered with professional servers who took what they did seriously with class! The amenities in the room for a light tea were lovely and tasteful, and i couldn't believe the box of office supplies that were supplied. They thought of everything! And when i told them my mattress was not exactly to my liking they brought me a memory foam that night that made up for the night before and then some. THe decor around the entire hotel was very British and very lovely indeed. I will look forward to coming back there again and using it to be centrally located to all thing in London especially the Theatre District. I'm looking forward to coming back TRULY!!",5,2017,07,28
105,Amazing gin and tonic experience!,"My friends recently surprised me with a gin experience at The Chesterfield. It was absolutely fantastic! We tasted three different gins, each paired with a perfectly selected tonic, lovingly presented on a colourful tray including different botanicals to enhance the flavours. Our host was super informative and talked us through each drink. We especially appreciated having time between each drink so we could fully enjoy our gin and tonic whilst having a good natter. We spent a good couple of hours there and enjoyed the experience immensely, especially with the live pianist. A lovely atmosphere in very charming hotel right in the centre of London. Would definitely recommend this experience - much more enjoyable that some other gin experiences I've been to. ",5,2017,07,25
105,Fantastic Gin and Tonic experience,"Jade was the perfect host for this unique experience at the fabulous Chesterfield Hotel. She was knowledgeable and informative whilst remaining down to earth and pitching her interaction perfectly with the vibe of our group. 

We all learnt a lot about the pairings of different gins and different tonics, but enjoyed being able to savour each one in turn in before moving on to the next drink, rather than it just being a 'tasting'. The atmosphere in the bar was lovely on a Friday evening, with the piano player providing the perfect background, and the sharing plates were delicious. 

Will definitely come again!",5,2017,07,24
105,Excellent gin tasting experience,"I visited the Chesterfield hotel on Friday for the gin & tonic experience with some friends. The staff were extremely welcoming and friendly and the ambience in the bar was lovely with the piano player in the corner. The gin experience was fantastic, I  leant a lot about the different gins and how to pair them with the right tonic and it was nice to get to enjoy the whole drink rather than just being able to sample them. Our host was very knowledgeable and witty and left us to enjoy each drink before moving onto the next one which made the experience even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend the experience - fabulous!",5,2017,07,23
105,Only disappointment was our room... ,"This is our second trip to this wonderful English   Boutique hotel.

Having visited the hotel last year alone and having experienced such a wonderful time , I promised myself that I would bring my family thru the following year.  I re booked about a year in advance and asked for two off the same rooms overlooking the lovely road as I had on that visit.

Assured all in order. On arrival guttered to arrive to worn out rooms right next to service staff stairs. Looking out windows the view was an ugly interior courtyard.I complained to the receptionist and mentioned that theses were not the rooms we booked a year ago. Unfortunately they could not move us as the hotel was full for Wimbledon. 

On a positive note, the position off the hotel is outstanding in Mayfair. Green tube station and  Green Park is around the corner. All the major tourist sites are within easy walking distance.

The staff are what in my opinion make this boutique hotel outstanding. Dominque thank you from one fellow South African to another. Your help was invaluable. Don't forget to update me on Sicily trip. Breakfast is classy and the teas are amazing . We had such lovely staff from all over Europe serving. Depending on the shift we would have some staff from Southern Italy serving us and I would joke and complain about the northern Italians and on alternate days complain about southern Italians. We would all just have a good laugh. Edgar thank you for the good service given and advice on your home country. I will definitely plan a trip for my family their in the near future. Concierge, receptionists , doormen all brilliant.House keeping lovely and couldn't do enough.

Kudos to the general manager who rolled his sleeves to help on on particularly busy breakfast morning .Thank you also for lovely cakes provided on my wife's anniversary .

In closing the decor is lovely. Well done. We will be back... Please just provide room booked for in advance  ",5,2017,07,23
105,Great Location Good hotel ,"After reading other Trip Advisor reviews we stayed here and after staying I also agree the location is great. Green Park tube is very close, the airport train line also runs through this stop. You are within walking distance to Hyde Park, Green Park, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly and Oxford/Regent Streets. The hotel offered a good breakfast both hot and cold. The rooms were good and clean but not overly spacious. The bar prices down stairs were overpriced and I'd recommend having a drink at a close by pub. Staff service was inconsistent depending on who you were dealing with. The afternoon tea in the hotel was very good. Overall i would recommend and stay here again.",4,2017,07,22
105,Afternoon Tea à la Willy Wonka,"Recently attended a wonderful Afternoon Tea with a friend I have not seen since a long time. So we thought this is a perfect occasion to catch up and enjoy a good cup of tea at the same time.
We were greeted and seated by Bernadette who welcomed us with a big smile.
In addition to celebrate we also ordered a glass of Champagne. Why not?!
Etienne, who took our order, was very professional and patient with explaining the menu to us and gave recommendations which teas we could try best with our treats.
Our Afternoon Tea stand was brought by Mihai who showed a very good knowledge of the food and even explained some history behind the tea ""Dancing Dragon"".
I'm not telling too much, find out yourself;).
The whole team during our stay made sure everything was perfect and as soon as we run low on sandwiches and scones we were offered to order refills.
At the end of our stay we even had the pleasure to meet Dominic who came to check on us how we enjoyed our Afternoon Tea.
This place is perfect to hide from the outside world and escape into the world of everlasting sweets, umpa-lumpa treats and a good brew of Chocolate Tea.
",5,2017,07,22
105,Tea Time,"I had a wonderful experience for a high tea at The Chesterfield in Mayfair.I used this venue for a business meeting.One client was Californian so it was his first high tea.The room where it was served is like a conservatory.Very pleasant and calm.We arrived at 5pm and left at 7.Etienne de French Maitre D was great.Very attentive.We had 4 different teas.The house chocolate tea,Earl Gray,Fresh Mint Tea, and I had Jasmin tea.The finger sandwishes and pastries where excellent.I ate so everyone followed and it turned the meeting into a relaxed and productive endeavour.It was Friday night and we finally relaxed after a heavy week.Ishall be back.I recommend it for your high tea in London if you are in Mayfair.",5,2017,07,22
105,It Keeps Getting Better!,"We just spent 9 wonderful nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair (our fourth stay at the property).  The rooms are delightful and given the location reasonably priced.  The location is perfect for dining, shopping and sightseeing.  For destinations further afield the Green Park Underground station is a 10 minute leisurely walk.  The staff is top-notch.  Every member with whom we came in contact was gracious, helpful, professional and friendly to a fault.  We had not been to the hotel in almost a year, but were greeted by name when we approached the front desk to check-in.

Over the years we have stayed at four other 5-star hotels in the area.  The Chesterfield Mayfair is now our ""home in London.""",5,2017,07,19
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"I attended for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea with my Mum. We often take afternoon tea together at many different 5 star hotels in London, being locals ourselves. We were delighted with every aspect of this afternoon tea at The Chesterfield, and have been back again. We have met lots of the staff, including Eryk, Adrianna and Etienne who have all been delightful. The ambience and surroundings are very beautiful and classic and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The food is excellent and the pastries in particular are delicious. I can't fault this establishment and they should be very proud of themselves and their staff for the quality service they deliver.",5,2017,07,18
105,Charlie & chocolate factory afternoon tea ,"This hotel is gorgeous, I wish we could have stayed here but afternoon tea was all we had booked! We were not disappointed. The room was immaculate and reminded me of something from a costume drama like the Halcyon or Selfridges. Staff were super professional yet warm and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble and even the most awkward customers (on a table nearby) were treated with respect and their requests accommodated. The afternoon tea was a delight with lovely touches of popping candy pop to wonka bar and umpah lumpah cupcake. Refills were as often as you asked, and my son not wanting tea was able to have a chocolate milk shake which he thought was divine. As we were there to celebrate his birthday they even brought an additional birthday cup cake. Not the cheapest afternoon tea but by far the best setting service and theme ",5,2017,07,17
105,Wonderful location and very central.,"Having visited London at least a dozen of times and mostly stayed in 4.5 to 5 star hotels, I am certain that this hotel provides the best personal service out of all of them. The location is wonderful and handy for shopping and dining. The rooms are very comfortable and most importantly the soundproofing works!!!",5,2017,07,17
105,Excellent traditional London Hotel.,"Very traditional Hotel in appearance but what we liked was the service and friendliness of the Staff , the majority of whom were youngsters.
Excellent location close to Green Park underground station , Park Lane , Berkeley Sq.,Grosvenor Sq., Oxford St., and Piccadilly .
Good size recently modernised double room .
Standard continental breakfast had plenty of choice and the Full English (extra) was excellent.",5,2017,07,16
105,Classic and Classy Chesterfield,"The location in Mayfair is very calm and residential.  It is a great location for shopping and hyde park area.  The hotel staff were warm, welcoming and helpful.  Our suite was amazing and very large.  The breakfast was included and they had a nice variety.  The pub is plush and a great place to meet up with friends/co-workers.  We did not have tea, but the room is darling.  Loved the hotel location, staff and room!",5,2017,07,15
105,At your service.,"This is the third different Red Carnation Hotel I have stayed at in London, all have been excellent. What is particularly remarkable about The Chesterfield is that, whatever the number of fellow guests, the staff make you feel that they are there just for you. The attention to detail is first class; nothing is too much trouble. The General Manager, Adam, whom we met during our stay must be very proud of his team and he must take credit for running such a fine establishment.",5,2017,07,15
105,"LOVELY HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION",The hotel is lovely and the bar exceptional. Never knew there were so many different gin and tonics! The rooms were very comfortable. In the Mayfair district of London and close to the Tube. Would happily stay here again.,5,2017,07,14
105,A Wonderful Hotel in a Great Location,Everyone that we encountered in this hotel worked to make our stay very enjoyable.  The front desk was very helpful in making suggestions and giving us directions.  The doorman always had a smile and greeting.  Our room was very nice and very clean.  We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who would be planning a trip to London.,5,2017,07,13
105,"Gracious, comfortable hotel with a fantastic staff who are always there to help but unobtrusive about it.","My room was good sized and beautifully decorated with excellent A/C, bathroom supplies, ample closet and drawer space and very comfortable bed.  I had breakfast via room service each morning (6 mornings) and the breakfast was delivered right on schedule and excellent.  This is a detail, but the TV selection was the best I have ever had a hotel.  A really minor detail - I loved the slippers they provided.  The location could not have been better.  It was in a quiet residential area but within walking distance to excellent restaurants and major sites.  I walked to the National Gallery, Parliament, and Harrods.  After the bustle of London, it was so,pleasant to return to this peaceful hotel.",5,2017,07,13
105,Not very happy,Location fair. Staff sent me on a roundabout route to restaurant that was three blocks away. Walked seven with heart condition.  Lobby air conditioned hallways NOT. WINDOWS UNSCREENED AND OPEN in hallways. I have just spent five days in hospital from insect bite received June 19th while sleeping there.,3,2017,07,12
105,Exceptional,"Had a recent stay here and have a major complaint, I didn't stay long enough! This place is exceptional, very friendly staff, lovely feel and CX from start to finish, will definitely be back and next time staying longer!",5,2017,07,11
105,High Tea ,"We went to have high tea, a traditional english afternoon meal at the chesterfield.  It was highly recommended by a friend.  And it did not disappoint.  We had a great time. 

The price is high, but it's fixed and is an all you can eat, buffet like affair.  You get unlimited tea, sandwiches and cakes. Kids also are catered to with hot chocolate and milkshakes. 

Everything is of a high quality and standard and the place is very posh. They were having a Willy Wonka special so he was there too. 

Scones, the plain ones were great. The chocolate ones not so much. Cucumber sandwiches, pretty tasteless, but the chicken and salmon ones quite good. Cupcakes and fruit cups quite nice too. 

Staff was amazing and celebrated my daughters upcoming birthday with much gusto...one of the waiters even take pics and videos of us with Willy Wonka!!!

So highly recommended. ",4,2017,07,10
105,Hotel is Brilliant!,"The location is perfect,it really is impossible to note on anything we did not like. The room was fabulous,the staff in all outlets were superb,especially on check out when talking to the night Manager Hani Morsi..he has been working at the hotel for over 40 years! Tells you everything you need to know how well the hotel is run when the staff never want to leave! Congratulations to the General Manager of the fine establishment for running such a great hotel..we will be returning soon without doubt",5,2017,07,10
105,"Wonderful staff, Very nice hotel, a few issues","We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Chesterfield.  My husband and I were traveling with our three teenage children.  The hotel is in a perfect location.  The staff is very attentive and helpful.  A full breakfast was included each morning which was lovely.  We attended the afternoon tea and found it to be delicious and a lot of fun.  Would highly recommend going.  Just a couple of negatives- the water in our shower was scalding hot and we could not regulate the temperature.  I had originally booked a junior suite with attached twin room and was getting 3 nights for the price of 2.  I had to change the reservation to the junior suite and a superior king when my older daughter decided to join us.  I was not made aware that the superior king was not 3 nights for price of 2 at the time.  Upon checking in I inquired about the deal to make sure both rooms were included and was told not to worry that upon checkout we would be accurate.  However, at checkout I was told the superior king was not part of the deal so I ended up paying quite a bit more than budgeted.  I wish I had known at check in this fact because I would have preferred to try and switch my superior room to a better room.  If I was going to pay more money I would have liked a better room.  The junior suite which my children shared was far better and much quieter than my superior king.  If you decide to stay it's worth getting a suite.",4,2017,07,09
105,It was great,"Location,staff, comfor, cancier's guide for sightseeing,  Managers personal approach and immediate response to requests and complaints. Extra stay for checking out late And allowing early.Will be back for sure.",4,2017,07,09
105,Excellent Host with Great Location,"Classic British hotel full of Charm. Outstanding breakfast with a very wide selection of great food and even better service. White linen table cloths to boot.

The bar is also Classic British with a sophisticated green motif and a hunting feel to it. The bar tenders are friendly and gregarious. 

Great Central London location -- we walked everywhere!!!!!!!!

The rooms are on the small side but very nice. The bed was very comfortable. The shower is not a walk-in shower but requires a very large step to get in.

Overall, we loved The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.",5,2017,07,08
105,Smashing,"I am an admitted hotel snob and travel often. It is infrequent that my expectations are exceeded. Bravo Mayfair. The hotel staff were beyond courteous and helpful. Shout out to Jade in the lounge, and Etienne and Ian in the Butlers Restaurant. Outstanding service. Food was wonderful from the included English breakfast to the fine dining evening meal. Treats upon check in, a note from the manager, and even storage of our luggage during a France side trip. Do yourself a favor and stay here. It is infinitely walkable and a delight.",5,2017,07,08
105,Charming English hotel,"This is not a modern cookie cutter hotel. The Chesterfield Mayfair is like a larger boutique hotel with lots of charm. The beds are very comfortable; rooms are small but adequate. You have all of the amenities that you could need, including hair dryer, robes and slippers. Breakfast is delicious. They also serve a fabulous afternoon tea in the conservatory. Couldn't ask for a better hotel in London's Mayfair district.",5,2017,07,07
105,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea,"Absolutely fantastic experience with my friend, her ten year old daughter and their mother/grandmother!
I have had lots of Afternoon Teas and I can honestly say that the service at the Chesterfield Hotel was the best I've ever experienced. They were warm, friendly, attentive but allowing enough space for us to enjoy our time without feeling overly hassled. Anything we requested was absolutely no trouble at all, from extra cakes, to boxes to take our leftovers home.
The day out was to celebrate Kore's 10th birthday and my friends were over from Holland for the weekend. It was a highlight in a weekend of visiting the Roald Dahl museum in Great Missenden and the Chesterfield Hotel really helped to celebrate by making a birthday plate with her name and age written in Chocolate (and more cake!) plus a visit with Willy Wonka, a little Chesterfield Hotel bear and the Happy Birthday song. Whilst they made such a great effort, I believe that this is just what they do!  
The food was fantastic and the 'fizzy lifting juice' a revelation!! Who doesn't enjoy being a kid for a day! Despite this though, the afternoon tea is not just for kids or those celebrating with children. There were plenty of adults just having normal afternoon tea and it was definitely a refined afternoon tea experience, not a kids tea party! 
Simply put, I can't recommend it enough (I'm still day dreaming about my vegetarian sandwich options and the Blueberry Macarons!).",5,2017,07,07
105,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!! THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"Me and my partner were lucky enough to celebrate a special birthday at The Chesterfield Mayfair.

From reservation stage, through to departing the hotel, the Chesterfield team were absolutely faultless. Their genuine care for their customers is one I have never experienced throughout the world.

Samantha Langaas took care of our reservation in a heart beat and noted that we were coming for a special occasion, little did I know that she had pulled all the strings in the background from passing this info to all the Front Office team, who were aware of our occasion before we even stepped through the door. From Joseph on the door, to Elliot at concierge to Letitia who manages the Front Office operation - their customer service levels and genuine care was second to none. Letitia had kindly upgraded us to a suite for our stay and the team arranged a 'happy birthday' card signed by all the team members, which really showed that the team at The Chesterfield go the extra mile. 

Breakfast was again, a faultless experience - ranging from the cold buffet options to our pancakes and full English breakfast, all items were evidently sourced from the best providers and served with a smile and care for our experience.

All in all - if you are looking for a hotel in the perfect location, with service levels that can won't only match, but exceed any 5 star hotel in London, then The Chesterfield is the hotel for you.

We can only hope to return in the future!!!",5,2017,07,06
105,Delightful,"We recently spent 10 days at this lovely hotel and could not be more complimentary about our experience.  To start, the location in the posh Mayfair area of London is ideal.  The hotel is located on a quiet street in the heart of Mayfair.  We were a short walk to numerous eateries and shops, including Piccadilly Street, Buckingham Palace and Green Park.  (And just down the street from our 3 must haves: a pub, a coffee shop and a gym.)

The service was impeccable.  The bellman, front desk, concierge and housekeepers were friendly, competent and always willing to help.  And the restaurant is not to be missed, serving up traditional British cuisine in large portions.  Loris the maitre'd is the consummate professional (and a delightful conversationalist) and was attentive to our every need.  

The decor of the Chesterfield is very British and the afternoon tea services are not to be missed--on weekends, reservations are recommended.  The hotel bar is also very nice with some interesting selections of gins.

While the rooms are slightly small compared to American hotels, they are well decorated and well provisioned.  

This was a five star experience for a reasonable price, and I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2017,07,04
105,Gin and Tonic Experience ,"My two friends and I had a wonderful gin and tonic experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair, hosted by the knowledgeable, funny and charming James. We had the premium experience and it was fantastic! We tried three very different gins in combination with different tonics and condiments such as strawberries, juniper berries, grapefruit piel and even pansies! All were delicious. We learnt a lot about the subtleties of different blends and how they can be mixed. 
A really great experience for a special occasion! ",5,2017,07,04
105,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Tea,"We had a Willy Wonka themed tea complete with Wonka bars, fizzy lifting drinks and gobstoppers.  My kids really enjoyed all the throw backs to the original movie.  The tea was all you can eat so if your family liked something in particular it was at your disposal.  Lots of tea selections!",4,2017,07,04
105,Great stay in the heart of London!,"We are a family of 5, and stayed at the Chesterfield for 4 nights following a Baltic cruise.  It was a wonderful location, and the staff were super friendly.  The only hiccup we experienced was that we requested 2 connecting rooms.  Turns out you need to reserve 2 of the same type of room to have the option of connecting rooms - but the reservation desk, as well as the liaison who repeatedly contacted me via email to see if I needed any assistance, failed to mention this fact.  So we ended up with a king suite (very nice) down the hall and some steps and around a corner from our kids' room, which had 2 beds.  Not the most convenient, but next time I will know to reserve two of the same type of room if we want connecting rooms.",5,2017,07,04
105,Family visit,"Wonderful first stay.  Lovely hotel, excellent service, great location. Our son had stayed before and recommended it.  
The staff at the desk and door were so helpful.  Loved the bar atmosphere with the piano player.
Will come again!",5,2017,07,04
105,Great stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair!,"My partner and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 12 days while in London. It was an excellent home base because of the location (proximity to the Green Park tube station, and nice quiet neighborhood). The staff were all nice. The property is clean. I would stay again, and definitely recommend it to friends and family (and all of you!).",5,2017,07,04
105,Lovely hotel ,"We were so impressed with the Chesterfield. It is in a wonderful area of London, near shopping, Green Park and many restaurants. 

Our room was absolutely beautiful. The bed was stunningly dressed with a drapery headboard. We had his and hers full baths that were the height of luxury. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful.  You will like be this hotel.",5,2017,07,03
105,Lovely Stay at the Chesterfield ,Stayed here for 1 night with my mom in a superior room . Interesting decor but Fantastic service from all staff - it's quite remarkable . Whoever trained them did an awesome job and other hotels should take note .They allowed a late checkout at short notice with no extra cost . Would definitely recommend and stay again. However as with most London accommodations the room was small .,5,2017,07,03
105,Fantastic stay,"Just returned from a four night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Cannot say enough good about this quaint hotel.  
Great location and rooms and fantastic staff who go out of their way to make your stay special.   Dining in Butlers restaurant was perfect. Delicious breakfast and dinner and superb service.  Try one of the unique martinis in Terrace bar. 
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,01
105,Must Stay Boutique Hotel in Central London!,"My wife and I spent another glorious month of May at the Mayfair Chesterfield in 2017. It has become our home way from home when visiting London. The Chesterfield has it all. It's location is second to none tucked away in a very quiet  upscale area between Hyde Park and James Park, minutes  walk away from bustling Piccadilly and Bond Street. It is like you are in a quiet fashionable village in the middle of Central London. Its staff are all warm and very welcoming offering top services for a marvellous long term stay. We couldn't be happier with our hotel experience.  The hotel is a chic old English style hotel. In addition they have London's best gin and tonic experience in the very comfortable and fashionable old English den lobby piano bar. So if you don't stay at the hotel drop down for a drink in a quiet spot after touring Central London. Ask for James.",5,2017,06,30
105,good location,"rooms are nice and clean.  front desk and maid service are good.  it is longer than five minutes to the subway.  we ate at several places right around the corner.  it is a safe location.
we will stay there again.",5,2017,06,28
105,Relaxing and enjoyable stay,"This is a hotel that truly knows what to do to make its guests feel relaxed and at home. Extremely helpful front desk and concierge. My double room had everything I needed and more (spare towels, face towel, fluffy towels, slippers, very comfortable bed allowing good nights sleep, aircon thats works well quietly, generous wardrobe space and many more details that other hotels, would not even think to provide).

Location is convenient to Piccadilly and Oxford Streets and their shops. Tony the concierge was spot on with his restaurant recommendations. 

Only negative was the restaurant - bit slow with drinks and staff there needs further training. The food is a bit inconsistent. 

Overall I had an enjoyable time and would look to stay again. Room rates are however on the high side. ",5,2017,06,27
105,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,"What a delightful hotel! Great staff, very clubby atmosphere, superb location. We had such fun! Loved the bartenders and piano player...made a point of stopping in most evenings before dinner. Food in the restaurant (Butler's) was good...we particularly enjoyed the Dover sole. Only negative was the smallness of the rooms but we overlooked that because everything else was over the top!",5,2017,06,26
105,Afternoon tea,"Myself and my friend visited for afternoon tea,it was wonderful,very tasty and in delightful surroundings.Plenty of choice and we where offered top up on the sandwiches.We had a few cakes left that the staff boxed up so we could take them home.Would highly recommend.",5,2017,06,25
105,A GREAT PLACE IN LONDON,"This hotel is very well located, close to the picadelly metro station.
You can walk to several places, including buckingham palace.
The hotel is excellent. The rooms are very comfortable.
The hotel staff are excellent, they try to accommodate and look for the solution to any problems that arise, they are very helpful especially the breakfast buffet staff and the bar on the morning shift.",5,2017,06,25
105,Anniversary/Birthday trip,"All I can say is for my first trip to England you set the bar high. From the room to the gin experience, to the employees at the hotel....... everything was top notch! 
Thank you for making this trip special...... we will definitely be back.",5,2017,06,23
105,"Well Located, Well Run Traditional British Hotel","The staff is very well trained.  You're within walking distance of all the high end stores and restaurants.  The area has reasonably priced places as well.

The bar is excellent.  Make sure you try their fish and chips.  It's world class as are the drinks.  (The bartenders really know what they're doing.)

The restaurant in particular needs to be renovated.  I stayed on the 6th floor, which had been renovated, and it was well furnished with a nice view.  Their room service breakfast was expertly done and a stress free way to start off the day.

I also noticed that the afternoon tea was extremely popular.

Once the Chesterfield goes through a complete renovation, it will be a real find as a London hotel.",5,2017,06,20
105,Fabulous Stay,"Was the trip of a lifetime and this hotel is what made it that way. 
Fabulous service in our rooms, the cozy bar and the lovely dining rooms. The hotel's location is exceptional. We walked and walked exploring out further each day.  Easy walk down Piccadilly to the theatre district, easy walk to Harrods, easy walk to wonderful pubs,easy walk to Buckingham Palace. Staff waiting at the door with huge helpful umbrellas for rainy days.
I can't wait to return.",5,2017,06,20
105,Wonderful Stay!,"A friend and I stayed for 5 nights at the end of May. The rooms are small, slightly dated but clean. The service and staff were excellent. It's located on a quite street and is in walking distance of shops, pubs, etc ... I would absolutely stay there again.",5,2017,06,20
105,Very nice hotel in great location,"Staff was wonderful: very friendly & helpful in every way.  Dining room was very nice. Didn't have dinner here, but breakfast buffet was great.  Everything is well maintained and clean.  Would stay again.",5,2017,06,18

105,Simply Wonderful ,We visited London this past week and The Chesterfield Mayfair was prefect from the rooms to the support staff and the location. We walked to Buckingham Palace 3 times in during our 5 day stay!  We loved this hotel and everyone who works there (especially Ian and Etiene),5,2017,06,16
105,Outstanding Service,"From front desk to wait staff in restaurant and all other aspects of service within this lovely old boutique hotel, every employee sought to help in any way possible. 
We were upgraded to a large suite with separate sitting room. King sized bed was very comfortable. Only suggestion to management is that one of the two pillows offered each guest could be firmer. Now both are very soft.
Excellent breakfasts and a lovely dinner in restaurant. Concierge very helpful.",5,2017,06,16
105,Good!!,"We have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair many times in the past, and as always, it is a delight.  This time we treated ourselves to a Junior Suite, and it did not disappoint.  The room was very well maintained, and the breakfasts were outstanding.   We often walked around the neighborhood simply to look at stores and buildings, and it was always interesting.    The location of this hotel is outstanding, being situated in Mayfair.  In every respect, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a hotel to which we will return.",4,2017,06,15
105,Excellent service at delicious afternoon tea,"We went to the Chesterfield for afternoon tea to celebrate a friend's birthday yesterday. We received a warm welcome with friendly and efficient service from our waiters Etienne and Valerij. The food was absolutely delicious and definitely one of the best afternoon teas I've had in London.  We were enjoying ourselves too much to leave after tea so we moved to the bar to finish our evening off with a very tasty G&T. Overall, the staff provided outstanding service and went the extra mile to make it a very special day for our friend. ",5,2017,06,14
105,Wonderful 4 day stay,"This was the perfect stop over for two single woman travelling.  The location was perfect and very accessible to all that London has to offer.  I fell in love with the decor and manners of Chesterfield Mayfair, it was the perfect place to beginning the day with their enormous breakfast selection and ended the day with a sip of wine after a long day of siteseeing.  I will return.",5,2017,06,12
105,Chesterfield Mayfair was a great place to stay in London,Everything was great at the Chesterfield Mayfair. While the rooms are on a smaller size - every attention to detail is catered for - including a French press for fresh coffee in the morning. The breakfast is fabulous - and the staff really friendly. Highly recommend the stay in London - superbly located.,4,2017,06,12
105,Perfect Lunch,"A flying visit to the Chesterfield for lunch, but as always the service was absolutely perfect. Our greeting at the door was like old friends returning, and James at the bar was funny, attentive and seemed genuinely pleased to see us. Food was faultless and the cocktails amazing.",5,2017,06,12
105,Dependable and the standard never drops,"From the time of a welcoming arrival from the doormen it is easy to feel at home.
Having visited several times it is amazing how the standard never drops.
Reception with Letitia and her team and Concierges Tony and Darren ensure that all your needs are looked after.
Thie excellent standard is also evident in the Restaurant where Loris and Bernadette ensure that Dinner and Breakfast are relaxing, and the food is first class.
The rooms are clean and here again the staff take great pride in their work.
A visit is always enjoyable.",5,2017,06,11
105,Amazing Cream Tea,"I think this visit is about our 6th for a cream tea usually celebrating a birthday.
This year it was my turn, I was 73 years old on 8th June and having helped celebrate my daughter's birthday about 4 times and my son's 1 time thought it was my turn this year.
We were 9 to sit down to eat out cream tea and it did not disappoint any of us.  In our party was my great friend and husband, they had come over from USA to help me celebrate my birthday and were duly impressed and had a great time.  
Unfortunately we were an hour late due to unfortunate circumstances, but this did not faze the hotel or the staff at all and they never hinted us to hurry up.
We have tried other hotels but this we consider is ""The Best"" for ""A Cream Tea"".  
Yes may be exspensive but is it for what you get!  You try!  Dare you!",5,2017,06,10
105,The Quintessential British Luxury boutique.,"I selected this hotel for my four day business trip based on the excellent reviews I read in Expedia and TripAdvisor.  I was not disappointed.  This boutique hotel is pleasantly located just a short walk from the Green Park tube station in the heart of London's posh Mayfair district.  It's another short walk to restaurants of every type and shopping for many of the world's most exclusive brands.

Even though this is a four-star hotel, the Chesterfield Mayfair has all the trappings of an ultra-luxury hotel.  From the highly-personalised service to the daily complimentary canapés delivered to my suite to the extra-large monogrammed towels to the plush slippers and terrycloth bathrobes to the fine furnishings, this hotel was impressive.  

The service at this hotel was excellent, and you could tell the staff was trained to meet or exceed their guests' expectations.  I have stayed at many of the finest hotels in the Americas, Europe, and the Far East and can tell you this boutique hotel, while not as ostentatious as some large, five-star hotels, can match them for comfort, luxury, and service.

I enjoyed everything about this hotel and recommend it to the discerning travelers who enjoy comfort, convenience, and exceptional service at a reasonable London Mayfair price.",5,2017,06,10
105,The Terrace Bar is simply splendid; Butler's restaurant was wonderful,"We were staying around the corner from this hotel, but discovered the Terrace Bar early on.  It may be one of the last great piano bars left in the world.  Classic British--intimate, great service, extensive and innovative cocktail list, very good food.  The highlight is the tuxedo-clad British piano player, who seemingly knows every song ever recorded.  We made this our go to place for evening cocktails.  You should, also.  And dinner one night in Butler's was lovely.  The rolling silver cart, wonderful service, excellent food.  ",5,2017,06,10
105,Loved it,I can't rave about the Willy Wonka afternoon tea enough. My 8 year old loved it as much as me and my husband. Friendly staff. Arrived an hour early and accommodated us. So much food you will be stuffed. Worth every penny. ,5,2017,06,10
105,"Very British, which was what I wanted","I loved the decor and ambience of the hotel and our room. The slippers and cozy robes were a lovely bonus, as was the morning paper which was delivered to your room. The location was close to many attractions and the Green Park underground station was five minutes away. The Terrace Bar was a very relaxing place to end the evening and all of the staff were very friendly. Highly recommend.",5,2017,06,09
105,Quintessentially English,"My first stay in this hotel, by George it will not be my last.      The hotel is in a perfect location for my business visit to London, from the moment the taxi door was opened and I was ushered politely into the warm charm of the Chesterfield it oozed quality and perfection.     The staff simply the best I have encountered in my many years of travelling the world, knowledgeable, polite, friendly efficient all with a smile and a charm that you could leave the most difficult task with them and they would provide the best solution.    The room I had was, for me, perfect, quiet pleasant decor of an almost bygone era, with all the trimmings for today's modern work tasks.    Smallish but great bathroom with all the requirements one could wish for easily at hand.     The Terrace Bar with attentive staff welcomed you into its sumptuous surroundings, service with a smile always discrete but always attentive.     The restaurant a delight, I had dinner there on my second night, the menu was excellent and the food outlandishly good.   The wine list too with great help, if any was need from the young Sommelier     The service was impeccable a score for the restaurant if one were to give one would be 10/10 for both breakfast and dinner, which were the only two meals I took there.    Price of a three course meal with a glass of wine and a nice Armagnac quite reasonable for London 10/10 for quality and price.    

This hotel has a wonderful ambiance, even going done to the Gentlemens' Washroom it reminded me of my old club, it is a timeless show of genteel living for gentlefolk, it is how one would wish to be treated and how well this hotel does it, all down to the staff and a pride in both their hotel and their vocation.    Thank you The Chesterfield Mayfair for a fabulous stay in your hotel. ",5,2017,06,09
105,High Tea we didn't want to stop munching,"What a gorgeous hotel; faultless with care and attention to detail in every aspect, from the wonderful staff, to the food, drink and quaint decor. Thank you Ian for looking after us so well. It was the perfect finishing touch to our 25th Wedding Anniversary celebrations. 
The chocolate tea was unexpectedly delicious and the food was amazing beyond our expectations. We can't wait to return to see what surprises our golden tickets have in store x excited 😊. 
Thank you everyone 🌸

105,Exceeded expectations,"We stayed in two different rooms and they were both excellent in size, cleanliness, decor and everything. Bathroom spacious, great hot water pressure, fully equipped.
The hotel itself well maintained, with options for restaurant or bar. 

Would definitely recommend and would stay again if in London.",5,2017,06,08
105,Fantastic Time in London!!!,"We stayed here on advice from our travel agent and we loved it!  Our room was not large, but you are in the big city!  The staff was very friendly and always helpful!  Absolutely fantastic location in a London!  Centrally located, walkable to almost anywhere!  The bar was fab!  Ian gave us a gin and tonic lesson that was out of this world!  Loved it, and went back for more!  Highly recommend!!!",5,2017,06,06
105,Terrific location and fantastic service,"The Chesterfield Hotel is located in the heart of Mayfair very close to Shepherds Market, close to the subway and near to many of central London's attractions. The service at the hotel is outstanding.  The staff are incredibly helpful, welcoming, professional and friendly.  No request is to big or small.  The room was very comfortable, typical of the size one finds in London hotels, immaculately clean and well stocked with everything one needs.  I had room service one evening as I had to work and the Chicken Pie made up for a very long teleconference!  The pie was stuffed full of perfectly cooked chicken in the most delicious pastry that I think was made with shortening ... yummy! Service was prompt and the food arrived piping hot. Dinner at Butlers Restaurant was excellent.  Try the daily ""Butlers Carving Trolley"".  The freshly carved gammon ham with fried eggs was outstanding ... a very upscale version of ""ham, eggs and chips"" ... very British! Afternoon Tea was quite the experience as it has a ""Willy Wonka"" theme.  If you have kids then it must be terrific!  I didn't try breakfast as I discovered a fantastic cafe just around the corner in Shepherds Market (Caffe In) that provided everything I needed. Next time I am in London and want to stay in the heart of Mayfair, I will certainly choose The Chesterfield.",5,2017,06,06
105,Afternoon tea,Afternoon tea at the chesterfield. Amazing. The whole team fully embrace the event with Willy wonka  doing the rounds to each and every customer. The food was delicious and never ending. Will recommend to all.,5,2017,06,03
105,Great Location,"Pros: Location location location
Cons: Scents should not be forced onto guests. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Great Location very good service but as all hotels they will try to give you the least desirable room . The breakfasts are truly excellent but very pricey. You can easily go out for breakfast close by. The hotel uses an scent in their hallways and the rooms. To some this might be alright but our group had some problems with scents. Not all folks like smells intentional or otherwise.",4,2017,06,02
105,Our best London hotel experience,"We needed a central London hotel for two nights and found the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel on the internet.  It is tucked away in Mayfair but is ideally located for the West End.  We readily accessed London Zoo, Apsley House and the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace from this hotel.  The hotel was fantastic - in particular the staff were first rate - kind, very helpful and and they all genuinely made us feel very welcome.  At breakfast we were welcomed and seated by Bernadett who made sure everything was good for us and we were served by Carolina who looked after us very well (and had a good sense of humuour).  Loris and Erik also gave great service at afternoon tea.  Service, room and food were all first class.  We have no negatives to offer; in short, this has to be the best hotel we have stayed in in London.  Brilliant and thank you!",5,2017,06,02
105,Excellent,"My daughter and I spent 4 nights at the Chesterfield last week. As my daughter would say, it is stellar. The location is perfect for getting around and close to Green Park tube station. There were many restaurants we could walk to and Shepherds Market is a two minute walk. The rooms were not large but were very comfortable. This is London so you are not going to get a huge room! I can not say enough about the staff! They were just outstanding and made us feel very much at home. Tony and the concierge staff were so kind and helpful and never seemed bothered when we asked questions or needed help. My daughter just loved them! A very kind bellman, who I believe was named Francisco, helped us in our room trying to get our converters for the blow dryer and hair straightener all sorted out. He spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out which of our converters was the right one. All the staff are very helpful and welcoming. One afternoon we came back at 5 to see that our room had not been cleaned and the breakfast tray was still there. We had accidentally turned on the Do Not Disturb switch so they did not service our room. We called down and realized that we were the culprits. The hotel had someone up within 5 minutes to clear the trays and bring up fresh towels and then cleaned the room when we left for dinner. The sign of a great hotel is one that immediately fixes a problem. I also highly recommend the afternoon tea. It was charming and very good. We can't wait to come back to this wonderful hotel! ",5,2017,06,02
105,Wonderful personal service!,Just spent 5 nights at this terrific luxury spot. Room was not large but was adequate and well appointed. Great piano bar. Breakfast was as good as it gets. The best part was the helpful and friendly staff...,5,2017,06,01
105,Exceptional Service and Great Location,"I usually won’t take the time to respond to email requests for feedback as I receive a large volume of them and generally they just don’t warrant the sacrifice of my time in completing them.

This case is an exception…..

We had a great experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair and I am delighted to provide feedback on our experience.

On our past trips to London we’ve stayed mostly at a small Bed & Breakfast establishment in South Kensington. We loved the facility because of the classic elegance, location and service we received in addition to the comfortable feeling we just don’t find in large hotels.

We love the Theater in London and usually purchase tickets at the Half Price Ticket Both in Leichester Square. The Mayfair area seemed the ideal location for convenience to the Theater District and London sightseeing.

On this trip we did some research on hotels that were located closer to central London. We found the Chesterfield Mayfair on Trip Advisor and chose the hotel because of the Mayfair location, comments by previous guests and the value compared to other highly rated hotels.

As this was our first stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, the promotion of a free night’s stay for our fourth night at the hotel pushed us over the edge in selecting the hotel over other choices that were available. (We stayed 5 nights).

Now, a few notes about our stay….

The location of the Chesterfield Mayfair is ideal. The hotel is located on a quiet, residential street away from the bustle of nearby commercial activity, yet easy walking distance to the Green Park Tube Stop. We found access to everything we wanted to see and do in London within either a short tube ride or easy walking distance. We took the tube several times daily during our first couple of days, but found walking to be almost as convenient, allowing us to see more of London from above ground and that was our primary choice the last couple of days of our visit.

Upon arrival at 1:00 we were delighted to find that our room was ready to check in. The staff person at the reception desk was friendly and the check in process was easy and completed in short order – I was pleased to be offered the option of settling my bill with either Pounds or Dollars.

We were escorted to our room by another friendly member of the staff who made sure that we were familiar with the common areas and features of the hotel and all of the nuances of our room.

We received a call from the front desk shortly after settling into our room to make sure we were comfortable and to ask if there was anything we needed. As it turns out we had a couple of minor requests for maps and ice and she dispatched someone who arrived at our room within a few minutes. (Nice touch! This would never happen this quickly in a large hotel…..). We were near the end of our trip so I needed a couple of items laundered and the staff person that delivered the items to our room explained that housekeeping could arrange to have that done for us…. However, rather than have us make a call to housekeeping to arrange for the laundry pick-up, she simply took the laundry for us and said she’d make the arrangements with housekeeping. (A small gesture but another example of exceptional service that became typical of our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair).

I wish I had the names of all of the staff people we interacted with, so that I could recognize them individually for the exceptional service we received, but suffice to say that the entire staff did a fabulous job during our stay.

In addition to the arrival experience I noted above, here is another classic example of the “over the top” service we received during our stay:

At check in, the staff recommended we consider having afternoon tea at the hotel. Following the recommendation, we booked that for our second afternoon. We thought the price for Tea initially seemed a little high but we wanted the experience. We were delighted find that Tea Service was in a beautiful setting under a glass roof that seemed like something out of a story book. Our 2 servers were friendly and attentive. We were offered “Everlasting Gobstoppers, Fizzy Lifting Drinks and Golden Tickets” to start off the Willy Wonka experience (Nice touch again!). We chose the Chesterfield Mayfair Blend for Tea (very happy with the choice) and a tower of sandwiches, scones and treats was delivered for us. We made it through the sandwiches and a couple of the scones with traditional clotted cream and jam and were feeling very satisfied (and full), it didn’t look like we were going to make it to the treats on the top of the tray and figured we’d just leave them and be satisfied. Our server checked in and asked if we wanted any more of anything (we were surprised to be offered more, since the initial delivery was impressive and generally enough for 2). I explained to the server that we were “satisfied, but at capacity”. He then pointed out that if we were staying at the hotel that we could take it to our room and have it later and said he’d happily bring us more. He refilled our tray and it then appeared as if it was just being delivered for the first time. When we were finished he promptly boxed everything in beautiful boxes for us to take back to our room. (We had a second tea experience later in our room and my initial feeling that the price was a little high was traded for a feeling of exceptional value). I almost hesitate to bring up the experience because I didn’t want the server to get in trouble for giving away food, but frankly it was just another great example of the staff going out of their way to may sure were felt valued and appreciated (almost like family).
You’d think that would have been enough to rave about, but on our way out of the dining room, the restaurant manager stopped us and made sure we took some extra candy with us out several jars placed at the dining room entrance (one more nice touch!)
We then got off of the elevator another staff person was delivering canapes on a cart to some of the rooms. We hadn’t requested anything but he asked if we wanted to take some to our room. We thanked him, but turned down the offer because were full and loaded with leftovers already. (But just one more example of the exceptional service we received during our stay)

During our stay we had Breakfast, Dinner and Afternoon Tea Service and visited the bar several times. The environment is welcoming and cozy. The staff was efficient, friendly and constantly recognized us during our stay.

We were very happy with our experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair.

It will now be our Hotel of choice when visiting London and we look forward to our next visit.",5,2017,06,01
105,Worth the Additional Expense,"In London with a friend for 5 days, we decided we wanted to be central and a bit pampered for a change. It was worth it.The staff were so friendly and solicitous. I came down with a cold halfway through the stay, and it was lovely to be able to order pots of tea to be sent up. Everything we asked for was provided. We enjoyed several pleasant breakfasts and an afternoon tea the day we arrived. Our beds were comfortable and the bathroom wonderful for two people sharing. We got in the habit of a nightcap in the bar most evenings because of the congenial atmosphere of the staff and a charming piano man who played most evenings. This is a very nice place to stay.",5,2017,06,01
105,THE best hotel in London,"Look no further! This is it! A warm luxurious homelike hotel with wonderfull staff and cosy, clean, beautiful rooms. Great breakfast.  Perfectly situated and close to everything. Worth every penny. You will not be disapointed. Can honestly not find a fault",5,2017,05,31
105,"Wonderful staff, Old World Elegance","We were met with the warmest welcome and throughout our stay the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  Our suite was large, elegant and very comfortable.  The location was wonderful for shopping and site seeing.  We would certainly recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,05,30
105,Premium Gin and Tonic Tasting,"We read a review of the gin and tonic tasting at the Chesterfield in our home town newspaper in NZ. We decided to stay at the Chesterfield based on the review and have just had the premium gin tasting. An experience not to be missed by any gin lovers. James, our host, was knowledgeable and engaging. Well worth travelling half way round the world! ",5,2017,05,30
105,"Great Location, Old World Charm",In a rapidly changing world The Chesterfield is a consistent gem. The service is exemplary. Th decor is Victorian and comfortable. The location is central Mayfair. Short walks to the U.S. Embassy and the memorable 9-11 memorial. Oxford Street is also nearby. I enjoy coming back to this home away from here me.  ,5,2017,05,29
105,Best Ever,"We have been here time and time again and it never ever fails to disappoint. 

The warmest of welcomes from such friendly staff who can never seem to do enough for you. 

The rooms are simply perfect and the bed is so comfy. 

Everything has been thought of and makes our stay perfect. 

Charlie at the Chesterfield is a must and the chocolate tea is yummy. It's a fun and relaxed experience with lots of tasty treats. 

Thank you and see you all again soon. 😀",5,2017,05,27
105,Great London Experience,"First trip to London for a 3 night pre cruise stay.  The Hotel is terrific.  One of the few hotels in London that actually have ""King Size"" beds.  Rooms were a decent size by European standards.  Clean and very well appointed.  Internet was first rate.  Service was outstanding, in every way (front desk, dining room, bellman, etc.) a first rate hotel  located in the Mayfair section of London which is outstanding, and close to all the attractions.  A short walk through beautiful Green Park brings you right to the front steps of Buckingham.  If your looking for a safe, friendly, and first class residence, this is the place for you.  My wife and I loved it.",5,2017,05,26
105,Great Afternoon Tea,"We went to the Chesterfield for afternoon tea. The hotel is beautiful, warm and elegant. The tea was perfect for children thanks to the Willy Wonka theme. The adult tea had the same theme but was closer to traditional tea with the typical offerings. The kids also enjoyed the surprise visit from Mr. Wonka. I liked the live pianist who alternated between standards, classical and contemporary music, including Bowie and the Stone Roses. ",5,2017,05,25
105,Fantastic,Second stay here and still fantastic. I love the ethos behind Red Coronation hotels. This [as is the Montague and Rubens] is run at the top of any hotel chain I know. Service is fantastic. Greeted with a smile and a name by concierge. Typical of the service was the fact that I had to take a call during our breakfast and the waitress came over and offered to take my meal away and keep it warm !! where would you ever get that. Just a top quality establishment. Yes its expensive but its worth it for a special treat. Location is brilliant and walkable to most places. Only slight point I would make is that the room was quite small are starting to look a tiny bit tired but nothing that would spoil your stay.,5,2017,05,25
105,Low key old fashioned service,"Had king room 202...small with very tight bathroom. Tub/shower hard to get into. First class amenities but just European  small.  Staff was outstanding and friendly. Breakfast was expensive  and  not very good. Yet, we would recommend and  stay here again.",5,2017,05,25
105,A Gem,"This small boutique hotel is just the perfect place to stay in London. The British ambiance, location near everything , high tea, lovely restaurant  and charming staff
are more than you could ask for! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a great experience in London.",5,2017,05,24
105,Wonderful 3 nights,"This hotel is top notch yet friendly and beautifully run.  We were treated warmly and helped effortlessly by a friendly staff who made our first time to London so much better.  

The location is terrific and the rooms lovely and big enough for 2.  Cozy bar, lovely dining room - highly recommend.",5,2017,05,23
105,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"The service was exceptional from beginning to end with our Willie Wonka themed Afternoon Tea.  The hotel also allows very well behaved dogs but ours was the only one on the day.  We were continually replenished with tea, sandwiches and scones and cakes and nothing was too much effort.  I'd recommend the smoked salmon sandwiches on beetroot bread and the chocolate scones (didn't like the sound of them but they tasted wonderful.  Also there's chance at the end to stock up on sweeties to take with you along with the cakes you can't fit in.",5,2017,05,23
105,The best hotel in the world!!,"This hotel is simply wonderful.
After reading many TripAdvisor reviews and speaking to the hotel staff i booked this hotel for a very special occasion (engagement). Living in Sydney made planning this event a little difficult but The Chesterfield done everything to take the stress out of planning this this day and making it a day to remember! from our swift check in and complementary upgrade to decorating our room with the romance package, everything was perfect
My fiancé absolutely loved the hotel and was blown away by the sheer kindness of the wonderful staff. It is a day we will never forget!!

Thanks you to The Chesterfield for making this day so special!

We are coming back to the UK for Christmas and will be sure to stay again!!

105,Top Notch,"The hotel is high end, but warm and inviting. The staff was wonderful to us during our 9 day stay. Special kudos to Joseph who always welcomed us with a smile and a chat. The room was wonderful. We enjoyed many evenings having a cocktail at the end of the day enjoying the wonderful piano player. 
Great location with a lot to do nearby. Close enough to Hyde and Green Parks that I could take a nice walk every day.
Enjoy a Chesterfield Martini--it was delicious!",5,2017,05,22
105,The Gin Expereince,"We really enjoyed our Gin Experience last night in the bar at The Chesterfield. Jade was amazing, her knowledge of gin was fantastic. Our favorite gin was the Martin Miller. Would highly recommend this,",5,2017,05,19
105,Great location and lots to like,"A very British old hotel in the heart of Mayfair. We chose the Chesterfield for its proximity to Hyde Park, Oxford Street, Knightsbridge, Piccadilly Sq, etc

The rooms are fairly small but comfortable. There are plenty of wall plugs for electronics, a desk to work on your laptop, a flat screen tv (about as big as one could fit). There was no refrigerator which is kind of a must these days. The room was very bright with two large windows (not much of a view though) which made it feel light and spacious even with the low 7 1/2' ceilings.

The bathroom is always key to me for making a stay as comfortable as possible. The shower is very narrow and you must climb into a deep sided tub to get in, which could make it difficult for the elderly. It has both a rain overhead shower head, which was only a few inches above my head, with great flow, pressure and temperature. There was also a hand held head which was great. If it were a door wider, it couldn't get any better. It has one of those strange British half shower doors which I suppose is needed to give enough room when the shower is very narrow (as most seem to be).

The continental breakfast buffet has a huge selection of breakfast items and everything was very good. There is a full breakfast menu as well should you want eggs or additional hot foods. A nice way to start your day.

Pros

Location, location, location
Excellent service
Comfortable room and bath
Lots of natural light
Heated bathroom floor
Great towels

Cons
Slow wifi
Narrow shower with low ceiling and deep tub to climb over
No in room refrigerator
Small tight rooms

Depending on what rate you are paying (and it appears they are all over the board), the Chesterfield Mayfair is a very nice choice to explore many of the hot spots in London. It's walking distance from so many places in the West End.",4,2017,05,18
105,"Great location, wonderful staff. Perfect hotel.","We spent a week in this delightful hotel. The room was very comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, the staff was very accommodating and went out of their way to satisfy and help. Only wish we had had more time in London. Totally recommended.",5,2017,05,17
105,Very British in super Mayfair location,"We stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed the location, atmosphere, service and staff. The hotel is charming, small and quiet. Our room was a superior king and the only drawback for a couple is that it is very tight in the bathroom and there isn't much of a sitting area in the room. Next time we will book a suite.",4,2017,05,17
105,Perfect!,"After an eight year hiatus, my wife and I spent a week here and were just as pleased as previously. Friendly and helpful staff and beautiful accommodations contribute to make this hotel one of London's best, particularly for the price. Would recommend opting for the ""breakfast included"" package as the both the continental and full English breakfast are excellent and available with this package. All facilities including the restaurant and bar with its upscale pub atmosphere are fantastic. The hotel is extremely well located in Mayfair (central London) and convenient to theatre district, excellent dining choices, good shopping and many of London's major attractions including Buckingham Palace. Would strongly recommend!",5,2017,05,17
105,A perfect stay in a great neighborhood ,"I stayed in this hotel nearly 20 years ago and remembered it fondly, so when we were looking into a trip to London it popped into my mind. I realized it was part of the Red Carnation Hotel group. I had seen this group advertised on Uniworld river cruise boats. I believe they are owned by the same company. The cruises have always been fabulous, so I trusted that the hotel would be comfortable too, and it is. It's small and cozy in just the right way to feel like you're really in London. The bar and restaurant have impeccable service, and the daily breakfast was scrumptious. The room wasn't large but was roomy enough. This isn't really a luxury stay in the sense that there is no pool nor a spa, but if you're looking for warm leather chairs and fabulous afternoon teas, and the sort of cozy masculine look of a nice library, look no further.",5,2017,05,16
105,Great hotel location and service,"They pampered us for the week we stayed there.   The service was truly outstanding. . Room very comfy with lots of amenities, including radiant heated bathroom floors, plush linens, great plumbing, very quiet and nicely furnished. Good restaurant and sumptuous breakfast buffet and nice hot options.  Terrifically convenient location - Green Park underground and close to Shephard,s Market with many good restaurants. I travel a lot and really find this hotel exceptionally friendly, comfortable and accommodating.",5,2017,05,16
105,Quaint & Cozy in Mayfair ,"Spent 4 nights here traveling with my father as a birthday gift for him. Hotel was perfectly located in this affluent neighborhood. Professional staff, comfortable-but European rooms (aka: small) but well thought out. Good size closets and drawer space. Nice bed linens, towels and bath products. Comfortable bed. 
The full breakfast served in the dining room or as room service was great! Loved the bar-bartenders were friendly and created fantastic cocktails--cozy atmosphere. 
We were able to walk to the tube a few blocks away-Great shopping and restaurants nearby-would stay here again.

105,"Great hotel, great location",We stayed here for four nights and had fantastic service.  The staff was incredibly attentive and the room (Suite 529) was beautifully appointed and well stocked with lots of amenities.  The breakfast buffet was delicious with great service in the restaurant.  Overall great hotel in a great location.,5,2017,05,16
105,A first class British experience!,"If you want to be treated like royalty stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The staff and service was 5*.  The extremely thoughtful extra touches so enhanced our stay. The room was magnificent, daily canapés delivered to our room at cocktail hour, breakfast food and service beautiful, concierge extremely helpful, kindness from all staff members.  Our stay at the Chesterfield so enhanced our week in London.  It felt like coming home after long days of exploring London.",5,2017,05,15
105,Excellent place to stay,"Stayed here for two night in may, excellent location and hotel, staff 10/10, facilities 10/110, however room 310 not a very nice view, so try to avoid.

Otherwise, the room was excellent, breakfast very good and the staff at a major hotel were one of the best I have encountered, keep up the good work, you are all a credit to the Hotel group.",5,2017,05,15
105,Exceptional service,"I have only good things to say of my recent stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.
The level of service was outstanding, from the greeting at the front door to every member of staff we encountered during our stay. Antonio from Room Service was so friendly and welcoming, excellent service.
The room was lovely, a very comfortable bed, robes, tea tray everything we could possibly want and I'm sure if we had needed anything they would have delivered.
We had a fabulous breakfast each morning which included a large selection cereals, fruits, yogurts. Cold meats, smoked salmon, cheeses, pastries and more, plus menu items cooked to order. Very friendly waiting staff especially Carolina who was delightful.
The location is perfect, plenty of restaurants just around the corner, walking distance to Hyde park. 
A great place to stay on a trip to London. I cannot fault the hotel, we will definately stay there again, highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2017,05,15
105,Child friendly - and it shows!,"As my husband and young son were gearing up for our trip, I started to get nervous that maaaaybe we chose the wrong hotel. Pre-toddler we wouldn't think twice about staying there but now we had an almost two year old and the hotel looked so elegant and nice. How would he handle it? How would the staff handle him?  Worry not wanderlust parents!! You do not have to give up comfort and style for mediocrity. 

Now for those looking for a more adult hotel, don't panic. We were the only couple (that I know of) with a child at the hotel. I didn't see any other young kids there so please don't think kids were running amok.

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome. We were flying in from Germany and my son got carsick on the way to the airport. As any parent can attest, a child's blankie is their life and well, this one needed a serious washing. I politely asked about sending it out to be dry cleaned and was instead told they would wash it in house and would deliver it to our room within the hour. There was not a spot on it upon its return! A miracle occurred in that washer! Charlie made this happen and it was a gesture like that which made us know we would be in good hands.

We were upgraded to a king suite where his pack n play was already set up with a robe and organic shampoos and wash for our son. Adorable! The room was spotlessly clean. It actually made you comfortable wearing one of the complimentary robes and using the glassware in the room. No other hotel has done that for me. You just feel so taken care of.

I was having trouble working the tv (press power and the number 1) and I asked an employee who was walking down the hallway for help. I thanked him and he simply said ""that's what I'm here for!"" And he meant it! No snark or airs about it.

The next morning at breakfast (complimentary I might add), our son started to fuss and when I gave my husband a look like maybe we should leave, a waitress brought over a lollipop and a teddy bear. She told us not to worry, that he was fine! 

I managed to escape for the afternoon at the hotel while my son napped. I read the paper in its entirety while sipping on their house tea and eating the tastiest sandwiches and desserts. Pure bliss! At first , you would think the desserts wouldn't work because they seemed so eclectic and mismatched but with each bite you will wonder why you question anything at all about this hotel. They clearly have this down to a science.

Alas, we did not find ourselves at the bar but it was always packed and everyone had a smile on their face. 

I want to thank The Chesterfield for their outstanding service. We were greeted with a smile at every single turn. The little things go such a long way. We will return one day but in the meantime will sing your praises to all.",5,2017,05,14
105,Awesome Hotel and Staff,"My first trip to London and accidentally selected the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel but I'm so glad that I did. The entire staff here goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. Everything is really clean and the bedding awesome.
The bar area has a piano and in the evenings John will plan anything you request. 
Ian and Antonio in there will accommodate your every whim without you ever asking. 
My son and I just can't say enough great things about the room and amenities. 

Thank you all!! ",5,2017,05,14
105,Charming and welcoming hotel in the heart of beautiful Mayfair,"From the moment we arrived, my friend and I were delighted.  Every aspect of this hotel is perfect.  Beautiful rooms and luxurious bedding certainly contributed to our wonderful stay.  But it was the people who made it even better.  The concierges couldn't have been more helpful, arranging reservations at restaurants, helping us navigate how to get from here to there.  Sitting at the bar is a special treat.  Lovely bartenders and ambience. Doormen,  front desk personal - all greet you with a smile.  Cannot wait to come back.",5,2017,05,13
105,Warmth and Elegance,"Stayed for a week in this lovely home-away-from home!  The room was small but beautifully appointed.  The bed was very comfy with such soft bedding.  The bathroom was done in Carrara marble and very spa-like, right down to the beautifule fixtures.  The rainhead shower was SO relaxing!  Nightly piano music in the bar was such a treat and the ambiance was warm.  But, the MOST wonderful element of the  Chesterfield is its people!!! EVERYONE was so kind and totally INVESTED in making our stay special.  Charlie at the front desk just couldn't do enough for us.  The concierge, Tony, was so engaged in arranging daily adventures for us.  And in the bar, James & Teddy were so polished- but warm at the same time.  We're wanting to return to celebrate our 25th anniversary in August but the higher hotel rates at that time of year may prevent it.  But, at some point, we will return. Can't wait!",5,2017,05,12
105,Great hotel at the center of London,"The hotel has a great localization, close to underground station and many buses lanes! 
The staff is very gentle and kind, always!
Rooms are big, comfortable and not noisy!
The only negative point is the breakfast, that is vert expensive! We decided to have breakfast in one of the several cafés close to the hotel!
Besides that, it's perfect choice in London!",5,2017,05,10
105,Plans changed,"I cancelled the cruise and will go on my 2nd CIE tour of Ireland , Wales and southern London...After the tour we will spend an entire week in this beautiful hotel. I stayed here in 2016 and fell in love with this masterpiece.
The area surrounding this hotel is so beautiful. And within walking distance are some great places to eat.
places in Sheppards Market like Ye Grapes and the Kings Arms are wonderful along with many other wonder restaurants. 
See you soon Chesterfield...BTW, the Tea service set are a great compliment to the room.",5,2017,05,07
105,"Wow, what a great find!","We enjoyed a wonderful afternoon at the Chesterfield in Mayfair. We started with the Willy Wonker afternoon tea which was delightful. Everything was perfect from the enigmatic Mr Wonker, glorious food, delicious tea to the wonderful service. We then moved onto the Gin tasting experience in the bar. We tasted three different Gins and learnt about where they came from and how to best enjoy them, perfect. We then sat back and relaxed whilst listening to the pianist. One of the things that sets the Chesterfield apart is the staff, they are lovely, professional, helpful, attentive yet never intrusive. I would highly recommend the hotel for a couple, friends, or even with young children. We look forward to returning soon. We can't remember all of the staff that looked after us, but special thanks to Emma, Kirsty, Freddy and James you made my birthday very special :)",5,2017,05,07
105,Superb Location and hotel,We have just returned from our 8th visit. Fabulous staff great rooms excellent location brilliant food and bar service we never usually score anywhere 5 but this place is the exception. You will not find better!,5,2017,05,07
105,The Best High Tea Ever!,This was our favorite high tea of all time. My husband and I were indulged by a very attentive group of servers. The teas were from all over the world. They were excellent. Our sandwiches were exquisite. The smoked salmon was my favorite. It was perfectly smoked. The sweets were wonderfully addictive. I also augmented my tea with some champagne. We frankly found high tea at the Ritz to be lacking as compared to the superb high tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Our deep gratitude to both the staff and the chef for an impressive experience.,5,2017,05,07
105,A gem of a hotl,"My friend and I have just returned from our annual Spring break weekend in London. We always stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair because it is a wonderful hotel that fulfils all our needs. It exudes class, has beautiful rooms throughout and such a lovely warm atmosphere. The staff are all so friendly, professional and welcoming, truly a gem of a hotel.",5,2017,05,04
105,Comfortable British Style in a great location!,"This will have been our third visit to The Chesterfield this year and after a bit of a rocky start--our upgrade wasn't available which was disappointing but promptly dealt with by the manager so that we received a comfortable room nonetheless--we had another pleasant stay at this quintessentially British hotel. The staff are attentive, the public rooms and especially the bar and library are cozy and welcoming, and the location is perfect for getting to all the attractions we were interested in seeing either via tube, bus, cab or walking. We much prefer staying in a small hotel with personality such as The Chesterfield that reflects the country we're in rather than a large, corporate cookie-cutter one. ",4,2017,05,03
105,Fantastic,"Was there for 4 nights. Amazing staff, fantastic location, tea was great, rooms were comfortable . Would highly recommend. Very close to the train and can walk to the palace easily. Good food around but hands down the best part is the attentive and helpful staff there. ",5,2017,05,03
105,Excellent,"I would recommend this hotel to stay.
Staff, location, rooms, service, breakfast... everything is excellent.
So, if you want to stay in a nice calm place, close to the center of the city, the chesterfield mayfair is a very good option.",5,2017,05,03
105,A Wonderful English Culinary Experience,"I spent a great night at the Chesterfield in Mayfair, London last weekend.  The ambiance was traditional, warm and welcoming and the food spectacular.  What stood out for us, I was there with my family, was the tremendous, caring service.   We all had the traditional roast beef and yorkshire pudding for our main course and the suggestions for wine with each course complemented the food perfectly.  Thanks to Loris Lucchini for looking after us and making us feel completely at home - 10 out of 10!",5,2017,05,03
105,What a fantastic hotel!!!,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the Chesterfield and we loved our stay.  The hotel is very well situated in the Mayfair district, which is my favourite in London because it's so quaint and posh.  We were nicely welcomed upon our check in by a lovely young lady named Charlie, she was really nice.  All of the staff is very nice and very helpfull at this hotel.  Our room was perfect and ready upon our arrival (at 10h00am..wow).  Breakfast is awesome (either delivered to your room or at the restaurant)  At the hotel bar at night, there's a pianist and it's the perfect place to have a night cap drink before going to sleep.
Would return in a heartbeat!",5,2017,05,02
105,"Excellent Vacation, Wonderful Hotel","We were delighted with our stay. All of the staff were attentive and helpful in all ways. My wife, son and I enjoyed​ our delicious meals, luxurious accommodations and central location within walking distance of so much. We highly recommend this hotel and hope to stay here again. ",5,2017,05,01
105,If I could give a higher grade than 5 - I would,"Beautifull hotel, Lovely stuff - each and everyone of them.
   beautifull and  comfortable  rooms. Old-briitish-style decoretd, ...
there was not a thing we asked that couldn't be done, and with a big smile.
Great location.
The stay at this hotel  just upgrade our London's experience",5,2017,05,01
105,"Clean,  comfortable and convenient ","We will stay another 2more nights (4nights) . Room is clean , but a bit small for us because we have 3 big bags. Bed is big and the softness is just about right! Pillow was too soft but after we ask they gave us 2more pillows that is not too soft. Breakfast was so good. People here are willing to serve. Underground is not too far .... so .. this is Nice... ",4,2017,04,30
105,Fantastic hotel ,I stayed for 3 nights on a business trip and was very impressed. Yes the rooms are on the small side but that is more than made up for by the excellent service and ambience. Breakfast was lovely and I had a drink in the bar which was very friendly and relaxing. Location also excellent. Would highly recommend. ,5,2017,04,30
105,Good but not great...,"Given the price of the hotel, I feel there are better options in the area. The decor is quite nice in the lobby area but the rooms are quite dated. I don't mind old-school decor but for example, the telephone looked like it had been there for 20 years. The bathroom was quite nice though and quite clean which is always important. An unfortunate incident occurred when I left my room card at reception and clearly wrote a note to say my partner would be arriving when I was out and to give him the room card so he could go to bed. It was late evening and the porter was not only unhelpful but he was quite rude and aggressive when my partner arrived and asked for access to the room. I understand security concerns but he jumped down his neck before even checking if there was a note from me at the desk. My partner was quite upset, he felt like the porter was accusing him of something! We got over it and the restaurant where we had breakfast was lovely and the breakfast was good quality. I have stayed at quite a few different hotels in Mayfair and I honestly don't think I would come back here and I certainly don't think it is value for money. There are many other options in this price range in the area.",3,2017,04,28
105,Charming Hotel in London,"We had a lovely Superior corner room, which met our expectations.  Everything was kept clean, the bed was very comfortable, bathroom with two different and easy-to-use showers nice, with bathropes and slippers. The staff remembered us with ""some extra"" like fruit several times. There was a complimentary 4G Handy mobile which was great when sightseeing. We enjoyed the nice breakfast items ordered separately plus the buffet with excellent Scottish salmon.  We also had some GT at the charming club restaurant, it was very popular on some nights. Also Chesterfield Afternoon tea seemed quite tempting. The staff showed us the British courtesy all over during our stay. I would recommend this hotel to my friends.",5,2017,04,28
105,resolved issues professionally,"We stayed at The Chesterfield for about the 5th time, for a special occasion.
Always been excellent.
However, we experienced a few problems and these were sorted out quickly, efficiently and professionally.

We will be back again soon
Tim",4,2017,04,27
105,Gem of a hotel in Mayfair!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield for a week. From the time we arrived until our departure, the staff was attentive, kind and helpful. We appreciated all the lovely touches-bath salts and chocolates for nightly turndown service and cupcakes upon arrival and the evening prior to our departure. The room was incredibly cozy and clean, and the bathroom was lovely, especially for Euro standards. You definitely get your money's worth at this hotel and will be incredibly happy if you choose to stay there.

The location of the hotel is prime. It's safe, and within walking distance to many major sights-Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Harrods, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, the Thames, you name it. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel has excellent pubs and restaurants. I'd recommend Shepard's Market, The Guinea Grill, and The Punch Bowl.",4,2017,04,27
105,Just Perfect,"The Chesterfield is a wonderful hotel in a great location. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate your every need. The rooms are not overly large but standard English fare size for it's pedigree. The linens and toiletries are of premium standards and the attention to to detail is admired. The bar is comfortable and service and attention to detail is obvious and appreciated.
If you are looking for a four star hotel in the middle of Mayfair...well you just found it. 
Try and book the hotel as far in the future as you can for a good rate",5,2017,04,27
105,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"I took my mum here for a Christmas afternoon tea. It was a wonderful experience. I have a nut allergy and my mum is vegetarian and doesn't eat eggs so we were a tricky pair to accomodate, however, they were exceptional and made us sandwiches to our tastes. They were very generous. The sweet selection of the afternoon tea was fabulous, with Christmas themed macarons and cakes. We were given complimentary mulled wine, endless cups of teas and cakes. The atmosphere was wonderful, it was busy but not too loud. We spent a good 2 hours in there and didn't feel like we were being rushed at all. Highly recommend this for a Christmas treat.",5,2017,04,26
105,Wonderful Fabulous Hotel,"We recently spent a week at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.  We went with another couple and all four of us loved our stay.  The room was very well appointed with every amenity, even fresh red carnations.  The bed was comfortable and the curtains allowed the room to be dark so we could sleep even when the sun came up.  The staff were always helpful and considerate.  The hotel offers a breakfast buffet and it is worth every penny.  We did look at other places to eat, but after considering their a la carte menus, the Chesterfield was better than anything else available in the area for breakfasts.  Their dining room in the evening also offered wonderful choices.  The front desk was able to give us directions and offer excellent advice.  The hotel is well located.  You can easily walk to tourist attractions and public transportation.  We highly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair.  If we return to London, we would not consider staying anywhere else.  It was truly a home away from home.",5,2017,04,26
105,Afternoon tea,"How nice to find a tea with a theme. Willy Wonka! Just so good. Pleanty of choice and all the food was plentiful, as much as you could want. Service impeccable lead by Teresa I think. Just a very good experience, and I hope to come back again before Christmas. If in doubt where to go for afternoon tea , this is the place.",5,2017,04,24
105,Home away from home,"I cannot say enough good about this hotel. You can walk anywhere from Oxford Street to Buckingham Palace, and the Green Park tube station is a 5-minute walk away. The staff is amazingly helpful and courteous, from the people at the desk to the doormen in their top hats. Before I had even paid the taxi driver on my arrival, my bags had been carried inside and they were checking me in. Great little room, very clean - beautiful bathrooms with heated floors, and the real bonus: a free local smartphone with unlimited data and calls. That was a lifesaver when I was out and about, looking up maps, etc. If I'm in London, I will be staying here.",5,2017,04,23
105,Wonderful holiday,"This was our first visit and we could not have selected a finer spot to stay. Perfectly located to shopping, transportation, Hyde and St. James parks, yet quiet enough for for down time. The service is impeccable yet unobtrusive. Our lovely room was the perfect oasis after each extensive day of touring the beautiful city. Tastefully decorated and the bath area was delightful with a very powerful shower! The room was very quiet as we could not hear anything from adjoining rooms. The rates are quite reasonable for the area, we look forward to another visit in the near future.",5,2017,04,21
105,Wonkerlisous,"We had an afternoon tea voucher for Christmas and used it today I have to say very nice indeed. Staff could not do enough to make us feel welcome and comfortable. 

The tea and food was very enjoyable and also we could have as many plates as we wished along with as much tea and try different flavours

This is defiantly a place I would not only recommend but would go back for afternoon tea again",5,2017,04,21
105,Amazing english style hotel,"My husband and I have stayed there for a weekend of shopping in London and it was the perfect boutique style hotel. The reviews were not missleading at all and its proximity to the best shopping areas of London made the hotel perfect for us.
The breakfast was typical english breakfast foods with a lot of other healhier options such a fruits which we did enjoy. The rooms were spotless clean and the reception staff very helpful with directions and informations about the area.
For the price we paid, we got our money's worth and then some, a good english experience !",5,2017,04,20
105,Outstanding London experience,"We spent a week at the Chesterfield Mayfair and couldn't have been happier.  From the warm greeting each time we'd return, to the accommodating staff during breakfast, we felt pampered and valued.  Our king room was a decent size for London and beautifully appointed.  The breakfast was excellent; I'm missing all the attentive service already. The location is outstanding.  It's a short walk to the tube and very conducive to walking as well.  Close to Buckingham Palace and the other Westminster attractions. Also close to the shopping area around Oxford Street.  There are several good restaurants nearby, especially in the Shepherd Market which is very close to the hotel.  We actually cancelled dinner reservations farther away and ate more often in the Shepherd Market since we were so pleased with the variety available so close to ""home"".",5,2017,04,19
105,Wonderful Traditional British Hotel ,"My husband & I really enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Our room was quiet & clean but very, very, small.  The ""included"" breakfast was really good. Lots of great choices & delicious coffee. Bernadett was an energetic, excellent hostess & it was nice to see her every morning.  The Chesterfield is in a fabulous location & we rarely took the tube, choosing to walk because of how central it is. All in all, a great place to lay your head while in London. ",4,2017,04,19
105,Very English,"The Chesterfield hotel Is housed in a very old building on the corner of Charles Street and Queen street. Typically British, small rooms unless you take a suite which is expensive and as large as a normal room in many of the hotels across the world. But the class is seen in the supplies. Very well thought out bathroom though the jacuzzi is noisy and not very relaxing. 

I wish they would offer different pillows for the international traveller. Their pillows are too soft. 

The bar is open till 1 am and has some great cocktails. Try your preferences. 

The breakfast is limited but they offer gluten free bread so I am a happy camper. ",4,2017,04,17
105,Wow !,"Really very nice . All staff were so nice and friendly. Great location and rooms so comfortable and well appointed ! The Birthday card and cupcake for my birthday were very well received. Will definitely return so nice to find somewhere well
Located and very well appointed ! ",5,2017,04,16
105,Classy boutique hotel,"The room was elegant. Plenty of room and all the necessary amenities. The location was perfect in the middle of Mayfair. The service is perfect. Our price was very, very reasonable given the quality of the room. We did not use the restaurant and can't comment on it. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,04,16
105,Stunning hotel,"A stunning hotel!!!
Right in Mayfair
The Chesterfield is a very English affair!!
Beautiful interior through out the hotel
Wonderful rooms!!! 
Great dinning options!!
very friendly and helpful staff
Just the perfect location for your London stay!!!",5,2017,04,13
105,"Great location, lovely staff","This hotel was fantastic. Our room was lovely and spacious for a city hotel. The location was ideal and we were able to walk freely around central London. No need for a taxi.

The staff were fabulous and couldn't do enough for us.

There is a nice bar and a library room. Both are open until late at night.

Breakfast was lovely too with a huge selection to choose from.",5,2017,04,11
105,Delectable Dining Experience at Butler's Restaurant ,"Goodness me, The Chesterfield, Mayfair really is a glorious place. 
My fiancé & I went to Butler's Restaurant to celebrate our birthdays but beforehand we visited the Terrace Bar where we quaffed delicious cocktails and were supplied with the best bar snacks around (caramelised pecans, Twiglets & the fattest green olives). Amazing & talented bar staff always ensure you are suitably snacked & tippled.
We then ventured to the restaurant where we were greeted by the manager, Loris Lucchini, who proved to be an excellent chap, both attentive & an intelligent conversationalist. 
To start we both had the Orkney King Diver Scallops, which are served with Jerusalem artichoke, Granny Smith apple, hazelnuts & a pulled pork croquette. We barely spoke whilst eating this exquisite offering. The flavours popped and mingled to create a truly scrumptious starter.
For main, I had the Aubrey Allen Dry Aged Rib Eye Steak 280g, served with flat mushrooms, plum tomato, grilled onion & hand cut chips (with parmesan & truffle oil - 'ah what the heck?' thought I & they were pure naughty deliciousness). The steak was cooked medium rare & was perfection, cutting as though a hot knife through butter. Juicy tomato & flavourful mushroom added to the traditional steak & chips wonderfully.
My other half decided to plump for what Butlers's are renowned for, their Dover Sole, which he had served meunière & with wilted spinach & buttery new potatoes. Our waiter (whose name escapes me sadly) expertly removed the bones, like the trick where you whisk the tablecloth from off the table and beneath the crockery leaving everything perfectly in tact on the table. It was melt in the mouth yumminess personified.
And then came dessert, mine three scoops of ice cream (bourbon vanilla, Malteser & salted caramel) - good gods!!! 
My fella had Bea Tollman's honeycomb ice cream & was in raptures (I can vouch for his reasoning & unwillingness to let me try more than one sampling spoonful).
Our wine was Bouchard Finlayson Pinot Noir, which went splendidly with both fish & meat. 
Following desert we were presented with a stand filled with unbelievably delicious petit fours, mini raspberry macarons & some balls of coconut truffles with a sweet berry interior - wow! 
In fact WOW all round. Perfect from start to finish. And they have menus for smaller budgets too, which also look incredible.
I urge you to go & check it out & feel like you're the most special people they've ever met. 
We will most certainly be back. 
",5,2017,04,11
105,Distinict character and personable service,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a superb 4 star hotel in an ideal location for tourists visiting London.
We started with a standard Twin room, which was nice but suffered a bit from noise coming from a nearby consturction site. The hotel's staff swiftly rectified the situation by relocating us to a beautiful room on the other side of the hote.
The hotel is beautifully decorated and has lots of charm. It is far from one of those run-of-the-mill chain hotels. On top of this, service overall is excellent and friendly.
We had a wonderful time at the Chesterfield and wholeheartedly recommend it.",5,2017,04,09
105,OLD WORLD CHARM AND GRACE!,"First time to the Chesterfield and must confess I enjoyed it very much. A touch of charm,class and style. Very friendly staff, well managed. Great restaurant. Dover sole is fabulous! Ask the waiter to take it off the bone! less messy if you are not used to doing it yourself! Super breakfast, great rooms, central location. 5 mins by taxi to central London about £6. Better than walking. I would go again in a heartbeat.",5,2017,04,07
105,Well located,This old but chic Mayfair hotel is well located and priced for the area. My only niggle is the breakfast was a bit limited. Rooms clean and a bit tired but what you expect in London. The service was excellent.,4,2017,04,06
105,A pleasant hotel,"I don`t have enough words to say about this fabulous hotel. We felt so cared for in every way during our stay. The service was impeccable. Rooms are very beautiful. The beds were incredibly comfortable with luxurious ultra soft bedding. We met friends for drinks in the cub bar, for hotel guests only- which was divine. The location is unbeatable -in the heart of Mayfair.",5,2017,04,05
105,Old fashioned but good hotel in Mayfair,"I've stayed at a number of small hotels in Mayfair now and I will come back to this one. Although a bit old fashioned the beds are comfortable, the bar is fun, breakfast is good and the staff without fail friendly and talkative. ",5,2017,04,05
105,Fantastic hotel,"In London for three days on vacation.  This hotel exceeded our expectations in all directions.  The accommodations were great, staff are pleasant and helpful.  We enjoyed breakfast each morning in their restaurant and the food is stellar with many options to choose from.  We could choose from both the buffet (a meal in itself) and the menu.  Creative dishes with superior presentation.  Try the bubble and squeak! The location of the hotel fit our needs perfectly. The area is relatively quiet yet only a five minute walk from Piccadilly road and Green Park and about 7 minutes to the underground.  We actually walked to the Royal Albert Hall from the hotel.  The nicest feature in the room was the complimentary use of a cellular device to carry with us around town.  We used this device for maps, routes, hours of museums, and everything else that you would use your phone for.  Nice service.  I would definitely recommend the Chesterfield when in London.  ",5,2017,04,04
105,Excellent afternoon tea,"We were given a voucher for our Christmas present for a Champagne Afternoon Tea and today was the day. The Chesterfield does a special Willy Wonka themed tea complete with the man himself talking to the guests. The restaurant is very nice, the staff charming and helpful and all the food was excellent. We had extra sandwiches, scones and lots of special themed cakes. A very pleasant afternoon. At full price it is possibly a little overpriced but on the other hand it's all about location. ",5,2017,04,01
105,Breakfast and Dinner,"Having had a wonderful one night stay in October 2016 with my husband, we decided to treat our daughter who works in fine dining to the wonderful Chesterfield experience.  We visited for breakfast and dinner on our Christmas shopping day in the West End.  

The food was outstanding in both cases and service which is what the Chesterfield does best was fantastic.  Laurice is such a good Restaurant Manager and in the evening, it was wonderful seeing him deliver giridon service with my turkey and another guest's salmon.  

The only downside is that the restaurant isn't busier in the evening as this would create a better atmosphere.  We had a beautiful half bottle of red and also cocktails in the bar which were fantastic.  

We will definitely be back and hope to have another stay in the not too distant future.  

We were made to feel like valued customers at all times even though we weren't staying.  Thank you again to all staff.",5,2017,03,30
105,Lovely Terrace Bar,"Joined friends who were staying at the hotel for drinks . The hotel itself seems very traditional but the staff are all so welcoming and friendly . The bar had a lovely atmosphere and we enjoyed a fantastic gin and tonic before going off for dinner . A pianist played , the nibbles were tasty and plentiful and the barman were super ... I would go again for an early evening drink . ",4,2017,03,30
105,"Great hotel, great staff.","Just spent six days at the Chesterfield hotel. What a treat. The staff are wonderful, so pleasant and friendly without being intrusive. The bar is cozy and the service was the best. The room is a little on the small side but the amenities are good. 
I think what makes this hotel so enjoyable are the staff. The buffet breakfast is  plentiful and the menu items offer a good variety. All things considered a great stay and a very convenient location very close to Green Park underground.
This is my third visit, would continue coming back.",5,2017,03,29
105,Charlie and the Chocolate factory afternoon tea,"We visited her recently as a family of 4 for a birthday celebration. All the staff of the hotel was welcoming and friendly, our waitresses was lovely and the waiter and head I believe Marius was great helped out the whole time offering more food etc throughout. This was definitely one of the best afternoon teas we have visited for not only location and atmosphere but afternoon tea was beautiful. We was asked if we would like to take the rest home which we did and our waitress kindly also gave us lots more of the delicious scones. Would recommend this to all friends and family and would return. Thanks again for the lovely day. ",5,2017,03,28
105,A guilty pleasure,Charlie and The Chocolate Factory themed afternoon tea was great value for money. The staff were friendly and very accommodating and there was no shortage of top ups for sweet and savoury treats. We were even allowed to take a goodie bag away with us - perfect !,5,2017,03,25
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"What can I say?  Well from the first moment we had the door opened for us, to when we were taken to where our table was for afternoon tea, it was perfect!

105,Birthday celebrations ,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair we got a good deal and worth every penny. Took in Jersey Boys at Piccadilly which was within walking distance as is Bucking Palace. Local pub the Footman is historic 1700's and served great ale and friendly staff. 
The hotel food was excellent as was the service. Expensive yes but worth it! 
Highly recommend.",5,2017,03,23
105,A light evening snack,"Really nice atmosphere in the terrace bar along with a fine selection of home made nibbles ranging from sausage rolls, chicken on sticks, toasted sandwiches etc etc. Washed down with a few glasses of cold beer or the specially Bouchard Finlayson fine wines from Red Carnation from RSA.",5,2017,03,22

105,Mother son trip,"My son and I just spent 4 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel was lovely and met our expectations. The location of this hotel was great with the green park underground around the corner, Hyde Park, and a great restaurant area nearby (Shepherd Market). The best part of our stay was definitely two individuals though. Ian at the bar went out of his way to accommodate us and specifically my son who has a peanut and tree nut allergy. The other individual is Joshua, the concierge. Joshua is a sweet, kind man. He made us feel special during our stay and we looked forward to seeing him each morning. We had a few unique tourist ideas, such as hiking from Seaford to Eastbourne, and Joshua went out of his way to investigate the logistics for these adventure. I will definitely return to this hotel.

105,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,This is the second time my daughter and I have stayed at this hotel. I read the reviews on TripAdvisor and they were all great. We stayed here in November 2016 and now this March 2017. The hotel is very comfortable and clean. I sleep very well here. We go to the Bar downstairs every night and the staff is Amazing. James and Vincent are FABULOUS. They treat us like Royalty. They always have a smile and are so friendly. We look forward to seeing them both. Vincent actually remembered our drinks from November. We couldn't believe it but that is why this Hotel is so special. I wouldn't stay at any where else in London. The afternoon Tea is fabulous too. I can't wait for my next visit.,5,2017,03,18
105,afternoon tea,"One of my favourite afternoon tea  venues ( and Ive been to a few). Took some visitors from Germany for an afternoon tea experience and it didnt disappoint! Food is lovely, the scones, especially the chocolate ones,  were sublime. Service was attentive  especially from Marius the restaurant supervisor who made my guests feel very welcome to the hotel and London as for one it was the first time in the U.K. A 5 for him.
We had the Charlie and the chocolate themed classic afternoon tea which my guests absolutely loved. Word of warning dont eat all the second plate of sandwiches if you want to eat all the cakes!",4,2017,03,18
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"Well what can I say.....from yhe moment we arrived we were treated superbly! This was my first ever afternoon tea and I'm afraid of going to any others as it won't ever be as good. The food was so fresh and tasted amazing, champagne was top notch, variety of teas was more then I could have hoped for and have to say my favourite was the Willy Wonka tea but try as many as you can. Nothing was ever a trouble for the staff, we had some allergies to work with and they were ever so accommodating and changed what we had to fit our needs. Getting a golden envelope that you can't open at the end is actually killing me but great gimmick to get people to go back as you can get free things but only if unopened on your next visit.

If you get the chance or aren't sure about where to go then hit this place up you won't be dissapointed and will never want to go anywhere else.

Thank you",5,2017,03,17
105,Accommodation for a perfect break!,"What a brilliant few days we had here!!  
 
Thank you so much to all staff for their kindness in arranging such a great experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  My now fiancee said Yes!!  We were welcomed so warmly on our arrival and the kindness continued throughout. We spent an evening around Piccadilly and had the choice of so many lovely restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  The strawberries and champagne on returning to the room were hugely appreciated as too was the choice of breakfast!  
 
I really couldn't have asked for a better few days!  Thank you so much again to all staff , they were all so kind and obviously 'briefed' for our arrival and my plan! Special mention to Patricia, Roberta and Kayleigh for making our break an ever-memorable one!
 
It is safe to say that my fiancee fell in love with the hotel and Mayfair itself and has already asked when we will be returning!",5,2017,03,15
105,Best birthday ever!,"Every now and then a hotel stands out for getting it just right and The Chesterfield, Mayfair did just that for us. It has a quiet confidence as a hotel, it is not an arrogance or smugness, it’s a calmness and an assuredness. We found a massively warm welcome from start to finish. Its staff are so well trained, nothing is too much trouble and their customer service is effortless, whether it was the best shoe shine ever or the best breakfast, this hotel nailed it! 
The location between Oxford Street, Bond Street and Piccadilly was what originally drew us to book, together with the promise of it’s British heritage building and some great Trip Advisor reviews. Like our stay at Only You, Madrid last year, I hardly want to divulge some of its treasures, as for sure a lot of our “wows” came from this hotel delivering the unexpected.
Thank you so much for adding to my incredible birthday week. The Jungle Suite was sensational. I loved every feature of it from the 'just look at the carpet', to the chairs to the wall art, the fluffy white towels with the C emblem, the rose petal bath and the amazing nights sleep after a day walking around London. Thank you too for the little extras the fruit platter and canapes sent to the room and the Happy Birthday cards from the staff.
Breakfast was amazing, I was back in my childhood with the porridge, given a modern twist made with coconut water, and then wow my all time Aussie favourite the smashed avo was on the menu (although called something more fashionably London like avocado toast!), my husband was in his element with a traditional British bacon and eggs.
In fact, that's it, it is the combination of the great British tradition with a modern twist, which gives this hotel the edge. No wonder this hotel has won two top twenty-five Travellers Choice awards.
The mix of other guests, lots of Italians and Americans made the whole stay a delight, whether it was a good evening in passing in the bar, or an 'after you' in the lift. We all had a grin on our faces like 'weren't we clever to book to stay here?!'
Congratulations to all the staff and thank you for adding to my best birthday ever!",5,2017,03,15
105,Afternoon tea,"Had a delicious afternoon tea with family in this delightful gem of a hotel in Mayfair.  Pre afternoon tea cocktails then a Willy Wonka themed tea.  Great selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones which were replenished on request.  Also an accompanying pot of tea and novelty Wonka juice was served.  Friendly and attentive staff completed the enjoyable experience.  By far the best afternoon tea I've ever had.",5,2017,03,14
105,Excellent base.,"A lovely hotel,perfectly located, tucked away in a quiet street, but within easy reach of the bright lights of the area, and with staff who could not have done more for me during my stay, from offering directions to filling up the printer with A4. I will be back.",5,2017,03,14
105,I really want to go back,"Extremely comfortable stay with a secure atmosphere.  The room was cosy and quiet.
All staff were pleasant, helpful and efficient.
Breakfast was delicious and served in a beautiful dining room.
There is a delightful terrace for morning coffees or evening cocktails.
Great location",5,2017,03,13
105,Weekend away,"We stayed here in January from Friday to Sunday. From the time we arrived until the time we checked out the staff couldn't do enough for us, everyone was so helpful and friendly... on the Friday night we booked a pre-theatre meal. It was delicious, accompanied with a great bottle of wine from their cellars... Their breakfast was very plentiful, everything you could possibly want was cartered for, all served on China plates. Definitely would return to this lovely old hotel.....",5,2017,03,13
105,Excellency at all levels except standard room's size,"Two nights at the Chesterfield Hotel. I should qualify it with a 5 but I can't because the room's size was completely inadequate for the price you pay. Both the room and the bathroom are ridiculously small, although compensated by the extraordinary comfort of the bed, itself. One of the most comfortable beds, I've ever slept.
On the positive side, almost everything: i) Location. Mayfair is the place to stay, ii) Breakfast: Delicious, iii) Friendly staff, iv) The Terrace Bar: Excellent",4,2017,03,13
105,Excellent Hotel,"Room was very nice, albeit a bit small for the price.  It's London though always remember that!  The restaurant was quite good as well. Four stars as the price didn't seem to match the return on our investment in the evening.",4,2017,03,13
105,A Head full of memories - Impossible to fault..,"We've been to many afternoon teas over the years in some very good and notable  locations. In our eyes Marius and the Chesterfield Mayfair team have raised the bar to new levels. Fabulous food and service. We went for my wife's 60th and took the family which included a 2, 5 and 15 year old and each and everyone of them thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Sandwiches were good sized with good fillings, the cakes ate as well as they looked and the chocolate scones were like brownies, gooey and soft. Mouth watering. The team were so child friendly too. No one has stopped talking about it since. The Willy Wonka character was also great fun, not intrusive but all in character and keeping with the theme. It may seem expensive but what you get for your money is well worth it and gave us all a head full of memories. Absolutely fantastic afternoon out.",5,2017,03,13
105,High Tea,A great afternoon out Willy Wonka high tea The food was amazing and the Willy Wonka tea was delicious. Also what you didn't eat was boxed up for you to take home. The staff were brilliant Marius and his team were just so helpful Will certainly be going back again.,5,2017,03,13
105,"Great hotel, great location",We stayed here almost exactly 4 years ago and gave it 5 stars then and we're giving it another 5 now. This time we upgraded to a superior king. The room is still on the small side (certainly by US standards) but probably a good size for central London. The bed was massive. Good facilities and storage space. Small but well equipped bath and one of the best showers ever. We especially liked the daily supply of mineral water and cookies and the good cafetiere coffee. We booked in advance with the hotel and got what I feel was a good rate compared with rates I saw quoted closer to the date. Breakfast was not included but there are several good coffee houses nearby. While the hotel is in a quiet area of Mayfair the lively pubs and restaurants of Shepherds Market are hidden just a block away and two of London's best restaurants are just around the corner.,5,2017,03,12
105,Best babymoon and birthday ever,"We decided to stay in London for our last holiday and my birthday as a couple without kids and my husband booked us into Chesterfield. They upgraded us into one of their suites. It was such a lovely experience. Their customer service was next to none! The room was very comfortable. My husband booked us a lovely afternoon tea on the Sunday. The food was absolutely divine! The scones... and macaroons! I could go on. They were also lovely enough to remember it was my birthday!

I will definitely visit again.",5,2017,03,12
105,Wonderful,"My experience started by being greeted from the taxi by the doorman. He took my luggage and set it down in reception, The resorption staff were excellent. The interior is beautiful with fabric on the walls everywhere.
The room was excellent. Free wifi and a free mobile phone! The room was well appointed with a real quality feel.
Breakfast was equally amazing with a swift check out. Definitely stay again!",5,2017,03,12
105,A gem in the heart of Mayfair,Had the pleasure of staying in this hotel recently. It is a beautiful hotel with very friendly and attentive staff. We also had an evening meal and all courses were delicious and beautifully presented. The food was so good that we booked their world famous afternoon tea the next day. The Charlie and the chocolate factory theme was visually stunning and a big hit with us even though there were no children in our group. Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for luxury in the best location in London,5,2017,03,11
105,The best afternoon tea in London!,"My mother and I had the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea and we were so impressed we're booking to come again for the regular afternoon tea as soon as possible! The service was absolutely fantastic here, we were treated like royalty and were given everything we could possibly want. Food was all delicious and we were given unlimited tea and food throughout the whole afternoon.
We have been to many afternoon teas in our time (probably too many) but this was the best in years. The room was beautiful and elegant and staff were friendly and welcoming, especially the supervisor Marius who made our day as special as possible.
Can't recommend it enough! Thank you.",5,2017,03,09
105,Lovely afternoon tea!,"My mum took me last 24th of february to have the Charlie & the Chocolate factory afteroon tea and it was simply excellent. Nothing to complain about at all. The service was great, specially Marius's who took care of us during the whole experience. He'd always make sure everyone in the room had been served and that everyone was satisfied. He explained every single detail that the afternoon tea contained always with a smily face. It was such a lovely experience that I would definitely recommend to anyone in London looking for a classic afternoon tea with a twist! 

Also to mention, we left our take away bag (couldn't leave those amazing sandwiches there! haha!) inside the hotel and Marius even went out to the street to look for us.",5,2017,03,06
105,We will definitely be back!,"We stayed in the Chesterfield Suite for one night, such a great experience! The suite was lovely and the staff took great care in making us feel at home which is so important when travelling with a toddler (a little teddy bear and branded slippers were awaiting her on the bed). Loved the relaxed atmosphere at the bar area as we had a few pre-dinner drinks and tasty canapes – special thanks to Iain for the amazing cocktails and service, truly enjoyable! Breakfast didn’t disappoint either, good choice of fresh products as expected. Overall, we were really impressed by the staff friendliness and attention to detail, we will definitely be back.",5,2017,03,06
105,Fantastic,"Checked in for a 2 night sty whilst watching a show in London. Friendly and efficient check in, and then I found the room and it was amazing! The attention to detail was amazing, the room service breakfast was out of this world and the bar is just perfect! 

Cannot wait to return",5,2017,03,06
105,Beautiful hotel ,"Stayed for 3 nights during a London trip. Can't fault this hotel at all. The staff are really friendly and welcoming. 
Our room was a bit small but very clean and well presented all the same. Perfect fit what we needed. Breakfast was delicious with a good selection. 
Would highly recommend ",5,2017,03,05
105,Charlie & Chocolate factory Afternoon Tea - Amazing,"We had the Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea and it was brilliant.

From start to finish the staff where attentive and felt like they went out of their way to help. We where met with a very jolly staff member who let us wait in the bar area and took our coats. We where given water and snacks whilst we waited, we where nearly an hour early!

We where then shown round to where the afternoon tea was, which was the conservatory. Although the conservatory was a little chilly it made for a lovely setting. 

The food was yummy and so inventive, we where offered seconds for everything. Which we happily took up the offer. 

I would recommend this afternoon to anyone. ",5,2017,03,04
105,Superb afternoon tea!,"A fantastic Willy Wonka themed afternoon tea at The Chesterfield. From the friendly staff and amazing cocktails to the wonderful sandwiches, scones and desserts, this experience could not have been better. Don't forget your wallet as it isn't cheap but it's a lovely treat.",5,2017,03,04
105,"quality , expensive","got to say that place is classy, full of great comfort, but it comes with high price, which is normal!
i am happy to recommend it to my friends who will be around london very soon
thanks for my nice stay!",4,2017,03,02
105,Charlie & the Chocolate Factory Afternoon tea - amazing!,"My husband, two children and I recently visited the Chesterfield for a fun afternoon tea. The quality of the food (both savoury & sweet) was incredible and the service was even better. Nothing was too much trouble for Marius and his team. The whole experience was a delight and all the added extras & surprises made it all the more fun. Plus we got to box up what we couldn't manage and enjoy it all again later at home! 
A highly recommended experience - thank you Marius!",5,2017,03,02
105,Excellent service,"We stayed in the African Suite which I would call a big room rather than a suite. The service is excellent in this small hotel, especially for the price. Room attended twice a day and the front desk was always well staffed and very attentive.  Could answer every tourist question. Lots of staff at front to get taxis and take care of every little thing. Felt very British, loved the decor. I've stayed in more expensive hotels in London that I would not bother to write a review about. Loved the fully equipped desk with everything from staple removers to tape. ",5,2017,03,01
105,One of the best Afternoon Tea,When my cousin visits from Toronto she always insists on coming here for afternoon tea. We always end up here for hours and are always made so so welcome Our teapots and plates are constantly replenished. We even end up taking boxes of cakes home! Staff are first class and super attentive. Cannot recommend this place more highly.,5,2017,03,01
105,"Favorite vacation, made better by the staff at The Chesterfield","Hubby and I went to London for an anniversary trip.  London is a fantastic city and Mayfair was a delight.  But what made our trip more memorable was the staff at the Chesterfield.  They gave such personalized, friendly service.  The facility has an old world London charm - very clean and cozy.  For those looking for a more modern facility, this is not it, but if you want comfort and care, they are the best.  The location is also great since they are close walking distance to the Tube and eateries.  I would highly recommend them and would stay here again and again.",5,2017,02,28
105,Afternoon tea at chesterfield,"We were four girls enjoying London for shopping and pleasure. We had booked an afternoon tea table to treat ourselves and it was amazing! The bread was filled with delicious topping such as salmon, ham and cheese. The scones were perfect with clotted cream and jam. The sweets were cute but a bit sweet for my taste. The cheesecake was the tastiest and most classic. Enjoyed with a cup of tea and glass of sparkling wine! The environment and service was perfect and it felt like we were on the top class restaurant of Titanic :) ",5,2017,02,27
105,Doing it right,"We recently had a quick 4 nights in London.  This was our 44th anniversary trip and they made it special.  We cannot think of a hotel in London that gives you more of that true London experience.  The room, lounge, breakfast and staff are excellent.  Ms Tollman you have a great team and fine establishment.",5,2017,02,26
105,"Lovely staff, great breakfast","We stayed here on night recently.  I am a fan of Red Carnation hotels but this was my least favourite so far.  The rooms are very small, bathrooms tiny.  The bedrooms could really do with an update, they are rather dated and dusty.  The bathroom also needs updating, the shower was very old and just a fixed head.  Breakfast was good though, nice buffet and hot food served at the table.  My hollandaise sauce was a bit tasteless though and the tables were too close together, making getting in and out to go to the buffet tricky.

The location is very good, not far from Green Park station and the Ritz so you are in a nice area, but I think it was rather over-priced for what it was.",4,2017,02,25
105,Excellent Stay,"We really enjoyed our two night stay. Staff are friendly, courteous & helpful. Our room was very comfortable with lots of thoughtful details, such as lovely linens, offer of real milk to accompany excellent tea/coffee making facilities, umbrellas etc.Try the Bubble and Squeak for breakfast! The Chesterfield is like a lovely country house in the city.",5,2017,02,24
105,Absolute Gem In Mayfair,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for five nights. I cannot say enough about how great our experience was. We travel quite a bit and I can say that we have never experienced a more friendly and knowledgeable staff. Every request was quickly and cheerfully granted. The hotel itself was polished and perfect.  The room, though not large ,had great storage, plenty of room and a wonderful  king bed. The bathroom was spacious and sparkling. The bar and restaurant had excellent food and drinks and great service.  The included breakfast was very good. The price was very good considering the Mayfair location, all the amenities of the hotel and the price of London itself. When we return  to London  we shall return here. I highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2017,02,23
105,You will be a right Charlie if you miss out on the Afternoon Tea at The Chesterfield,"I am writing a review on an outstanding Family Afternoon Tea my family and I (3 Adults and 2 Children aged 7 and 4)  enjoyed at the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair London.
 
The theme of the afternoon tea is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the name of the experience is aptly named Charlie & The Chesterfield Afternoon Tea. The cost is £38.50 for Adults and £19.50 which on paper is dear for sandwiches, cake and tea but is good value when you put it up against other venues offering Afternoon Tea within the heart of the capital and also for the experience too.
 
The experience is aimed at families with young children and as we were doing the afternoon tea in the half term school holidays the crowd within the hotel enjoying this was families with young children .
 
The choices of sandwiches on the Adult menu are Salmon, Ham and Cheese, Chicken, Cucumber and Cream Cheese and Egg Mayo and on the children’s menu are Peanut Butter and Jam which is a good choice for the adults and children. If you are really hungry the waiter’s will offer to give you additional sandwiches of your choice which is really good and adds to the value.
 
The Scones are good too with a choice of Chocolate Chip and Fruit and the homemade pastries and cupcakes tasted great and the kids lapped them up.
 
What our children liked was the option of substituting Tea for a milkshake.
 
All guest also got a Wonka Bar and a Golden Ticket which includes a prize (which can only be opened on you next visit mind you so I guess many of them won’t get open as I would guess that this is a one-off experience for most guest).
 
Willy Wonka is also in attendance posing for photos with the children and handing out sweets and those golden tickets.
 
All in all a well worth the money and a very enjoyable afternoon…..Well Done the Chesterfield you are onto a winner.",5,2017,02,23
105,1st Wedding Anniversary Drinks,"We visited here for drinks with my Aunty to celebrate her birthday and our anniversary, on arrival we were presented with a complimentary bottle of champagne, then we were also presented with desserts wishing us Happy Birthday and also Happy Anniversary.  The staff here are the best we have come across, the surroundings are beautiful.  We will definitely return and highly recommend.",5,2017,02,23
105,"Fantastic, comfortable hotel!","Have walked past this hotel many times & thought how nice it looked. Finally stayed last week.
Comfortable & welcoming - nothing too much trouble for the staff. Rooms are traditional  & very comfortable. The Hotel is well located for Mayfair & has a lovely Bar where the staff are friendly & helpful",5,2017,02,22
105,Great Bar,"I have been to the bar at the Chesterfield several times for business meeting and must congratulate Vincent for his classy service.

Also the Club Sandwich is delicious.

Thank you to all at this top Hotel. ",5,2017,02,22
105,Attentive and very friendly staff,"Attentive and very friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble.
Fabulous location for the Shepherds Market area, very easy walking distance to Buckingham Place, St James Palace and New Bond/Oxford streets.",5,2017,02,20
105,Perfect Stay1,"We stayed here for 2 nights and could not have been made more welcome by the staff.  We enjoyed our stay and what really impressed us both was how much the staff ""care"" about the hotel and the service they provide.  They have great pride in the hotel and it shows, and rightly so. 

Our room was lovely, the food was amazing and the hotel offered a calm and relaxing place for us to enjoy our stay in London.

We will return again very soon!",5,2017,02,20
105,Best hotel in London!!,"This was our 5th stay at The Chesterfield each time we are allocated a different room - all of them kept spotless by housekeeping - all of them with a different theme. We stayed in the Duchess suite this time as we brought both children with us. We walked into this room and were simply wowed - the nice little touch was housekeeping added little bath robes for the little ones along with matching slippers - ""this is the best hotel I've ever been to!"" Said my 10 year old son and I couldn't agree more. We try and eat in the restaurant each time we come and always have the pleasure of being served by the ever gracious restaurant Manager Loris Lucchini! We had the lobster omelette which was scrumptious followed by the ox cheek. My wife is a little fussy(apologies) and wanted her omelette well done which Loris relayed to the kitchen team without hesitation. The children's menu had something to suit both children and my son polished off his food! We retired back to our room
And the children still had energy to run around in their robes (that's how excited they were) we did not see any other children on this trip but this hotel obviously caters for everyone as we usually travel as a couple. The next day the breakfast spread had something to suit everyone's needs - they have just upgraded the breakfast menu with healthier items such as porridge with coconut water and avocado on cape seed bread - I personally liked the classic full English breakfast but my wife adores all the new healthy options. Everything was perfect from The check in from Alina followed by the goodbye by all the staff at the end of our stay. Looking for a hotel in Mayfair ? Look no further than The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. See you again - Itayi and Natasha Chinehasha.",5,2017,02,20
105,Where the centre of attention is 'YOU'!,"A very warm and friendly welcome from Letitia on Reception as we arrived, returning guests to see all the lovely warm and friendly staff who are so delighted to see you and are so obliging; nothing is too much trouble. Chesterfield Chocolates in our room which was the Curzon Suite; a must if you can!  Fine dining in the Restaurant with excellent knowledge of wines and food pairing by Sommelier, William. James in the bar with his excellent knowledge with the Gin Tasting Experience and good to meet Ian, from Ireland. Lovely Lidia, Room Service, prompt attention with our fresh milk and later on our Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Yummie!! Thank you to all at The Chesterfield for your warmth and attention. Would not dream of staying anywhere else in London!!",5,2017,02,20
105,"Fabulous ""Charlie & the choc factory"" afternoon tea at the chesterfield","Fantastic service, every member of staff, including the mad willie wonka himself handing out gob stoppers during tea, made our experience above and beyond what we expected. Extra touches really made a difference -  from a live pianist playing the theme tune to the Oompa Loompa song, to the wonderful top-hatted doorman offering extra sweeties to my very excited 8 year old while we waited for our friends to join us.
And the afternoon tea itself was delicious, inventive, and generous! The staff were more than happy to bring extra of whatever you liked. Highly recommend!!",5,2017,02,20
105,"Our ""home"" in London","Location, rooms, service, breakfast, hospitality; all in all a perfect place for us on our regular visits to London. Also very helpful booking restaurants with good recommendations. We always enjoy coming back to the Chesterfield in Mayfair.",5,2017,02,20
105,NOTHING IS TWO MUCH TROUBLE,"The service here is the best we've had from doorman Norbert, porter Adrian,  Conceirge Tony and James the barman certainly knows how to make a lovely cocktail infact, every member of staff we met were delightful. The staff here made us feel like we were part of their family. 'This hotel is ideally situated 5 minutes walk from Green Park Station and in the other direction from the hotel you can find Regent Street, Oxford Street. and Bond Street. Our Suite was first  class and plenty of toiletries. At breakfast we were greeted and seated and asked immediately what we would like to drink. After ordering our cooked breakfast we were told we could help ourselves to anything  from the enormous display of fresh fruit, smoothies, cold meats, choice of cereals and delightful mini pastries infact there was everything on the buffet tables to cater for everyone's needs, diets etc. This is our fourth time staying here and would not dream of staying anywhere else in London. It was my birthday when we arrived. We went out shopping and when we came back there was a card from the staff on duty and a personal greeting from the General Manager plus a box of handmade chocolates from the staff in our suite, not many hotels would put themselves out like the staff at The Chesterfield. After eating breakfast the staff in the breakfast room approached our table and produced a cake with candle and a truffle and macaroon and a personal message written in chocolate icing for me plus two large glasses of champagne they then all sang happy birthday and handed me a large red carnation. They certainly make you feel important. I vote this hotel number one for smiling helpful staff who make you feel so welcome and go the extra mile to make your stay memorable.Most definitely will be back. Thank you all staff at The Chesterfield xx",5,2017,02,19
105,Awesome little Hotel!!,"This Hotel is amazing, right in the heart of Mayfair. 
Staff always go the extra mile. Me being gluten free, they help me massively. 
The bar was nice, beds comfortable. Can't wait to go back. 
Thanks!!!",5,2017,02,19
105,Fabulous afternoon tea!,"We've just returned from a fabulous afternoon tea at the Chesterfield, where we were treated like royalty by the wonderful staff. The setting for the tea is beautiful, we were in the conservatory- and the gorgeous decor and pretty gardens were instagram heaven. This afternoon is tea is much more reasonably priced than other top London hotels, and even more delicious. The Willy Wonka theme worked wonderfully, particularly as there was a real life Willy Wonka in the dining room- adding an extra touch of magic! The sandwiches and scones were perfect, and the fantastic themed cakes were absolutely delicious. We were served by Kirstie and Emma who couldn't have been more welcoming or attentive- making sure we had everything we needed and more besides. The Chesterfield is the perfect destination if you're in search of some old school London glamour, and we are already making plans to return for drinks in their beautiful garden when warmer weather arrives. Thanks again to the wonderful team at the Chesterfield!",5,2017,02,19
105,Perfect stay!,"Had a lovely night with my sister in room 218 - the interiors were perfect - spacious, perfect for 2 ladies, overlooked the street, had all we could need in terms of tea and coffee making facilities, bath robes as well as complimentary water. We had dinner in butlers restaurant along with other members of the family who spontaneously decided to join us - despite the last minute booking for our family who came with my cousins - they had little bath Robes and milkshake vouchers waiting on the bed! More about Butlers restaurant - Loris Loris Loris - what a guy! He served us perfectly along with Christian, they knew the menu inside out and interacted so well with my shy little cousin. I started with the lobster omelette then had the catch of the day - it was delicious - Salmon cooked to perfection. I cannot say enough about how superb this hotel is -  did not get the chance to try the bar but hopefully on another visit. When I left everyone was so friendly and it was like saying goodbye to old friends. If you need a hotel to stay in london look no further than The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel suitable for families, lovers, friends! Thank you all - Thembi C",5,2017,02,18

Thank you to the brilliant waiting staff who were well aware of our crazy diet arrangements! They also do a veggie and gluten free teas. ,5,2017,02,17
105,Bubblegum Eclair -- whaaaat?!,"We went for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed afternoon tea with children during half term.  Excellent tea, fairly priced, very child friendly and fun theme.  Service by Mihai was outstanding.  The hotel is a nice, accessible location in Mayfair and has a quaint quality about it.  Really loved the Willy Wonka tea, fizzy lifting drinks and kids gobbled up the bubble gum eclairs!  Would highly recommend to families, especially tourists who want to do something traditionally English but not at all too pretentious!",4,2017,02,16
105,A very welcoming visit,"This was a family celebration in the conservatory area, beautiful th staff were complimentary to the Chesterfield and left no stone unturned.  The service was impeccable .the hotel is so very  amenable to the local sights of London and other ***** star establishments in the area.",5,2017,02,15
105,REVISITING OLD HAUNTS,"We had  wonderful service and a lovely SUPERIOR KING  ROOM NO 319  QUIET OVERLOOKING THE STREET .Bathroom  great very modern  .LOCATION OF HOTEL SUPERB with easy access to Green Park Piccadilly and Shepherd Market   with its excellent eating houses and pubs French Bistro brilliant.
We also dined in the Hotels Butlers Restaurant and had a very good British Roast with Lamb carved at the table, Breakfast cold Buffet first class with excellent hot food prepared to order and delivered to your table
Best likes were the Staff from Reception to Room care .All  so friendly and helpful which would be great for new visitors to London.
Only minor gripe was Breakfast Seating as there were only 2/3 Tables for 2.This meant couples were seated on the long Bench  and this was somewhat difficult to sit on comfortably and move on to as 75 year olds plus.",5,2017,02,15
105,Another perfect visit ,"Cannot rate this Hotel highly enough. I have visited several times for Afternoon Tea and this trip was as good as ever. Impeccable service, lovely relaxed surroundings and delicious food. My favourite hotel in London. I love it so much that I've booked my wedding reception here in June. Cannot recommend it highly enough and looking forward to going again soon.",5,2017,02,15
105,Best afternoon tea in London,"This is hands down my favourite place for afternoon tea in London and the benchmark I compare every other afternoon tea I go to. None have been as good, which is why I take everyone I know here. 

It's a traditional afternoon tea with a twist - you can get refills of EVERYTHING! 

The sandwiches are delicious, all on different breads; pesto, beetroot and white rolled on toasted almond flakes. 

Scones are delicious and served warm with clotted cream and jam. 

There are also desserts; eclair, cupcake, macaroon and others plus a massive wonka chocolate bar. Again whatever you fancy can and will be refilled. 

Tea selection is great and you're able to change as many times as you like. It's such a great way to try new teas. 

Staff are great, all really nice and feels very natural when they're talking to you. I have to say that one of the waitresses (can't remember her name (may have been Emma or Kim) but she's blonde with a South African accent) was amazing and really made the afternoon fantastic.

They also give you a golden ticket that you open on your next visit. Our golden ticket  was 2 glasses of champagne but as we don't drink, they gave us money off the bill instead. 

Already planning my next trip. 

In summary - go here for afternoon tea, you won't regret it!",5,2017,02,14
105,Wily Wonka Afternoon Tea,"I love afternoon tea and have been to many but the service, food, surroundings and everything was just fantastic here.  William, Mihai and Sara could not have looked after our party any better.  Having Willy Wonka circulating and talking to the kids is a lovely touch.  The choice of food was gorgeous and you could have as much as you would like.  I would HIGHLY recommend this for any age.",5,2017,02,14
105,Great location,The location of the hotel is excellent. Our room had a leaky shower and the staff gave us another one promptly that was very nice of them! Breakfast was very good with lots of staff on hand to serve you. Very good housekeeping. The only problem was the window in our room was very drafty but luckily the curtains were good and helped keep the room relatively warm at night.,4,2017,02,13
105,Service with capital S,"I can only rave about this hotel,and its staff. A true home away from home!

The excellent service already start the welcoming doormen and the reception of always shining and smiling Charlie and her colleagues at reception. 

Concierges Tony and Joshua and colleagues are always ready to help you out with and service required. 

Make sure to start the day enjoying the full English breakfast that is served by Bernadett and her colleagues. They continuously make sure you will leave the hotel with a stomach full of fresh food (the eggs benedict are my favourite!) and juices.

Its wonderful relaxation at the bar under the enjoyment of a cocktail by James, Vincent, Freddy, Ian or one of their colleagues.

Every visit is and enjoyment and a welcome break in a busy work schedule. Thank you all for making my visits to London so comfortable!

105,A Year Later ~ Still the best hotel service!,"My girlfriend and I stayed here in April of 2016, I travel a lot for work and although this was a vacation it is hands down the best service of any hotel i have ever stayed at, the central location is ideal and in an safe and upscale neighborhood.",5,2017,02,09
105,My favourite Mayfair Hotel,"I travel to London regularly and I always hope to book this hotel if staying overnight. The service is second to none, free Wifi and a nice relaxed bar and restaurant that is nowhere near being pretentious like a lot of the other Mayfair hotels I have stayed in. Food is excellent, the only reason it is not a five star is some people may consider the bedrooms a little small and if travelling as a couple that may be an issue, but that doesn't bother me as this is the perfect hotel for my London business trips. Great staff, great location, love the place.",4,2017,02,07
105,great stay,"great time and stay, luxury, class and staff is very professional.
i enjoyed the whole experience, as it is the first time me and my family go there.
will be back
good to go with the family as well , its a friendly place to enjoy",5,2017,02,07
105,Disappointing Value,"We recently stayed with the hotel and were disappointed on a number of fronts. The hotel rooms are generally small and poor value compared to other hotels we have stayed in the Mayfair area, indeed after having booked we realised the hotel was more expensive than 5 star hotels in the Mayfair area during the time of our stay. The Hotel offers a meal voucher to encourage you to eat in their restaurant, however we found the food to be very average and the atmosphere in the restaurant poor, furthermore we found breakfast disappointing. Staff were generally helpful. The hotel décor is very tired and we found the cleanliness of our room was not great, with layers of dust on curtains,wall fabrics and ledges. Be warned that bathrooms are extremely small.",2,2017,02,06
105,Great location and attentive staff,"We stayed 5 nights during the first week of Feb 2017 and enjoyed ourselves very much. The Chesterfield 's location is on a quiet Mayfair street about a 5 min walk to the Green Park tube station which is on the Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee lines providing quick access to major rail stations and popular locations like Leicester Square and Westminster. That said, London is made for walking and from this Mayfair hotel the entire West End is within a 30 min walk. 

The restaurant (Butlers) and bar were nice places for a meal or drink.  The food was good (I did not try the roast pork belly but it looked delicious!). Our King room was ""cozy"" (a little small but very comfortable) and had a very comfortable bed. We barely used the TV but noticed a very comprehensive selection of satellite channels. One thing to note - if you hope to connect a computer to the TV so that you can practice a presentation you may be out of luck as the remote control does not allow selection of alternate inputs.

One nice perk that we did not need and therefore did not test is the use of a free Android smart phone for the duration of your stay.

Other thoughts:
- Good quality Wi-Fi
- No gym

Overall a very nice hotel.  We would happily return.",5,2017,02,06
105,Seven Night Stay in Mayfair,"We enjoyed our seven night stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair from 12-28 to 3-1. I researched a lot of hotels in this area before booking our stay and a friend who's stayed in properties all over London recommended this one. For the location and price, it's hard to beat. 

We stayed in Room 407 which was nicely appointed, if a bit fussy. We had housekeeping take away the desk chair near the foot of our bed to allow for extra room and thought it was funny that it was stored in the hallway a few rooms down during our entire stay. 

Breakfast - this was included in our price and was definitely worth it. Great selection of food and juices with both continental and made to order available. Butlers Restaurant is also a pretty space and a great way to kick off the day.

Bar - really enjoyed The Terrace Bar. Great service and nice ambiance with a piano player at night. Plus they had great free snacks to go along with the drinks!

Location - in a quiet area not far from the hustle of Bond Street, Piccadilly Circus, the Ritz, etc. Very central to major shopping locations, other neighborhoods like Covent Garden, Soho and Westminster.

If not for a few hiccups, we would have rated this as 5-star. Better direction from the concierge would have been helpful. Additionally, while checking in with a line of people behind us, the front desk clerk told us to book directly with them next time and not through Booking.com. She indicated the hotel will match any pricing from the internet. I book through Booking.com as a way to better track my hotel stays and thought this was a rude way to be introduced to a 7-night stay.",4,2017,02,05
105,Not as good as previous visits,"From the moment the reservations team forgot to return my call re our booking I got a sinking feeling about our visit. Room was, as usual lovely, but the cups had to be washed before we could use them as had stain marks int the bottom. Felt there were a lot of gimmicks, complimentary breakfast and a £50 food voucher, the restaurant's food is ok and elegantly served but tends to lack atmosphere. This visit was not as good value as normal and I was horrified when I went to book for our wedding anniversary and realised that the Ritz is actually cheaper that weekend.......sorry Chesterfield you are a nice 4 star hotel!",3,2017,02,05
105,The best afternoon tea experience. ,"Loved it. It's a must must must. 
The staff are unbelievably friendly, especially William who couldn't do enough for us. 
We've never had such a friendly, helpful and hospitable afternoon tea experience. 
All the food was exceptional too especially he wonka bar which is made in house. 
I would visit again and would recommend anyone contemplating between this one and the other Charlie and the Chocolate factory afternoon tea, to give that one a miss and go to the Chesterfield (I've been to both) ",5,2017,02,05
105,Weekend in London,"Lovely boutique hotel for a long weekend in London before Business meetings.  Very quiet, yet great location for walking, shopping, sites. Close to Greenpark tube.  
Decor is old world charm. the smallest rooms, while very compact, are like little jewel boxes.  
Staff is professional, gracious and eager to please.  Excellent.  Will definitely return.",5,2017,02,05
105,"Excellent value, elegant, and a friendly atmosphere","This is the best hotel experience, out of rather many, that I have had in London. I got a quiet, beautifully decorated room, a comfortable bed and a very good breakfast. The staff was kind and the service excellent.",5,2017,02,03
105,Afternoon Tea,Visited The Chesterfield Hotel for Afternoon Tea yesterday.  I have had many Afternoon Teas in London and I can honestly say The Chesterfield's is by far the best.  The service is fantastic.  The staff can't do enough for you.  The hotel is lovely and The Afternoon Tea is gorgeous.  Fresh sandwiches and beautiful cakes and chocolates.  Everything is replenished if you can eat that much!!  We are already planning our next visit.  Can't wait!!!,5,2017,02,02
105,Submerge in traditional English style,"High class hotel in traditional English style. Go back in time but all amenities and luxury you expect of the 21st century. Rooms are spacious and luxurious decorated.
Breakfast offers a large buffet and English breakfast choices from the menu.
The bar has an extensive menu and is to be recommended for a very large selection of gin-tonics.",5,2017,02,02
105,What a disappointment.,"Since my 2011 review we have spent one or two nights at the Chesterfield on about twelve occasions and always been happy. Not this time. On check-in the receptionist suggested that we book direct with the hotel next time. When I told her we had booked direct and offered to show this on my phone she made it obvious that she didn't believe me. Next one of the porters asked if we needed help with the luggage. I am perfectly capable of carrying one small bag but like to recycle a few pounds to people who probably aren't paid very well so accepted his offer. When we turned from the desk to go to the room there was no sign of him or the bag so I assumed that, rather oddly, he had gone ahead. Arriving in the room there was no bag. My wife was keen to shower and change before we went to meet some friends but 20 minutes later still no bag so I phoned reception and after another few minutes a different porter arrived asking, 'Is this your bag?'. No money changed hands.

I have reached an age where I don't sleep if there is any significant noise and one of the reasons for choosing the hotel is that the rooms have usually been as noisy as a 3.00am graveyard. This time my wife pointed out that we were next to the lift but as we were now late to meet our friends I decided to assume that the Chesterfield would have properly sound proofed the lift shaft. After the theatre we arrived back at midnight. By the time I realised that the lift was anything but silent my wife seemed to be fast asleep and it seemed unfair to wake her in an attempt to change rooms, so I lay awake listening to the banging and clattering of the lift to about 2.30am before sleeping until it started up again at 5.30. 

I realise that when the hotel is full someone must be next to the lift but the hotel did not seem that busy to me so I am not convinced that we could not have been in a quieter room, especially as we had arrived in the early afternoon. We had been given a very good rate and I have to wonder if that was the reason for the room allocation.

We had organised a full programme for the next day but by lunchtime I was collapsing with exhaustion so we had to head home. Next time we will be trying another hotel.",2,2017,02,01
105,British comfort,"We stayed for 6 days and enjoyed the small yet oh-so comfortable room. The hotel is understated British with lovely décor, nice bar/pub, quiet library and terrific breakfast. The hotel staff were attentive and discreet, always ready to help with a smile. The location could not be better as we felt we could walk easily to many of the London land-marks (V and A museum, Harrods, shopping etc...). We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,01
105,Luxury in London,"We recently spent a Sunday evening at this beautiful hotel, and were warmly welcomed and catered for from the very first step into the lobby.

The central location is very useful, and we loved the decor and atmosphere of the Chesterfield.
Vince and Ian took very good care of us at the bar before dinner, and the high standard of service continued into the dining room. Will deboned the Dover Sole (delicious!) beautifully and paired our starters and mains with excellent wine choices. Charming Loris was exceptional throughout the service, informative, attentive and entertaining, and we retired a good few hours later to our room with very satisfied appetites.

We found the room very comfortable, complete with a jacuzzi bath to boot. A good nights rest in a quiet haven was topped with a room service breakfast of Eggs Benedict - delivered with a newspaper and a smile the next day.

Overall, an absolutely lovely stay with the staff themselves ensuring the hotel stands out from many others in London. We will definitely be back - hopefully for longer next time!",5,2017,01,31
105,A warm welcome every day,"This hotel was a little more expensive than we normally book for London but the location for the show, concert and restaurant we had booked was perfect so we decided to splash out a bit. I'm so glad we did. From check in, to concierge, to housekeeping to the three great guys in the bar (I think Lorenzo, Antonio and Ian) everyone just wants to make you welcome and get the best out of the time you have with them. Customer service the way it should be. Top notch but not intrusive or too much. 
I'd now definitely save a little more to stay again the next time we are in London. 
For foodies who want to spend a weekend in top restaurants the location is perfect for Angela hartnett, langan's brasserie, nobu and many more. 
I've now fallen in love with that little red carnation! ",5,2017,01,30
105,Charming hotel in a great location,"This is a hotel that you will definitely enjoy: great service, delicious breakfast and very good beds. One of the best in London. We did not see any kids at this hotel and the atmosphere is generaly calm so it suits mostly adults.",5,2017,01,30
105,Nice hotel,Spent a Saturday night. Staff are very good and helpful. We stayed in a superior king which was fine if quite small. Breakfast was fine. Had a meal in drinks in the bar which was good. A nice hotel in Mayfair.,4,2017,01,29
105,Amazing,The hotel was brilliant and the staff absolutely wonderful. We were well looked after and our dog was welcomed with her own bed and bowls. The food was really good and room service excellent. Will definitely return,5,2017,01,29
105,Afternoon tea,"I have been to many places in London for afternoon tea but this has to be the best by far. The hotel was beautiful, the food was delicious and the service was second to none.  I really enjoyed myself and I will definitely be going back again.

It is worth noting that most places will only top up the sandwiches provided with afternoon tea (if you a lucky!).  At The Chesterfield we were offered a top up of all food provided with the afternoon tea and the staff came over to offer us refills throughout the meal which was a really nice touch.   

Thank you to Marius and his staff for looking after us so well.",5,2017,01,29
105,Still the Best Place to stay in London,"I have been here before and plan to return again.  This is truly one of the best hotels anywhere and certainly in London.  The staff is so helpful that they seem to anticipate your needs before you even ask.  I even had a special problem that was handled by the staff with efficiency and ease.  This is a top Hotel and  although not one the big glamour places to stay at, it has the best accommodations in the City.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,29
105,A SCRUMDIDDLYUMPTIOUS Afternoon Tea,"Experiencing the Wonka Afternoon Tea here was amazing. Marius the Restaurant Supervisor was very attentive with superior service and guided us through the menu and tea itself. We were asked if we wanted more tea/sandwiches/cakes which was wonderful as you certainly did leave with an empty stomach. The Tea was delicious and  quirky which was great to share as a family treat. Would love to return again for the experience. Definitely one for families, couples of all ages!",5,2017,01,29
105,Quality from check in to departure ,"Great quality from start to end, check in, concierge, check out all 1st class
Nothing to much trouble for any of the staff and would recommend as great location for all the Mayfair attractions- Hakkasan, Sexy Fish, Benares etc etc
",5,2017,01,28
105,Best choice we made on our vacation.,"My fiance and I stayed here for our first trip to London and it was such a great choice. The entire staff is some of the nicest people we have every met.The room was a good size. The location was close to so many great places. After the first day, everyone remembered us and was very kind.  Joshua at the front desk helped with train times, and the room service was always spot on. Above all, the Bar staff made our trip most memorable. Jade, James, and Freddie are some of best bar staff around. Thank you truly for making our stay one we will never forget. Can't wait to come back after such great service.",5,2017,01,25
105,Excellent stay at this hotel,"We chose this hotel as it was excellently located for my husband's two meetings off Pall Mall.  It turned out to be a super location for me to visit galleries, museums and concert halls easily.  Our double room was spacious, good quality bed and fittings.  We enjoyed having breakfast in our room both days - easy as we had a good sized side table and two comfy chairs.  Our stay was made really enjoyable by the swift, attentive and friendly service of every member of staff we came across. Reception, room service, bar and cleaners all friendly.  Storing our case until late afternoon was easy too.",5,2017,01,25
105,Top class Hotel,"Luxury with a capitol "" L "" Right from your arrival, there was someone there to assist you. Nothing was too much trouble. The décor was "" Old Colonial style "" in pristine condition. No cracked tiles or MFI furniture in this place. The breakfast dining, again was superb, from buffet style to full English, the service by uniformed staff was courteous and very professional. The location was less than a mile from Piccadilly Circus. We went on a 3 day break, Tuesday to Thursday. 2 nights Bed and Breakfast .The  luxury is reflected in the price £368 . Not cheap but a fabulous experience",5,2017,01,25
105,First-class service & a truely wonderful hotel,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for one night as part of her birthday celebrations and I am extremely happy with my choice of hotel.

From the moment you enter the lobby you are greeted and made to feel exceptionally welcome. I happened to select the romantic package they had on offer which included free drinks at the bar, which we opted to do whilst we waited for our room. We both went for something from the cocktail menu and they were fantastic. We've had a range of cocktails from various locations, but these were by far the best we've had to date. 

Once our room was ready we made our way up. Our luggage was already waiting for us in the room, which was a nice touch. In keeping with what we had seen downstairs, our room was beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. The bathroom in particular was glistening and spotless. Everything was very well looked after and the attention to detail was amazing to witness. 

As part of the romantic package, I received a turn-down service which involved scattering rose petals on the bed, with a single rose and a bottle of Champagne. This was scheduled with the hotel prior to my visit, so that I did not have to discuss anything whilst my girlfriend was present. My girlfriend also received a small cake later that evening, which again was a really nice touch. 

The hotel at this time of year is beautifully decorated, full of festive touches and a wonderful Christmas tree in the lobby. If you like that kind of thing, try and stay at the hotel around Christmas and you get even more pleasure from your stay!

The only thing to note with this hotel is that it is in Mayfair and therefore quite expensive to park - even for 24hrs. We pre-booked a car parking space that was about 8-10min walk from the hotel, which worked out to be a cheaper option. The hotel do offer a car parking service but it isn't cheap, but the flip side to that is that you can simply drive up to the hotel door and your car will be parked for you without the hassle of making arrangements yourself.

Overall, I would highly recommend you visit and/or stay at this hotel to experience the wonderful service on offer. We would love to stay again and hope to do so in the very near future!",5,2017,01,25
105,Good old fashioned hotel in the heart of London,"Very conveniently located in the heart of Mayfair, within walking distance to Piccadilly ave, Green and Hyde parks, and Oxford street. The hotel has very good service, however the rooms are a bit old, with no recent renovation (although some rooms are). I was staying in the music room with music theme on the walls and bathroom, which was quite neat. Good breakfast. Good feel of what old hotels used to be like.",4,2017,01,24
105,Amazing staff and hotel,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel my husband and I were treated with the utmost kindness, we felt welcome. Since the tv set in the room stopped working properly we were moved to a suite that was large and very well decorated. Besides, since we were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary, we received a beautiful bouquet of roses with  cards signed by the reception staff and a dish of cupcakes all decorated for the occasion. We felt very special . We spent four wonderful days at the hotel and are planning to return with our granddaughters soon",5,2017,01,24
105,Trip of a lifetime,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review because it means my time at The Chesterfield has come to an end. From the first moment we arrived the staff was welcoming, friendly and attentive. 
Our room was not too small as many of the rooms can be in Europe and the fresh flower in the bathroom each day is a wonderful touch. 
I cannot say enough great things about the bar staff. Particularly, Jade, James and Freddie. They seriously made our trip one we will never forget and are the best staff members I have ever had the pleasure of meeting at any hotel. During our stay I celebrated a birthday and I got engaged. For a small moment I was sad that we did not have our family or friends surrounding us to celebrate but Jade quickly erased all those thoughts. I could go on for hours about how great these three are, thank you for all you did during our stay! It feels like we left some great friends back in England.",5,2017,01,23
105,Amazing Boutique Hotel,Fabulous facility in a great location.  The staff was amazingly friendly and accommodating.  The service and food in the bar and restaurant were all beyond our expectations.  The rooms and all appointments were cosy and elegant.  When next we go to London we'll definitely be staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.,5,2017,01,22
105,Amazing staff and Tea,Birthday treat to myself..staff were so friendly and helpful and had a fabulous tea loved it. Willy Wonka was fabulous my favourite place for tea..go every year cant wait to go back. Thanks to you all for a fab time.,5,2017,01,21
105,"Fabulous Boutique Hotel, Great Staff & Wonderful Attention to Detail!!!",From the moment our taxi drew up at the front of the hotel we knew that we would enjoy our stay here. The Doorman was there instantly to open the taxi doors and extend a warm welcome to us. The hotel is fabulous and the staff really do pay attention to every detail. As it was my boyfriend's birthday there was a cake and a personalised birthday card waiting for him in our room - a lovely touch! The bed was really comfortable with sumptuous bedding you could really snuggle into. Even the slippers provided had more padded soles that you would normally get! The bar area is cosy and the cocktails and service superb (great piano playing too)! Really great location and really quiet at night. In the hotel info they tell you some of the history about who used to live in the different 'houses' which now make up the hotel - a very enjoyable read. Would definitely stay again!,5,2017,01,20
105,Loved Mayfair,"What a gorgeous English place to stay within walking distance to shops,restaurants and everything London.  We liked the lovely welcome at the door and then met the friendly staff! One of the girls was from Australia. The front entrance is small, formal and decorated beautifully. Very like all the 'Red Carnation' style. We love dogs and have a King Charles spaniel so it was fun to see the dog tapestries in the breakfast room. We stayed for 4 nights and We are returning again this year and can't wait to get there.",4,2017,01,19
105,What a gem!,We just returned from a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel. Everything was done with total perfection. The staff is exceptionally helpful. Breakfast was excellent. The location is phenomenal. We can't wait to return! We were sad to leave. We had a wonderful stay!,5,2017,01,18
105,Our favourite hotel,"We have now stayed at this hotel four times after being introduced to it when we stayed after  a friends birthday party at a local restaurant.  We love the fact it is centrally located but is very quiet and that its small enough to be personal but large enough to be affordable. The service is brilliant - attentive without being intrusive or obsequious and the breakfast is the best I've ever had in an hotel.  English breakfast is freshly cooked to order (and includes kippers - my husbands favourite) - no dried up eggs or bacon sitting in its own fat here.  There is also a wide selection of fruits, cereals,  croissants etc to help yourself from if you want a more continental breakfast.  
Bedrooms are of a reasonable size for a city location and are very comfortable. Staff are friendly and accommodating and seem to enjoy giving their customers the best service they can - no world-weary eye rolling here! We love going to the Chesterfield and are already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2017,01,18
105,One of the Best Ever!,"I very seldom write reviews, but The Chesterfield Mayfair was beyond excellent.  And believe me I don't rate higher than satisfactory ever!  My wife and I originally had booked into The Rubens at the Palace but it was undergoing renovations so Red Carnation moved and upgraded us.  The Hotel is everything you could expect from a Hotel.  We felt like we were at Downton Abbey.  The entire staff is incredible, and they make you feel like you are the only ones there, but special kudos have to go to Marius in the dining room and James in the bar,  The hotel is a couple of minutes from the Green Park station, which is only a couple of stops from all the major tourist sites, except for Buckingham Palace, which is in walking distance!  There is no doubt that we will return!  In addition we were pleasantly surprised by the anniversary gift on our arrival.",5,2017,01,18
105,A delightful sanctuary in central London,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield Hotel - and it will not be the last.  The Management/Owners of this delightful hotel should be truly proud of their exceptional staff who make this establishment such a joyful place to spend time.  All guests are made to feel they are so special - nothing is too much trouble for them and they all have such an enthusiastic approach to everything they do.  Particular praise must go to all the front of house staff.  Reception, Concierge and Porters immediately make visitors welcome and put them at their ease as soon as they arrive.  Their competence, attitude and abiltiy to interact with everyone enables even the most timid of visitor to relax and make the most of their time at the hotel.
Attention to detail is so evident at all times.  The exterior of the hotel looks so attractive, but inside is even better - chic, elegant and furnished to such a high and individual standard giving the feel of 'days gone by'.  Bland, characterless marble effect and minimalistic design is nowhere evident at this hotel.
The location is just perfect being so close to its nearest tube station, shopping areas and the interesting tourist sites around Westminster, Buckingham Palace etc.
We only had breakfast at the hotel having already committed to meals elsewhere, but the quality, quantity and choice of breakfast fayre was faultless.
Thank you everyone at the Chesterfield Hotel for a lovely three day stay.",5,2017,01,18
105,Classy hotel without the pretence,"The title says it all. Top end hotel but does not feel the need to bore people about it...
Found this hotel to be absolutely fantastic. Starts at reception and check in, great friendly staff, more than happy to help..
Standard rooms are small but that's London I guess. Wifi is fast free. Otherwise every thing you need, very clean and tasteful. Very comfy bed and pillows, turndown service available.
Very relaxing bar and again very good service.
Breakfast was lovely, great selection, freshly cooked breakfast and again top service..
Excellent staff again at check out, very professional.
Can't wait to return when in London again.",5,2017,01,17
105,Wonderful stay with teenage daughter,"I just returned from my 8-day stay at your wonderful hotel.  I spent the week there with my 14-year-old daughter.  Yes, I was alone with my teenage daughter for 8 days!  Our trip to London was fantastic and I think that a major reason for the success of the trip was your hotel.  I have traveled extensively for work and pleasure and, as my friends and colleagues know, I am quite picky about where I stay--especially when on vacation to a city.  I want to be centrally located, in a hotel with personality and amenities-----but I also want some quiet.   All of those things were provided at your hotel.  

Your staff members are friendly, professional, and helpful without being intrusive.  We enjoyed high tea, English breakfast, in-room canapes, room service, in-room tea time, etc.  The room with the twin beds and seating area and spacious bathroom was all the space we needed and much larger than I expected from an European hotel.  The location of your hotel is ideal.  We could (and did) walk to Picadilly Circus, Hyde Park, Berkeley Square, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, and Victoria Station (both bus and train terminals).  For all other excursions, we took the underground which was just a short walk away at Green Park.  Despite the central location, your hotel is tucked away on a quiet, quaint street---just perfect.  Prior to finalizing our trip, I sent my daughter a short list of hotels and asked her to choose where she would like to stay.  She chose the Chesterfield Mayfair because of its location, historic nature, and amenities.  I am so glad that she did.   

Some other comments:  When we checked in my credit card was not accepted because, even though I had called the company to tell them about international travel, the attempted charge in London raised concerns.  Your staff could not have been more helpful.  To further complicate things, this incident occurred on Jan. 2 (a holiday) and my cell phone does not work in London.  So, your staff permitted me to use your hotel phone and were so helpful as I got the situation sorted.  

Thank you, thank you, thank you for our wonderful stay.  

I will recommend your hotel to others and hope to be back soon.",5,2017,01,17
105,Cute and great location,"This is a nice boutique hotel in the center of London. Within walking distance to a lot of the major attractions like Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. Everything else you can get to from the tube. The lobby is pretty with antique furniture and the staff was very friendly. They held our bags since we arrived quite early and where in our room later that day. They also left us a nice card and cupcakes for our anniversary. We had a lot planned in London so we didn't have a lot of time to explore the hotel but their afternoon tea looked really nice and we would have tried it if we had time. The room was decent, small but suitable. The bathroom was very nice and had a large tub. Also, it had lots of storage for your luggage. The bed was decent, not hard or soft and had to request extra pillows. We both had allergy problems while sleeping (only time while visiting several countries) but not sure if it was the hotel or just London in general. Great location and pleasant stay. A great choice for those wanting to be near the main tourist spots in London and want an upscale feel without staying at a chain hotel. ",4,2017,01,17
105,Very much 5 Star,"Everything about this hotel was superb. It has a regency style and is not a 'modern' hotel. The service was terrific, the food first rate and the building itself was excellent and exhumed quality.

The only small drawback was that the rooms were a little small and they were cluttered. Yes, it is good to know about the hotel and it's services, but the folders took up much of the free work service.   The bed made up for it though. It was sumptuous and oh so comfortable.

I would most definitely stay at the Chesterfield again.",5,2017,01,17
105,Mr S Lanza,"We have stayed at this hotel many times and fine it to be very central for shopping , restaurants and general things that you would like to do when in London. The staff and manager of the hotel are also amazing. The rooms are spacious and very well maintained. Everything is perfect and nothing is too much trouble. I would certainly say to anyone wanting to be in the west end to give it a go. Especially room 101 total opulence. ",5,2017,01,17
105,Fantastic Customer Service,"I enjoyed a one night stay with breakfast at The Chesterfield Mayfair on Sat 14/01/17.  This was a get together with my best friend who I have not seen for over 12 months.  

All the staff at The Chesterfield were extremely pleasant, eager to assist and always with a smile from front desk to housekeeping.  I would like to mention our Receptionist Letitia in particular who made our stay truly outstanding.

Our room was pleasantly decorated and very clean. The only slight aspect missing was perhaps a mini bar but all other amenities were provided.

The breakfast which we chose to have delivered to our room at no additional cost had a good range of choices and the eggs were poached beautifully. We will definitely return again.",5,2017,01,16
105,Excellent Three Night Stay in a Beautiful Room,"We'veWe’ve stayed here before in a standard room which, while very well appointed have been on the small side. This time we must have been upgraded to the Music Room which was beautiful with plenty of space and a big bathroom with a lovely free standing bath and shower. 
Comfy bed, lots of toiletries, tea, coffee etc. and plenty of complimentary bottled water. Free Wi-Fi was very good to have – especially in London. 

Breakfast was a bit hit and miss. The food was rather overcooked on the Saturday when it was busy. Buffet selection was good though. If one wants runny eggs – one must order them as runny or they come hard as I discovered on day one. Dining room was elegantly decorated though and staff very attentive. 

Great location and a short walk to the tube. Highly recommended.",5,2017,01,16
105,Wonderful hotel,Having been moved to this hotel due to the one I had chosen being closed for renovations I was a little concerned  - however as soon as we entered the foyer we were treated like royalty nothing was too much trouble. The whole atmosphere was like days gone by total luxury. We had afternoon tea which was perfect. The service was exemplary. We booked for an evening meal/snack for later which also was faultless. Unfortunately the weather was not so good but the hotel supplied umbrellas and taxis so we did manage to do a few touristy things. Our room was spotless. There was nothing we could complain about. The staff at reception were lovely and charged my phone for me as I had taken the wrong charger away. ,5,2017,01,16
105,Made My Birthday !,"We booked for my birthday. We had a very friendly greeting even though we were early. Parking in the area is expensive but no more than the train fare would have been, and the hotel staff parking the car made it all the more attractive. In chatting when we arrived the Reception Manager found out it was my birthday and that we both like G+T. We went out. On our return, our room had been upgraded and there were 2 G+T's ready when we were.  The room was fabulous. Spotlessly clean, well appointed and the bed very comfortable. The bar and restaurant are beautiful. Service at breakfast was excellent and, even though a little expensive, a fantastic choice, worth the extra.  For such a quality hotel, where with others you can experience a little snootiness, we were made to feel very welcome and like we were old friends. Being located close to Oxford/Regent Street, museums and theatres, we know where we want to stay on our next visit to London.  Thanks to all at the Chesterfield.",5,2017,01,15
105,Birtday/work,"We were introduced to the chesterfield by secret escapes. We had originally booked a different hotel. We were transferred to this hotel 2 months before we travelled. 
We arrived at the hotel and found the staff to be exceedingly friendly. We were allocated 'the study ' this was a wonderful, interesting and cosy room. It had very warm and homely feel. The hotel staff couldn't have been better. We dined in the restaurant and had a beautiful meal from the a' la carte menu. We were looked after so well, especially by William. A very knowledgeable member of staff. A credit to your company. It was more like a 5 star rather than a 4 star hotel",5,2017,01,15
105,Amazing!!,"This hotel was a replacement for the original one booked and boy what a replacement!!
The original booking was as a birthday treat for my partner who was turning 50, we never do things like this but as it was a special occasion...
This hotel is everything you'd want it to be, luxury everywhere, friendly staff, beautiful food, everything were not used too.
My partner and i were so impressed, from the minute we arrived at the front door nothing but lovely friendly staff, the decor-beautiful.Our room was amazing!! The staff bought up a lovely little surprise birthday cake for my other half, he was so chuffed, i think that was the best bit for him:) the tasted nice by the way.
I would just like to say a massive thank you to all the staff at the Chesterfield for my making it a brilliant start to a massive birthday weekend!",5,2017,01,15
105,Cocktails! ,"A late spontaneous trip to the Hotel for cocktails! Not my first visit and will not be my last! Greeted by Charlie and the rest of the reception and lobby staff! Shown into the bar and seated at my favourite spot! Assisted straight away by Freddy with the cocktail menu and offering assistance. The best cocktails in London made by the one and only James! My guests and I, one whom happened to travel to London from Ireland for a weekend hosted by myself and my dad, absolutely loved all our drinks, the fabulous atmosphere and the outstanding staff of the hotel! See you all soon! MB x ",5,2017,01,15
105,Classic Boutique Charmer in Heart of Mayfair,"Beautiful little hotel in Mayfair just a short walk from Hyde Park.  Great location as a ""base"" to explore more areas of London.  15 min walk down to Whitehall, Parliament, etc.  Tube station 2 short blocks away at Green Park. Staff here extremely nice and helpful -- good recommendations on restaurants, travel logistics, etc.  Rooms exquisitely outfitted - furniture, art, linens, etc.  On site restaurant is good quality, bar open late, very convivial.  Also, the hotel keeps its own beehives on the roof, so they us their own ""homemade"" honey!  There are MANY quite similar options in this part of London, but you will not regret selecting the Chesterfield.",5,2017,01,14
105,The perfect hotel,From the minute we arrived with the doorman helping to checking out the staff at the Chesterfield were wonderful. Letitia checked us in and gave us an upgrade (the room was great) as it was my wife's birthday with  complimentary drinks at the bar. When we were out they put a cake and card in our room which was just a lovely touch. The location is great for shopping and restaurants we will always use this hotel when visiting London. Thank you so much    ,5,2017,01,13
105,Fabulous Boutique Hotel!,"Wonderful stay.  Staff made us so welcome.  Had a very comfortable room and English breakfast was included in Butler's Restaurant.  There is something for everyone on the menu.  Evening meal was also wonderful.  Can't beat the Dover Sole, prepared at your table.  We have stayed many times in the Mayfair area.  This visit was the best.
We will be planning another visit at The Chesterfield in the future.",5,2017,01,13
105,Worth every penny!,"Small old hotel in a posh, quiet setting with unbelievably great staff (and lots of them too in formal dress!). You felt as if you were in an old English estate with staff who had been there forever. Breakfast was opulent and sufficient to last you through the day. The location was hard to beat and the room tastefully decorated. Comfortable bed in a quiet room rounded out the pleasures. Nearby Shepherd's Market made it easy to find a bite close by. I would definitely return.",5,2017,01,12
105,Amazing Anniversary Celebration,"The staff at Chesterfield Mayfair made our 30th Anniversary one for the family archive. We were surprised with an upgrade when we arrived at the hotel - we were expecting a standard room and breakfast which is what we paid for - what we got was...
The Duchess Suite - amazing in every detail
Cash credit to spend at the restaurant
Plates of hors d'oeuvres and cakes delivered to our room while we were at dinner
An anniversary card signed by several of the staff wishing us happy.
We cannot say enough good things about the staff and the hotel - a very lovely experience made extra special by the staff and the amazing room.",5,2017,01,12
105,Opulent living,"We stayed in the Phillips suite. Large bedroom and a large living room. My three teenage children could comfortably sleep on the living room on cots. Everything was refined. The furnishings, accessories, even a complimentary decanter of Sherry. Everyday we got small knickknacks on our pillow like face rejuvinator spray, bath salts etc. Breakfast was included. Breakfast was ordinary by American standards but was acceptable given that it was complimentary. The staff had excellent manners and was genuinely friendly. Nice library. The bar has great selection. Ask the server for the most flavorful gin, and order it. One suggestion to the hoteliers:
Please match the evening canapes delivered to the room to the number of guests. We were five in number and got four on day one and day two. On the last day, we got one farewell cupcake. May be the cupcake is like a Hawaiian tradition of pineapple. You are welcomed with a pineapple. But if you find one on your bed, its time to go lol.",5,2017,01,09
105,Afternoon tea,"Nothing was too much trouble for all the staff, from arrival to leaving. A nice touch when they came out with a cupcake for a 21st birthday. Food was lovely and plenty of it, and endless tea. Would recomend that you spoil yourself here.",5,2017,01,09
105,Visit to the chesterfield ,"Visited the chesterfield for the day had a lovely steak in the butlers restaurant followed by a drink in the bar jade nelson and all the staff where extremely pleasant and made us feel very welcome will be visiting again 
",5,2017,01,09
105,A shopping trip to be repeated yearly!,"We love this hotel! For 4 girls on a shopping trip it was perfect. After traipsing around all day it was like an oasis to go back and dine in luxury. We highly recommend the location, atmosphere, cuisine and friendly staff and can't wait to return. Thank you. ",5,2017,01,08
105,Night out in london,"Lovely hotel. Staff very helpful, nice room, amazing location. Room wasn't as clean as the wife would have liked, but certainly not dirty. Breakfast nice, but would have preferred a a better buffet option. In the whole, a very nice place to stay. The staff are very pleasant and helpful.",4,2017,01,08
105,Cozy and Exclusive,"The hotel is small but it has a lot of personality. The decor is very traditional. It feels like I traveled back in time. I absolutely love the look of it. The terrace bar is amazing. I love the drinks and the service at the bar. They bring a snack plate over right away which has huge olives, sugar pecans, and salty cracker sticks. There is a piano player very week night. I could go here every night. I also had afternoon tea at the butlers restaurant which was delicious. I had the dancing dragon blooming tea. I do recommend it! I also went down for lunch one day and the service was amazing from the moment I walked through the door. That service is the same impeccable service I received from the entire staff from the Doorman to the chief or room service to the concierge. absolutely everyone was delightful, professional and expedient. The rooms are small but comfortable. They clearly appreciate their guests and genuinely want them to feel comfortable. A couple of touches that I like were. Bartenders and room service remembering previous orders. Room having robes and two sizes of slippers, one larger one for my husband and a smaller pair for me. There were also 6 water bottles restocked each day.3 still and 3 sparkling. There was a tea set with an assortment of teas and a water heater, also cream sugar and cookies. Also a coffee press and coffee press in the room in case at any time you wish to make it for yourself. This is of course apart from room service which I also ordered and was delicious! And on our last night they left a farewell cup cake in the room. Its the little things that make a big difference. The level of personal service I received on my stay was unparalleled and that's why I give it 5 stars!",5,2017,01,08
105,Brilliant Hotel,"We wanted a traditional, historic British hotel and The Chesterfield did not disappoint!  Our stay for 4 nights was fantastic and every staff member was superb!  The bar/lounge was very comfortable and we enjoyed drinks there after long days of sightseeing.  Butler's Restaurant for breakfast worked out very well.  The room was a bit smaller than what we had hoped for, but was extremely comfortable and very well appointed.  The hotel itself is in a stunning neighborhood of London and is beautifully decorated for Christmas.  It is a short walk to Hyde Park where the Winter Wonderland festival takes place... an attraction we highly recommend going to!",5,2017,01,08
105,Chesterfield Afternoon Tea,"What an amazing hotel!! The afternoon tea was with the theme of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, my girls loved it. Was my wife's 40th Birthday, champagne and gorgeous afternoon tea from sandwiches, to cakes, scones and refilled when finished what more could you want!!! Endless surpluses of so many different teas. Such a special and an amazing place, staff were amazing I could not recommend it enough!!! Be going back soon!!!",5,2017,01,07
105,Christmas experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"I am pleased to report I had a very positive experience at the Chesterfield and would recommend it highly to anyone.  The overwhelming number of positive reviews here on TripAdvisor are well earned.  

I stayed for 5 nites on my own over Christmas Day while visiting London.  It was an especially nice gesture for the hotel to give a gift Christmas stocking to the guests.  The mood in the hotel was very celebratory. I stayed in room 608 which was very quiet.  There is fabric covering the walls in the rooms and halls which make the rooms more quiet than any hotel I've been in.  Also the wonderful water pressure in the shower (better than in my home) deserves a mention.

The comments from others about the outstanding service at this hotel are true! I should mention several staff members who deserve recognition: Letitia at the front desk was very helpful to me.  The doormen Gorgy and Norbert were as well.  The two young men working at the bar (I don't know their names) were very pleasant as well.  Housekeeping was outstanding.  They came around every nite with extra towels.

The only area of service improvement I would suggest was within the Butler's restaurant.  I realize the Christmas season brings staffing challenges but the service when I went for dinner on 12/16 was terribly slow.  I was too tired to wait longer and ended up leaving.  The staff sent dinner up to my room as a courtesy which was very nice. 

One other issue is worth comment - on my final bill when I checked out was a 1 pound charge listed as ""charitable donation"".  I have never seen this applied to a hotel bill, especially without notice to the guest.  There was no identification which charity (if any) it was to be given to.  Since I prefer to make my own charitable donations, I asked the trainee front desk clerk Jakob to remove that charge.  I would suggest if the hotel continues that practice, you give notice to the guest at check in that it will be applied to their bill.",5,2017,01,06
105,"The new Capital of London!  Central, convenient and very classy!","Our family of four stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair prior to the Christmas holiday.  In short, it was an amazing five days.  The hotel is very attuned to customer service, which should be the watermark in this industry.  The staff is inviting, very helpful and quite respectful.  The location is ideal for tourism, yet located among the rabbit warren-like streets in the Mayfair section of London.  As for the rooms, they are clean and the beds are fantastic.  We attended breakfast on one of the days, and found a somewhat diverse continental breakfast spanning the offers of fresh fruit, to black pudding.  Based upon our schedule, we mostly ate at Cafe Nero around the corner for breakfast.  The dinners at the Chesterfield was excellent.  Again, service was outstanding, as was the food.",5,2017,01,05
105,Christams at the Mayfair,"Booked the Mayfair for four nights over the Christmas period. From start to finish the stay was excellent. First class service throughout. All staff were very friendly and attentive. The room was very nice, not a bad size for a London Hotel, bathroom nice, bath and overhead shower. Very  large comfortable bed.
We ate in the restaurant for breakfast, very good choice, full English, eggs benedict etc and extensive cold continental style buffet. 
We had an afternoon meal from the main menu which was very good but the best meal was Christmas lunch. It was a fantastic 6 courses over a nice and relaxed 2.5hrs not rushed at all.
The hotel is in a fantastic position, walking: 15mins to oxford st, 15mins Regent st, 10 mins Bond st and about 20mins to theatre land. Green park tube station is a 5-10 min walk around the corner opposite the Ritz.
I would highly recommend this hotel, and recommend Red Carnation hotels having stayed at others in London.",5,2017,01,05
105,Best staff ever! Great location,Incredibly good location and friendly staff! The hotel is old fashioned typical English. The breakfast lady has great energy and really cares. I definitely recommend the hotel for the location and warm welcome from the staff.,5,2017,01,01
105,Highly recommended ,"Hands down the best hotel I ve stayed in. The chesterfield is an old English style hotel the staff at this hotel are like no other. The service I received was top notch. They were always happy to help and full of information from the moment I checked in to the time checked out the entire experience was seamless. They were always cheerful friendly and polite; rooms were cleaned daily any requests were met instantly. The hotel manager, staff at the concierge, guys at the bar and the door man were fantastic they you feel so welcome and at home. The location of the chesterfield Mayfair is positioned very centrally. I was able to walk everywhere. They was no need to catch a single taxi during my entire stay of 8 days . It's 5 mins walk to Green park station and there is a direct line to to Heathrow. I will definitely be staying at Chesterfield Mayfair on my next trip!!! 
The only opportunity I can think of is the restaurant managers. I dined there for both breakfast and dinner and their attitudes and the level of service was not at the same level as the rest of hotel staff. ",5,2017,01,01
105,"Beautifully appointed rooms, excellent location, attentive staff!","I can't speak highly enough of this property! I had the pleasure of staying here during a business trip to London in late November, and as a NYC luxury hotelier myself, my standards are sometimes impossibly high; however, the Chesterfield Mayfair not only met, but exceeded each and every expectation. The hotel itself is charming yet sophisticated and elegant; the rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated, and the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and well looked after. A special thank you to Jade at the bar and to Adam, the Hotel Manager. You're both wonderful assets to the hotel and the epitome of true hospitality!

I look forward to returning to the Chesterfield Mayfair next time my travels bring me to London.",5,2016,12,30
105,A delightful welcoming hotel,I stayed overnight after a theatre trip with friends. The hotel looked lovely decorated for Christmas and it was a delight from beginning to end. A particular pleasure is the bar with a pianist and very knowledgeable bar staff. ,5,2016,12,30
105,Traditional Comfort,"We had a lovely comfortable stay in this good value traditional hotel in the centre of London. The extra touches here such as a mini mince pie with the turn down service, attentive staff and a wonderful gin tasting experience really rise this hotel above a lot of others we have stayed in London.",5,2016,12,28
105,London visit ,Good location in Mayfair easy access to west end and shepherd market where there are good restaurants for breakfast and dinner.Room was a little snug for us beds a little hard for our taste bathroom really nice good shower.Easy access to Green Park tube 5 min walk and buses would recommend buying an Oyster card for travel on public transport in London makes life a lot easier ,4,2016,12,28
105,Christmas at the Chesterfield,"Seven of us spent four evenings here over the Christmas holiday.  It is an elegant older building that has been updated.  The location is in a quiet side street in Mayfair.  It is fairly close to Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park.

The staff was very responsive and were very good to our 5 and 9 year old grandkids.  We ate breakfast each day, had high tea one day, and ate one dinner here as well.  The food was very well prepared and beautifully presented.

Highly recommended!",5,2016,12,26
105,Fabulous Christmas Day Lunch,Absolutely fabulous Christmas day meal.  Hotel was decorated beautifully.  Santa was on site and giving out presents to all. Dining room was beautiful and the meal was delicious.  Staff were very attentive and the whole experience was great. Definitely worth doing if you are in London for Christmas.,5,2016,12,25
105,"Fresh, fine and nice","We stayed here for four days enjoyed all the time. The breakfast is very good, the staff and the service is very good. The room was ok in size - it tends to be less in the London city - clean, and very pleasant. The situation in London is perfect: quiet, yet close to everything.",5,2016,12,23
105,The best afternoon tea experience ,"The afternoon tea here is flawless. The waiting staff are attentive and polite, not once did we find ourselves having to catch their attention or feel pressured to vacate the table that happens so often in other venues. 
We came at Christmas and so had the winter wonderland themed afternoon tea which was amazing. The sandwiches were tasty, the cakes and scones were perfect. It was also unlimited refills which meant we could all try the different cakes and sandwiches. 
Overall, this has been my best experience of afternoon tea in London. Excellent and I'll definitely be back!
",5,2016,12,20
105,"Excellent location, highly motivated staff, but...........","Spent 3 nights in this perfectly located medium sized 4star- hotel close to Piccadilly in the very centre of Mayfair. Reception- and bar- staff is helpful, efficient & highly motivated. Excellent bar with great atmosphere. Afternoon tea overpriced. Classic rooms are not big, but with almost all amenities needed (surprisingly they don´t have a minibar). 
If sensitive of noise avoid rooms viewing the backyard  as there is a permanent sound level from the exhaust fans starting from 8:00 a.m. till about 1:30 a.m.- you´ll hear it even with closed windows. Specially on 3rd floor these exhaust fans are right in front of the windows, maybe it´s better on higher floors.
If you can get a quiet room- recommended because of location and staff.",4,2016,12,20
105,Romantic WE before wedding,"My fiancé and myself would like to thank your team very much for the superb week-end we spent at the Chesterfield. 
 
We enjoyed a cosy drink at the bar, gorgeous breakfasts, our quiet and comfortable room and, on top of that, the kind efficiency of the Chesterfield team. 
 
I’m also very grateful for your help into getting a tea time reservation at the Ritz. A childhood dream has come true last Friday, this experience having been far beyond my expectancy. 
 
Merry Christmas and a happy new year!",5,2016,12,20
105,Warm and wonderful,"What do you look for for in a great hotel? Beautiful room decor? Egyptian cotton? King size bed? Lovely lounge area? Impeccable service? Warmth and friendliness? Great restaurant and bar? Well informed concierge. Well look no further! Introducing the Chesterfield Mayfair. Five star service without the cold distant aloofness that so often surrounds premium experiences. A warm and welcoming but beautiful and premium hotel. Just walking inside greeted by smiles and heartfelt warmth makes you happy.

Every year my Mum and I go to London - to experience only the best London has to offer - from the Ritz to the Dorchester. Well we needn't look further - we have found our spot. 

The service was impeccable, staff were amazing and the room was beautiful. We were so delighted with the hotel.

You can't go wrong here!

105,"Charming, Elegant and Perfectly Located","One of the hallmarks of a great hotel is exceptional service...this hotel has that in spades!  This small and charming hotel is well located in Mayfair, cozy and comfortable with exemplary service and charm. Our concierge, Darren, was able to provide expert advice, from shopping to dining, securing last minute reservations...all provided with genuine warmth and aim to please.. In fact, all of the staff was friendly, welcoming and helpful. We love this hotel! Breakfast is fabulous and not to be missed...and the bar, after long hours of touring and shopping, is a welcome spot to adjust an attitude! An added major bonus is that this hotel represents tremendous value!",5,2016,12,19
105,Another wonderful stay,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield we stayed for 2 nights , it was a birthday treat for my daughter her 18th . You are  made welcome as soon as you walk through the door , the staff are fantastic. we stayed in two classic double rooms , both were of a good size and the beds were very  comfortable . Breakfast superb lots to chose from , I would also recommend dinning in the butlers restaurant its a must . The food is fantastic and so Is the service . We intend to visit London three times in 2017 and we intend to stay at the Chesterfield on each occasion .",5,2016,12,18
105,Less than Stellar ,"Well, this should be a rave review, but it isn't. The hotel has a good location, the amenities were nice, but somehow the experience was less than stellar.  We arrived early (1:00) and at first they said our room was ready - then they said that was a mistake and it was not ready.  However, they said they would upgrade  us to a executive room. The room turned out to be extremely small -- that was an upgrade? Really? 

We decided to have a ""bite"" to eat in the bar - which was hardly full- but had to wait 50 minutes for our food. The bartender was very apologetic and comped us our lunch which we did appreciate. (And we left an appropriate tip for that kindness - it was most likely the kitchens fault and not our server). 

I suspect there is some type of management problem, as all staff seemed stressed to me. Overall it wasn't a happy experience. 

Also, the hotel seemed over decorated for my taste, as if it were trying too hard to be posh. ""Tarted up"" is the phrase that comes to mind. 

For these reason, I would not book at that hotel again, and I would recommend it to others with caution. ",3,2016,12,18
105,The staff – every single one of them! - is consistently friendly and helpful at every stay,"The hotel seems to be an excellent work place for the staff, which I believe contributes to the consistent high quality, amicable atmosphere and friendly service that I receive every time I stay there.
The rooms are not large but well furnished and equipped and provides variation between stays. Not two are identical? The beds are wonderful with duvets.
Super, effecient location in the heart London, in a quiet, safe neighborhood. 
Fantastic value for money.",5,2016,12,17
105,what a wonderful stay,Always traveling around the world we celebrated some lovely days at the Chesterfield Mayfair well i want to thank them for their outstanding staff we felt so welcome .The breakfast was superb as well as the Butlers restaurant .All so cosy and we really found our place in London to return .The location in wonderful . The rooms are so elegant decorated. Well i would say keep up the high standard and great trained staff and the great atmosphere .we are already looking forward returning . !!!,5,2016,12,17
105,Winter wonderland tea,"We have been to the Chesterfield 3 times now for tea and this is the first for their Winter Wonderland themed tea. We had a lovely experience there as always with the service and staff (Marius - thank you so much) very attentive throughout. We sat in the conservatory and on arrival you have a glass of mulled wine and we had the champagne tea with their Christmas blend tea (which I would recommend - although spiced tasted lovely, like mince pies!!). We had two servings of sandwiches and the cakes and scones were delicious. We had vouchers from a previous visit (the golden tickets from Willy Wonka theme) which gave us money off. At the end of the tea we were able to pick another two envelopes for next time. I would recommend a visit for tea here.",5,2016,12,16
105,"Perfectly Located with Cozy, Comfortable Atmosphere","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in December and it was as if we'd fallen into Christmas. Gorgeously decorated inside and out.  The staff was incredibly generous and helpful.  The room was comfortable and cozy.  The shower had a glass half wall instead of a curtain or door, so beware the water spills on the floor.  Bar was fantastic.  Breakfast in the restaurant was great.  And the location was superior!  Situated close to the Green Park tube station, Buckingham Palace, Bond Street, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, the Theater district, and Shepherds Market which is a gem in and of itself!",4,2016,12,16
105,OUTSTANDING,"This is our  second visit this year, and the hotel continues to be quite brilliant. Warm friendly staff at reception,great bar service especially Jade and wonderful pianist. Excellent breakfast served in such lovely surroundings

Hotel is situated right in the middle of Mayfair..excellent restaurants in nearby Shepherd Market

Cannot  recommend highly enough  and hopefully we will visit again very soon",5,2016,12,16
105,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Had a delightful afternoon tea here for my birthday. The service was impeccable and the selection and quality of sandwiches, teas and cakes was excellent. The surroundings are beautiful and I loved how we could have unlimited refills so my partner and I tried four different teas between us, all of which were wonderful. I really enjoyed my afternoon tea here. ",5,2016,12,15
105,Fabulous family friendly stay ,"
We stayed at the Chesterfield  for 2 nights in early December with our two young children ( 2&3). It was fabulous. Josef the porter carried our 2 year old in, gave her a tour of his hat and then produced a croissant for our 3 year old when she dropped a not so subtle hint. The wonderful Letitia was warm and welcoming and made sure we had little extras like kids toiletries, mini bathrobes and slippers, not to mention cots etc. The rooms were outstanding- individually decorated and a gave a real sense of luxury. And breakfast was fantastic- our kids marched in on our second day demanding more eggs and hot chocolate. A few minutes walk from Hyde Park and all of the west end, it made for a great base for a few Christmas activities - ice skating in Somerset House, visiting the lions in trafalgar square and of course feeding the ducks in the Serpentine. Great hotel- highly recommend it.",5,2016,12,14
105,Afternoon tea delight,"We took my family here for the festive afternoon tea and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were welcoming and attentive and the food was delicious. I was a big fan of the mini yule log!

We will definitely be going back.",5,2016,12,14
105,Christmas shopping ,"Our fourth visit here for a weekend of Christmas shopping with my sister and niece .
A lovely stay nothing was too much trouble ,staff friendly & helpful .The food in the library was delicious (main restaurant had a private party booked) and in the bar we had a champagne cocktail,gin /tonic free as part of executive club menu on both nights - a nice touch .
All of us were made to feel special and welcome card from Adam was lovely too.
Great hotel,great location super staff - merry Christmas to you all .",5,2016,12,13
105,December 3 2016,"Had a fantastic Christmas afternoon tea.  The place was beautifully decorated for Christmas, really warm and cosy, a haven of peace and comfort after a busy few hours shopping.  The sandwichs and cakes were lovely and the scones were the best we have ever had.  The staff were delightful, very friendly and efficient, we were very well looked after.
Highly recommended.  Will definitely return.",5,2016,12,13
105,"– “A Hidden Mayfair Gem…""","I am running out of accolades for the Chesterfield Hotel because it continues to be nothing less than outstanding in every way year, after year, after year…

The quintessential British style and luxurious elegance of the hotel is reason enough to stay there but the staff are quite another.  Each, and every, member of staff that you deal with will be nothing less than happy help you – and they do so with a genuine smile on their faces.

Ask the chambermaid for extra milk, biscuits, towels – done.  Want your eggs “shaken not stirred” at breakfast – done. Need a table in the bar for pre-theatre drinks – done.  Need a taxi to get you to the theatre on time – done.  Whatever it is you require it’s done; and with a smile and the greatest of pleasure.

We, a group of independent lady guests, feel very welcomed and safe staying at the Chesterfield hotel which is an important consideration in todays’ volatile world. 

We’ve booked already for next year. And, a special mention is due to Letitia, on the front desk, for accommodating all our requirements for our 2017 booking with good grace and the loveliest of smiles.

The location is ideal – turn right off Berkeley Square to take you towards the expensive delights of Mayfair & Piccadilly.  Turn left and wind your way in a matter of minutes to the retail madness that is Oxford Street.

What’s not to love…go there!",5,2016,12,13
105,Mr,"Afternoon tea was fabulous with a good and unlimited selection of sandwiches, scones and cakes

105,Short but perfect stay,"Stayed in this hotel with my sister in November and I have to say that I have not find anything to complain about. We had a dinner in the restaurant and as everything in the menu sounded very delicious, it was hard to decide what to order. Our meal was amazing both the dinner so the breakfast. Staff was very attentive and friendly. As soon as we got to our room we were brought a little appetizer which was nice. The room was clean with enough amenities.",5,2016,12,08
105,Boutique Hotel with Fabulous Staff,"Chesterfield rooms are a little on the small side, which is typical for London. The common area is very nicely appointed and welcoming! My wife particularly enjoyed the afternoon hot cocoa provided for guests!
I must make special mention of the concierge Joshua! He really knocked himself out getting us tickets, dinner reservations, and large taxi's to accommodate our group of 6! I should also say that all staff were always very pleasant and as accommodating as possible! 
The area around this hotel is great for bars and restaurants as well. We'll be back!",5,2016,12,08
105,So great !!!,"I spent 4 nights in this wonderful hotel. Friendly and attentive staff, feeling like I was at home. I was in a single room and it was perfect: clean, beautiful and comfortable bed. Decor and style British and so lovely. Excellent breakfast and afternoon tea with various cakes give a special touch to this boutique hotel. Free small bottle of water every day and cleaning and fitting room 2 times a day. Great location: 10 min walk to the shopping street, 20 minutes to London eye. Mayfair neighborhood is lovely, peaceful and beautiful. Considering that I was travelling alone as a single woman and stayed alone at the hotel I felt completely safe and cared for. Thank you all and I'll be back again for sure!
Sincerely, Vanja",5,2016,12,07
105,Afternoon tea,"Had an afternoon tea with two friends as part of a birthday celebration, and I have to say , it's one of the most pleasant places to be. The staff was more than friendly , took perfect care of us, paying attention to every detail, also preparing with a nice little present, after they heard it's our birthday. Special thanks to Biagio for looking after us to the fullest. We will definitely return",5,2016,12,07
105,Birthday afternoon tea ,"We've been there for the first time on Sunday to have an afternoon tea to celebrate our birthdays! 
The service was excellent and Biagio (The F&B manager), took good care of us surprising us with some little presents during the hours we spent there, he took us to have a show around and made sure we were happy and everything was perfect! Thanks again Biagio for looking after us! We will definitely come back again! :) 
Great and excellent service in the bar area and restaurant too. Highly recommended! ",5,2016,12,07
105,Wow!,"We stayed at The Chesterfield to celebrate our engagement and it was quite frankly the most delightful experience.
You step through the doors, held open by a perfectly attired and friendly doorman and back in time to an age where glamour, sophistication and courteous perfection are the order of the day (and night).
Upon arrival we were greeted by receptionist Letitia, the epitome of cheerful professionalism who upgraded us to a junior suite, The Chesterfield, which was luxury itself - we were speechless for some time, I have never known my fiancé lost for words - props to The Chesterfield methinks. We were then surprised with a bottle of champagne sent to us by Letitia and delivered by Alice, another amazing member of The Chesterfield team, charming, helpful & happy.
The bathroom was sparkling, with two showers, one over the Jacuzzi bath (with which I very nearly caused a tsunami - eek) and the other in a cubicle, fluffsome towels, thick, plush dressing gowns and Elemis products - perfection.
Amazing breakfasts too, which we had in our room (because we didn't want to leave it and all its splendour), again delivered by a lovely lady (sadly, I cannot remember her name).
You get a free drink voucher for the bar and I must suggest you sip upon the Old Fashioned, which comes with a ginormous ice sphere. 
Also, in the bar, you are served a selection of canapés free of charge and your table snacks are the biggest olives on the planet, Twiglets and scrumptious cashews. It will come as no surprise to learn that the bar staff (namely James) are truly exemplary and will cater to your every beverage whim. 
I cannot recommend this timeless beauty of a hotel enough, it sure is a treat.
Thank you Team Chesterfield",5,2016,12,06
105,"Well, what can I say","Absolutely outstanding, room, staff and where it's situated is totally perfect. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be coming again and will recommend to others. ",5,2016,12,05
105,A great location and helpful staff,"We've just returned from 8 days in London. We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair our entire visit. The Mayfair location is perfect and really convenient to many of the sights of London. This is a boutique hotel, quaint and very British. The staff was helpful and friendly and we loved the neighborhood of the hotel. We walked to many places.  I do think the rooms could use a bit of a update but the bed was super comfortable and we would recommend this property. The bar has live music (piano) at night, they serve a lovely afternoon tea and it was decorated beautifully for the holidays. We'll keep this on our list for our next visit to London.",5,2016,12,04
105,Absolutely amazing !!!,"Thank you so much to the entire team at the Chesterfield !!! Thank you Letitia and Matthew at the reception, Antonio at the room service, William at the Butlers, James at the bar (Gin & Tonic with cinnamon was fabulous !!) and to all of you for making this stay extra special !! From arrival to departure it has been a wonderful experience ! You have an amazing staff, very friendly and helpful, the suite was gorgeous and very spacious ! It is definitely the best hotel in the area, I would recommend it to anyone looking for perfection ! The Butlers restaurant offers an amazing cuisine and a brilliant service, I had the best dover sole ever, greatly recommended by William ! The bar is charming with a very large selection of drinks and a very relaxing atmosphere, perfect for a late drink.. I will definitely be back !",5,2016,12,03
105,Boutique Gem In Mayfair,"I just loved this hotel. It's old school with great service and comfortable lodgings. It is also not overly large or too small. The public rooms are well furnished and staffed with polite service oriented professionals who are not overbearing but always handy. In a world of generic brand hotels, this place is warm and unique. The size and high end decor makes you feel as if you are in a luxurious 19th century mansion but you are a welcome guest. Table service in the restaurant was perfect. The food was excellent. Breakfast was first rate as was the afternoon High Tea. Loved the high tea.

Located in Mayfair, it is near the Green Park Tube/subway stop and multiple bus stops on Piccadilly, only a couple of blocks away, an easy walking distance. We found it extremely convenient. 

The room we had was a modest size but updated and completely decorated, featuring luxury linens. The bathroom was modern and clean. It was quiet. We stayed 8 nights and were sorry to go.",5,2016,12,03
105,Perfection ,"Loved this hotel. The room is beautiful and have a good size. Very comfortable and quiet.
Lovely staff and perfect location.
There are many options of restaurants, markets with good options of meals. 
The subway is very close.
Thank you for everything. ",5,2016,12,02
105,"Superb service, Mayfair location and good value","Stayed in this small luxury hotel for 5 days while on a visit to London. Could not have picked a nicer location, close to a quaint market with a variety of reasonably-priced restaurants. Service was simply superb: personalized, warm and attentive. We were impressed by how outstanding the staff was; Freddy is a good example of the excellent staff in the Bar area. The area is safe, close to things, but the rooms are not spacious, a common issue with London.",5,2016,12,01
105,Excellent hotel and perfect location.,"We loved our stay in Chesterfield! Accomodation and staff and service are extremelly good. Very cosy rooms and housekeeping twice a day with little extras was very nice!!!
Very complete breakfast all freshly prepared.  Afternoon tea lovely experience but overpriced. Most convenient location. Would certainly consider staying there again.",5,2016,11,28
105,Cheers to The Chesterfield,"Fantastic experience. Very friendly, very well run, really nice people. All the hotel staff were superb. Front desk / concierge (Darren and Joshua) were fabulously helpful in making recommendations and reservations. All were spot on. Restaurant staff remembered our names after the first day! Greeted and seated promptly each and every day. Christina was especially nice in the restaurant.  Excellent location. Will definitely stay again!",5,2016,11,24
105,Wonderful service in superb location,"We travelled to London to see exhibitions at the RA. The Chesterfield was perfectly placed for this in a superb location. The staff were unbelievably attentive and helpful and our one night stay was a joy. The decor is English club, comfortable and inviting on a very windy Autumn day. The room was small but perfectly appointed with a spacious bathroom.
We will definitely stay again not least because of the wonderful service.",5,2016,11,23
105,Quintessentially British,"We were looking for a quintessentially British hotel, on the smaller side, in a quiet, yet central location. The Chesterfield was everything we were looking for! While the room we had was somewhat small, it was comfortable and quiet. The breakfast was outstanding, and we enjoyed both tea and drinks at the hotel. Service and staff were superb. Would not hesitate to recommend the Chesterfield, and will definitely stay again next time we visit London.",5,2016,11,21
105,"Fabulous hotel and staff, and the location can't be beat.","We like to stay in authentic, historic, yet well located hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair was all of that and more. I traveled with my daughter this time and we loved the Chesterfield. The friendly staff and atmosphere were warm and welcoming. We were greeted by the lovely Matthew at the front desk upon arrival. After a long day of travel, his pleasant and quiet demeanor was just what we needed. Also at the entrance was Gyorgy, he was amazing. He helped with luggage, opened doors for us, gave directions, and one day when we were a bit lost, he walked down the street and walked with us to our destination (as it was a bit difficult to navigate).  Truly outstanding was Antonio in food services. If you find yourself ordering off of the room service menu, not only is the food delicious...If you have Antonio deliver it, you will not be disappointed. He loves his work and his service shines. My daughter wanted to pack him up and take him home. The staff in the lounge were also awesome. Really, I can't say enough about the staff and service. The room was lovely and authentically English, beds were comfortable and it was quiet. Location wise it was ideal.  We were able to walk to the places we wanted to go, it is close to Bond Street (Old and New), a short walk through Green Park and you are at Buckingham Palace, The Ritz for afternoon tea, or walk to the Green Park tube station to get anywhere else. Amazing restaurants nearby, Nobu and Sexy Fish are walkable for example. Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair, if we return to London, we will be back for another visit.",5,2016,11,21
105,Spoiled Rotten,"I checked in on the 5th November as a Birthday Treat. On arrival Roberta from Reception checked me in and was very welcoming. Unfortunately my rom was not quite ready so I kept my bag with the Concierge Team.

I returned at 1pm, my room was ready. I was stunned, my room was amazing! I was upgraded to the Jungle Suite. A large spacious bedroom with leopard themed carpet.

I had an afternoon tea booked in the Butlers Restaurant at 1:30, I bought a friend along with me. William looked after us and made us feel very welcome. We had the Willy Wonka themed afternoon tea which was absolutely amazing (I returned a week later with my cousin). The restaurant was obviously advised that I was celebrating my birthday as I had a cake and some staff sing 'Happy Birthday' to me. Thanks Ian, Willy Wonka and William - your singing skills are superb and was a real treat.

Later that evening, I returned to my room to find a small room service card advising me that I had missed out on Complimentary Canapés, I called down to Room Service. Alice was so prompt and so welcoming and friendly and bought me some up. 

A card was signed by all the staff which was a really nice touch and a small cake was also in the room for my Birthday. Thank you!

Sunday evening, I met up with Letitia, the Nights Manager who showed me around some rooms and gave me a little walking tour around the hotel. She was so friendly and had such a bubbly personality, was a real pleasure touring the hotel with her. Letitia then checked me out really early Monday morning as I had a 6am train to catch, and was able to advise me the best time to catch which tube and which destination to go to.

You guys spoiled me rotten and made my stay so special.

Thank you so much for all my treats and for such a wonderful bedroom.

I cant wait to return and hope to book to stay in the near future.",5,2016,11,21
105,Fabulous revisit tinged with great sadness.,"This fabulous hotel has been our regular home from home for the past 10 years and holds so many wonderful memories for us that we wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. We now live in the Middle East but still return again and again to this gem of a hotel for our much needed 'Chesterfield Fix'  The location, the warm welcoming atmosphere, the decor, the food and the amazing staff who are truly wonderful, are just a few of the reasons why we choose to stay here. 
Our visit this time was no different except to learn of the sad passing of one of our concierge friends Christopher Campbell. Chris was instrumental in my husband and myself getting married and we shall never forget this amazing gentleman. Rest in peace special friend, you shall forever be in our hearts and fondly talked about often.",5,2016,11,20
105,The Big things are good.....the small things are great,"This is a gem in London. Apart from the great location, a few blocks off Piccadilly, it has a very authentic London feel, all wood panels and leather, a cozy bar, a beautiful atrium for afternoon tea. The decor is very traditional with a timeless feel. The rooms are named and themed in the style of a bye-gone era, very atmospheric (and comfortable too, btw). 

For all the beautiful property what makes The Chesterfield special are its people. They were all so welcoming, obliging and really capable professionals. The atmosphere created there makes it the place we will come back to whenever we are in London.",5,2016,11,18
105,Yet another wonderful stay,Could only manage one night this time would not consider staying any where else now.Sometimes a second visit does not match up but this one was better than the last time.What a wonderful team Adam has.,5,2016,11,18
105,Lunch,"Chesterfield hotel

From the moment we arrived to the farewell after a  leisurely lunch at Butlers restaurant we couldn't have been made to feel more welcome The traditional
 British ambience  charm and  fare which has been so sadly lost in many London establishments is alive and well in abundance at the Chesterfield hotel in the heart of Mayfair the calm professionalism and the air of nothing is too much trouble was a delight to experience The lobster omelette which I considered a light lunch and recommended with a Chardonnay where both superb.Unrushed reassuring service made the whole lunch,finished with a classic cheeseboard a wonderful experience had it been a dinner I think I would have certainly opted for a traditional English roast carved at the table from a magnificent silver trolley anyone visiting London for the first time should choose the Chesterfield to experience a first class traditional British welcome in a wonderful location special thanks to Adam who made it a wonderful day 
",5,2016,11,18
105,Birthday Celebrations,"Both myself and mother in law share the same birthday weekend! And were lucky enough to stay here for 2 nights!!! We were all truly blown away from the start with our greeting through to us leaving!
Cocktail experiences were amazing especially the gin experience and Eton mess cocktail for dessert.
The room was stunning and had some lovely personal touches in both our rooms to celebrate our birthday. 
We ate at the hotel both nights in the end as we were so blown away on the first night, and the breakfast...... well you are certainly not left hungry!
All the staff were so friendly from the cleaners to the door staff!
AMAZING! Have already been recommending and planning out next visit! ",5,2016,11,17
105,Excellent ,"We stayed at the hotel for a weekend and t was great! Location was perfect if you want to be near Mayfair. Walking distance to different attractions and to the underground. Comfortable rooms, very cozy and excellent service.",5,2016,11,16
105,Best Boutique Hotel in London,"I had the pleasure of again staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair for three nights earlier this month. It is right in the middle of Mayfair, and so centrally located that it's almost unbelievable. You can walk to anywhere you want to go in central London and be there in 15 to 20 minutes. Anywhere. That being said, the real allure of this hotel is found in its coziness, its quiet, its incredible staff and its beautiful and tasteful rooms.  Everyone at the front desk is spectacularly kind and helpful, and people like Biagio, the food and beverage director, make the experience of having (the included) breakfast, cocktails or anything else there an absolute delight.  I almost hesitated at reviewing this hotel out of fear more people would find out about it!  And the rates? Spectacularly reasonable! Easily my favorite hotel in all of London.",5,2016,11,16
105,Excellent as ever,Excellent as ever The Chesterfield  is in the perfect location in Mayfair we have stayed there on numerous occasions  service is excellent rooms elegant staff are friendly and helpful breakfasts are disgracefully good the only place to stay,5,2016,11,15
105,Nowhere better in London ,"This is our favourite hotel in London. We try to stay whenever we are in town. As we had had 2 weeks in Thailand and flew in early evening we decided to stay here before I travelled home and my husband returned to work. As always the welcome was warm and check in efficient. Our room was beautiful, all are slightly different, and we had a bowl of fruit. 

The bed was comfy and room cosy. The ambiance in the hotel is always good but it is the staff who make it, all are friendly and go out of their way to chat albeit very professionally 

The hotel is in an ideal location, suffering from jet lag we awoke early and walked up New Bond St and Oxford street just before shop opening time to see the Christmas decorations   

We didn't breakfast in the hotel but have in the past and it is usually good

We always feel as though we are coming home when visiting and this is enhanced by the welcome note that was left in our room

Thank you, again",5,2016,11,15
105,Another excellent and most enjoyable stay at this wonderful hotel,"My wife and I have stayed at the Chesterfield on several occasions, and it is now our favourite, and certainly first-choice, hotel in London; this time, we stayed for 5 nights. Apart from its great location in Mayfair and close proximity to Green Park tube station, what really sets the Chesterfield apart is the friendliness of the staff, who are always most pleasant and helpful. This time we stayed in the Chesterfield Suite; we enjoyed the spaciousness and furnishings of the suite. There are two good sized closets for cases and clothes, and a third smaller cupboard which contains a safe and the tea/coffee tray. The hotel dining room (Butlers) is a lovely room for breakfast and dinner; we particularly like the fact that the restaurant serves pre-theatre dinners from 5:30pm. We look forward to our next stay in the coming year.",5,2016,11,14
105,Perfect hotel in the heart of Mayfair ,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for one night and it was amazing, as someone who lives in london these are the type of hotels that represent all that is English - traditional with all the modern finishings. Everything in the room was so well appointed, the bathroom especially impressed me with a walk in shower as well as a bathtub. I also had afternoon tea and it was excellent! We were served by Marius and he was excellent in the way he explained the different pastries and gave us brilliant friendly service. I will definitely return ! This hotel is faultless and their excellent staff compliment the first class facilities and food. Why would you stay anywhere else ?
Thank you for an amazing experience.",5,2016,11,13
105,Another wonderful stay.,"Why consider going anywhere else?!
The staff are so friendly and helpful, the rooms cozy and homely, the breakfast always delicious and such a brilliant location.
A truly fabulous hotel.
Thanks again.",5,2016,11,11
105,A Quintessentially English Wedding Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield on our Wedding night because the hotel is affiliated with our chosen wedding venue.  The hotel staff were extremely helpful with our booking and the bookings of our family and friends.  

I stayed at the hotel the night before our wedding and although our wedding night was complimentary, I was upgraded to the Chesterfield suite for both nights.  The Chesterfield suite was stunning and when my husband and I arrived back at the hotel on our wedding night we had been left a lovely bottle of champagne and a card.  The breakfast was delicious and the doorman were very welcoming.  It is a simply lovely hotel!",5,2016,11,09
105,Great afternoon tea for my wife's birthday,"We are just back from London celebrating my wife's birthday. She is a massive Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan so decided to book here for afternoon tea. 

We arrived at 1300 and there were quite a few others arriving at this time. Promptly seated in the restaurant and the waitress was helpful in recommendations of tea and also on answering any questions we had about the menu.  

The food we fantastic I must admit. We asked for only a few of the sandwiches to suit our taste which wasn't a problem. They were cut into small sandwiches and we're very tasty. The staff were good and were happy to change the sandwiches to suit your own tastes. 

Scones and selection of buns were very good. You could have as much as you wanted if you got through the selection on the table.

Willy Wonka made an appearance and the kids seemed to love it. Happily recommend here. ",5,2016,11,08
105,"Charming, Reasonably Priced Hotel","This hotel is in Mayfair, London.  It is perfectly located, within walking distance of all the major London attractions such as the London Eye, Buckingham Palace Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square.  The hotel staff treated us very well.  The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant.  We especially enjoyed spending time in the bar with the bartender, Jade who tended to our every need.  Her service was over the top and she made us feel extremely welcome.  The hotel bar also provides complimentary snacks at the bar, such as our new favorite snack, Twiglets (English pretzels), olives and nuts.

The hotel concierge, Joshua was also extremely helpful, answering our many tourist questions and provided is with useful tips and directions.  

Jade and Joshua are both huge assets to The Chesterfield Mayfair and their service made our stay that much more enjoyable.  We are looking forward to returning to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel as soon as possible.  ",5,2016,11,07
105,An afternoon full of magic! ,"After viewing copious amounts of afternoon teas online, there was one which stood out to us more than any. The Chesterfield 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' afternoon looked like something else and that is exactly what it was. 

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by an extremely polite man who then took our coats to the cloakroom. From there, we waited outside the place where afternoon tea was held and it wasn't long before a member of staff greeted us and said although we were early, we could be seated already! Our hungry tummies were then shown to our table and that is where the magic begun. Marius came to our table and greeted us with such manner and happiness, we felt as if we'd been regular for years even though this was our first experience at the hotel. This incredible service from Marius was continued throughout our whole experience. We started with the chocolate tea which was absolutely delicious. My partner does not like many types of sandwiches but the kitchen were more than happy to adhere to his taste buds. This made him very happy! The afternoon tea itself was out of this world - the many sweet delights were not a disappointment. They taste as good as they look and then some! The piano player and Willy Wonka made this experience even more wonderful. Willy himself made us feel so welcome! 

Our afternoon tea was wonderful and we cannot fault the hotel at all for anything. Thank you Chesterfield waiting staff, kitchen staff, Willy and the pianist for such a delightful experience, we will be back sometime soon! ",5,2016,11,07
105,First rate hotel in fabulous location,"Hotel was beautiful, rooms were lovely, service was extraordinary, and location was within walking distance to many restaurants, tube, and tourist attractions. Hotel also had a fantastic breakfast to start your day!",5,2016,11,07
105,Superb Afternoon Tea,"As a Devonian my only criticism of the afternoon tea is that the cream for the scones is Cornish. Everything about the experience was excellent. 
I first took my girlfriend here 3 years ago ago and we have since tried 2 other hotels in Mayfair for afternoon tea but the chesterfield is definitely the best. 
Marius and the rest of the team really looked after us and made the afternoon special. 
My personal highlights were the chocolate and hazelnut tea (subtle and not too sweet) and the chocolate orange oompa lumpa cupcake. 
The Charlie and the chocolate theme not only lends itself well to some delicious food, but also makes visiting the chesterfield fun and enjoyable. 
The hotel is situated a scone's throw away from Green and Hyde Park and in the heart of the back streets off of Oxford street which means there's plenty of places to go exploring and walk off the afternoon tea you've just indulged in. ",5,2016,11,07
105,Perfectly nice,"This is a perfectly nice place to stay in Mayfair, London. I can't say that I spent a lot of time in the place because of commitments elsewhere, but my only real comment was to wake up very hot in the middle of the night, to eventually find the air conditioning. It's this little kind of thing that I wish that they'd made obvious when I checked in. Oh well.",4,2016,11,06
105,Luxury at reasonable prices,"Used this hotel a few years back and saw an offer on a website and booked for my husbands birthday. Great location, lovely staff, fantastic room, we had the study on the fourth floor. Checked in, asked if needed help with luggage, complimentary newspaper offered. Room was beautiful very well laid out. Staff prepared room for the night whilst we were out. Cake and card left for my husband, chocolates left on the pillow, curtains closed and sheets turned down on bed. Well thought out room, nice toiletries and tea and coffee making facilities, robes and slippers if needed, good towels.",5,2016,11,06
105,Oasis in the heart of the capital,"A superb hotel, the best service I've experienced anywhere. The staff are so welcoming and friendly. Everyone of them seems genuinely caring and interested in your day.
The bar is outstanding. Comfy and relaxing with a pianist tinkling the ivories, it truly is an oasis in the middle of the storm that is London.

105,Afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea with my daughter as a treat absolutely loved it. The staff, food and willy wonka were lovely! Would definitely recommend this afternoon tea experience. My daughter was amazed by it all also. ",5,2016,11,05
105,Simply The Best,"We had the privilege of staying for one night in a wonderful suite and had the further privilege of being upgraded to a suite, The Duchess Suite which was beyond luxurious from the coffee machine, wonderful bed with the most luxurious bedding, luxury toiletries and robes and towels and complimentary brandy and water.  The living area and the bedroom as well as the bath and shower room were huge, luxurious, characterful and something we have never experienced before.  However, we will definitely be back!

The thing which really makes the Red Carnation Collection so different from the rest is Beau Tolman's focus upon quality of customer service.  There is no falseness and every customer is truly valued and made to feel special from the moment they arrive until the moment they leave.  Staff are truly wonderful and are clearly well trained and enjoy their job.  We will not only stay at Red Carnation Collection again but will be using the restaurant for both an evening meal and breakfast and will be treating family members to afternoon tea.  

Don't just read this review ... try it for yourself!",5,2016,11,04
105,Amazing Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea,"Fantastic afternoon tea. 

The only downside was despite booking we were left waiting a little at the start to be seated. 

It was a very quiet mid week and therefore the service was excellent and we were never rushed. 

We were offered more of everything and constantly had our tea topped up. We were also asked if we would like to try any other teas. 

Our waitress was an absolute star and a credit to you. 

We had finished all of our pastries and because of this we were offered additional to take away with us. Which we gratefully accepted. 

At the end you were also invited to fill your pockets/paperbag with lots of free sweets. 

Lovely food and your staff were amazing.",5,2016,11,02
105,Charlie and the Chesterfield Afternoon Tea - Fabulous!,"I booked the Charlie and the Chesterfield afternoon tea for my Mother in Law’s 50th birthday. We visited on Monday 31st October. The hotel is short walk from Green Park tube station. We were directed to the Butlers Restaurant where the afternoon tea was being served and was shown straight to our table. The room was very grand with beautiful gold decoration. We were greeted by our server and the fizz popping drink which contains popping candy! We chose our tea and this was poured for us into bone china cups. Our sandwiches and cakes arrived on a beautiful 3 tier stand and included; cucumber and cream cheese, cheese and ham, salmon and chicken sandwiches along with scones and a variety of Willy Wonka inspired cakes. My favourite was the Wonka bar! We asked for a top up of tea to wash down those lovely desserts. You wouldn’t think it but it really filled us up – you can ask for more if you like but we didn’t need to. The staff very kindly presented my Mother in Law with a cupcake and candle and sang happy birthday which she was not expecting so thank you very much – it made her day! At the end of the afternoon tea we were given an everlasting gobstopper and asked to select a golden envelope from Willy Wonka’s hat! The staff were very accommodating and professional and we had a fabulous time. Don’t let the price put you off as it is worth every penny! I will recommend to all my friends and may even return with my unopened golden envelope ;)",5,2016,11,02
105,Old England,"Overall, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a fabulous hotel.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Although, if I'm traveling with my 14 year old daughter, perhaps not (she might find it a bit stodgy!)  Here's a brief overview:

Good:
- strong wi-fi signal through out
- rooms are very quiet
- delicious breakfast buffet (altho they could alter the contents daily)
- beds comfortable 
- great water pressure for an older building
- attentive staff
- close to Shepards Market for eclectic dining choices.

Bad:
- room size is on the small size (to be expected).  We had booked a superior twin beds room.  Alas, while there were 2 beds, they were pushed together as if one.  So while we had separating bedding, were right next to one another as if in the same bed.  Not a problem for us since I was with my mother, but if you were traveling with just a friend, this might be awkward.
- while the location itself is not bad (actually Mayfair is very nice!), the walk to the Tube was longer than I would've liked, especially after a long day of touring.",5,2016,10,31
105,A gem of a hotel in London,"What is great about this hotel?  Its location, its staff, the gin tasting menu in the bar, the lovely conservatory room for tea, the comfortable rooms and the fine bathroom amenities.  The staff had great recommendations for dinner.  The location provided easy walking through a lovely part of London and a nice walk to Buckingham Palace.",5,2016,10,31
105,Simply the Best.,"Hasn't changed in twenty years other than to say it just gets better. Everything about The Chesterfield is quality in a central location and is what visiting London is all about.

Staff are always charming, practical andmost helpful should you need suggestion of the moment. it was explained that the only reason the hotel wasn't five star was simply the lack of a gym.

Breakfasts are a winner, that said, have chosen the kedgeree twice and not the best ever!",5,2016,10,31
105,Boutique charmer!,"Lovely boutique hotel on a quiet street in Mayfair. Short walk to tube and a charming staff to point you in the right direction. Have stayed here three times over the last 10 years and the quality has never wavered. Tea is marvelous. Rooms are small by US standards, but sumptuous and well appointed.",4,2016,10,29
105,A gem in Mayfair,Outstanding from check-in to daily service and upgraded to a marvelous junior suite. The various concierges were highly informative. The breakfast buffet was beautifully presented and the eggs to order were perfect. Excellent location!,5,2016,10,28
105,Love this hotel,"Great location near green park tube station. Lovely rooms and baths and exceptional service. Great breakfasts both continental and eggs etc to order.  Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Oxford street and surrounding shopping areas.  Concierge service is excellent. Second stay here love this hotel. ",5,2016,10,27
105,A wonderful hotel!!!,"Spent 5 delightful days in London, made better by a stay at the Chesterfield.  The hotel drips with character.  The rooms are small but very well appointed.  The bar is absolutely great and the restaurant has a delicious breakfast.  We didn't sample dinner because the staff kept pointing us to great restaurants in the area!  Speaking of the staff, they are all very attentive, caring and attuned to guests needs.  This hotel can't be beat!",5,2016,10,26
105,Anniversary stay - superb ,"Simply superb is how I would sum our stay up. First of all we were upgraded to a suite, the room of which was incredible. Sublimely comfortable bed, beautiful bathroom offering a jet bath, and a room I wished we could have stayed in for much longer. The food from the room service was quick and delicious and washed down with champagne. We were then delivered complementary gifts, although we went out for dinner we came back to a card signed by all the front of house staff as well as a note to say that we had missed some more canapés!! A very personal touch and very much appreciated. The hotel is beautiful, however what really made the stay was the staff; attentive, courteous, friendly and professional. If you are staying in London then stay here, you will not be disappointed. ",5,2016,10,26
105,Coziest Hotel ever,"I simply love the Chesterfield. It has an amazing athmosphere, and coziness that no other hotel can provide. It's nicely furbished, the service is excellent, the bar with piano music in the evenings is very pleasent, the breakfast room is beautiful and the food is delicious and high quality. The location is also excellent, and the staff is always very helpful and supportive",5,2016,10,25
105,Great Hotel - Great Service,"First, I will list the only negative that we had: We had requested a room with a view and unfortunately, had a room overlooking some construction on the rooftops. We had no issues on the weekend but then on Monday, the noise from the rooftops woke us at 7:00 am.  Hopefully, when the construction is done, this will be resolved.  

Now, for the positives of which there were many!

No. 1:  The service.  We had 2 rooms; my husband i& I n one room and my sister in another.  All 3 of us experienced immediate response to every request - from extra towels, assistance with thermostat, room service, cream for my sister's coffee, (which they kept refrigerated and delivered every morning - WOW) plus many more. One rainy evening we were on our way to a dinner reservation and out dashed the doorman, in search of a cab.  He returned to tell us that there was a demonstration of some sort downtown and drivers were not going there.  We were getting ready to get to the tube (my sister and I in our heels and dresses ) but out dashed the doorman one more time to ask another driver.  Sure enough, he returned to tell us that he had found a driver that would take us (driver got us there in time).  Desk staff was always so pleasant and willing to help us with directions and tips for seeing London.
#2: Bartenders at the Terrace Bar were so great; brought us dessert from the restaurant next door along with tasty drinks.  Bar had a great ambiance; we ended our evenings there almost every night. 
#3: We loved that we could go from our rooms in the elevator, quickly & smoothly. No waiting which is the advantage of staying in a small boutique hotel.
#4 Rooms were lovely if a bit small.  Bathrooms were nice as well. Beds were soooooo comfy, including pillows (which my sister kidded she was going to stuff in her suitcase). 
#5: We slept solidly during the weekend (except for the Mon/Tues which unfortunately woke us up with noise from construction).
#6: We did have a chance to dine in at the hotel restaurant as we got in quite late and were too tired to go out. We would rate the dinner entrees slightly above average but with exceptional desserts. 
#7: Location was great - just a few blocks from the tube and walking distance from Hyde Park and other places to see. 

We were in the UK for 10 nights and the Chesterfield Mayfair was our favorite stay by far.  We LOVED our 4 days/nights there.  Hopefully, we will return!!!",5,2016,10,24
105,Afternoon tea at butlers - chesterfield hotel,"Visited here Saturday for afternoon tea, such an amazing hotel very beautiful and the staff were so attentive and friendly. The tea was amazing , the food was delicious and you can eat as much as you would like! In addition , if there's anything you don't like the kitchen staff were so happy to accommodate to your needs and tailor make sandwiches for you etc. Such an enjoyable afternoon , and the service here tops the whole experience off the staff definitely go above and beyond. I would also like to give a big thank you Marius the restaurant supervisor , whose service was impeccable and made our day really special; when I mentioned it was my sisters birthday he came out with a cake with a candle singing happy birthday as well  as a mini teddy and a rose ,such a lovely gesture and little extra. Thanks for being so wonderful will definitely be back x ",5,2016,10,23
105,Nothing special ,"We spent 3 nights in the Jungle Suite and it was fine but nothing special. They did bring in a rollaway bed for our teen which had the thinnest mattress we have ever seen in a hotel. The shower was clogged up and did not drain (this was fixed when we brought it to their attention), turn down service was nice on two of the nights (nothing on the middle night), we asked for only still water (no sparkling) - this request did not reach housekeeping.  Tea tray was not refreshed one of the days. In a hotel like this, the service has to shine. It was nothing special here.  No response was received from management to detailed feedback on form supplied.  We find it sad when management only responds on social media. 

Also note that many reviews here on TA are for the tea (which people seem to like - we did not go to this). But the high TA ranking of this hotel is because of those tea reviews.",3,2016,10,23
105,Heaven in London,"It all starts with the door man in top hat....This is the ultimate in TRUE british elegance and tradition, This hotel is fantastic. From Marble bathrooms to a traditional british library with leather bound chairs....To formal tea's and great bar area. The rooms are beautifully decorated and spotless... This is the ultimate.
I booked a cruise out of South Hampton to visit the Norwegian Fjords instead of Amsterdam to cruise the Baltics, Just so I can stay at this hotel prior to the cruise.
This hotel is in Mayfair which is a very expensive London location. 
I can't wait to return....",5,2016,10,22
105,Wonka tea was splendid ,"We had an afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair and it was delightful! The waitstaff, particularly Marius and Lorenzo, were extremely friendly and accommodating. The tea was rally good. I especially enjoyed the Wonka tea with chocolate. They really cater to children, with the service and treats. Our family had a great time. ",5,2016,10,22
105,5 Star experience,"Definitely a 5 star hotel.  Absolutely no complaints.  The staff is top-notch, accommodations are lovely, well-kept.

Food was perfectly prepared.  Highly recommend.",5,2016,10,22

105,Wonderful Anniversary Stay,"We stayed here in early June and had a luxurious junior suite, the Berkley Suite. While I have stayed here two previous times with my daughter, this was my husband's first trip to England.   It was a fabulous stay, as good as I remembered and then some. The concierge, Chris was very helpful and recommended an Italian restaurant close by,Da Corradi, a family restaurant, and the food was wonderful. I can't say enough about the Maitre'd, Loris, he was friendly and charming, and made us feel very welcome and special, as was all of the food we had there in Butlers restaurant . The bar staff, James, Jade and Selmon, we're all excellent and my husband loved spending time at the bar with them every night! If it is possible to come back to England, we will definitely stay here.   I am sorry to be so late in writing a review, but I honestly thought I had done it already.",5,2016,10,21
105,Absolutely outstanding!,"My friend and I visited The Chesterfield as a special treat for her birthday. I treated us both to the champagne afternoon tea and I couldn't fault it one little bit. 
The service we received and the quality of the food was incredible! 
The food came out so well presented and tasted as good as it looked! The fact we could have as much as we wanted again and again was amazing. 
I completely forgot that I'd mentioned it was my friends birthday however soon remembered when all the butlers came out singing happy birthday with a cake - this made the day extra special! 
The guy that served us, Marius, was the nicest, friendliest man and nothing was too much trouble for him at all! 
We had such an amazing experience and the golden ticket at the end topped it off. 
We will both, 100%, be back!! Thankyou!",5,2016,10,20
105,The Chesterfield Hotel...still our first choice in London!,"My wife and I made our 8th visit to The Chesterfield too weeks ago for a fun long weekend in London.  And, I am happy to report the Hotel is better than ever.  The choice of rooms is broad and large enough to unpack and hang things.  The service is superb and the bar and restaurant are wonderful...quaint and cozy!  If you choose to eat out, the restaurant selection within easy walking distance is unbelievable.  Try it, you'll love it!",5,2016,10,19
105,Great place to stay in Mayfair!,"This is my go-to hotel in Mayfair. Service is fantastic! I also was very pleasantly surprised by the food available from room service.

Highly recommend the Chesterfield.",4,2016,10,19
105,Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea was amazing and the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.
We booked the library room as part of a corporate event.The room was very nice and nicely set-up for our event.
There was a great choice of tea and also halal, gluten free and vegetarian sandwiches.",5,2016,10,19
105,Afternoon tea,"I went with my friend and our children for the Willy Wonka themed afternoon tea. The food was amazing (and unlimited!) but even more than that was the service, which was truly impeccable. The restaurant manager Marcus was brilliant with us, refilling our plates and tea cups throughout the afternoon and providing excellent service in general. The kids had a great time eating the  Oompa Loompa afternoon tea (with milkshakes and hot chocolate)! I would highly recommend the experience. Having been there twice before without children and enjoying the Gin experience the Chesterfield offers, I'd recommend that too. Finally, it is actually excellent value for money, which is rarely expected of Mayfair. ",5,2016,10,17
105,Afternoon Tea Party,"Went to The Chesterfield for afternoon tea with 4 adults and a 4 year old and 1 year old ( for her birthday). Staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. Really friendly, attentive and helped us celebrate the day. Food and tea were brilliant and if you wanted more all you had to do was ask. The food was brilliant and the kids loved it too with the four year old having the children's version. His milkshake was lovely. When the staff came with a birthday cake and sang to my daughter was brill. A take home box of any thing we wanted to take was appreciated. Would recommend to everyone. Welcoming to all and feeling really special. Thank you. ",5,2016,10,16
105,Afternoon Tea,"I visited Butlers Restaurant  for afternoon tea for a friends 30th birthday and it was absolutely fantastic. The food, service, and attention to detail was outstanding. We had an excellent afternoon and I would certainly recommend this to others.",5,2016,10,16
105,Superior service!,"My wife and I have stayed at a few Red Carnation Hotels and the service here was no exception. It was our 1st Wedding Anniversary and when we got back to our room on our full day, they had left us two cupcakes on a plate sign written in chocolate 'HAPPY ANNIVERSARY' and a card signed by the manager and half the staff! Such a thoughtful little present and acknowledgement. This was as well as a handwritten note from the manager on our arrival day welcoming us and hoping that we'd enjoy our anniversary. 

Breakfast was lovely too, friendly service and the location is great for exploring central London. ",5,2016,10,16
105,Wonderful Hotel!!,"We had a delightful stay at this beautiful, elegant hotel.  The location was great.  Our accommodations were lovely and the service was exceptional.  Everyone we came in contact with was extremely helpful, personable and always very pleasant.  The breakfast, which was included in our booking, was delicious, offering several selections and the venue was lovely.  All in all we were very happy to have had the opportunity to stay there and wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair to anyone planning a trip to London in the near future.",5,2016,10,15
105,A week in London,"We spent a very pleasant week at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel is very well located for restaurants, sight seeing, the underground, and walking around. The rooms are small but very comfortable and nicely decorated. The staff are welcoming and helpful. The housekeeping staff does a wonderful job and keeps the rooms spotless with a lovely turndown service. It was very well priced and we look forward to returning.",4,2016,10,14
105,Beautiful,"I booked an afternoon tea for my birthday and could not have been happier. The staff were very helpful and friendly, they even accommodated a friend, who has allergies, with a different meal option. 
The tea provided was unlimited refills on food which was incredible. The selection of cakes and sandwiches were lovely, and the Willy Wonka theme was spot on without feeling tacky. I could barely finish my pot of 'dragon' green tea before it was topped up!
The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, we had a grand piano with a pianist playing for most of our time there, I could have stayed all day.
The building itself is very beautiful inside and out and would be a great place for special occasions, either for dinner, afternoon tea or to stay in. (I would quite like to stay there one day!) 
I did have a peek at the bar as we arrived early - another little detail, it was atmospheric and kept in the same historic feel as the hotel itself. All of which I might add is tasteful, you don't feel like it's dated even though it's old.
I would recommend a visit here.",5,2016,10,12
105,Cozy ,"Great ambiance. Wonderful afternoon tea. Very friendly staff.

We had the traditional afternoon tea with a twist. Very nice fizzy ""Wonka"" welcome drink. Nice sandwiches, good tea selections. And we went home with a Wonka chocolate 🍫 bar. 

Had a good time. Will visit again.",5,2016,10,10
105,Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea experience,"Absolutely lovely experience here , the staff were amazingly friendly ,, attentive and professional. We came here for my daughters 9th birthday and she was absolutely delighted and was made to feel very special by both the staff and the man playing Willy Wonka, As for the food well it was sumptious the cakes were amazing and if you wanted more you could ask but quite frankly we were stuffed , they also gave us presents for the kids and fantastic champagne we would definitely return.",5,2016,10,10
105,WONDERFUL hotel!,"Chose to stay here as we had frequented the Chesterfield Palm Beach several times before and enjoyed it. The location is wonderful, is a less crowded and touristy area of Mayfair. The staff really make the place special, they granted each request with enthusiasm and everyone went above and beyond their call of duty to make us feel welcome. The rooms and beds are very comfortable, though if you need more space opt for the suites. The afternoon teas and bar are spectacular. I would like to commend the management and team for their commitment to outstanding service, our holiday was made so much more enjoyable by our decision to stay here.

Tip: Trekking to and from the Green Park metro station with luggage can be a  headache. Opt for a taxi instead. A bit more expensive, but definitely worth it. The hotel will make arrangements for you.",5,2016,10,10
105,"Great Location, Service and Decor","A very central location, just a block away from Berkeley Square and the Mayfair attractions, and a short walk from the Green Park Underground Station. The shopping of Oxford Street is also readily accessible. 

The hotel itself is charming and very nicely decorated, very much in keeping with the area. I had a cozy double (by American standards) with a marble bathroom, with every amenity.

The staff were very helpful and responsive. I tried the restaurant for only one breakfast, but it was a good one.",5,2016,10,09
105,"Excellent location, attentive staff unusal layout.","It is functional, clean and comfortable. A 4-stars rating.  I will go back when they have special deals.  Free wifi, good breakfast selection and convenient for travel and exploration of central London.",4,2016,10,09
105,Lovely Service and Amazing Night's Sleep,"I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Red Carnation Hotels. I love the service, the quality of the rooms, the amenities and warm feeling of staying there. The Chesterfield didn't disappoint us on our stay. We visited for one night in August with our 4 year old son and had a lovely night. We had room service upon arrival for lunch and then relaxed in our lovely jr suite before heading out. Once we returned to the hotel later after dinner we had a couple of beautifully crafted cocktails in the lounge while our son had a gorgeous hot chocolate that he rated as the best ever. We then retired to our bedroom and had a glorious night's sleep. Our room had everything you would need in the way of amenities and if something was missing the staff were more than happy to accommodate. I honestly couldn't fault the hotel and the service and will definitely be heading back.",5,2016,10,07
105,A hidden gem in Mayfair.,"We spent four days/three nights at this small, upscale boutique hotel.  After working through a room ""snafu"" upon our arrival, we situated ourselves in a beautifully decorated and quite roomy accommodation.  The rooms were extremely nice, the service quite response and the doorman as attentive as personal butlers.  The only downside of our experience was the broken lift/elevator and overpriced restaurant (with rude service).  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again...",4,2016,10,02
105,Such a friendly staff!,Such a comfortable room; and a beautiful lobby! The bar at cocktail time was very inviting; with a wonderful pianist. The staff was very accommodating with every request. Wholeheartedly recommended!!!,5,2016,10,02
105,Great boutique hotel for christmas,"We stayed with our dog and parents for Christmas.  They go the extra mile with the dog and of course us humans. Family friendly professional service.  Great food, breakfast was fab. Bar is lovely and try the gin and tonics. Perfect location for dog walking, and mooching. Lovely pub over the road too as an alternative.

Rooms a bit small unless you book deluxe which are well worth it. Try the music room suite. 

All of the staff are friendly are d really helpful. Lots of regular returners and this helps a great hotel atmosphere.",5,2016,10,01
105,wonderful stay,"I have nothing but all praise with my recent stay in this hotel. Good location, very close to the tube and to most of the tourist attractions as well as plenty of restaurants nearby. The room is tidy , quiet  and has a comfortable bed.  I had a good quality sleep and felt well rested. I would highly recommend this hotel!!!",4,2016,09,30
105,Lovely hotel,"I enjoyed my stay, the hotel is beautiful and the staff are all very friendly. The room and bathroom were both clean and neat. The doorman will help you with right about anything (directions, storage...no problem). I recommend the buttermilk pancakes for breakfast 😃
",5,2016,09,30
105,A great English experience!,"We were looking for a hotel with an English/British feel and booked this one to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
We loved the hotel, the friendly staff/doormen, the English breakfast, the afternoon tea with Mr. Willie Wonka, and a dinner there.
The room was a bit on the small side, but we weren't there much; it did provide you with bottled water every night and a treat on the pillow (a cookie, bath salt, or face mist, which was a lovely surprise).
When we checked in, we got a fruit plate as a welcome in our room along with a handwritten note from the hotel manager (Mr. Adam Lake, we think) and 2 days later, we got 2 cupcakes with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate on the plate!  
It certainly made us feel special and welcome!
This hotel is centrally located in Mayfair; a 5-8min walk to the train (Tube) station. Taxis tend to be expensive as it takes a while to go anywhere with  the heavy traffic.
We were glad to get this package from Costco travel and it was a worthwhile experience in this hotel!",5,2016,09,30
105,Afternoon tea ,"The hotel itself was really easy to find and only a 5 minute walk from green park station. Green park has lifts if wheelchair or buggy access needed. A very pleasant welcome from the door men. Lovely decor and big once inside. Shown to the afternoon tea lounge with glass roof and again pleasant decor. we had the wonka afternoon tea so were served with a fizzy lifting drink which was really yummy. Then we were served sandwiches scones and cakes on a tier. The sandwiches were nice and you could order as many as you liked. As with the cakes and scones. The tea was kept flowing which is nice as no waiting and dying of thirst in between bites. The waiters were very attentive always asking would you like more. Definitely worth the money as we also had a 25%discount. The kids plate was very good and as much milkshake or tea as they want. Really can't fault this afternoon tea apart from maybe the bread could have been a little fresher. 
The cakes were really pretty too. ",5,2016,09,28
105,Fabulous service ,"Had the Willy Wonka afternoon tea, as a treat for my 10 yr old daughter. We arrived over an hour early expecting to have to wait - however the staff were happy to bring our booking forward. From the initial greeting and seating at a lovely round table, to leaving a few hours later the staff were excellent. 
Food was great with the added Wonka Bar. Selection of tea is extensive and fantastic. The kids loved meeting Mr Wonka !
Youngest daughter is coeliac and they have gone to the trouble of including a menu dedicated  to Coeliacs. 
All in all a fantastic experience that I really can't recommend enough. 

",5,2016,09,28
105," 1 night stay for Golden Wedding","Our son booked The Chesterfield Hotel, for us and our friends, where we were to meet up to celebrate our Golden Wedding together.  The Hotel is well situated, just a short walk to the main shops in Oxford Street and Mayfair. 
When we booked in the reception staff were friendly and professional. They had given us all an upgrade to a suite. Each one was very different and traditionally decorated, they were all spotlessly clean and comfortable with lots of room. It contained everything that you could possibly need for your stay.
The bed was really comfortable and the room was quiet allowing for a good night sleep.
We celebrated in the bar that evening. The staff were attentive and friendly they presented us with chocolate cup cakes, macaroons and home made chocolates on a plate decorated with Happy Anniversary. How thoughtful and kind.
Breakfast the next morning was excellent again the staff were friendly and attentive. We were also given the best table in the restaurant.
We returned for afternoon tea and we were given the same table again which was great. We did not realise that it was Willy Wonker themed, he was also in attendance. Our son apologised as it was not what he expected for our Golden Wedding. But we did not mind a bit as it made the day fun and memorable.
The sandwiches very fresh, ask for extra chicken ones they were amazingly different, the scones light and the themed cakes delicious as were the chocolate Wonka bars. Again the staff were great and nothing was to much trouble for them.
Our stay was truly relaxing the hotel had a homely comfortable atmosphere and the staff were magnificent. The Chesterfield have some of the best staff in the hotel business.
We will return again to this lovely hotel.",5,2016,09,26
105,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea,"We went for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea. I was there with my two kids and we had a great time. The restaurant manager Marius explained everything very well. We could order as many as we wanted. After an hour the kids were full and then Marius gave the kids a bag full of colour books so they could play and I could still enjoy the treats. When we left we received a golden ticket and I could even bring home the ""left overs"" and Marius told the kids that they even were allowed to fill their pockets with candy ;).",5,2016,09,26
105,Wow!!,"Went here for afternoon tea on Friday and was blown away

From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable 

Our waiter was Ian who had a trainee badge on. He was FANTASTIC!!! The training is obviously top notch as he was flawless! Explained the concept perfectly and explained all the different teas. Gave all his recommendations and asked us if we had any dietary requirements. I told him I don't eat nuts and they already knew my friend was vegetarian and they completely tailored the tea to our requirements 

The decor was beautiful and a real pleasure to be in. 

The concept was brilliant! We had the willy wonka inspired tea and it was so cute! Wonka bars, chocolate tea, golden eggs and amazing cupcakes. 

Really cannot recommend this place highly enough nor can I say how great Ian our waiter was. Really made sure our afternoon was one to remember ",5,2016,09,25
105,Delights of Pure Imagination!,"I booked the Charlie and the Chocolate Afternoon Tea for myself, my son and a friend as a special treat.  I didn't know what to expect, but the reviews and the website showed what looked to be a lovely afternoon tea. We were not disappointed!  The staff were extremely attentive, there was more than enough food, the teas were fragrant and it was the little touches such as Willy Wonka himself making an appearance, bringing round 'everlasting gobstoppers' for everyone, the Wonka bar and beautifully served and fresh sandwiches, cakes and scones. We weren't rushed, had copious amounts of tea and the staff really did go out of their way to make you feel special, even if you didn't have a special occasion to celebrate. It was probably the last time I was going to see my friend before she leaves to go to the U.S and when we told the staff this, they bought out a cake on a plate with 'good luck' written on it for her.  So unexpected, but so wonderful.  The piano player was also amazing and we enjoyed listening to his playing as we ate our tea.  On departure, we were told we could help ourselves to the sweets in the entrance to the restaurant and were each given a golden ticket.  Great marketing ploy - as you aren't allowed to open it until your next visit...but we will certainly be back and with every ticket a winner, even a glass of champagne on the next visit would be lovely!",5,2016,09,25
105,Three nights in a wonderful suit,Great place to stay as a single woman. Loved the rooms and the location is perfect. Heart of Mayfair and walking distance to everything. Well worth a little extra to stay so comfortable and safe. Lovely staff and extremely helpful. Felt like home away from home. ,5,2016,09,22
105,A very nice English hotel,"A very nice English hotel with good atmosphere, good location, quiet , good breakfast and nice rooms. The hotel got a cosy bar, which is a nice meetingplace. I will come back on my next stay in London.",5,2016,09,21
105,excellent location,"this hotel is in an excellent location for all the good restaurants in mayfair and also near the underground.
the staff are very helpful and friendly this was demonstrated to us by one member of staff who on meeting us one night by the lift, asked us were we were going we told him we were going to Le Gavroche has part of my mothers 80 birthday present on arriving back at the hotel she found a cake and card from all the staff in the room.
this was a really nice thought and I would like to thank the staff for making it extra special.
we have stayed here on numerous occasions and it never disappoints.",5,2016,09,20
105,"GREAT LOCATION, OVERPRICED HOTEL","This is a lovely older hotel with a great location. Conveniently located near the Green Park tube station. However, do not follow the directions on the hotels website. The hotel has tried to make their directions more straight forward, however, it take longer than it needs to be. Take a look at a map and plan your route to the hotel, it will be more direct. But I digress. This is a lovely hotel with a wonderful lounge offering a menu of gin and tonics.",4,2016,09,19
105,Lovely Afternoon tea experience ,"Had afternoon tea at the Chesterfield to celebrate my birthday & it was fabulous!! We were lucky enough to experience the Charlie & the chocolate factory inspired version and even treated ourselves to a lovely glass of champagne. 

Not only was the food amazing, especially the chocolate chip scones and fizzing lifting drink, but the service was brilliant. Our waiter Marius was great, as were all the other peoples who served us. 

We were told from the off that we cold have as many refills of sandwiches, scones and cakes that we wanted which was just fantastic. They even presented me with a cupcake with a candle and sang happy birthday to me (as they did for everyone experiencing a birthday), which was a really nice touch. 

The Willy Wonka tea was so tasty!!! Never had chocolate tea before, but loved it!! 

Cleverly they presented us both with a 'golden' envelope which has a promised prize in it, but you're not allowed to open until you next have an afternoon tea with them - great little incentive to go back (although you don't need one as it's so good, you'll want to go back anyway). 

We've experienced quite a few afternoon teas and have to say this one was up there with the best!! A great treat even if it's not a special occasion.",5,2016,09,18
105,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,This place is fab - amazing service and made a birthday celebration very special - could not fault - if you like afternoon tea you have to come here - I have been to many dissapointing afternoon teas but this has been one of the best so far ! ,5,2016,09,18
105,September 2016 - The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel,"The area of the hotel is just picture perfect. Being from Los Angeles, we don't see streets like Mayfair. The hotel was near many little eating areas' and that was perfect. The street sounds were low, which is what I was looking for. Of course there was construction on some of the buildings, but compared to the traffic this was great. The hotel from the outside is just like being in a movie walking into a royal hotel style. Inside was a mixture of what London Royal countryside would be with a classic look. The rooms are victorian style, with cloth walls and moldings. The closet space and drawers are plenty. The windows open, so when you want some outdoor fresh air you can get it. The best part of the room was the marble floor. It had heaters. Now that was something we enjoyed in the mornings and after a bath/shower. The sink was higher, which was so nice. I loved having a higher sink. The shower/tub was a good size, but I don't understand why the shower had one side door. So it was half a glass door. Maybe things are different in London. Let's go to the dinning, which I have to say the breakfast is excellent. There is also a bar, which you must go to at nights. There is a piano player, and he truly is a lovely person who happens to have talent. One night I wanted ice-cream, and they served it for me. It's great how they try so hard to please their guests. The workers are great, talk to them and get to know them. Some of them come from Italy, Spain, Bulgaria. They have umbrellas for when it rains, they get a taxi for you when you need it, they provide directions and explain how their subways work, and they tell you all the things that you can do while visiting. If you need a computer or to conduct business or get married, they provide all your needs. For business, for pleasure, for family, for friends; The Chesterfield Mayfair is for all. I have to say, I didn't see any children at the hotel. I was there for 8 days and not one child. O, they are also echo friendly and they do their best for our green earth.",4,2016,09,16
105,Great location!,"My aunt and i visited London for three days and stayed at the Chesterfield. The staff is wonderful and the dining room was so great we had two of our three dinners there. The afternoon tea was fabulous and the breakfast is a must! 

Our room had no view, but was a beautiful English decor and gave you a great feel of London/England/UK... VERY accommodating and helpful staff. They really go out of the way to make a stay special.

We took two private all day tours with pick up from the hotel, so i can't speak of walking distance for the surrounding, but less than 5 pounds will get you to the shopping district in a black cab.",5,2016,09,15
105,A calm oasis in Mayfair,"We have stayed in this hotel a number of times. The location near to the Royal Parks' Piccadilly and the restaurants of Shepherds Market makes it very convenient.
The breakfast is very good with and excellent continental buffet and good choice of hot dishes.
The rooms are small but adequate and comfortable. The fabric may be getting on as the lifts did not work for a few days although an upgrade offer was given to compensate.",4,2016,09,13
105,British warmth,"The service at this hotel was as good as it gets.  It was always pleasant to enter the place amid the smiles and courtesies of the staff.  The bar is warm and friendly.  The room is beautifully furnished, but it is quite small.  The bathroom facilities are excellent, and the cleaning service very good.  All in all, this is an excellent hotel in a wonderful location near the West End but away from the crowded thoroughfares.  It is expensive, but its value of memory is worth it.",5,2016,09,13
105,Does it meet top 15 rating ?,"Don't get me wrong, the hotel is good, the service is of a very high standard, food, bar, breakfast and other facilities in the hotel are also of a high standard, but
I'm not sure if it met my expectations from a top 15 London hotel, which is a huge accomplishment and for me an extremely tough title to earn.  

The hotel had a nice warmth, an old quaint English country touch, elegance and charm, personalised attention and good standards all along. The breakfast is a good combination of a buffet service and a hot menu made to order, though the menu needs major review as much of the information is lacking, which led to a major concern with the chef.  I will not go
into detail of that incident as the hotel management was most concerned and promised to deal with the matter appropriately.  

Room was small but adequate.  Minor repairs and renovation is needed in some areas, such as carpets, quality coffee machine in the room, bathtub (needs to be wider) and noise proofing in rooms (specially close to the lifts get a lot of noise from the housekeeping). 

Also needed is English fluency lessons for some of the bar and breakfast service. They are very warm and welcoming but need clarity on some menu items. 

The hotel needs to be freshened up a bit, mainly in the staircase area (guests had to use the stairs as the lift were under repairs but dealt with very well by the management), as well as, list and corridors. 

The aim for my review is to give my honest opinion to bring it to the level I would personally expect from a top 10 London hotel.  I was happy with my stay and will stay again. 

Library is fantastic and the doormen are some of the kindest and most helpful I have ever met. ",4,2016,09,13
105,Comfortable stay and friendly service,"I was staying in London for a wedding by myself so I booked a single room.  It was quite small but perfectly fine for my needs.  The bed was very comfortable, it had a/c, the plumbing was modern.  A nice added touch was a tea set up with cookies and all. Its a close walk from a lot of nice (and not too pricey) restaurants, about 8-10 minutes to the tube.  All the service was good- an especially nice touch was when I complained that I couldn't read the tube map, the man took the map to the printer and enlarged it for me.  So nice!  The gin drinks in the bar are also outstanding!

I shopped around and got a good price.",5,2016,09,12
105,1 night stay for 16th Birthday celebrations,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield. From arrival to leaving, the staff made us welcome and sought to provide whatever we needed. The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea was delicious and fun, and the service at the bar and at breakfast was first class. This is a warm, professional and courteous hotel. We will keep coming back for our family celebrations and good times, because we are treated so well and the welcome is warm.  Every member of staff is kind and concerned that you are OK. My 16 year old daughter received a small cake and card signed by many staff, as a surprise waiting in her room. She was overjoyed and will never forget this sweet gesture.",5,2016,09,12
105,Willy wonka afternoon tea,"We visited here on Saturday 10th September for afternoon tea for my mums 50th birthday and i really felt compelled to write a review. The whole experience from Start to finish was amazing. Mauris and Maihi (not sure if they are spelt correctly) waited on us and the service was just flawless. The food was beautiful. The unlimited refills were just what we needed due to missing breakfast, and was even offered food to take away if we desired which was a lovely touch. i would thoroughly recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair. Thank you once again",5,2016,09,12
105,Even better than expected,"Welcoming, bag assistance, overall helpfulness, breakfast choices and service-all amazing! Corridors were clean and room itself was beautiful with a nice size bathroom and chair. Perfect location by Green Park tube station, easy to walk to Buckingham palace or grab a quick tube ride to another area to then walk around. Would stay here again in a heart beat if I can afford it! (I got an awesome deal on their website 2 wks before my visit at about 1/3 of the usual room fee). I travel a lot and this is one of my top all time hotel experiences!",5,2016,09,11
105,Go for it,"Such an amazing adventure to be in this hotel, staff are wonderful, rooms are great. everything here is encouraging, i have been there last month and would love to come back again. Living in London is hard to me, but finding a nice place like this is encouraging ppl like me to over on each holiday i get.",4,2016,09,11
105,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea,"I loved the theme afternoon tea at the Chesterfield!

The tea is served at the hotel restaurant, which is very fancy with live piano music and beautiful chandeliers.

It is necessary to book a table before you go, but they didn't ask for credit card information for that.

We booked the last available hour, so the tea could be an early dinner. I recommend that you substitute a meal, because it is a lot of food!

The tea is a bit expensive, but I thought is is worth it! It's a memorable experience!

To start, you are greeted with a very cute welcome drink.

After, they bring a three story plate with sandwiches, scones, cakes and other sweets. The food is default, so at first you can't choose. Afterwards, you can repeat anything and for how many times you want. If there's leftovers, you can even as them to take home.

As for the tea, you can choose how many teas you want from an extended menu. I recommend the hot chocolate, for it is very thick and delicious!

In the end you even receive a golden ticket!
",5,2016,09,09
105,AMAZING customer service from Myriam Bousbia,"I was supposed to arrive on a specific date and had cancelled the booking because of date changes.  The person I spoke to was polite and cancelled my booking on my behalf.  The day after I was supposed to arrive, I received an email asking if my dates had changed and that I missed my cancellation window and would be charged one night.  I wrote to Myriam, the reservations leader and explained what happened.  Within a few hours she had rectified the situation and although I will did not stay at the hotel, I have been there many times when other colleagues had stayed there and the facilities are excellent, customer service superior and most of all, I appreciated the quick resolution to the situation.  I will absolutely book there again - they exceeded my expectations in resolving my issue.  Thank you Myriam Bousbia.",5,2016,09,08
105,Best wedding experience ever!!!,"After checking out various London locations my husband and I decided to go for this stunning place and we cannot thank the events management team and everybody at The Chesterfield enough! Our wedding day was perfection. The canapés during the champagne reception were delicious, original and presented elegantly at timed intervals, the bubbly kept flowing and no glass was ever empty thanks to the vigilant and smiling waiting staff. In the meantime, the kids had an excellent time at the Charlie and The Chesterfield afternoon tea. The maître d' was extremely efficient, friendly and no single detail escaped him. My mother's dog had a comfortable cushion in every room she set her paws in, perfectly sized chicken and duck bites during dinner; she even got her own doggy bag! So, if you are an animal lover and tired of the ways your furry friend gets treated in some establishments, The Chesterfield Mayfair is the place to go! The dinner in The Conservatory wowed everyone! The set up of the table was sumptuous to say the least and our guests were mesmerised by the beauty of the setting. The food was excellent - something that is not an easy achievement during weddings - we went for the Gold Menu and literally everybody praised the finesse of every course. The wine was outstanding, i.e. wine lovers can rest assured that the sommelier at The Chesterfield really is an expert. Prior to the wedding Samantha, the wedding events manager and her team, were helpful throughout, real fun to work with, and open to all our ideas. Sam also always made an effort to give us the most affordable deal, which always helps. For our wedding night, my husband and I were upgraded to a junior suite (because it happened to be available), which made our wedding even more memorable. The word which best defines The Chesterfield is ""elegance"": superb taste, kindness and warmth without snobbery. If on your special day you want to treat yourselves and your loved ones in style, then you should check this place. I can give you my word you won't regret it.",5,2016,09,08
105,Charming old world hotel,"Checked in for a week leisure holiday. Everything went smoothly from check in to check out. The staff were warm and friendly ,and we shared a few laughs. The room was comfortable,well appointed and a nice size for London. The location is excellent. Close to many attractions and Mayfair is a beautiful area. Yet the hotel is set on a smaller side street that is quiet and peaceful. Highly recommended. I would definitely return. Good value.",5,2016,09,07
105,"Excellent service & location, older hotel charm.","The Chesterfield Mayfair is an older hotel, with a lot of classic English charm and decor. The service is impeccable and the location is in a quiet area of Mayfair within walking distance of Hyde Park, Oxford Street and several tube stations and the charming Shepherd's Market! The staff is always friendly, worldly and engage guests in conversation. The food and drinks are excellent as well!  Overall, for a busy city like London this place is a peaceful retreat.",5,2016,09,07
105,Lovely staff lovely hotel.,"The hotel lovely,the staff lovely,

Lovely lovely staff!

But really need to sort out the little fury friends running around the Restrant.

Which in my judgement they will sort it out.

Had a wonderful stay bar staff great,
Concierge a great help room service great.  ",5,2016,09,04
105,Afternoon Tea ,"Today we visited this hotel for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea. 

A great experience with very attentive and friendly staff. Food was great and service exceptional. We will be returning in December for their Winter Wonderland afternoon tea experience. Thank u all. ",5,2016,09,04
105,The service from Marius was outstanding!,Myself and my sister brought our mum here as a surprise for her birthday and we are so amazed by the wonderful service. We have been to lots of places for afternoon tea including The Ritz and The Savoy but the service here was so much better. Especially by Marius who looked after us so well. He is a credit to the hotel! we will be back for the Winter Wonderland afternoon tea! ,5,2016,09,04
105,Nice attention to detail,"We have stayed at the chesterfield before, and again this time, our stay was excellent. The staff are friendly, efficient and helpful. The location is terrific. We very much enjoyed the breakfasts. We also enjoyed a nightcap at the bar, nice bar menu with interesting choices of drinks, and good piano music.",5,2016,09,02
105,Cozy hotel,Our six-persons family stayed for three nights in The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel. We really enjoyed it. Decor is old-stylish but need some renovation. Food is good in restaurant & room service is fast & good as well. Location also is very convenient to walk around the part of city centre. Personal is very helpful & friendly.,4,2016,09,01
105,Perfect Stay,Seamless service from start to finish. All the staff from check in to housekeeping to breakfast waiting staff were always attentive and available but never intrusive. Whole hotel has a lovely relaxed atmosphere - would thoroughly recommend and would definitely stay again! ,5,2016,09,01
105,Posh stay in Mayfair,"My husband and I stayed for 6 nights in July and really enjoyed it.  The decor is ritzy old London, which is appropriate for a former earl's residence.  The lobby is both cozy and impressive and the room was charming.  Bath was a mite small, but covered in marble.  Service throughout our stay was swift and friendly whether for breakfast, at the bar, or in the room.  Good pub up the street called The Footman. Check out Shepherd Market just behind the hotel for loads of intimate dining options.  We had previously stayed at another Red Carnation hotel, Montague on the Garden, which was also lovely.  Can't seem to go wrong with a Red Carnation property.  ",5,2016,08,30
105,Delightful hotel,We stayed here for 3 nights in August.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Green Park Tube stop.  The hotel stall cannot do enough for you during your stay.  The decorating needs a little bit of updating but very nice.  We had the superior room with a king bed which was nice.  A negative to our side of the building is the noise that come from an outdoor party space in the adjacent building which goes on to 11:30 pm. Mayfair is a perfectly situated neighborhood to many of the London sites along with being a very beautiful section.,4,2016,08,30
105,Great Hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights over the August bank holiday weekend on a ""Mayfair Weekend"" package which we thought was great value including an afternoon tea, bottle of champagne, late check out etc.   We've stayed at other ""grand"" London hotels such as The Langham, the Ritz which are twice or almost three times the price which is simply not worth it given the quality of the facilities, ambiance, staff and location of somewhere like the Chesterfield.   Excellent all round.   Even better than their flagship hotel Ashford Castle.",5,2016,08,29
105,Amazing afternoon tea,This is my favourite place to come for afternoon tea - if you want to spoil yourself come here. They cater for vegetarians and there are unlimited refills. Staff are incredibly friendly and you come away with a smile on your face and extremely full.,5,2016,08,28
105,How can this not already be a five star?,"Impeccable service. Attention to detail was immaculate. Everyone knew my name. Breakfast staff were a little tired however..especially the young man! The room service gentleman in particular was so kind and happy and chirpy and helpful. Breakfast was buffet for continental and then order for hot food. Would return 100% . Location also phenomenal, was so central that I was able to pop in at multiple times throughout the day without going out of my way - it's central to absolutely everything.
One main reason I chose this hotel was because it claimed to offer 'airport transportation' .. It doesn't. I was instructed to get a taxi and the Heathrow express which isn't a hassle at all but I thought maybe I would be expecting a complimentary shuttle or something..so don't say that you offer this! Especially for customers on a tight schedule business trip who may choose you due to this!",4,2016,08,26
105,Fine hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel in the heart of one of London's most popular and expensive locations.  Its close proximity to the many restaurants and tourist attractions of the area (literally seven minutes' walk from Green Park and Buckingham Palace) makes it an excellent place to stay for tourists like ourselves, and the staff are both highly competent and eager to please.  The bed was among the most comfortable I have experienced in a hotel, firm enough to sleep on the edge without danger yet soft enough to allow one to avoid undue back pain.  In my experience, few hotels manage this level of comfort.  The room, while not gigantic, was sufficiently roomy for our purposes, and all was kept pristinely clean and fresh by the diligent efforts of the room staff.  
        Like several other similar hotels in the area, the Chesterfield Mayfair occupies an old suite of townhouses from the mid-eighteenth century, and they have successfully managed to retain the charm and elegance of bygone days while maintaining up to date facilities.  We initially stayed for several days on the third floor, then returned after a week in Ireland and stayed on the seventh floor.  The only criticisms I have derive from this second experience.  There were some small problems getting sufficient water pressure for showers, toilet use and the like, and the shower, like many in various hotels we have occupied, was quite slippery and dangerous to enter and exit.  This last problem could be remedied quite easily by a better placement of the safety bar in the shower or perhaps by the addition of another which was closer to the entrance, and a plastic, non-slip bath mat should be automatically included in the room.  The plumbing difficulty is of course common in older buildings and less easy to fix, but at some point this may require attention.             
      The bathroom was otherwise lovely like the rest of the room, and to reiterate, the staff were wonderful and highly motivated.  While we would not always stay at a hotel like this because of the rather high price, we did find the Chesterfield Mayfair to be a first-rate place to stay, elegant without a trace of snobbery and perfectly located to suit our needs.  Cheers to Darren and Chris and the rest of the staff; you make the experience a fine one indeed.  Many thanks.",5,2016,08,26
105,Charlie and the Chesterfield Afternoon tea! ,"Fabulous little treat for adults and children. We booked as a pre Theatre treat for the kids. 

Milkshakes, gobstoppers, fizzing pop and endless cakes.. The kids were in heaven!

Willie Wonka presenting a golden ticket a lovely touch!

We will go back! ",5,2016,08,24

105,A real gem in the heart of Mayfair,This lovely hotel offers a peaceful ambiance in delightful surroundings with exceptionally helpful staff.   My room was lovely and quiet and everything had been thought of in the well equipped bathroom.  Food is excellent and the bar has a great atmosphere.,5,2016,08,23
105,Extraordinary - perfect,"Reserved a single room for solo weekend.  Expected small accommodations but had full size bed in nice sized room. The Best Linens - so comfortable. Same for the towels - plentiful and plush. If you are keen on bathtubs (I sure am)...this one was huge,  deep, fast-filling, great fixtures,  spotlessly clean, water quickly as hot as you like.  Overhead fixed shower plus handheld one too. I want the same one for home! All staff could not have been nicer, from the front door to the front desk to the waitstaff. Superb location in central Mayfair. Shepherds Market ethnic food area close by, great variety of affordable choixes, and upscale restaurants also close by the other direction. And Hyde Park just blocks away. Sooo homey cozy and comfortable.",5,2016,08,20
105,"Great, awesome. Nice place",We came just for  and everything was perfect. Staff was friendly but professional. Food was amazing!!! We had 3 courses and from the beginnig till the end we enjoyed everything. Staff who looked after us was great especially in restaurant . Have nice staff and friendly crew. They serving with all there hearts. Nice!!!!,5,2016,08,20
105,Love this place,I cannot give enough praise  to this magnificent hotel. We visit every year so that in itself sells it. The staff are second to none. The rooms are beautiful and the complementary Sherry is a must [just one glass ] . Afternoon tea and breakfast were delicious.It's so nice that the staff can recall who you are. Jade remembered us from previous visits and made a lovely fuss of us. .,5,2016,08,20
105,Staff alone are worth 5 stars.,"We have visited the hotel several times, and the standard has never varied. It is always first class , and one reason is the excellent staff.
From the time of arrival, the reception staff are most welcoming, and the concierges are experienced and most helpful.
The food is excellent with a really good choice at breakfast, again with great friendly service.
The rooms are clean and comfortable and housekeeping staff do a great job.",5,2016,08,19
105,Superb quality and service,"In the heart of Mayfair, the hotel is lovely and the staff are wonderful.  Fabulous full breakfast each day in the beautiful dining room.  The bar has an extensive gin cocktail menu not to be missed.  Expensive but worth every sip.  Ask for Jade - the friendliest bartender in London.  The staff are very accommodating.  The rooms are a bit small and take some maneuvering but are nicely appointed with little extras that make you feel welcomed.   I would definitely return!",5,2016,08,18
105,Absolute leading in the hotel industry,"I went over for one night, and i must say i am the type of person who's appreciating finer details and pragmatic people.

You feel very welcome during the reservation, a very friendly congierge putting me through. A nice reception staff who also gave me a hint to pay for (not their fault) absolutely ridicilous ""congestion charges"" for entering london with my rental car. Almost £ 30,00 for 2 days...  So be aware and look after this is you choose to rent a car.

The bar staff was friendly and Jade knows her Gin-Tonics! And therefore she earned bonuspoints in my prestige. Be aware, you just keep drinking them if she is making them ;-)

The room was lovely, a lot of details from fine art to a jogging map of central London to mineral water, a good TV, lovely cookies, nice fresh damask cotton sheets to the lovely shower. 

I slept very good and the room is very nice due climate control which i set at 20 degrees.
Bed was very good, pillows where quit thick, i prefer flatter once but that is an object of preference.

A very very good breakfast buffet with salmon, caviar, sweets, fresh toast, eggs and bacon and.... filtered juices!  Very good coffee and friendliest staff again.

The parking valet and concierges where very kind and helpfull!

Overall an very big 9+ for this super-hotel!",5,2016,08,18
105,Lovely staying in The Chesterfield,"We came just for two nights and everything was perfect. Room was in 2nd floor and for two people more than enough space. 
Staff was friendly but professional. 
Food was amazing!!! We had 3 courses and from the beginnig till the end we enjoyed everything. Staff who looked after us was great especially in restaurant Kamila, Valerij, Alexandra and Emma. All of them were smiling and made a good atmosphere.  
Reception was very helpful. Especially Gabriel who found answer on all of my questions.

In conclusion I definitely enjoyed staying in this hotel and I can fully recommend to stay in.",5,2016,08,16
105,Mayfair Hideaway,"We stayed here for 3 nights in August 2016. The hotel is nicely located on a relatively quiet street about 1 minutes walk from Berkeley Square and within 5-10 minutes walk of Green Park, Bond Street and Hyde Park Corner Tube stations. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk.

Check-in was smooth and efficient and we were soon in our room. The room was on the top (7th) floor and was towards the rear of the hotel. It was a reasonable size for weekenders like us and with plenty of storage space I'd imagine it wouldn't be too much hassle if you were travelling with suitcases. The bed was large and comfy and the large TV had a reasonable selection of channels including several Sky Sports channels. There was tea & coffee making facilities, a safe, a hairdryer and an iron & ironing board. The aircon worked fairly well.

The bathroom was compact but clean and the heated mirror is always a bonus.

On the niggly side, the room curtains seemed quite thick but didn't do a very good job of keeping the early morning light out. The TV would switch itself off randomly (which appeared to get fixed once we reported it to reception) but the worst thing was the shower in the bathroom. The shower head was fixed and was only suitable for people under about 5 feet 6 inches tall, otherwise you had to stoop to get under the shower and in a very compact space it often meant banging knees and/or elbows against the wall or shower screen. There was also a constant humming noise in the room even after we turned everything off. Maybe because we were on the top floor there were Aircon units on the roof that we could hear? I don't know, all I know is if you're a light sleeper you may want to pack the earplugs.

We drank in the bar one evening and had dinner in the restaurant another evening both of which were perfectly pleasant but the prices were high and there are plenty of better places to eat & drink in London for those prices.

Overall we had a very pleasant stay but if you like a nice shower and you're over 5 feet 6 inches tall and not a contortionist then be careful which room you choose.",4,2016,08,15
105,Not As We Remember,"Having stayed at the Chesterfield in the past,we were excited to be there again.  It was a Friday and Saturday night stay to celebrate my Birthday.  Our bags were taken as soon as we arrived and check in was efficient.  Our room was on the 5th floor and was disappointing.  Whilst clean, it was incredibly small.  The bed dominated the room and we kept bumping into each other. Two of us couldn't be in the bathroom at the same time, as there wasn't enough room.  We have stayed in much nicer rooms in the Hotel.  Customer Service fluctuated and wasn't consistent. We opted for the cooked Breakfast on the Saturday Morning, and were kept waiting for 10 minutes for a table.  No apology was given and our table lacked condiments and milk which we had to ask for.  The sausage was overcooked and bacon very salty, which I couldn't eat.  When we mentioned this, the young waitress couldn't understand what we meant, so we left it. On a positive note the service and food we received in the bar was exceptional.  The young lady and gentleman were very kind and courteous.  I had a coughing fit in the Bar and a glass of water was promptly bought over to me.  Thank you.  On a personal note, I received a Birthday Cake and Card,whilst a lovely gesture, it was delivered a day early.  How do you get that wrong?  The Chesterfield isn't a cheap Hotel to stay in, and having stayed there in the past we expected more.  This time we didn't leave with a ""spring in our step"" more of a ""stuttering gait"" .",3,2016,08,14
105,"Pleasant, but not perfect","Perhaps the rave reviews of this hotel raised our expectations too high, but we only found it to be a pleasant stay rather than amazing. The ambiance is quite nice and the staff competent. The location is central and easy to obtain transport (taxis) for those who aren't very agile and can't walk far. The rooms are modest in size, as expected in central London, but were clean and well maintained. The rooms have shower in bath (again an issue for mature aged with agility concerns) and good toiletries selection. The restaurant food was ok, but did not reflect the price paid and we would suggest eating elsewhere - there are some nice eateries around the corner. In the end, we simply didn't connect with this hotel, which is a shame, as we had been very much looking forward to our stay. We'd look elsewhere before returning.",3,2016,08,14
105,Exceeded expectations!,"I spent months researching hotels for a 10-night stay in London this past July.  I've used Trip Advisor in the past and have never been disappointed with my final decisions. Based on this site's reviews, I had high expectations for the Chesterfield Mayfair. Simply, these expectations were exceeded the moment I stepped into the lobby (after a very long flight). I could tell instantly that this was a special place.

Without being too long-winded, the entire experience was positive. The room was clean and quiet, everyone at the front desk (and the doormen) was helpful and friendly, breakfast and dinner were served professionally and efficiently and afternoon tea was a lot of fun. The bartender (James) made a great Old Fashioned and was knowledgeable regarding the different Scotches. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit London. It's in a great location (Mayfair is safe and close to everything) and the people make you feel at home. ",5,2016,08,13
105,Passing through London...,"I had an opportunity to stay in London recently and stayed at very nice place.  The Chesterfield Mayfair was perfect place to stay.  The location was convenient - a short walk to the underground and Buckingham Palace and safe.  My room was clean, small (it was a single),  but perfect!  I was impressed by the decor - the fabric walls were very classy!  The food (breakfast) in the restaurant was delicious.  Everyone was nice and the service was perfect.  The price was reasonable - purchased on TripAdvisor.  I will certainly go back!",5,2016,08,13
105,Great hotel,"The hotel was great and so was the staff.  The ambiance gives u a real English flavor.  The rooms were small but very elegant, clean and rich. The staff and service was phenomenal. Would definitely stay there again ",5,2016,08,13
105,"Very English stile,which I like a lot!","The location is walking distance from many restaurants,pubs and clubs.
There are 15 min walk from the Palace and just 5 from the park.
The afternoon tea is really great!The rooms are nice and all the staff of the hotel are so kind!There were bringing every day some surprises for our daughter!",5,2016,08,11
105,A cosy Mayfair base,"We stayed here for a week enjoying the attractions of London. Of special note is the thoughtful, and at times humorous, company we enjoyed from the restaurant manager and his staff. By the end of our week we felt we were leaving behind a part of our family! Nothing was too much trouble, and we spent most evenings happily in the bar area that is best described as cosily welcoming. We look forward to returning when we anticipate seeing our new friends once again.",5,2016,08,11
105,A gem in Mayfair,"I have been staying here for many years and I do believe it gets better every stay. I hadn't been for a few years as I now live abroad but as soon as I walked in I was greeted with ""Welcome back, lovely to see you again"". It is this personal touch that makes The Chesterfield so special. All the staff are attentive, gracious and so helpful. Everywhere is immaculate. It's like a home from home. I look forward to my return.",5,2016,08,10
105,Fabulous ,"A beautiful hotel in the traditional style. The staff were all welcoming and helpful. The room was the most comfortable I have stayed in and everything was quality, for example, Christy towels....large and fluffy!  The price reflects high standard service and accommodation. You definitely get what you pay for.  I recommend the breakfast too. There was more than just full English on offer. Excellent!",5,2016,08,10
105,Excellent hotel,This hotel has everything most people will need for a trip to London. We stayed in the Dormer Suite. It was about 600 British pounds per day which is expensive but it was well worth it. One because I am a big guy and too because of the location. Alot of real estate in Europe tries to cram as much as they can into small spaces. Big Guys don't normally work well in small spaces. The bathrooms here were good size and the bed was very comfortable. There was a separate bedroom which worked well as I had a child that need to sleep early. The service at this hotel was amazing. We had a Portuguese woman that serviced our room and she was amazing! She was always so happy to see us and she interacted so well with our young daughter. She genuinely acted as though she loved children which we loved. The service for food was always timely and the people were always courteous when delivering our food. The room service was expensive but it was expected. The valet and front desk were very nice too.The hotel is located perfectly in London. There is plenty to walk to if you want to eat or see things and the taxis are always close by.,5,2016,08,08
105,Mostly positive ,"Just came back from four nights at Chesterfield Mayfair.

Positives include an amazing location (underground and best restaurants are walking distance) Comfortable bed and a terrific bathroom and shower.  Rooms though small, were set up correctly with enough storage and counter space.

Negatives:  Worn out decor (beyond antique looking), small rooms and slightly unprofessional staff (not rude but I travel extensively and there was definitely a lack of customer service training from the front desk to the house maids)

Didn't try any of their dining options.",4,2016,08,08
105,Superb Experience,Nestled in fabulous Mayfair this Hotel is outstanding for Service and Comfort. Nothing was too much trouble for the Staff . My daughter and her 5 month old son were staying with me as a special treat and thank you all at The Chesterfield you delivered ! ,5,2016,08,07
105,Amazing ,Wonderful hotel centrally located and with tremendous charm.  Everything we needed was there. Our room was very comfortable. We had snacks and drinks in the bar prior to the theater and it had a lovely old world feel with piano music. We enjoyed our stay very much! ,5,2016,08,07
105,"Great hotel, great location and fantastic service",The staff at this hotel were extremely friendly on all counts.  The rooms are very clean and lots of personal touches from the staff.  Great location with numerous things located nearby.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone for either business or family travel.,5,2016,08,04
105,"""A wonderful Experience""","Our recent return to the Chesterfield Mayfair was once again a memorable experience. There are many hotels within a 15 minute walk of the Chesterfield that sorely lack the wonderful ambiance of this hotel.   The ownership, management and staff have managed to create an appealing atmosphere of Old World British charm, absent the pompous gravity exhibited by too many of the hotels in the Mayfair / St. James area.  
    
The rooms are sufficiently large and beautifully appointed. The entire support staff - front desk personnel, bellmen, doormen, cleaning ladies, concierges - are courteous, congenial, very professional and helpful to a fault. Sadly, these are traits too often lacking in the hospitality business today. Letitia Chihambakwe, with her ever-present smile, was particularly helpful in extending our stay.

Finally, not only is the Chesterfield a brilliant all-around experience, the tariffs are far more reasonable than similar properties in the area. We eagerly look forward to our next visit!  

Dennis & Cindy Gray",5,2016,08,04
105,Willy Wonka High Tea,"This is such a brilliant treat for the whole family. We recently went with my 7 and 5 year olds and they were completed enchanced. Biagio Sarubbi (the Food & Beverage Manager) was dressed up as Willy Wonka and make the whole experience utterly magical for both of my children. It clearly wasn't a chore, he made time to come back to our table numerous times and was more than happy to pose for photos. Nothing was too much trouble. Every member of staff that we dealt with were lovely and keen to help. Not least of all the food was amazing! I would highly recommend, not only the hotel itself but this special high tea. I went a step further and had special personalised 'golden tickets' made and this really added to the whole experience for the kids. We were also told at the time that they will be running a 'Winter Wonderland' theme from November and we'll certainly be making another trip for that as well.",5,2016,08,04
105,"Excellent hotel, great location.","My wife and I were given a free gift voucher for two nights at the Chesterfield, which included afternoon tea, so we were delighted to stay at this hotel which we normally wouldn’t be able to afford. On our arrival we were upgraded to a suite, and the weekend just got better. We had afternoon tea at the hotel which was an interesting experience; there was an excellent choice of different types of tea so it was good to experiment. The waitress very kindly arranged for the cakes and sandwiches which we didn’t eat to be delivered to our room which was useful as we were rushing off to the theatre and had something to snack on for supper on our return. When we got back from the theatre there was a knock on our door and a charming waiter delivered a chilled bottle of Champagne.
The hotel location is excellent, walking distance to most central London sites, although the underground is close by if you need to adventure further afield. The hotel staff are excellent; friendly, welcoming, efficient and helpful, hopefully one day we’ll be able to return.",5,2016,08,04
105,Service was incredible ,I was on a trip to London with my new baby to meet up with family and the service I received was incredible everyone was so helpful especially Daniel on the front desk. Will definitely stay here again made our trip to London very easy and luxurious. The location and breakfast was also brilliant ,5,2016,08,04
105,Very British Luxury Hotel,"This hotel represents the quality that should be found in any luxury hotel.
You are welcomed the moment you arrive and the can do attitude of the staff is remarkable.  The rooms are comfortable and well furnished.The Breakfast room is welcoming and offers a large spread of foods to prepare for what awaits you in London. The location is perfect for restaurants and shopping. The hotel is only a 15-20 min cab ride from Paddington Station where it is easy to catch the Express Train to Heathrow.",5,2016,08,03
105,Simply Amazing not too be missed,"I stayed  recently as I needed to be here for work. I visit London very often to check hotels out for my clients, for some reason I have missed this one  before  what a shame,I was blown away. Lovely reception staff, our room was just delightful , nice big bright room, with every comfort you could ever want, and the most amazing bed ever. We had drinks in the bar, lovely staff again, how refreshing. Breakfast was fabulous. I could of stayed a few more days. The biggest bonus is the location it is just perfect. Can't wait to return. Thank you to everyone.",5,2016,08,03
105,FANTASTIC BIRTHDAY WEEKEND,"From start to finish AMAZING Adam and his team are wonderful so welcoming and helpful Food an experience to be repeated ,cannot say enough about the bar staff from the Gin tasting experience to the deconstructed cocktails they all helped to make our weekend one to talk about and recommend .",5,2016,08,02
105,Lap of luxury,"Great hotel to stay at.  Easy access to all that London offers.  Wonderful afternoon tea.  Very friendly and helpful staff and concierge.  Had a great full continental breakfast.  I enjoed the ham and cheese selections, and my 27 year old daughter totally loved the Scottish Salmon.",5,2016,08,02
105,3 day leisure trip,"Everything was professionally done, decor, rooms, service, friendliness of all the staff, couldn't have asked for more. The location of the hotel is ideal for the main shopping areas, New Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street.",5,2016,08,02
105,excellence,If you want to insure that nothing will go wrong with your stay in London you stay here.   Room was large and desk help and maid service was spot on.   The location is very good.   Across street is mini-pub land and there are plenty of restaurants around.   The hotel bar also makes awesome drinks.,5,2016,08,01
105,Afternoon tea with twist,"I took my husband and two children to the Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful experience!! The service was amazing, with the staff asking on numerous occasions if everything was OK, or if we needed any more. I can recommend the champagne and wonka tea! The sandwiches were delicious, and the cakes and scones were so fresh. To top off our visit we were presented with a cupcake with an anniversary message and a red carnation. Definitely a day to remember.",5,2016,08,01
105,The staff make the hotel great,"Atmosphere: 
Old world ornate English style hotel with a beautiful reception area. 

Service:
Fantastic service! Every member of staff from the doorman to reception to the events coordinator couldn't do enough for us. We stayed the night before and of our wedding (our event was in Dartmouth House) next door. In the lead up to the wedding, the events team was incredibly accommodating and responsive (by email and phone) regarding our hotel block for guests, handing out welcome bags to guests at check-in, accommodating Daly check-ins and late check-outs and sorting out breakfast in the conservatory so our group could sit together the morning after the wedding. They even left a card signed by everyone on staff in our suite with a bottle of champagne on our wedding night. We are so grateful for the staff's warmth and kindness. 

Sleep:
We were in the Berkeley Suite (junior suite) which was decorated nicely and quite spacious for London. The bed was comfortable although on the firmer side. The bathroom had both a shower cubicle (which was a tight squeeze even for little petite me) and a shower/bath combo. 
 
Eat & Drink:
The breakfast buffet was nothing special (yogurt pots, cheeses, meats, etc) and the cooked breakfast was good (I had the crushed avocado toast). Like every other hotel, I've ever stayed in, breakfast is overpriced so I only have it if it's included in the rate. I also indulged in some really tasty (but overpriced) late night sandwiches in the bar. 

Play:
The hotel is in a great location in Mayfair and is very close to the Green Park tube and a 20 min walk to Covent Garden. There's also a great pub on the same street, The Footman. 

Park:
The hotel has no parking. 

Notes:
Complimentary bottles of sparkling and still water refreshed daily in the room and free wifi. ",4,2016,07,27
105,Great boutique hotel,"I stayed at this hotel years ago on business, and so when visiting London again on vacation recently I checked the reviews on TripAdvisor and booked again.  I am glad I did!  

First of all, the location is in the lovely neighborhood of Mayfair on a quiet street, but still convenient to major sites.  The Green Park tube station is about a 5 minute walk away (maybe 5-7 blocks...not at all strenuous) which is on 3 tube lines so very easy to get around.

The hotel itself is a unique gem.  All of the rooms have fabric wallcoverings which is so pretty and cozy.  The bathrooms are a bit compact but certainly has all the amenities needed.  The common areas of the lobby,  dining room and bar area are also nicely decorated in a warm and inviting manner.  

The service was wonderful but all the employees we met.

I really can't recommend the hotel enough.  If you want a quaint, friendly, quintessentially British boutique hotel with great staff in a lovely convenient location, the Chesterfield Mayfair should be considered.",5,2016,07,26
105,The most scrumdiddilyumptious afternoon tea in London,"Went here for the Charlie & the Chesterfield afternoon tea. The most beautiful hotel (although doesn't really have the ""wow"" appeal from the outside), fabulous, welcoming, friendly staff & a beautiful setting. Nice decor & spotlessly clean. The Wonka tea is delicious (highly recommended specially blended tea) & the fizzy lifting drink is amazing. The sandwiches & cakes are mouth-watering & you can have as much as you can get in your little tummies + a quaint box for any you want to take home. Willy Wonka himself makes an appearance with a golden ticket & gobstoppers. I'm not keen on the 18% service charge slapped on the bill + 20% VAT (we're not in America) but paid as service was ace although you can asked for it to be removed. All in all, an amazing afternoon tea experience with a twist.... Enjoy.",5,2016,07,26
105,Great location but beware of what room you get.,"This is a nice hotel in a great location.  However, it is next to a club and our room was right over it.  It was so loud that you could hear every word the DJ said and the songs they were blaring.  We asked to change rooms but they said none were available.  They did offer us a free drink at the bar and told us it would be over by 11:30.
If it hadn't been for that, which was a big deal, I would have given them 5 stars.  Beds are vert comfortable and great bathroom and a friendly staff.",3,2016,07,26
105,The staff is incredible!.,"We always stay at the Chesterfield  when we visit London both for the location and the fantastic service. We especially enjoy seeing Hani, who has been the night manager for over 40 years. He is very helpful and will try to accomodate any request. The staff is very loyal and we see the same people on every visit and they remember you.",5,2016,07,25
105,Friendly hotel,"My husband and I stayed here when we booked our trip through Costco. We had a great time! All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice and clean. When they found out it was for our anniversary they all congratulated us and then sent a card (signed by members of the staff) and cupcakes! It was a very nice gesture. 

Overall, great experience, would recommend, and stay again!",5,2016,07,25
105,Weekend of Leisure,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel. We were welcomed by Joseph the doorman and Aline a trainee receptionist, both were polite, friendly and make a very good 1st impression. Our room was beautiful and well appointed, definitely the best bed we had on our entire trip. My boyfriend and I had a competition on who could choose the best hotel, I won hands down! Thank you!! ",5,2016,07,25
105,1st time in London,"Our stay at the Chesterfield was great!  Being our first trip to London, the staff were very helpful with directing us to nearby tube stations and places to eat. 
The rooms are quaint and the beds are very comfortable. The rooms had a surprising amount of amenities. Blow driers, irons and ironing boards, robes, slippers, shoe polishing kit and even a small sewing kit. (This came in handy as my travel pillow had a rip)
The location was perfect. We walked through Hyde Park and downtown London. 
The underground tube was two blocks away. 
When the staff heard we were going to meet our cousin, they sent up a bottle of wine for us to take and share with him!
When we returned from our day's journey, we had water bottles on the nightstand as part of their turn down service. 
We will definitely return to The Chesterfield. ",5,2016,07,25
105,Great place to stay,"Stayed here recently for two nights and what a treat.  The staff were so welcoming, the hotel felt very warm and friendly and the rooms were lovely.  Mayfair as a location is great and felt very safe, and close to Hyde Park and Green Park Tube.",5,2016,07,24
105,"Look no further, this is THE hotel!!","Everything about the Chesterfield Mayfair is lovely. The beds are so large and comfortable with nice linens, the bathrooms carefully and newly done with fabulous toiletries and plush towels. The hotel has a ""anything for you"" attitude. They are there to serve and do not disappoint!! The concierge is incredibly helpful and the food in the bar is fantastic. The breakfast buffet cannot be beat. The hot food and cold choices are excellent and their pastry chef is amazing. The air conditioning was fantastic at night and the turndown service was such a treat. The Mayfair location is wonderful. You are five minutes from the Greenpark tube station, Hyde Park, Green Park and Buckingham palace. You are near incredible restaurants and bars as well. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London!  Seriously the best!!",5,2016,07,22
105,What a gem!,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for several nights recently.  We found the staff to be very friendly and mostly helpful (they were always attentive).  The room we had was very comfortable.  We had breakfast at the hotel and were very impressed with the quality of the food..My favorite part of the experience was our nightly stop at the Terrace Bar (although I never actually saw the terrace).  The piano player was very good and soothing, as were the rather extensive assortment of Gin and Tonics available.  I frankly have never given much thought to variety in the G&T, but I won't make that mistake again.  Such a pleasure.  Once we returned home, I was still hearing the piano playing and recalling the relaxed atmosphere that we felt.",5,2016,07,22
105,Perfect stay /excellent hotel. ,"What a wonderful hotel in a perfect location. The staff goes above and beyond and managements concern for our comfort and well being was very impressive. The hotel has my unqualified recommendation. The room was meticulous, the food was excellent ( especially the breakfast) and the hotel's concierge service was great. My daughter and I stayed for 6 nights and every day was outstanding. Thank you for a great and memorable stay.",5,2016,07,18
105,Gin Experience lots of fun,I visited the Terrace Bar for the Gin Experience with a friend. We were shown to a cosy seat and made to feel comfortable. Our Gin guide was Soloman who was very informed about the different gins and tonics as well as the additional extras that were going in. He gave us plenty of time to enjoy the experience and was helpful answering questions as we went along. Really enjoyable experience I'd highly recommend it to any gin lover!,5,2016,07,18
105,Wonderful boutique hotel ,"Perfectly situated on Charles Street off Queen Street in Mayfair, this hotel is great for families, couples, business persons or what have you.   Breakfast is excellent and the service is grand.    Bar is great and servers are wonderful.    Rooms are not overly spacious but hey it's Europe.  If you can afford it, get a suite.  ",5,2016,07,17
105,Lovely Old English Hotel,My family and I stayed here for a week together and we loved it. The food and drinks were great and the staff were very helpful if we were unsure of how to get anywhere. I will be staying here again for sure.,5,2016,07,17
105,"Pleasant stay, good location!","We had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. Location is great, walking distance from the best places to eat and go shopping. Service staff was friendly and helpful. Everything ran smoothly, absolutely nothing to complain. Room was cozy, dark and quiet to sleep at night. Recommended.",5,2016,07,16
105,Fancy proper English inn at the heart of London ,"We have truly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield. We are a large family group with 5 rooms and each has been wonderful.  We like the traditional decor and each room is different but common theme- lovely dark wood trim and whimsical upholstered walls. Rooms are not huge but clean and comfortable. Nice fancy baths that are well appointed. Food and drinks in the bar and restaurant have been wonderful . Breakfast was included in our package and it is really fantastic. Lots of choices of hot English breakfast and a very high quality continental breakfast that includes incredible juices and delicious cheese and meat selections. Staff is very professional and super friendly! Close walking distance  to everything good in London, We would definitely return here!",5,2016,07,16
105,Four nights in Mayfair,"I booked this property after a wonderful previous stay at sister Red Carnation hotel in Bloomsbury.  The location of The Chesterfield was a lot better but overall I'd say that I preferred Bloomsbury.

Pros: location!  terrific King bed, decent sized room for London, breakfast at Butlers, cocktails. You could walk to Hyde Park in under 10 minutes.  Excellent location for mass transit.  Mayfair neighborhood is first class and this hotel is a wonderful value for the area.  The breakfast was incredible.

Cons: bathroom size, street noise and next door neighbor party. Didn't love rain shower and tightness of tub and I am an average height person.  Sink too small to hold any of your toiletries.  No place for your empty luggage.  

Tip, ask for room away from the street.",4,2016,07,15
105,In need of a refurb,£315 for 1 night no breakfast.  OK it was Wimbledon weekend but location apart this was a Mayfair hotel in need of a serious lick of paint. The room was very small with no view and the bathroom was completely awash if you used the shower,2,2016,07,14
105,Traditional Hotel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a Traditional Hotel in a great location. It is within a few blocks of Hyde Park, Green Park and Oxford Street.

This seems to make it a popular place for tourists.  However, it is quite an expensive hotel.

The food is good. I tried the breakfast and dinner menus and both were excellent.

My room was upgraded from a Queen to a King. Whilst quite small it had everything I could possibly want.",4,2016,07,14
105,Mayfair grandeur.,"Our first stay at the Chesterfield for a concert weekend and what an absolutely perfect place to be. So central in a quality environment and perfectly tucked away so as to be peaceful and very comfortable. The staff are all very attentive and seem genuinely concerned that they provide the best possible service and experience for guests; nothing was too much trouble. So congratulations to The Chesterfield, we will return hopefully soon and recommend you without hesitation.",5,2016,07,14
105,Mayfair Magnificence,"This was a perfect hotel for me for a week's worth of business meetings in and around London: central, perfectly positioned.  On top of that, the service was impeccable, the room amazing (I was put in the Africa Suite which made me feel right at home!).  Nothing was too much of an effort in any way.  I would highly recommend anyone staying here for either business or pleasure as it personifies the elegance of London while being in close proximity to all the major sites for tourist-purposes and all the major centres for meetings or being able to get to meetings.  I will definitely be back.",5,2016,07,13
105,Amazing hotel in London,I have stayed many times in the last tow years at the Chesterfield Mayfair. It is one of the best hotels in London. The location is perfect. All the people who work at the hotel are really helpfull. The breakfast is superb and the rooms are really cozy. I will continue choosing it.,5,2016,07,13
105,Great short stay at The Chesterfield!,"Just a one night stay, but we really enjoyed it.  We were very kindly upgraded to a suite (The Dormer) which was huge and decorated in a 'clubby' style.  Huge comfortable bed with beautiful linens.  We had filled in the pre stay questionnaire in which we requested feather pillows and duvet - lovely!   We even had a decanter of sherry, a Nespresso coffee maker and lots of lovely teas.  The bathroom had a generous supply of Elemis products - everything was perfect.  We dined in the restaurant and both my husband and I chose their speciality dish of Dover Sole, which was excellent.  In the morning we enjoyed a full English breakfast which was served quickly and efficiently and again was very good.  The staff were all very helpful and willing to assist.  An excellent choice!",5,2016,07,13
105,Very good indeed,"Stayed here for 2 nights 11/12 July.
Rooms very comfortable,beds amazing,staff helpful,great location just off Berkely square so ideal for Picadilly and west end.
Rooms were tastefully done if a little tired,no mini bar which was a bit disappointing but enjoyed my stay here and would definetly return.",5,2016,07,13
105,Brilliant afternoon tea!,"My girlfriends and I headed to the Charlie and the Chesterfield afternoon tea a couple of saturday's ago as we really like the idea of a themed afternoon tea. From arrival the experience was great! Lovely, lively and fun atmosphere, great service, great food, great experience!

The hotel itself is great. Upon arrival we were promptly seated and given our first taster of what was to come. The food is excellent, one of my friends is gluten free and usually has to miss half the meal, however they had this all sorted and she had just as much as us! The gluten free options were EXCELLENT.

The food is incredible, really nice sandwichs, scones and treats! If there is something that you particularly like, just ask for more and they will continue to replenish your plates.

The wonka bar on the treats was amazing!

We will most definitely be returning - absolutely brilliant afternoon and great value for money!",5,2016,07,11
105,Fun with Charlie and the Chesterfield!,"I was on the lookout for a child friendly afternoon tea and after seeing so many wonderful reviews opted to book at The Chesterfield Mayfair, and I am so glad that I did! 

We had an absolutely wonderful experience. The food was divine and in abundance, the staff were so welcoming and attentive, the restaurant itself is lovely. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute.",5,2016,07,09
105,My grandson's first visit to London,"I wanted him to experience a fine London hotel within my price range and the Chesterfield was perfect! The Junior Suite was a good size for our six days, the staff helpful and warm, and the location ideal for walking and the Tube.",5,2016,07,08

105,Wonderful staff and superb service,"My mother and I stayed at the Chesterfield to celebrate my mothers 75th birthday on her first holiday in the UK.  We travelled across from Australia and after a long flight we were thoroughly spoilt. Luxurious comfortable quiet and central the Chesterfield has it all. We were thoroughly spoilt and loved the hotel, the meals, and the location. We would recommend the Chesterfield to anyone visiting London. ",5,2016,07,08
105,Knock-your-socks off beautiful,"Got a great price through Trip Advisor at this otherwise very expensive hotel in very expensive Mayfair (the Embassy area of London) near Green Park tube station. 
The Chestefield Mayfair is well known in the area for a fabulous ""Tea"". 
The rooms are very luxurious and relatively large by European standards. 

There is a warren of streets near to the hotel called Shepherds Market and Shepherd Street which has some decent restaurants and pubs. The one that served our needs the best and became our commissary was a small cafe called ""Caffe In"" Address: 3 Shepherd St, London W1J 7HL, United Kingdom Phone:+44 20 7493 6400. Served 3 meals a day and opened early so we could get on our way. Fresh food at reasonable prices.",5,2016,07,07
105,A pleasant time with my business partners,"A wonderful building where I gladly send my business partners. Excellent service, food and hospitality. The rooms have been personally inspected my a member of staff and I and I retained them to be greatly in line with what I look for my clients, Clean, elegant, well decorated and in a great location. I highly recommend this property to any potential customers.",5,2016,07,07
105,Super location,"What a fabulous hotel. I felt truly spoilt. Lovely quiet room I slept really well. Super bar with a pianist playing gentle music. Found an arch way near by with lots of interesting restaurants of all nationalities. Corridor opposite Trumpers shaving shop if you can't find the archway. 
Back at the hotel I had an incredible breakfast.",5,2016,07,07
105,Excellent location ,"I frequent this hotel for business purposes as it is located perfectly for my requirements. The service, rooms, and breakfast are consistently to a very high standard. The Chesterfield also has a very well stocked bar which indeed makes for a pleasurable stay.",5,2016,07,03
105,Luxury Boutique Hotel . . . Very English,"Best place to stay in London,  Easy access to the Tube at Green Park.  The staff is incredible and knows all guests by name very personable and friendly.   True English feeling throughout this historic hotel, its a gem.   Charming, service, doorman, Butlers Restaurant fabulous, close to everything to walk to or take tube.   The people are the NO 1 asset of this beautiful establishment.   Rooms were made up quickly, service was incredible and we especially loved the Louis the maitre d of the restaurant so colorful and entertaining.   The bar was lovely and quaint as well and excellent service.   Upon leaving the night before the staff even brings over a desert with the words ""farewell"" or something similar written in chocolate.  This hotel is a 5 star hotel and puts others to shame.   I will only stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair when visiting London.  It is truly the best.",5,2016,07,03
105,Top notch room & superb bed!!!,"Stayed here when going to the Grosvenor House for a function and really enjoyed it! Not only superb décor and service but a fantastic location to explore or shop!! Quiet area too. The Mattress was great quality, firm yet comfy .... and had a brilliantly good night sleep!!",5,2016,07,03
105,. ,"The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel in London is truly a home away from home. Their hotel staff went above and beyond ..in every possible way to make my stay wonderful . I have never seen such incredible hospitality. Every single hotel member, from the front desk,doorman ,and food/bar staff ,was simply outstanding.
My room was very clean and bathrooms seem to be brand-new!
The location is close to everything and I would definitely stay there in the future!",5,2016,07,03
105,Child Friendly Afternoon Tea,"When in London afternoon tea is a must!  While visiting we had many friends and relatives we wanted to say hello to and afternoon tea seemed to be the perfect venue to meet. We had quite a large group of 11, for afternoon tea- with ages ranging from 10-85 and food restrictions ranging from vegetarian to a nut/sesame allergy.   The staff was very accommodating and attentive to all the needs of the entire group.  The tea was very child friendly, the Charlie and the Chocolate theme was fun and both adults and children alike throughly enjoyed themselves.  The price tag is similar to other afternoon teas but they do not skimp, tea and sandwiches/snacks are a plenty and refills are not frowned upon! Alexsandra especially made an effort to make our daily experience a truly memorable one!",5,2016,07,02
105,Wonderful British Experience,"We wanted to experience the image of England we had in our American minds - the properness, the politeness, a bit of formality, linens, silver, leather chairs, and English food.    We got all that and more - a great pub for afternoon drinks served by cheerful staff, beautiful fresh flowers all around, comfortable library, wonderful restaurant with top service, and changing wonderful food, in a very nice neighborhood, within walking distance of important London sites.  Room was clean - actually the whole place was clean, clean, clean.  Most of all, the staff seemed genuinely cheerful to have us as guests and proud of their hotel.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants the experience the best of British life.",5,2016,06,30
105,Ideal location and stunning room ,I managed to get this hotel for a bargain price and I was really impressed with the facilities and the decor of the place. The staff were really friendly and the location is only 5 minute walk from the green park tube station. I'd recommend staying here if you can. ,5,2016,06,30
105,21st birthday ,Stayed over for one night and from the moment we arrived to the departure the staff and service was amazing room service very promt with our bubbles would recommend for comfort And central location great breakfast try the gull egg omelette when in season ,5,2016,06,30
105,Quaint hotel,This was our second stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  Unfortunately our rooms were smaller this time around and we definitely felt more cramped and not as comfortable.  This is an adorable hotel with impeccable service.  Breakfast was fabulous and the staff is very professional.  We enjoy the location and were pleased with our stay.,4,2016,06,29
105,Excelent hotel!!,"We had an amazing stay at the Chesterfield. I loved the rooms and was always clean. The restaurant was 5 star and afternoon tea excellent! I really loved the little details they had every night in our room. I want to thank the staff who were very helpful, Chris who helped us with directions and helped us buy theater tickets, and Fabio excellent waiter, Loris the restaurant manager was always attentive and Tony and the doorman and the rest of the staff. Please give my regards to all the staff for making our first visit to London special. We will definitely return to the Chesterfield for our future visits. Thank you",5,2016,06,28
105,Absolutely Wonderful!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for ten days in the beginning of June and couldn't have been more satisfied. Customer service is excellent and friendly, the rooms are cleaned twice a day, there is a classic restaurant to eat breakfast at in the hotel, and the concierge Chris literally became our best friend. It was no joke when I said the employees are friendly and more than helpful. Chris is so enthusiastic and all smiles to help people, we saw him almost every day to talk to him about musicals and plays in London and he was more than helpful. We went to a few musicals on his recommend and couldn't of enjoyed them more. This hotel was classically English, very clean, and had the most amazing location. You're pretty much smack dab in the middle of London, close to everything. If you want a hotel who gives you a traditional English experience and gives more than costumer satisfaction, I would very highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair. I have no complaints and plan to go back to London and book no other place but here. Guaranteed you will have a lovely experience with no regrets.",5,2016,06,28
105,"Good hotel, great value","We spend four nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair in early May 2016, and were very pleased.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was not large but was very comfortably appointed, in a very traditional way.  Housekeeping was quite good.  

We did not eat dinner in the hotel, but did have breakfast on one occasion.  It was quite tasty with ample variety and friendly service.  

The location of the hotel is hard to beat.  

Finally, while by no means cheap, the room rate was an excellent value for the location and the quality of the product.  

",5,2016,06,28
105,Tired dreary room but lovely staff!,"I stayed here for two nights in June and was really excited as treated myself to what I thought was a top class hotel.  I was meeting some old friends that I had not seen in sixteen years!  We had afternoon tea booked which turned out to be wonderful and we enjoyed it very much indeed.  However, when I went up to see my room I was very dissappointed,  I had booked a 'standard single' and was expecting a very cosy, classy room from the pictures I had seen on the website when booking.  The room I walked into had a very large bed, which turned out to be two singles pushed together with a lumpy quilt in the middle.  The bed took up the whole room, which was very small, hardly any room to put luggege etc.  There was a small table and two rather large chairs pushed against the window which you would not be able to sit at as there was little room.  The room had no tea/coffee making facilities, which I would have thought basic.  I called room service Sunday morning and ordered a pot of coffee that took three more calls over the space of an hour before I eventually received it.  All in all I would say I was dissappointed and perhaps my expectations were high from the description and pictures on the web site.",3,2016,06,28
105,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"I booked Afternoon Tea at the Chesterfield after seeing photos online about a Wonka themed afternoon tea and it truly didn't disappoint!

We went for my friend's belated birthday, the service was fantastic, the food was gorgeous and the cupcake with a candle and flower for my friend was amazing!

Make sure you leave room for all the cakes.... they are worth it!

I am definitely planning to go back again.... I just need to find a reason!",5,2016,06,27
105,FIRST CLASSS,"Absolutely everything you could want..  NICE STAFF, especially Chris the concierge, beautiful piano bar with the best bartender EVER   Selmon.   You need to ask him about the special cocktail that comes with a little hammer.  No more ""hints"". HA.  Wonderful restaurant..  Close to Buckingham Palace.  Around the corner to Shepards Market (which is not a market but a group of restaurants and shops). Fun local people.   I strongly recommend.",5,2016,06,26
105,Stunning!,"I was in a party of 11 who visited the hotel for the Willy Wonka themed afternoon tea. It was fabulous! The service and attention we received was outstanding.  The food was also delicious and we were so pleasantly surprised to find you were replenishing food at no extra charge.  We had two of the party who were celebrating their birthday and it was a fabulous touch to have cakes for them, and carnations presented to each of them.

Particular praise has to be sung for Kamila and Loris. Both were very charming and helpful and couldn't do enough to keep us happy and ensure we had a splendid afternoon.  They both excelled in this!",5,2016,06,25
105,Phenomenal Hotel for a Relaxing Holiday,"I stayed here from Monday May 23rd until Friday May 27th on recommendation from my parents who have stayed many times. I now understand why they keep coming back. The hotel is beautiful, the service is impeccable, and location is right in the heart of it all. 

During my stay, I took advantage of the Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea and I am so happy I did. This was a wonderful experience that I think each guest should take advantage of. I tried several different types of teas and enjoyed each and every sandwich and cake, and I asked for more!!! 

Those who say that the hotel on a city holiday doesn't matter, that all you do is sleep and shower there have not stayed in a hotel like the Chesterfield Mayfair. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be back on my next trip to London.",5,2016,06,25
105,Amazing ,"Visited here a couple of months ago for my daughters 4th birthday, it was  amazing start to finish, it was a experience the children spoke about for weeks, the staff from the door man to the chef deserve a massive well done, our waiter was brilliant always at hand for re fills.
The waiters and waitresses were brilliant and brought a birthday cake out for my daughter and sang happy birthday made her feel very special 

the little gifts the children get are a brilliant touch 

We are returning again with friends on Sunday with our golden tickets 😀

I can't stop thinking about the chocolate scones 
",5,2016,06,24
105,Royal Treatment,"This hotel made me feel like I was special and important. I had afternoon tea with my mom while staying there and it was lovely. It;s in a beautiful naturally lit room. The waiter dropped a glass near us and the manager insisted that we have free champagne to make up for it. Our room was very cute and clean. Every time I came back from a long day in London, there would be a new surprise on my pillow. The staff was very sweet and caring. The concierge was very helpful and the doorman was very welcoming. With out stay we got a free 3 course dinner which was very good. We also got a free English breakfast every morning which highly recommend. I had a very lovely stay at this hotel and am planning on returning on my next trip to London.",5,2016,06,24
105,Royal Treatment on the Queen's Doorstep,"On this, our second visit to the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair, we confirmed without doubt  that this boutique hotel is a local gem. Located just far enough off of Piccadilly Street to be quiet, it is within easy walking distance to the real reasons you travel to London...Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Square, the theater district and shopping on Bond and Oxford Streets. But it is the care and attention of its wonderful staff that made our stay special. They provided superb advice on touring the city and promptly arranged a next day appointment for my husband who had a dental emergency. There is an exceptional chef, live entertainment in the bar and the rooms are comfortable and up to date. We are already planning our return visit!",5,2016,06,22
105,Willy Wonka afternoon tea,"First class and the perfect way to spend the afternoon.  We stopped off on the way home after staying in another hotel in London the previous night.  The hotel let us store our luggage whilst we had tea.

From the start Mr Wonka produced a fantastic spread with a slightly more unusual  take of the traditional English afternoon tea.  I won't spoil the surprise at the start, but needless to say, tastebuds standby.

A fine selection of leafed teas; I'd recommend the Wonka blend.  Then the 3  layers of of excitement which will be replenished on request (for free). 2hrs of all you can eat and drink.
Layer 1: A stylish selection of sandwiches; the smoke salmon is particularly tasty
Layer 2: freshly made scones with a Wonka twist 
Layer 3: I never thought bubblegum Eccles would work, but when you sign up for 'Charlie at the Chesterfield' you've got to try them :-)

The staff are great and really made the kids feel welcome .

The final piece of the afternoon tea is drawing a surprise golden ticket we will be back.

Oohs did I say you get a Wonka bar

In summary perfect venue, with an added twist for afternoon tea for kids of all ages at a reasonable price.

'The Chesterfield, Mayfair' many thanks.",5,2016,06,22
105,Pure Pleasure ,"I first visited London in the sixties and I have returned many times thereafter . My love for this city has only increased over the years . This was my first stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair and I cannot imagine a better hotel . I will return . 

Why ? Size . Decor . Location . Service . Price .

This is a small hotel which I prefer because people recognize you and requests are promptly answered . I do not use the amenities of a very large hotel ( gym , spa ) so I do not want to pay for them . However my room at this hotel was large by London standards and the attention to details shown is incredible . This hotel is part of the Red Carnation Group and its very interesting and informative to read about this good company .

To name just a few of the special details ; in your room there is coffee , tea , hot chocolate , cookies and OPTIONS for milk , they even offer to bring a pitcher of fresh milk up for you in the morning . In a drawer there is a selection of paper clips , staples , rubber bands Etc in case one needs them . Ever really need just one paper clip ! The robe comes with comfy padded slippers instead of those thin ones which fall off when you walk . Sheets and pillows are high quality . It felt like someone's guest room not a hotel room . Just amazing . 

The Chesterfield is beautifully decorated in a traditional style as one might prefer when in London . In person it is lovelier than the photos show . I looked at other hotels before booking this one and I was disappointed to see that they had "" updated "" the decor so that they looked like any hotel anywhere . I want my surroundings to make me feel like I am in London where tradition matter ! 

The location on a quiet street in Mayfair does seem like you are staying in a private club or home . However a short walk of a few blocks puts you on Piccadilly , Oxford St. and Hyde Park . Please walk in London . It's the best way to connect with the city and  to discover the wonderful mews full of shops and restaurants that you cannot see while driving by in a taxi . Since I enjoy walking I walked to , Selfridges , Harrods , the Victoria & Albert museum , The Royal Albert Hall , a West End Theatre , Fortum and Mason's and more . 

The service I received was impeccable . In advance of my stay all my e mails were answered promptly and in a friendly manner . I was able to obtain tickets to a show and information about transportation options from the airport . 

There is a cozy bar right off the lobby where a piano player is often playing and a handsome bar tender makes lovely drinks for you .

London is a very expensive city and this hotel is an excellent value . I am thinking about my next stay already . ",5,2016,06,22
105,First Class in London,"Our first stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair but it won't be our last. Stayed five nights and hated to leave. Great location convenient to Shepherd's Market (restaurants, shops, pubs) and to the Green Park tube station. Quiet neighborhood away from the London hustle and bustle. The staff were all genuinely friendly and attentive. All the nice touches are there to make our stay wonderful. Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair!",5,2016,06,21
105,As British as you can get,Stayed 3 days and loved it. If you want to experience a true British elegant hotel..this is the place..top hat doorman and all.  Very nice and so accommodating.  They suggested the perfect spots from pubs to upscale dining.  Will return if we go back to London,5,2016,06,20
105,Welcoming Sanctuary in Busy London,"My husband and I had five nights to spend in London following a cruise and chose to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair on the recommendation of friends.  This was definitely an excellent choice not only for location but amenities. From the minute we exited the taxi at the door, we were warmly welcomed, helped with our luggage and shown to reception.  Although our room was not yet ready, we were made comfortable in the lounge to have lunch. Our room was of adequate size and very nicely appointed with luxurious robes, towels and bedding. We found a newspaper of our choice hanging on our door every morning.  Breakfast was included in our rate.  The choices, quality and service were excellent.  Throughout our entire stay every staff member we encountered in the hotel were more than friendly and accommodating to our every request and wants.  We had dinner two nights in the hotel restaurant called ""Butlers"". Again the choices, quality and service were excellent.  We loved the dover sole on the menu so much, we had it both times!  After long days of touring the city we always looked forward to our return to this lovely hotel and having a glass of wine or beer in the lounge which also served excellent food.  The staff here were equally warm and friendly with great service.  At the end of our stay, we felt like we were saying good-bye to friends.  The Chesterfield Mayfair will definitely be our first choice of hotels should we ever have the chance to visit London again.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,06,20
105,Whisky tasting & overall impression,"Our first time at the Chesterfield, we stayed 5 nights and what a wonderful experience it was, very professional & committed staff, to name just a few Biagio Sarubbi who could not do enough for all the guests, Aleksandra in the restaurant so friendly and professional, Selmon in tne bar who introduced me to be the first to take the whisky from around the world tasting challenge, just fantastic.

The location is just perfect, 5 minutes walk to Green park on Piccadilly which is close to Buckingham palace etc. 5 minutes to a tube line.

The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious and immaculately clean, as is the restaurant and all other areas. We also niticed they also cater for disabled and are very child friendly. The food is of Michelin star status and can be fully recommended and of course breakfast is a treat. 
Thank you Chesterfield Terry & Nicki W",5,2016,06,19
105,Willy Wonka afternoon tea,"Superb experience from start to finish. Arrival at the hotel and being greeted by a wonderful concierge, we were shown through to afternoon tea. The food was wonderfully fresh and tasty and never ending!! The staff were friendly and could not do enough for us. Willy Wonka arrived to give us never ending gobstoppers and a swirly lolly for my daughter, as well as our golden envelopes. A perfect ruse to get us back, as they are only valid if opened on a return visit - but I don't care, because we will be back for sure. Can't rate it highly enough.",5,2016,06,18
105,Simply fabulous ,"We have just returned from a lovely weekend at The Chesterfield. This beautiful hotel is conveniently located about 6 minutes' walk from Green Park tube, just off Berkley Square (sad lack of nightingales this weekend), and is very close to several bars and restaurants if you don't want to eat in the hotel restaurant. We only had breakfast in the hotel, as we had dinner reservations elsewhere- although my husband did sample the fish and chips from room service and said it was excellent. The breakfast menu is extensive and all tastes are catered for- it was tempting enough to tear me from my well worn Continental breakfast path and I would heartily recommend the smoked salmon with scrambled eggs and bagel. 
The service was excellent and the staff couldn't have been warmer or friendlier. 
The friends with whom we travelled with were celebrating  their wedding anniversary, and we were all greeted with (delicious) cupcakes with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate and a card- we are saving ours until our anniversary in December ( the card, not the cakes, they didn't last the night).
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. Simply fabulous. 

 

",5,2016,06,15
105,Faultless,"We only stayed one night but it was a fantastic experience. Lovely welcome and smooth check in, staff were so forthcoming with offers of help. Within 5 minutes of being in our room we received a call to ask if we were happy with the room and if there was anything more we needed for now. The room was quite small but nicely furnished and well equipped, fluffy dressing gowns were a nice addition as was the stationery set in the draw. We asked for dome fresh milk for pur tea and it was delivered in minutes. We had a very good nights sleep, beds were very comfortable but maybe that was down to the super dirty martini we had in the bar whilst listening to the guy tinkle the ivories on the piano, the best dirty martini we've had since New York 10 years ago. Fantastic location, we would definitely stay again",5,2016,06,15
105,Birthday treat,"Fantastic stay at The Chesterfield hotel Mayfair, I arrived at the hotel and got a warm reception from Lois, I was asked by her what my stay was for and I said it was my birthday. Once checked in I headed to the room, the room was lovely, had a nice old classic feel to it, lovely bed which was very comfy. The bathroom was stunning and I loved the heated floor!
The breakfast was fantastic, literally everything you could imagine was on the menu or on the buffet, there was even a sweets table, loved it!!!
The bit that really touched me the most was that Lois had organised a cake with happy birthday written on it and also she organised a birthday card which was signed when all the staff in the hotel and these were then delivered to the room. It was so lovely, I'd had quite an eventful birthday (not the best if I'm honest) so this cheered me up no end and I felt very loved. Thank you Lois! I hope to visit The Chesterfield again in the future. Thanks Lois for making it fab and also to all your colleagues for making it perfect for me.xx",5,2016,06,15
105,Wonderful hotel,"I am delighted to say that all the positive reviews are true.  From the initial warm greeting of the doorman to the day I had to sadly leave, I was made to feel welcome and very well cared for.  The staff of this hotel couldn't have been nicer.  The room was on the 2nd floor front, but was completely quiet, not to mention charming and well-appointed. I also appreciated the convenience of a computer downstairs, complete with printer for printing airline check-in page. It was a busy week for me, but I hope to return again.",5,2016,06,14
105,A Delightful Stay,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a wonderful place to stay in London. The staff is most helpful. They go out of their way to make sure you are helped. 
The lobby is beautiful, and the rooms are lovely as well. 
Breakfast each morning was fabulous. The buffet has a wide variety, and they also have a wonderful full menu as well.
The hotel is VERY clean! The rooms are well attended, and they have a turn down service at night. I was very pleased, and I am very, very picky.",5,2016,06,14
105,Afternoon tea wanka style,Company whith teens did not think the wanka theme would fit. But it did. For the adults ;() Great sandw and bakery. The service is outstanding and worth the extra £. Just start with the champagne and your afternoon starts perfect - wanka fan or not!,5,2016,06,14
105,A gem!,"I travel to London frequently for work, and despite however stressful my meetings may be, I always look forward to coming back to the Chesterfield Mayfair! The staff go above and beyond to ensure your comfort -- especially Letitia at reception -- and the rooms are always cozy, clean, and charming, each with its own character. The location is very central with great pubs, shopping, and restaurants walkable.  If you're looking for a sleek hyper-modern stay, this is not the place for you. But if you enjoy a little historic flair, charm, and great customer service, I highly recommend.",5,2016,06,13
105,Cozy hotel on a cozy street in Mayfair.," We got off a long flight from LA and went straight to the chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel is warm and cozy, just what weary travelers need. To stretch our legs we took a nice walk around Mayfair.   We enjoyed excellent Dover sole at the hotels Butler restaurant which also serves breakfast. Then it was on to the  continent. ",4,2016,06,09
105,WONDERFUL WELCOMING HOTEL,"We spent a very enjoyable week at the lovely Chesterfield Hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel at home and from then on, it really did feel as though it was our London home away from home. 

We had a lovely quiet room on the third floor with a very comfortable bed and even though we arrived with a lot of luggage including 3 suitcases, they were all able to be put away in the cupboard so that our room was taken over by our possessions.  

Breakfast each morning was a delight with a varied selection of cold cuts, cereals, fruits etc. and the cooked breakfast was even more delicious.  We ate one night in the restaurant and the roast chicken was just what we needed after being away from home for over 7 weeks. It was just as I make it at home together with the wonderful vegetables. 

We also had lunch in the Bar a couple of times and that was lovely as the Bar is so very cosy.  Our afternoon tea on the Sunday was so great that we didn't need any dinner that night. 

The Chesterfield is in a fantastic position, very close to Green Park Tube Station as well as just being around the corner from Shepherd's Market which has quite a few interesting restaurants. It is also close to Green Park and Hyde Park, such a lovely part of London.

We would definitely return to the Chesterfield if we ever visit London again. Only the long flight of 24+ hours is stopping us from returning regularly.",5,2016,06,09
105,An oasis of quality ,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a night recently. The staff are warm, solicitous and always helpful. Room was very comfortable.Food was  generally satisfactory though not outstanding (let down by sloppy preparation). Would definitely return. ",5,2016,06,06
105,"Wonderful hotel, delicious breakfast, polite and helpful staff","There were six family members in our group including two college-age grandkids.  We all loved this boutique, formal but friendly hotel.  On a quiet Mayfair street. Lovely accommodations, delicious and HUGE breakfast included - buffet and made-to-order!  Wonderful coffee!  Within easy walking distance to many major tourist sites, major parks, shopping and about a 7-minute walk to a central tube station.  Concierge staff (especially Chris) were most helpful.  Mayfair restaurants can be expensive, but two blocks from the hotel you will find Shepherd Market, with MANY restaurants to choose from: Italian, French, pubs, delis - much more reasonably priced!  This is the kind of hotel I really enjoy.  Great location, elegant without being pretentious; just the right size so the staff recognizes you and are eager to be of service.",5,2016,06,05
105,Reviews very accurate,"My husband, young adults daughter and I stayed at the Chesterfield for 6 nights.  It is truly a hotel with old world charm and a highly trained/welcoming staff.  I did email ahead to insure our junior suite would comfortably accommodate three adults, which it did.  Everything is kept very clean, the full breakfast and excellent dining room staff included with our rate was terrific.  Two days we ordered room service as we were leaving the hotel early.  It was equally delicious and prepared with attention to detail.  Little treats left with turn down service nightly were appreciated.  The only reason I am not giving five stars is i also emailed about a quiet room.  We were given a room above a banquet area and on Friday evening our room and the outside hallway was literally vibrating.  Now when i checked in i was assured by the front desk person that she ""would give this room to my own mother who is a light sleeper.""  Felt slightly ""taken"" by her.  Did speak to the night manager who promised me the wedding/band would be over by 11:30 and it was (we had gotten up at 5:30 that morning so it was an inconvenience).  The hotel management did apologize and make things right by us, but it would have been better if original request for a quiet location was taken seriously.  Hotel's location near Green Park Station in a delightlful London neighborhood, along with all the positive mentioned would have me stay there again if in London.",4,2016,06,04
105,Very Comfortable and Charming Boutique Hotel in Mayfair,"My wife and I spent a month at this delightful hotel which has a perfect location tucked away in a quiet village like area just off the main roads in Mayfair. It is a very well run boutique hotel with the most courteous and friendly staff without exception who made our stay in London very comfortable and relaxing. The hotel has old world charm, is well appointed, has excellent food and room service was amazing. It is a gem and its rates are very fair for Central London.",5,2016,06,03
105,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at!,"The staff was incredibly kind and genuine. The breakfasts were absolutely delicious. Our rooms were always cleaned spotlessly, along with a fantastic bed turn-down service every evening. The hotel is nice and close to the underground transportation and is conveniently located in London.",5,2016,06,01
105,London....never disappoints!,"My wife and I have been to London on different occasions and this time we brought our two adult children.  On advice of our travel agent, we booked two rooms at the Chesterfield-Mayfair.  Prior to our arrival our room types were confirmed by the hotel.  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and comfortably checked in.  The location is amazing as it is close to Green Park tube station and many restaurants.  As was stated in previous reviews, the staff here is amazing and very accomodating.  The other thing worth noting is that we stayed on the fourth floor and I can say that this is without question, the quietest hotel In which I have ever stayed.  Evenings spent in the bar were truly enjoyable.  The concierge staff was always on hand and willing to assist.  We opted for breakfast there daily and enjoyed the food and staff.  The bottom line is that this is a wonderful traditional English hotel in a great part of London.  I am sure there are less expensive properties, but in this case you truly get what you pay for!",5,2016,06,01
105,At Home in Mayfair,"This was our third stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair with our first two stays coming about 3 years ago.  Everything we experienced during this visit just reinforced the opinion we had formed during our first stays.  Our room was nicely sized for a European hotel, and was very well decorated and appointed with first class amenities.  The service supplied by the entire staff was first class all the way.  My only wish was that I could package up the Chesterfield Mayfair and its staff and take them with us on all of our travels.",5,2016,05,30
105,Little treasure,"Very courteous friendly staff who couldn't do enough for  you. 
Lovely room, great cocktails, heavenly bed and wonderful breakfast - couldn't have asked for more. Hotel in a super position in Mayfair so great for walking around central London",5,2016,05,30
105,Hotel where service has been perfected,"I expect from a London hotel expensive prices so so service and small rooms so what a revelation was The Chesterfield. Quite simply this hotel has got it right - I cannot fault the impeccable service and the way the staff make you feel welcome and relaxed. I was there as a surprise trip for my Birthday arranged by my sister and her hubby and it was quite simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at - food, the bar and the room were all terrific and I did not want to come home. Upgraded to the Dormer suite it was the special touches - not only the mini birthday cakes but also a card signed by the hotel team - it made the whole experience special. A special mention to Willy Wonka who broke off from hosting the afternoon teas to wish me a happy birthday. There with 9 family and friends it was a truly memorable stay and all of us want to come back - six stars if I could give that much",5,2016,05,29
105,R khan,Excellent staff excellent service have used this hotel and bar for ten years and quite a few others of red carnation hotel s chesterfield is second to none after noon tea willy wonky is amazing for adults and children especially when willy is giving out the tickets ,5,2016,05,29
105,Lovely high tea ,"Went here for a surprise birthday treat for my mum. Had the willy wonka high tea which was amazing, unlimited selection of teas, sandwiches, and cakes. Very good value for money. Staff were very friendly and helpful, and willy wonka himself was there. ",5,2016,05,28
105,This hotel never fails to delivers,"We went back our 17th time, we always leave having a wonderful experience.
As you walk through the door you feel special, the hotel is always immaculate with a warm welcoming ambiance with the best service.
We always really enjoy having a drink and something to eat at the bar, listening to the great pianist.
The bedrooms are lovey, cosy, so quiet we always sleep in.
Breakfast  has everything you would want.
This time we chatted to some Americans all who had fallen in love, as we have with The Chesterfield.",5,2016,05,28
105,Perfect Daddy Daughter Date for me and my 9 year old,"We did not stay at this hotel but rather took advantage of a special afternoon tea they offer for children.  I'm sure the hotel's offerings as far as rooms, internet, view, environmental practices, and the like are exemplary in every way.  Per our experience in the restaurant for the afternoon tea, few things deliver when those things dare to say, ""we provide an incredible, unforgettable, experience"" but The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel does just that.  I would especially like to point out Marius who leads a great, great international team including Kamila who sat us and served us.  Marius is the restaurant manager for the morning and afternoon shift and his attention to detail, personality, sincerity, and responsiveness was simply...overwhelming.  From the personal attention he gave my daughter to the special birthday cupcake and chocolate inscribed plate and to the additional ""extras"" he provided along the way, he and his team surpassed my very high standards for this once in a lifetime date with my daughter.",5,2016,05,27
105,Wonderful,"Very friendly and helpfull staff. Our room was with a very good size,  pretty good closets and comfortable bed. The location was super, very special neighborhood with everything that we needed nearby. We will come back...",5,2016,05,27
105,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"Booked this Willy Wonka tea to celebrate my grandchildren's 5th Birthday. We had the most amazing time. Excellent food  and lots of refills. Staff very attentive and caring. Great ambiance and yes Willy Wonka made an appearance. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble.

Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,26
105,My favorite London hotel,"I stay every year at this wonderful hotel when I come to London. This is my absolutely favorite hotel in the UK. I enjoy everything about the hotel, the great location, that it is a smaller hotel with great charm, the wonderful rooms (which are quite large as London hotel rooms go), the excellent bathroom, the in-room french press coffee and of course your staff is always so friendly and helpful. Everything about the hotel is awesome .",5,2016,05,25
105,Birthday treat,"My boyfriend treated me to an overnight stay in London for my birthday in early Feb. This hotel was just out of this world. When we arrived they had given us a room upgrade and we were treated like royalty. The staff are the kindest people I've met and the hotel is just one big piece of art. We went out to the theatre in the evening and when we got back there was a card and cake waiting for me, the card was signed from all the staff and I am truly grateful for this, it was an amazing birthday treat and I just can't thank all of the team enough. ",5,2016,05,25
105,Third stay in a year,"Stayed last week for the third time in the last year, as it is such a perfect hotel in a lovely part of London - stylish, sophisticated and wonderful atmosphere due to all the help and attention to detail by the amazing staff.",5,2016,05,25
105,Classic British Hotel in Mayfair,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel in early May.  We had a fantastic experience.  Our room on the third floor had been recently renovated and was quite comfortable and tastefully decorated.  The hotel staff are all very courteous and helpful.  We forgot to bring electrical converter plugs and the staff provided them during the duration of our stay.  The hotel has a great bar with a very talented piano player.  We had drinks there a couple of nights and found it very relaxing.  The hotel is a short 10 to 15 minute walk to either Buckingham Palace or the West End.
We plan to return on our next visit to London and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,24
105,Wonderful Experience!,"Members of our family have stayed at this hotel for many years. They recommended it highly! This was our first opportunity to stay there and we were not disappointed. We have done some extensive traveling and this staff may very well be the best, most personal, and accommodating of any we've ever dealt with! Special recognition goes out to Hani, Chris, and Letitia for their warmth and attention to our care! No stone seemed to be left unturned as far as meeting our needs. Hani is the ultimate host and is a grand representative for this hotel! Chris took us to our rooms and explained the hotel and rooms in detail! Letitia made sure our check-in went smoothly and efficiently and helped with directions several times over our stay. Several staff members knew our names after the first day. During the second evening at the little bar the staff there knew our preferred drinks and how we liked them! We attended afternoon tea and it was a very nice experience for this American. The rooms were a bit small but very well appointed. The location is within walking distance of several restaurants and stores as well as The Tube. This will forever be our hotel of choice while in London!",5,2016,05,24
105,I'll be back,"I chose The Chesterfield Mayfair for my 10 day London vacation because I was so impressed with the level of service at another Red Carnation hotel, The Montague on the Gardens, but I wanted a more central location.  The Chesterfield didn't disappoint.  Perfect location, a block from Berkeley Square and a five minute walk from Picadilly and the Green Park Tube.  My room was lovely and cozy.  I was wildly impressed with the marble tiled bathroom with 24 hour radiant heat in the floor and the rainfall shower head.  But best of all, the wonderful staff.  Adrian showed me to my room upon arrival and I was embarrassed I didn't have British money to give a tip, yet I still got a warm smile every time I say Adrian during my stay.  The bartenders knew my drink after the first night.  Smiling greetings from housekeepers whenever I encountered them in the hallways. Very fatigued after a long day on Sunday, I asked if I could move my reservation from 7:00 to 6:00 p.m.  Unbeknownst to me, Butlers doesn't open for dinner until 7:00 on Sundays, yet they served me at 6:00!  I look forward to staying here again.  The Red Carnation hotels are the epitome of hospitality.",5,2016,05,24
105,Most memorable afternoon birthday tea with willy wonka,This was the most memorable afternoon birthday tea so far. Very good service all over including willy wonka treats for the whole family. Outstanding and attentive service from Marius and Rebecca. Thank you so much. A good choice of dietary needs and tea choices. Booking is essential and a treat for the whole family with a golden coloured envelope to choose from at the end to win a prize at your next visit.,5,2016,05,24
105,Magnificently Run Hotel in Mayfair!,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough,great area of London,with fabulous restaurants close by. Such friendly staff in all the areas. And the breakfast is the best I have had for many years. I hope to return many more times. 
Keep up the good work !",5,2016,05,23
105,Excellent all round small boutique hotel,"My husband and I stayed here on a Friday night with 4 other family members and really thought the staff were very welcoming and attentive .  We had the willy wonka afternoon tea which was fun in their quaint atrium part of the restaurant.  

We met down in the bar before exploring London in the evening at 6 pm.  Live piano was playing in the background and it really set the mood.  We came back later in the evening as well and found it wasn't too busy which was nice for talking etc...

The next morning we enjoyed a lovely cooked breakfast.  

The hotel rooms are nicely decorated.  I think this is a little gem for the price, location and overall ambience.  ",5,2016,05,22
105,Elegant well appointed room in Mayfair,"I stayed here for 5 nights. The location was excellent and less than a 10 minute walk to the tube. The room was spotless and well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. Even though it was small, it was very well organized and did not feel small. Every thing that you could need was provided in the room, even a large variety of office supplies. The staff at the front desk were friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful in providing directions and advice. The restaurant was very good as well, but a little on the expensive side. There was free wifi.",5,2016,05,21
105,A perfect birthday treat ,"This afternoon tea is great value with lovely surroundings and brilliant service.

We booked for a birthday treat and were a part of 2 adults and 5 children ranging from 11 - 7.  We were warmly welcomed by all members of staff and seated at a table in the main Butlers restaurant.

The afternoon tea was explained and we orders 2 adults and 5 children's afternoon tea.  Some of the children were worried that they would be missing out with a children's version but anxieties were quickly set aside by our friendly waiter assured them that they could ask for refills if they needed too.  

Sandwiches were fresh, scones still warm and macaroons delicious.

We ordered many refills of sandwiches and the waiters happily brought plate after plate.  We were offers more cakes and tea but we had already had plenty so declined.

The members of the party who were celebrating a birthday were brought and individual cup cake with a candle and all staff sang to them.

We were not rushed at all and left to enjoy the tea at our own pace.

I would definitely recommend if looking for a treat with great service.  ",5,2016,05,21
105,Home from Home,"I have stayed at this Hotel on a number of occasions now over the last few years and have just returned from a short overnight stay. Facilities, food and service are five star and it is hard to fault this hotel, particularly in relation to the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Nothing is too much trouble for them from looking after your luggage as you arrive at the front door to the doorman waving you goodbye as you leave in the taxi to return home. They have definitely managed to create a home from home where you feel comfortable to live while in London.",5,2016,05,21
105,Wedding ,"Lovely hotel in Mayfair, very reasonably priced, the rooms were clean and comfortable with the usual amenities required, iron facilities, hairdryer etc and the breakfast was amazing, with plenty of choices to choose from which was included in the price. This hotel is in a great location near to Oxford Street and the West End for the theatres.  Would definitely recommend it.",5,2016,05,20
105,Amazing stay over our wedding weekend ,"We stayed at the hotel the night before and the night of the wedding along with a number of friends and family.

I would highly recommend the hotel- it has real charm and style, the location is amazing, we loved our junior suite, breakfasts were also fantastic and we really appreciate all the little touches which helped us celebrate our wedding in style.

Above all I have to mention the amazing staff - particularly Leticia and Leanor who ensured that everything with the booking and the stay itself went well for everybody!

We are already planning to be back to celebrate our wedding anniversary next year.
",5,2016,05,20
105,Warm & Welcoming,"Drinks at the Terrace bar with the girls was an amazing experience - fun, relaxing and most enjoyable.  It felt like home!

Edgar the bar manager was very attentive and made us feel that no request was too big or difficult to accommodate our party.

I cant wait to try Butlers Restaurant on my next visit - looks divine!",5,2016,05,19
105,Afternoon Tea...in a world of pure imagination,"A charming hotel in Mayfair. 
The afternoon tea is a must.
Fans of Charlie in the Chocolate factory will enjoy a Willy Wonka afternoon tea.
Choice of teas, even one infused with Chocolate.
Cakes inspired by Wonka himself.
Clever ideas. 
You even get a golden ticket ",5,2016,05,18
105,"Amazing staff, great rooms, perfect location!","I traveled solo to London after dropping my son in a suburb for a month-long sailing expedition.  I arrived tired and hungry and was greeted warmly and offered assistance to my room which I didn't need but it was nice.  I went into my room and collapsed on a really comfortable double bed with great fresh and clean linens and snoozed a few hours.  The a/c in the room was amazing as it was a consistent.  The hallways were quiet despite a crying baby two rooms down, I heard nothing of the street traffic or my fellow hotel mates.  I went downstairs for a soda and the bar gave me the nicest assortments of olives, nuts, snacks so I just sat and took it in with the friendliest staff... love you Jade!!!  I skipped going out to eat and opted to see a movie around the corner at an amazing art cinema which was beautiful.  First night was done.
I headed by taxi to the theater district and saw two shows, Mrs. Henderson Presents and the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night.  Great seats at the TKTS for less then half price same day but as a single, I think it is easier.  Walked and walked and walked.  Came back to my hotel and again... ahhhhhhh!!!!!
The shower was great the staff again fantastic.  The tube is a 7 minute walk past 2 Starbuck's and the amazing Ritz Carlton.  It was clean and easy.  The walk to Buckingham Palace is about 10 minutes thru the park and a must for the changing of the guard.
I spent Sunday on the Thames hopping on and off and got home around 8 pm to the Chesterfield to another wonderful greeting and a great night sleep.  I ordered room service which was VERY disappointing but they took the meal off my bill without question and I was too tired to try anything else.  It was the traditional fish and chips and it was just disgusting.  Maybe it was just too late but the fish was smelly, not fresh and the breading not cooked thru.  Chips were good but not a meal did they make.
One more night and I saw The Book of Mormon and again, a late night back to a comfortable room and a great quiet and dark night sleep.  
I love this location as it was truly halfway from everything I wanted to do.  I was at home and relaxed and truly loved the people who made this mom of three, traveling without my husband or family, feel comfortable and welcomed.  Will return and recommend!!!!",5,2016,05,18
105,Best hotel in London,"This hotel was amazing, the staff really went out there way to make our stay and my girlfriends birthday a stay to remember.

Not just that the food and hotel location is brilliant. 5 stars all around ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2016,05,18
105,Very good hotel -would definitely recommend,"I was in London for business and pleasure in April and had the pleasure of staying at The Chesterfield.  The location is incredible - minutes to walk to Hyde Park, great restaurants and world-class shopping.   Our room was wonderful.  We were in the Phillip Suite and it was very spacious - especially for a London hotel room.  The staff was amazing - on arrival from our overnight flight from the US, the suite we had requested was not available.  But the Hotel Manager (Biaggio) immediately offered us an upgrade to the Phillip Suite for the same price.  And he remembered our name and checked on us throughout our stay.  The lounge was a favorite with several members of the small group we traveled with and we quickly got to know the staff who worked there - all of whom remembered our favorite drinks.  I had not stayed in a Red Carnation property before, but after experiencing the Chesterfield - I will give them a try.  Great stay!",4,2016,05,17
105,Good classic hotel ,"The hotel is located in a perfect spot in Mayfair. The interior is classic and nice. The room is in average bigger compared to hotels of the same category in the area.
Breakfast was nice in presentation but would have liked a better free offer.
I was not lucky with the person who attended me at the front desk with the check out... (listening skills to be improved).",4,2016,05,17
105,Great location,"Great location in Mayfair. Staff very helpful. Rooms are a bit small, but we expected that in London. Ate at their restaurant, Butler's, one evening. Meal was good, but their were only a few people in the restaurant on the Sunday evening. Nice bar. Free wifi. Have stayed there before and would stay again.",5,2016,05,17
105,What a great hotel.....,"We stayed at The Chesterfield on 7th May - what a great hotel!! Location wise, it is perfect and only a few minutes walk from Green Park station and near Shepherd's Market - great to stop in for a bite to eat & drink - staff were brilliant, great welcome and genuinely engaging about why were we were staying & what our plans were (we were going to the theatre) - we had heard that they have an excellent gin selection - try the strawberry and black pepper gin & tonic - truly delicious.  Room very comfortable & breakfast was delicious - lots of options & breakfast cooked to order with great variety - definitely recommend to stay if you are visiting London",5,2016,05,17
105,"Great Location, excellent staff","A decent sized room in a fabulous location.  Centrally located to many of the excellent Mayfair Restaurants, and fantastic shopping.

The staff are very friendly and will do their best to accommodate any requests.

Surprised with a birthday cake!  

You can't beat the location.",4,2016,05,16
105,Excellent,Stayed for two nights and enjoyed the comfortable room along with the friendly and polite services offered by the staff. The hotel is centralized as it is a five minute walk from Piccadilly and there were many other attractions that weren't far.,5,2016,05,16
105,Very nice hotel in great location,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed at the Chesterfield for 5 nights in the Dormer Suite. The accommodations were very comfortable, quiet, and well laid-out, with one bedroom, a sitting room (into which a rollaway bed was added), and bath.  The hotel location is excellent, being on a quiet street but walking distance to major attractions and also to the Green Park tube station.  We enjoyed warm and gracious service from everyone on the staff; they were unfailingly friendly and willing to help in any way.  Special recognition goes to Rebecca who served at breakfast in Butlers Restaurant; she was simply delightful and took wonderful care of us each morning.  We had one snafu with room service our last evening there, but the staff handled it beautifully before we even uttered a word of complaint.  It just exemplified the professional and gracious manner with which we were treated during our stay.  If I had one quibble with the Chesterfield, I would say that, while the service at Butlers is great, the food could stand improvement.  It's fine for breakfast, but I would recommend eating elsewhere for dinner, particularly at those prices.  Again, however, I definitely recommend staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2016,05,15
105,Exceptional hotel,"My daughter and I had a fantastic stay. The  staff is super friendly trying to fulfill your every whim. Decor is very elegant with nice wallpaper and very well stocked pantry. Hotel is located on quiet street yet very central and close to Green Park tube station.
It was a special occasion for my daughter and she was treated like royalty  with a special birthday treat.",5,2016,05,15
105,Afternoon tea with a twist,"What a treat! My husband took me here for a birthday suprise to the Willy Wonka afternoon tea and it was really lovely.
A large selection of teas to choose from, i picked the organic rose and my hubby had the willy wonka special tea.
A lovely tray full of sandwiches, scones and cakes which keep getting refilled until you cant eat anymore. 
Staff are really friendly and can't do enough to ensure you have a great experience, Willy Wonka himself even makes an appearance to offer an everlasting gobstopper and a golden ticket  to use on your next visit.
To top it off, i received a lovely verse of Happy Birthday along with a special cupcake which was a lovely touch.",5,2016,05,14
105,Charming Chesterfield,"Wonderfully located hotel with lovely ambiance and a high level of service! Very pleased with our short stay-- comfortable beds, well appointed rooms, homey common spaces. The hotel exudes the warmth of a country estate set in the heart of Mayfair. The breakfast buffet was plentiful with many choices. Service was a bit slow in the morning but once the tea and coffee finally arrived, the situation improved. A traditional hotel with all the modern comforts!",5,2016,05,13
105,lovely intimate hotel,"This was a random choice through trip advisor and i am very glad i stayed there.  It is very well located and in a quite place.  The rooms are comfortable, well equipped and in very good condition.  The hotel staff were charming and make you feel very welcome.  I didnt partake in the afternoon tea but it looked lovely as was the area it was served.  The bars and other public areas are well appointed and it was easy to find a place to read, have a drink or have a private chat.  I stayed in a queen room which was great for one person but i am guessing ~25m2.  not bad for london but not palatial.  A couple may look to have one of the larger rooms.",5,2016,05,12
105,Elegant hotel with traditional values and service,"This small hotel is located in an excellent part of London - easy to walk almost anywhere most tourists go - Harrods's, Piccadilly Circus, West End, Buckingham Palace, etc., or a short cab ride.  Doorman was excellent and helpful as were the reception staff and concierge.  Rooms are lovely but typically European small.  

Small things can make a difference in perception of a hotel; there were many that made the slightly higher cost of this hotel well worth it.  For example, we loved the scones at the wonderful (and relatively inexpensive) afternoon tea.  My traveling companion is gluten intolerant  but they had a complete tea for her.  We asked if we could have scones delivered to our room the next morning, and they did - at no charge!!  We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it.",5,2016,05,11
105,London with Liz,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair on the last leg of a two week vacation in Europe, and was fairly tired when I arrived in London.  I have to say, the staff at The Chesterfield Mayfair was outstanding!  From Chris (concierge) to dinner (Loras) to the social environment (Jade and Antonio are most accommodating in the bar!), everyone made my stay very comfortable.  The service was first rate, and always with a genuine smile.  You can certainly tell that this is hotel staff is a family.  And, Jade makes a lychee martini that is second to NONE!",5,2016,05,11
105,Third visit,"This was mine and my husbands third visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair, really doesn't need any further comment however...
The service here is excellent, yes it's a bit pricey but as the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"".
The bar charges £7 for 500ml of lager, £4 for a cola, but it's very easy to get comfortable and be loathe to move..so be warned if you like a drink or two. We also ate in the bar twice.....sharing plates of sandwiches and chips. The bacon sandwiches were very good, my son and his wife also recommend the prawn Mayo but the ham sandwiches were very disappointing.....on the brakfast table there had been some beautiful slices of ham and I had assumed this ham would also be used in the bar meals, what came was thin, pre packed, tasteless ham which was quite meagre in the sandwiches (one thin slice), not recommended. The bacon had been generous in the bacon sandwiches. My husband doesn't like to complain but in retrospect we should have done on this occasion.
The restaurant, we had the best of British set menu, 3 courses, (6oz steak), and a couple of drinks and the bill was £185 for the 4 of us. The rhubarb Cambridge burnt cream (creme brûlée) was particularly delicious.
Breakfast was included and was lovely, the full English was tasty and well cooked, as was my cheese and ham omelette and there was a nice selection on the continental buffet. 
We also had afternoon tea on the last day which was very nice, we had a small problem with the sandwich course which was remedied by the restaurant manager. My favourite was the blueberry macaroon.....luscious.....
All in (and we do like a drink or two) we paid around £700 a couple for the two night stay..that includes one evening meal, an afternoon tea, two bar lunches (shared one portion between two) and a few bar bills.
Standard double room was very comfortable, everything you need, extra pillows, milk, cream etc supplied quickly with no problem. Free wifi. 
Would I recommend...yes of course, and would I stay again.....yes it's spoiled me for anywhere else to stay in London but I'll have to save up again first.....",5,2016,05,11
105,Miss,"We had an amazing time at The Chesterfield. The food was amazing, such a fun experience (Charlie & the choc factory afternoon tea) but ALL the staff made our day but especially Chris and Marius! Absolutely brilliant service-would recommend to everyone!! ",5,2016,05,10
105,Wonderful base for our wedding party,"I really cannot thank the staff enough for the incredible stay we had the day before and night of our wedding at the beginning of April. The complimentary upgrade to the Curzon suite was so kind and helpful to accommodate all the wedding party getting ready. Every member of staff we dealt with was kind, courteous and accommodating to all our needs and the bedrooms were extremely comfortable, breakfast delicious (even managed to eat with wedding morning jitters :-) ) Thank you so much to the whole team for making our stay so memorable and perfect.",5,2016,05,10
105,Service that is beyond the excpected,"I usually don't except much from hotels in London, unless you are staying in a 1000 plus a night hotel! I was travelling with the family, after a long flight, we were treated warmly by the front office staff, check inn was quick and we were showed to our rooms, do not expect spacious rooms, as is the case with most hotels, rooms were clean and fresh. 
we went down to plan our 3 days in London, we received all the information from the front office team and it helped us to maximize our time in London, breakfast in this hotel is a Must try, we had an amazing lobster omelet. there is no gym in the hotel, but you can use a facility nearby ( 5m walk ) 
All in all we truly enjoyed our stay there, and we would . .go back for sure.
special thanks for the special lady from Lisbon) you truly made our stay an enjoyable one) Thanks.",5,2016,05,10
105,The Chesterfield Experience.,"Our third time in this little gem of a hoteL Traditionally furnished to a high standard and everywhere is spotlessly clean. The bedroom was more than adequate in size, beautifully furnished with a comfortable bed. Bathroom has a good sized tub and a powerful shower. My favourite is the breakfast, always such a variety of delicious hot and cold food. Hotel is in a good location in easy walking distance to the theatre and shops. The staff members are  all polite and attentive but never invade your space. Isabelle H Stamford.",5,2016,05,09
105,Excellent hotel with very friendly staff,"Nice and quiet room, delicious breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff both in the restaurant and in the reception. My 11 year old daughter and I had afternoon tea at the hotel as well. Perfect for children! Marius made the afternoon tea to such a nice experience, being so kind and attentive. The hotel also has a cosy bar. We would definitely come back and it´s a perfect hotel bringing children to.",5,2016,05,09
105,Charlie and the chocolate factory themed afternoon tea.,"We are a family of three and booked a Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea as a birthday treat for our son.  It was beautiful from start to finish. When booking in advance I advised that it was our sons birthday and that we didn't want any salmon. They asked for our sons name and also asked if we would like him sung to on the day. My son is shy and didn't want to be sung to, they made a note and on the day they came over and wished our son a happy birthday in a low key way which was lovely for him and presented him with a cake a a teddy. On arrival we was met in our car by Josef who very kindly took out car and found us a space for it, then had it ready out side the hotel on our departure which was very kind of him. Alexandra and Terresa, sorry not sure if I've spelt their names correctly ,whom were our hosts and couldn't do enough for us. We will definitely be coming back.  Would also like to point out that we arrived early and so walked just a couple of minutes down the road to Buckingham Palace so very close to some lovely places.",5,2016,05,09
105,Afternoon Tea,"I cannot say enough about the afternoon tea!  This was our first time having afternoon tea and I had high expectations based on what I read and saw and all my expectations were EXCEEDED! We experienced the Charlie and the Chesterfield tea, which was perfect because we were seeing the musical that night.  I love the book and the themed tea was a perfect match.  The staff were wonderful and so kind to our kids including giving them a little teddy bear and activity package.  Our waiter walked us through the whole process and was very attentive.  It was a pricey afternoon tea, but it was totally worth it.",5,2016,05,05
105,One of the best for a 'fun' afternoon tea!,"For those looking for a less formal and more relaxed venue to treat friends or a loved one, I cannot rate the Charlie & the Chesterfield Afternoon tea experience highly enough. Set in the grounds of the majestic Chesterfield Mayfair hotel, you are treated to Wonka heaven. From the fizzy uplifting aperitif to the delicious golden white chocolate egg, this is a wonderfully fun and creative dining experience that should be enjoyed by all that yearn to release their inner child. 5 star rating for the quality of the food, beautiful conservatory setting and friendliness of the staff. Best enjoyed with a glass of champagne! ",5,2016,05,05
105,Beautiful Hotel with Great Customer Service,"Staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair for my first visit to London made a great impression on me on British hospitality and service!  
When I checked in, the staff made you feel like you were a ""Celebrity"".  I was given a tour of the hotel on where things are located.  The gentleman accompanied me to my room showing me where and how everything worked.  It was great!  As soon as you check-in, practically every staff member when they saw you remembered your name.  The decor was exactly what you get on what you see on their website - exquisite.
Being my first visit, the Concierge was very helpful in recommending the tours I should take that worked with ny schedule (I was in London for business).
The Afternoon Tea was a wonderful experience!  The restaurant staff was equally kind and gave the same great service as the hotel staff.
Thank you for making my first visit a wonderful and memorable experience!",5,2016,05,05
105,Top Notch Hotel,"We had a wonderful time in London and our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was a big part of that. Very helpful staff ready to offer advice as needed, nice clean room and centrally located for easy access to many of the cities attractions. Oh and the gin tasting was terrific as well!",4,2016,05,04
105,Elegant and wonderful hotel!,"We booked 2 nights in Chesterfield Mayfair with short notice for a weekend visit to London.  Absolutely fantastic experience!  Classic and very British interior (leather, dark wood and bolstered walls). Great service and attention to details. Do not miss the breakfast (and order a-la-carte)!",5,2016,05,03
105,London marathon,"Can not fault this amazing hotel. Staff are exceptional. Rooms very clean, warm and welcoming. Ordered room service and was delivered very quickly, food was fantastic. We will be back. It felt like home. Thank you for an amazing weekend.",5,2016,05,03
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"I had a lovely experience here. My friend had booked a group of us as a surprise for my 40th birthday. The place is gorgeous, really refined, and the staff were attentive. The Willy Wonka style afternoon tea was amazing. So delicious and quirky and I was even surprised with a special cupcake and Happy Birthday being sung to me! I can highly recommend this place as they give UNLIMITED food and tea and you can add champagne if you want for not much more.",5,2016,05,03
105,"Very nice hotel, perfect location..made even better by the amazing bar","I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend with my BF.  I read the tripadvisor reviews and was expecting it to be nice.  I was also expecting the location to be great.  Both of those lived up to my expectations.  We arrived exhausted early on Friday AM (after traveling over night from the US).  We were warmly greeted by the front desk team, but a room was not available for us.  We spent the morning wandering and sight seeing.  We got a call around noon letting us know that a room was ready.  We went up, changed, and fell into bed to grab a 2 hour nap.  About 10 minutes later, there was jackhammer noise directly above us.  It went on and on and on....we called down and they were able to move us to a nicer (and importantly quieter) room.  The staff were all very nice and did an excellent job.

The differentiator for us came in the bar.  I had received an email highlighting the gin and tonic experience that they offer.  As fans of cocktails, we decided to stop by after our dinner on the first night.  We were blown away...it was educational, fun, and creative.  We enjoyed talking to Roberta and Edgar, and then later James.  The creativity of the menu so exceeded expectations for a small hotel bar (typically I hesitate to venture too far from beer and wine in hotels) and even for a large cocktail bar.  Having the pleasure of observing them create such amazing works of art (and maybe ordering a few along the way) was a true joy.  We stopped by all 3 nights after dinner, and it honestly felt like coming back home.  We will absolutely stay again on our next trip to London.",5,2016,05,02
105,Doggie friendly afternoon tea ,Delighted to go for afternoon tea here on our tour of doggie friendly swanky places. They literally couldn't have been more friendly putting us slightly out the way so we didn't have to feel that our pooch was going to disturb others. The willy wonka themed tea was very well done and particularly liked the sweet shop sweets. Only slight criticism was that the bread was every so slightly harder around the edges suggesting the hadn't been made fresh for us. The staff though were excellent as was the venue. Will definitely return :),5,2016,05,02
105,Afternoon Tea,"Great afternoon tea, all staff were friendly. Always topping up plates, bringing more and more food and tea. Great atmosphere and got to meet willy wonka, who gave out sweets for everyone (not just children) and a golden ticket to be opened on next visit.",5,2016,05,02
105,Home again!,"Stayed for two nights in one of the hotels delightful and luxuriant  suites in March 2016 and again recently 29th April 2016. Feels like coming home when ever we stay here, which is why we have done for the past few years. We will  keep coming back for the wonderful service from the staff of the hotel, particularly Loris and the restaurant team. The wonderful and creative menu's beautifully executed by Brian and his masterful Chefs and wonderful wines to compliment the food. Do try the flight of wines experience, to go with your meal choice, ideal for those wishing to try new wines without the expense of purchasing many bottles. Afternoon tea is a delight as well as breakfast, served in the lovely conservatory or mirrored  dining room.",5,2016,05,02
105,Amazing Hotel,"

I booked a hotel near the finish line for the London marathon and I was extremely pleased with my choice. 

The service from start to finish was just superb! 

I loved the little goody bag that was provided as a 'good luck' token. It's the little extras that make all the difference! Breakfast was a real treat with first class produce and the staff were extremely personable and courteous. 

The concierge desk made an excellent recommendation in terms of a local restaurant and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms are clean and comfortable with lots of the little touches that make it a home from home.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for a quality experience within easy distance of many of the attractions London has to offer.

Thank you for making our marathon experience so lovely!",5,2016,04,27
105,A real gem of a hotel!,"Just a superb hotel. We stay every Spring for our annual London weekend and the standard is always incredibly high. All the staff whatever their role are so welcoming, friendly and professional. Classical decor, excellent location we would not consider staying anywhere else.",5,2016,04,27
105,Exquisite!,"The hotel is very well looked after and their customer service if superb! The staff made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. The location is very convenient as green park tube station is only a 5 minute walk away, so you can easily get out to see the best of London's West end. Perfect if you have any bookings for the theatre and fancy an overnight stay or taking a nice city break.",5,2016,04,26
105,Great location and excellent service,"I booked a single room for one evening as I was attending meetings at Dartmouth House (next door) and the Ritz, 5 minutes walk away. I was upgraded to a double room and was told that it was newly refurbished. It was very comfortable indeed.  I had room service which arrived promptly, was well presented, hot and delicious. The next mining reception was cry happy to hold my luggage for me whilst I attended meetings. This hotel is spot on for a one female business traveller. I can't wait to stay again. ",5,2016,04,26
105,Brilliant! Superb service and lovely staff.,A most excellent hotel. Perfect service from Reception to Porter and Concièrge. The hotel itself is very charming indeed but most importantly every member of staff went out of their way to help us. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,04,26

105,"Great location, wonderful staff","Terrific classic London hotel in ideal location. Small but modern rooms with excellent a/c and wifi. Quiet and yet two blocks to Green Park, walking distance to Piccadilly, all theaters, Buckingham, etc. Great staff. The tableside ""gin tasting"" is a must in the quaint bar. ",5,2016,04,24
105,Good value for money,"We stayed in The Chesterfield Mayfair during the Chinese New Year holiday.

Great location, many sightseeing spots are within walking distance.

Good service, staff are friendly and fast response.

The room is tiny, but is nice and cozy.

For its price, it is good value for money.",4,2016,04,24
105,Amazing,"The hotel is beautiful and situated in the heart of mayfair. We were travelling to a show in Swiss Cottage in the evening and felt very safe walking around at night. We received a warm welcome from the reception manager Letitia and she appointed us in the beautiful room the African suite, she even called us 5 minutes after checking in to see if everything was okay.
The breakfast was scrumptious, the room well appointed (I wanted to live in the bath robe) and everything about the hotel was perfect ! I would recommend this to anyone who visits London - where else would you want to stay? We did not have time to visit the bar but noticed a pianist and what seemed like a very buzzing, classy atmosphere ! We cannot wait to return to the best hotel in London : The Chesterfield mayfair hotel.",5,2016,04,23
105,A lovely hotel in a quiet posh neighborhood,"We loved the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Nicely located on a quiet residential street a few minutes from the Green Park tube stop off Piccadilly, it represents British grandeur and tradition.

On arrival, we declined a room that technically had more floor space, but was configured oddly - a very large bath, but a half closet and not enough space for two luggage racks.  We were shown two other rooms with different configurations and smaller baths, but each had ample  space for our luggage.  We received some welcoming fruit, a note from the manager, and the hotel was otherwise very willing to make up for the need to move our room. 

Overall, the staff at the hotel was friendly, accommodating, and available for all questions and concerns.

The quality of the linens and towels was superior, and the bed was firm and comfortable.  The breakfast in the traditional restaurant (think wood, maroon, gold, doggie photos, and Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin from the speakers) was delicious, with a full complement of choices surely aimed to please any visitor.

There is no question that our London Mayfair experience was nicely supplemented by our luxurious accommodations at the Chesterfield.",5,2016,04,20
105,The Circle of Wine Writers Dinner,"This was a wine trade dinner with many overseas visitors joining the UK writers.  It was not an official ""dinner"", but a group of international like minded people getting together over more than a few bottles of excellent wines.  The staff are so good they should be famous.  The  very tall Sommelier William was an absolute joy and was so enthusiastic with a bunch of old wine hacks and looked after us incredibly well.  The food was exceptional, the decor discreet but very lush.  A quiet corner of Mayfair that hides an polished jewel of a hotel.",5,2016,04,20
105,A memorable birthday treat!,"I would like to thank all the staff at the Chestfield for making my surprise 30th birthday stay a memorable one. All staff that knew it was my birthday made such a lovely fuss and made me feel extra special.  I received a lovely cupcake with a birthday candle, a birthday card signed by the staff and lovely canapés on arrival to our room. The room itself was lovely, spacious and had a lovely decor. An unforgettable experience. Would love to stay again!!!",5,2016,04,19
105,"""Charlie and the Chesterfield Afternoon Tea""","What a delightful experience! This Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed afternoon tea offers a colourful menu of tasty sandwiches, scones and pastries; all of which can be replenished to your heart's content! To wash it down, a range of teas are available or a glass of champagne if you prefer. Children have their very own 'oompa loompa' menus. The waiters and waitresses are wonderfully friendly and helpful and only too happy to make you and your party feel special. The tables are situated behind the restaurant in a room that looks like a glass conservatory to give the impression you are in a traditional English garden  - which is particularly lovely if you go in the summer. I highly recommend this tea for those young as well as young at heart!",5,2016,04,19
105,Great lodging and location ,"So impressed!  Great staff, delicious breakfast and comfortable rooms.  Within walking distance to so much.  Buckingham Palace, the Tube, and so much more are close.  Our group had a special dinner in the Conservatory our first night.  I recommend the Creme Brûlée. ",5,2016,04,18
105,Lovely afternoon tea!,"A friend recommended this hotel as a great place for an afternoon tea. We weren't disappointed! Staff were very friendly, welcoming and attentive. We arrived a bit early, so had a drink at the bar. The waiter gave us some nibbles, then carried our drinks over to our table for us when it was a ready. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating. You can try as many of the teas as you like. The sandwiches were lovely, and we asked for extra which was fine. The scones and cakes were also delicious. I noticed that leftovers could be taken home in a box provided by the waiter - although we didn't do this as we ate the lot! I didn't have my children with me on this occasion; however children are welcome here, and there were quite a few well behaved children enjoying the Wonka themed goodies.
My only negative comment is that I didn't like the bubblegum flavoured cream in the chocolate eclair - yuk! Although that's just my personal opinion.

Thanks Chesterfield for a lovely afternoon.",5,2016,04,18
105,"Beautiful Rooms, Boring Breakfast","We love to stay here when we come to London. The location is fantastic, many nice restaurants are within a walking distance. The rooms are beautifully decorated, comfortable beds with large blankets, hot water is actually hot.
The breakfast is quite a disappointment, and at that price one should really to go either to Fortnum & Mason or to Wolseley. Better, cheaper, and just around the corner.
There is enough space in the wardrobe for a week stay for 2 adults. The bathroom is spacious, too. Every room is equipped with an ironing board and an iron. Our room was very quiet even with an open window.",5,2016,04,17
105,Outstanding Old Fashioned Traditional Values,"Would highly recommend, we were in the Curzon Suite room 422, 2 ensuites.  Very homely feel, very friendly staff.  In a hotel in central London quite amazing they could remember you and your name!  Excellent breakfast with a quiet calm start to the day. Brilliant location, cannot wait for our return visit!!",5,2016,04,17
105,Amazing afternoon tea! ,"We came to the Chesterfield for afternoon tea on Saturday 9th April 2016 to celebrate our daughters 8h birthday. We were in London for the wkend and this was the absolute highlight of it. The hotel is so beautiful. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and made such a fuss of our daughter. She was given a colouring pack and a teddy bear on welcome too. We had the champagne afternoon tea, which was lovely. Good choice of sandwiches, scones, (the chocolate ones were amazing!) and a selection of willy wonka themed cakes. I also liked the fact that you could ask for more if you like. The tea selection was also really good, I had a hot chocolate and my partner a green tea. The staff were smartly dressed, and polite at all times. We loved meeting willy wonka at the end, he gave out gobstoppers and a golden ticket to use on our next visit. Thank you so much to the Chesterfield hotel for making our daughters birthday a brilliant one! ",5,2016,04,16

105,Welcoming stay,"The hotel and staff were very accommodating and helpful. Our room was lovely and we much appreciated the 'treat' during turndown in our room.  The location was very central for many attractions. It helped that the weather was kind to us. Sheppard's Market which is just around the corner from the hotel was a little haven in all the hustle of London, lovely cafes, restaurants and good old fashioned pubs.",5,2016,04,16
105,Above and Beyond,"Arguably one of the best hotel experiences my husband and I have ever had. Not a single detail was overlooked, and they truly made us feel at home. The food was absolutely amazing, and the room was impeccable. I highly recommend, and we will for sure be returning!",5,2016,04,16
105,Where have you been all these years?!,"After many trips to average, poky, indifferent London hotels suffering from capital city syndrome, this hotel is like a breath of fresh air. From the friendly and helpful staff, to the quality of the rooms, this is an excellent place to stay in London. 
The room was well equipped and bright, and touches like the bowl of fruit, and a bottle of water with the turndown really made it.
If I had to be critical, a kettle in the room would finish off the touches.
If back in London, I shall certainly look this one up again.",5,2016,04,16
105,The Chesterfield Restaurant ,"Wonderful meal cooked to perfection. The staff were fabulous, Chef Ben, Biagio the Food and Beverage manager, Loris the restaurant manager and Rebeca our waitress.  
I noticed that any children eating with parents got extra special treatment, which included a goody bag.

A great place to eat and feel special !",5,2016,04,15
105,The best kept secret hotel in the heart of London,"My room was deluxe, the location could not have been better as it was around the corner from The Lansdowne Club, where i was attending a wedding. In the morning I could get up, have breakfast and walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street to hit the shops! The best thing about the hotel though was the staff on reception, the concierge, housekeeping and even the doormen could not do enough!",5,2016,04,15
105,An amazing stay in Mayfair at the Chesterfield!,"We enjoyed our five night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair at the end of March for many reasons, but what stood out most is the staff. They made us feel as if we were part of their family. The location was a peaceful retreat from our busy sightseeing days but close to many dining options and the amenities were spot on.  During our stay we enjoyed dinner at The Butlers Restaurant and the Gin Experience. Loris made our dining experience special and James presentation of the Gin Experience was one of our favorite London memories. A special thanks to ALL of the bar staff, after busy days they made us feel as if we were ""home"".",5,2016,04,14
105,Lovely place,"Small doors there but very comfortable and elegant.  Great staff!  Excellent selection for breakfast, namely salmon and avocado on grain toast and pear juice.  

We stayed three nights and were really impressed with the lovely accommodations and great location.   The concierge desk was well-informed and quite helpful in guiding us to find good spots to eat and fun things to do and see near by.  

The rooms have a nicely equipped desk too.  Very good stay.  The Chesterfield Mayfair is everything you could want in a London hotel.",5,2016,04,14
105,"Charming, delightful Mayfair hotel","We normally stay in another very nice hotel nearby, but for various reasons chose the Chesterfield Mayfair this time. This was our first stay at the Chesterfield, and we were very happy with the hotel. It's charming, the rooms are very nicely decorated (we stayed in a suite, our friends stayed in regular rooms) and provided with amenities.  The public areas are extremely attractive: the bar is one of the best we've ever enjoyed in decor, service, drinks menu. The service was friendly, courteous, helpful, professional. Ideal for people who want a hotel with character (not a soulless impersonal chain). The location is convenient for Piccadilly, Green Park, Shephers Market, and walking distance to St. James and to Westminster. Really, it would be very hard to find a better choice in London - highly recommended.",5,2016,04,13
105,"a friendly, well-run hotel","if you are looking for an old world hotel with new world amenities, try this hotel. it's central, close to a big park, easily accessible by the Underground (subway) and the rooms are quite big, by London standards.",4,2016,04,11
105,Afternoon Tea based on Charlie and The Chocolate Factory,"As i arrived at the hotel , the doorman open our door from the taxi and welcomed us in to the hotel ,he was very plesent .
At the reception the staff was kind enough to show us are way to the area of our afternoon tea, we were booked in and shown to our table i was early for my booking but they were kind to still have us seated and have drinks brought to our table.
we changed two of the finger sandwiches and they were happy apply to our request .
They checked to see if we needed more drinks and finger sandwiches it was all unlimited which i thought was really great it included hot chocolate , tea`s and milkshakes.
Believe me i was fully content when we finished our lunch ,everything to food,drinks and the staff was amazing.
Also the was a discount the following day but not the time i booked my table , i rang the hotel and they were happy to give me discount for the day i arrived plus do birthday cupcakes for no extra price , i give them top marks for being friendly ,so kind and welcoming .
We had Kamilla ,Rebecca and  Fabio as our waiter`s they were great they sang Happy birthday to my sister and daughter as the day was for them but they made us all feel special.
I would deffently go back to this hotel again for any occasion .
We had the perfect Afternoon.
 you should go there, you will not be dissapointed .",5,2016,04,10
105,Traditional London Hotel,"Me and my partner stayed here for our 7th anniversary and it was a traditional London hotel with a lot of historic features. The room was small but had everything we needed, the staff couldn't help enough and we also had the Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea in the conservatory that was very creative linking every dessert to the film. 

Overall I wouldn't go back as I like more modern decor hotels rather than the traditional and old fashioned decor.",3,2016,04,07
105,Like going back in time...Beautiful experience,"Charming hotel that has kept its historical feeling. Rooms are small and might need an upgrade here and there, but the atmosphere and the staff make up for it. Breakfast is amazing, served in the dining room with silverware and original decoration. The bar has live pianist in tuxedo playing hits from 1920´s... Its a magical place.  Only one thing bothering me was the modern (awfully wrong in this setting) flowerpots, when everything else feels original. Staff were very friendly, personal and cheery. Loved it!",5,2016,04,06
105,"Wonderful place, amazing staff","We were here in London for a short vacation and also to see Adele at the 02 Arena. The very attentive reception manager left us this very sweet pre show treat. Great location, real old world charm. Feeling very pampered. Definitely will return and would highly recommend. ",5,2016,04,06
105,Spectacular in every way!,"Friends introduced us to the general manager, Adam Lake, and from there we reserved three nights at this absolutely spectacular property. Our room was perfectly appointed and regularly attended to by housekeeping (one day three times), and we felt entirely at home in the public rooms especially the bar and the dining room. The staff were friendly, helpful, and relaxed--not an ounce of stuffiness--only genuine interest in helping us have a great stay. We'll definitely be back and we'll absolutely recommend the property to friends and family.",5,2016,04,05
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"I took my Mum here for a surprise Champagne Afternoon Tea as a belated Mother's Day present and introduced her to Willy Wonka.  We had a lovely table in the conservatory. The sandwiches, scones and cakes were absolutely delicious.  We had Moroccan mint tea and pink champagne.  Absolute heaven!! Our plates were replenished and we were able to take home what we did not finish.  Fabion, our waiter, was attentive, funny, courteous and friendly.  Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Fabion!!  In fact all the staff were lovely and friendly.  I do not hesitate in recommending this to anyone, especially with so many places offering afternoon tea.",5,2016,04,04
105,Wonderful service,My sister and I stayed for one night and my husband and I stayed the following night. The staff were incredibly helpful and did everything to make the stay memorable. The location is brilliant and the food excellent. The beds were really comfortable and the whole hotel has a luxurious and peaceful atmosphere. I can't think of anything that would make it better. I will definitely stay there again and the sooner the better.,5,2016,04,04
105,A very happy hotel,"Booked through secret escapes, so very good value compared to normal rates.  the air of the hotel is of a well furnished town house with little nooks and crannies.  Normal double was well furnished with plenty of room for a short stay in a central London hotel, including  dressing gowns in the bathroom and nice touches like a mist free mirror.  Wifi is throughout and free (!).  Location is great - quiet street right in the heart of thew West End within 5 minutes of Green Park, the tube and a short stroll to Buckingham Palace etc.

Outstanding feature is the friendliness and welcome from the staff.  this isn't just formulaic - they were all interested and enthusiastic in talking to us, welcoming us in and looking after us, from the welcome at reception through personal attention in the bar and at breakfast right to check out.  All in all a very pleasant stay.

A warning for the budget conscious - this is a top quality hotel in the middle of the richest part of London, so the extras (bar etc.) aren't cheap, though the quality is high.  Enjoy the luxury or pop over the road to the Only Running Footman or another pub!",5,2016,04,04
105,Willy Wonka afternoon tea,"Had afternoon tea to celebrate our daughter's birthday.  The hotel was like an oasis - quiet and calm.  Willy Wonka's tea was unique, with little touches that made the occasion magical.  All the staff were excellent; but Marius made us feel very, very special.  Thank you all.",5,2016,04,03
105,Willy Wonker Afternoon Tea,"I have never written a review before but this trip certainly warranted it. I visited with my friend & daughter (age 7) for afternoon tea. Whilst the quality & quantity was fantastic, it was the service that blew us away. The waiters were so friendly & kind, genuinely wanting us to have the best time, nothing was too much trouble. After about an hour my daughter was getting a little fidgety, without asking our waiter came over with complimentary colouring books, crayons & a very sweet teddy bear which my daughter was thrilled with. The service really was second to none and made the experience for us. Lastly the sandwiches, scones & cakes were absolutely delicious. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this afternoon tea, in beautiful surroundings in a top class hotel! ",5,2016,04,02
105,It only gets better,"It is said on occasions that a hotel is only as good as its staff, as they can add so much to the facilities. In this case the staff are so friendly, courteous and helpful.
The hotel rooms are well serviced and the beds comfortable.
The breakfast offers an excellent selection in a lovely spacious restaurant.
It's location in Mayfair is ideal for exploring the West End and close to many theatres which is one of the reasons we like to base ourselves there.
We have visited on several occasions and are never disappointed, always looking forward to returning.",5,2016,04,02
105,First time to london,I did a lot of research to find the perfect hotel for my husband and my vacation. I was unsure as it was not affiliated with any chains I knew but it was perfect. The location was splendid as we walked everywhere. The staff was delightful even through an issue with the water being delayed. After a night out we loved to visit the charming bar for a sweet Manhattan. I highly recommend this venue. Ps the bathrooms were great with lots of water pressure and the rooms spacious for London! ,5,2016,03,30
105,Pure class,"Been a few times and could not complain even if I tried. Had the gin experience at the bar and the concierge took us on a bit of a walkabout showing us the different dinning rooms. From the pianist to the bar maid service was impeccable!

One of the best boutique hotels around. Well done management!!!",5,2016,03,29
105,Great property!,"We just had a lovely 3 night stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair. We were 1 adult and 2 children and that is sometimes a tricky configuration to just book online. I emailed the hotel to ask what they might suggest in terms of accommodation and they responded quickly with several options. We took the option of a Superior King Twin that connected with a Classic Single. It was a terrific option for us. Note for us Americans, this single bed was wider than a typical American single and very comfortable. The rooms were of good size for a London hotel room. They were very well-appointed, the sheets were WONDERFUL, the towels fluffy, the bathrooms immaculate, updated and water piping hot.

I also used the Concierge to book musical tickets and restaurant reservations. Chris was great ~ very responsive and helpful and all our arrangements went off without a hitch. We found all the staff to provide friendly, helpful and unassuming service.

The location in Mayfair was great for us ~ walking to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, St. James Park and Westminster Abbey and beyond. We very much enjoyed our stay and would return. London hotels are expensive and we felt this was a very good value for the price, with the level of quality and attention to detail that we appreciate.",4,2016,03,29
105,Quality undoubtedly but a big heart beats strong in this hotel,"From top to toe the staff at this operation naturally are friendly and have an easy confidence with guests. This is no more exemplified than the guys who take care of the bags and of course the reception. It would be unfair to single out one person because they all are excellent. One caution with the afternoon tea is that it is so popular that it can get booked up so if you want it i would book it.
Breakfast is excellent. i have to say better than many much bigger more prestigeous hotels. I might do kippers or a smoked haddock with egg alternative but there are the classics here.
We go for the king classic room which is compact but has every conceivable extra.
If you want fresh milk with your tea made in the room they will bring it.
This family owned hotel had some issues with the water this last weekend. They sorted it quickly. you can complain over things going wrong but it is how they got on with fixing it that counts. They did.
It is as you would expect of this first class operation. I mean FIRST CLASS.",5,2016,03,29
105,Easter treat,"My husband and I stayed here for one night over Easter, which was a present from our sons and included a £100 food voucher. We used this in bar, which was best for us as we were out most of the day. The food was very good there as was the breakfast which you could have as much as you wanted. Our room was good, with the usual amenities. I would like to thank all the staff who made us feel really welcome and nothing would have been too much trouble. Would certainly return.",4,2016,03,28
105,Great location,This is a very good place for a week-end in London. So many places within walking distance and the price we paid was very reasonable. Rooms are small but decent. Service at reception was ok. We did not try the restaurant nor did we have breakfast. Will definitely return as the location is just perfect.,4,2016,03,28
105,The Chesterfield weekend stay,"Myself and my wife both stayed for one night over the Easter weekend. The reception from the staff was very good and we were both warmly welcomed. The consierge was right on and offered help with our luggage. We checked in and were shown to our room. The room was very nice and what I expected with traditional decor and all the usual 'bitz' you would expect from a hotel of this type. However, a couple of small issues:
- The television did have moments of 'delayed and jumpy' signal.
- Initially there was no hot water running.
- Although a double room with a King Sized bed you could feel it was really two put together.

However, within 15 minutes of arriving in our room we did receive a call from reception checking everything was ok which was when I mentioned about the hot water which they were aware of and remedied within the hour. 
The only other issue I had was that the English Breakfast did leave a little to be desired and wasn't as good as it may have been for the £22.50 I paid. On the other hand the sandwiches and Egg Benedict was delightful. 

Exceptional bit

We did spend a little time in thd bar in the late evening and were looked after by Jade whoade sure nothimg was too much and attended to everything includi g making up an Espresso Martini which wasn't on the menu. Really good service!

I would certainly come again and would reccommend to others.

",4,2016,03,27
105,Top unassuming service,"ALL of the staff were always pleasant and helpful.

I had booked a great deal on web site including breakfast and a dinner. But we still got upgraded into a larger room with a nice welcome note. I needed to get some documents printed signed and returned to Australia. It was no fuss at all. Breakfast each morning was a Continental spread and menu for cooked. It was simple to adjust the meal to our needs. It was a great start to a day walking London.The dinner was from a set menu with choices but the manager was very happy for us to mix with the main menu.
The hotel is surrounded by embassies and only 5 minutes walk to Green park tube, 7 minutes to Hyde Park and 7 -8 minutes to the theatre district. London, we think, is not the place to try and book cheap rooms as most hotel rooms are small.Look for good deals and get a nice room in our case we had an amazing deal in an amazing hotel ",5,2016,03,23
105,anniversary visit,"stayed in the Garden Suite, very luxurious with Jacuzzi bath and floral material on walls. Nice change from beige bedrooms. Excellent breakfast and afternoon tea. Brilliant location as we walked to both the theatre and the shops.  Very friendly staff. 
Will return.  Only moan is that the walls in the bedrooms are thin.",4,2016,03,21
105,Business stay,"I was given a night staying in this hotel for a business trip. Fantastic location, good service and pillows are lovely! Staff is very helpful, trying to direct me to my business meeting location.

Need to visit the cocktail bar next door! Fantastic view!",4,2016,03,18
105,Experience British hospitality at its best,"This place brings one back in time when Earls and Counts come to London for business and require a good place for bed and breakfast before going back to their families in the country. This hotel has a nice bar which is almost always pack with business people, travelers and genteel crowd. Love the vibes in the bar which has a good selection of cocktails, liquor and wine. The breakfast in this hotel is amazingly good ,made to order unlike most hotels which have it served on a buffet table. The rooms are comfortable and  the mini bar is free with a good selection of tea and coffee along with biscuits (love the chocolate biscuits). Look out for the turn down service which comes with little chocolates. Oh and do have a nice swig of sherry at the lobby of the hotel. Very nice touch and this hotel is our go-to place each time we are in London.",5,2016,03,17
105,Excellent customer service,"We thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay at the Chesterfield Hotel. The room was very comfortable and well equipped, the evening meal and breakfast were both excellent , the overall ambiance was one of old style comfort, but most importantly the service received from every member of staff made us feel welcome and appreciated. We will definitely be coming back again.",4,2016,03,13
105,One night stay with my husband.,We had a really great experience. The bar had a great atmosphere for our pre evening drinks. Nice touch that nibbles and canapé was served. Door and reception staff all very helpful and professional. The hotel is in a great spot and the breakfast wax delicious. All in all just what we needed.,5,2016,03,11
105,Fantastic hotel,We have stayed at the Chesterfield  Mayfair a few times and we were delighted to receive  a surprise upgrade for our birthday weekend.   The suite we received was amazing and had just been refurbished.   The staff are warm and welcoming and we even received  a personalised card and cupcakes! We felt very special. A very big thank you and we will always  return for any stay in London.,5,2016,03,11
105,Another Superb Red Carnation Hotel,"Booked one night as part of my wife's birthday surprise. We were so well looked after by the wonderful staff. On check in, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was beautiful, homely and very comfortable. On our return from dinner and the theatre, we found a little birthday cake, delicious canapés and card signed by lots of the staff, waiting in our room. It's those special touches that make us WANT to return, time after time.
Great location and a gorgeous breakfast helped too.......but it's the staff that makes The Chesterfield and other Red Carnation hotels so very special.",5,2016,03,10
105,Anniversary getaway ,"We were given a night away as a Christmas present for our anniversary. Everything was lovely! The staff were always happy to help and very polite, especially the lovely man in the bar area. He cottoned on to the fact my partner loves twiglets and kept on bringing buckets over for him to have with his drink! 
The doorman also recommended where to go for a nice drink and nibble on the afternoon without breaking the bank, also very helpful. 

Dinner and breakfast were all cooked beautifully, can't fault anything! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! ",5,2016,03,08
105,Good Mayfair location boutique hotel.,Very nice little hotel in the Middle of Mayfair. Not too far from Picadilly Circus tube station and Green Park. A few blocks from Berkley Square. Would be 5 stars except the rooms are very very small. Excellent service.,4,2016,03,08
105,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"This wasn't our first stay at The Chesterfield and as others have said it was like revisiting old friends. The staff are so warm and welcoming, remembering our names. Even the non customer facing staff are excellent. On the morning of checkout I was wheeling our suitcase down the hall, my walking stick in the other hand. Two maintenance guys appeared, one took my case, the other rushed ahead to call the lift. Really above and beyond.
On this occasion the lovely Letitia on the front desk had upgraded us to a very swanky suite. Apparently the Dalai Larmar had stayed in this one. Fortunately he hadn't finished all the complimentary sherry! We also had two televisions, a sitting room with roll top desk, four poster bed, lovely bathroom with twin sinks and a large shower over the bath. Others have been disappointed with the size of the room and wifi connection. We had no issues with either.
We had dinner on the night we arrived, and were asked when we booked if we had any dietary requirements. What a sensible idea. The food was excellent, and a real occasion. A meal to savour and enjoy, not to be rushed.
Similarly breakfast the following morning was of the highest standard, and served by charming staff.
London is a city where it is easy to feel ripped off, as it is so expensive, and everyone's always in such a rush. If you appreciate value for money and proper unhurried service, treat yourself to the Chesterfield. You won't regret it.",5,2016,03,07
105,Nice old-fashioned hotel,"I've got an upgrade. 

My wife selected this hotel. It was a short trip by a black cab from Paddington Station (about GBP12) where Heathrow Express arrives.  Close to Green Park tube station, albeit it is quite difficult to find the way to the hotel without a map.

Nice bed. I slept with an open window but without a/c which I found to be rather noisy.

Definitely worth going back.",4,2016,03,07
105,A great hotel,"I am in the last day of a four day visit and have to say the Chesterfield has proved to be a great choice as a base.  From reception, to lounge bar, and from dining room to bedroom , service has been first class.

Our room 426 is lovely.  Sunshine through the bay windows in the morning, peace and quiet at night to enjoy a sleep in the most comfortable bed we've had in an Hotel!  The hotel is handy for the Theatre area and much of what you would want to see in London.  Green Park tube is less than five minutes walk alongside the Ritz.

There are plenty of cafes, restaurants and pubs nearby if you seek a different environment but the hotel has a very comfortable and welcoming air about it.

Breakfast in the mornings offers a range of options and Reg full English is delicious.

We would definitely return in the future.",5,2016,03,07
105,"""So relaxing in London""",Stayed here last weekend and what a lovely friendly relaxing stay at The Chesterfield. Staff were so helpful and hotel had such a warm feel. Service and facilities were excellent . Our group of six thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5,2016,03,06
105,Trip for business,"Myself and a colleague visited the Chesterfield and we were lucky enough to have a tour of the hotel aswell as a delicious meal. The bedrooms were very unique in design and individually decorated, this would suit many tastes. The food was lovely in presentation and taste. The wine was fabulous, the sommelier was very helpful and really enthusiastic. The staff were also fantastic and it felt like they were a real family. The hotel had a very British feel about it and I loved it. ",4,2016,03,06
105,My Home in London,"I have been staying at the Chesterfield every year on my London trips since 2007. It's charming.The hotel is exquisitely decorated, and every facility is state-of-the-art.  The rooms are very comfortable and so clean; and the public rooms have really great furnishings.  The staff is so very helpful and accommodating. Breakfast in the dining room is excellent, and all meals are truly delicious.  Best of all is the location of the hotel; it just off Piccadilly near Berkeley Square in Mayfair . . . within walking distance to great shopping at the Burlington Arcade, Bond St & Regent St.  It's not for those on a budget; but it's so nice to go first class, when you're away from home.  Enjoying the lovely surroundings and being pampered by a warm & friendly staff which make this hotel a real gem!",5,2016,03,05
105,Recent stay in London,"The Chesterfield is a 5 star hotel in my opinion.  Location, staff, service, ambiance, contributed to a perfect stay in London.  Will recommend it without reservation to all and will certainly stay there again.  A great spot.",5,2016,03,05
105,Dog Friendly Bliss,"This was our first visit to the Chesterfield and we will be back!

We stayed for a wine tasting at Berry Bros and we chose the hotel as it was in walking distance and then we realised it was dog friendly...! 

We took our 8 year old black lab who was made to feel so welcome by all staff, he had a bed, bowls, treats, poo bags and even a voucher for the in room dog dining!",5,2016,03,04
105,A Friendly Oasis,A favourite hotel of ours. Not for those on a budget but a brilliant atmosphere and staff who seem like a family. Great furnishings and very comfortable rooms. Located I a backwater of Mayfair.Although part of a group of hotels this is an antidote to the myriad of corporate and characterless hotels. First class food and hugely attentive staff.,5,2016,03,03
105,Lovely hotel excellent staff,"This is a tru gem
Location is great ,near Piccadilly,Shepherds Market, Berkeley square
Staff are plentiful and very helpful
Our room was not ready when we arrived
Immediately offered free drinks in the bar. The bar is a cosy old fashioned room 
Staff were excellent and the atmosphere is good .
Rooms very good . Breakfast was excellent nice not to have hot buffet but to have it cooked to order and brought to the table .",5,2016,03,03
105,Perfection in Mayfair,"A fantastic base for my wife's birthday weekend. All of the staff were superb, from the upgrade at check-in as a ""present to your wife on her birthday"" to the bar and restaurant staff with the perfect G&T and cooked to order breakfast. The birthday cup cake brought to the room was a lovely touch. The room The Chesterfield Suite was large and beautifully decorated. All in all perfection - I thoroughly recommend.",5,2016,03,01
105,Best I've stayed in London so far,"It is an old style hotel. It is beautifully decorated in an old British style. Nevertheless not neglected or feels old, but feels very well taken care and maintained. In the room you have everything you need with an extra thought. The location in Mayfair near the square is so pleasant and quiet. 3 min walk to Green Park station. Breakfast is good and rich. Service was pleasant and efficient. Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,01
105,"Wonderful hotel, amazing staff","Stayed here for the second time, just as good as our first visit.
A special mention to the reservation staff who rearranged our visit due to a family illness at the very last minute, even though our booking should have been non transferable. They then, on hearing we had suffered a bereavement, put a bouquet of white roses and a sympathy card in our room. So thoughtful.
Lovely rooms very comfortable and clean. Public rooms are well furnished. Both breakfast an evening meals were good with excellent service.
Won't be our last visit.",5,2016,03,01
105,Wonderful Hotel,"Visited this hotel for our anniversary. The concierge were great and showed us to our Room. The room was wonderful! 
Highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a weekend in London. 
Thank you Chesterfield for the happy anniversary card.
",5,2016,03,01
105,Always amazing!,"I have stayed here once, and visited on several occasions for drinks in the bar!
Just recently I booked for their 'Gin Tasting Experience' and would recommend to anyone. Jade in the bar is just AMAZING, so professional, but manages to be really friendly, warm and funny. Whenever I go in it's like seeing a friend, because she seems so genuinely pleased to see me, and nothing is too much trouble.
I adore The Chesterfield! Everyone treats you so well and would have no hesitation in visiting again, and telling others to do the same. Their Afternoon Tea is next on my list!!",5,2016,03,01
105,A gem!,"A beautiful hotel.  Wonderfully located in London.  Walk to Hyde Park, Picadilly Circus, etc.   Great shopping on Bond Street.  The front desk, very polite. Vintage common room to relax with family and friends.",4,2016,02,29
105,Birthday treat,"I stayed for the first time at this hotel for my birthday(a present from my husband). I was booked in to a double room as a lovely treat just for myself.  When I arrived at reception I was greeted by lovely staff and was asked if I would like an upgrade to a suite as it was my birthday! The suite was lovely and big with the most comfortable massive bed that I have ever slept in.  Lovely jacuzzi bath with Elemis toiletries, lovely bath robes and luxurious towels. During the day the staff put a birthday cupcake and a card signed by staff in my room, such a lovely touch. Big bottles of water provided(complimentary).  Huge walk in wardrobe with iron etc. Breakfast lovely with every choice available.  Beautiful hotel, attentive and friendly staff.  Amazing stay.",5,2016,02,29
105,Best business lunch ever.,"What a fantastic venue for a business lunch. Staff were exceptionally attentive, food was as good as is gets and the venue is second to none. For a short stay in the capital I can't imagine a better hotel. Well done.",5,2016,02,28
105,Never wanted to leave!,"What a delightful hotel. No detail overlooked. Delicious food and cocktails, beautifully appointed room, perfect location. I especially enjoyed the laundry service; everything came back super fresh and beautifully pressed. The Afternoon Tea was cute, in the ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" theme, definitely suited for mommies and daughters but I still enjoyed it all the same. 

I got an amazing deal through Tripadvisor to stay here in Feb 2016. Otherwise this hotel is out of my usual budget when traveling internationally, but it was an absolute luxury to experience this historic hotel in all its glory. Thanks to Tripadvisor for hooking me up!",5,2016,02,25
105,Best hotel we have ever stayed in!,"Incredible experience! It was the best stay that we have had in London and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I had booked this stay for me and my girlfriend as a birthday surprise. Once you enter into the hotel you're greeted like a celebrity or VIP. As it was for a special occasion we were upgraded to a Junior Suite; the room was absolutely beautiful, 5* room and even had a Jacuzzi bath - to be upgraded to this room was absolutely unbelievable and cannot thank the reception enough! About an hour or so after we had settled in the room, a lady brought us up a bottle of Prosecco in an ice bucket and some savoury appetisers! As well as a Birthday card from the staff and a small cake! Was a lovely surprise which made my girlfriend very happy!
All the staff are on hand to help and nothing is too much trouble, truly professional caring people. We went out for our evening meal, but had breakfast in the hotel in the morning; which was excellent; we had a Full English, it was one of the best we have had. Every part of the hotel is pristine and the food is excellent but the things that really make the difference are the staff. 

The hotel is outstanding! We plan to come back again next year for her Birthday again!",5,2016,02,25
105,Avid Monopoly Player...,"We all wanted a hotel on Mayfair!!

For our (first) trip to London as a couple, I wanted this trip to have a relaxing feel, as we both work very hard in the middle of the country. 

London can be stressful, so I booked in advanced. 

What I loved about this hotel is the helpful staff (Yes I know I paid for it!). I arrived very early and I just wanted to leave my bags to look around - They looked to see if a room was free. 

This is a dog friendly hotel and they mean THROUGHOUT. As a proud Jack Russell owner, this is a great touch. 

Room was lovely (nice filter coffee and biscuits ) with a trademark red carnation in the bathroom. 

My advice, try the Gin and Tonic experience (£25) in the bar. Part history, part appreciation and a unique feature of a hotel that is both charming and thoughtful. 

Thank you for having us.  ",5,2016,02,25
105,One of the bed hotel breakfasts ever!,"We stayed at this hotel for my sisters wedding in January.  I can honestly say the staff at this hotel couldn't have been more friendly, helpful or accommodating throughout.  Nothing was too much trouble!  Especially as the vridalparty got ready the morning of the big day!
Our room was nice, but this wasn't the best part of our stay.  All amenities were caters in the room however the fabric walls were a little fussy yo have to look at.
Breakfast was ourstanding!  The choice was fabulous, with every conceivable requirement met.  I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon he first morning which was first class and the full English the second morning.  All served fresh to the table from the kitchen despite the dining room very busy.  It was ably complemented by a eye owning array of continental options!  The ham was amazing!  Try it!  Also so so nice to be served tea in a china cup and saucer. I loved this!  Will be back in a heart beat!",4,2016,02,22
105,Amazing Gin Experience-highly recommend!,"I was gifted a gin and tonic experience in the Terrace Bar within The Chesterfield for my 30th birthday. What a treat! We were greeted and then educated by Jade who enhanced the experience even further. She was attentive, personable, informative, interactive and really knew her gin! We had an excellent 2 hours tasting, learning and enjoying all things gin with lots of laughter and fun. The experience was topped off with a little birthday cupcake and some of the staff singing happy birthday to me. It was a fantastic experience that I would highly recommend at a very reasonable price. Particular thanks to Jade for making it a memorable experience. ",5,2016,02,21
105,Family half term holiday to ENO,"Excellent hotel. This is fourth family visit and each time the experience has been superb. The attention to detail, food,and staff are exceptional. The atmosphere is quite special and full of character. The location in the heart of Mayfair speaks for itself.

The Wrights, County Down  ",5,2016,02,21
105,Fabulous afternoon tea,"I booked the Charlie and the chesterfield afternoon tea for my nieces 8th birthday along with my younger nieces and nephews and sisters.
Upon arrival at the hotel we were directed to the cloakroom and then were shown to our table.  
Our waiter arrived and gave each of us our first drink a ""fizzy lifting drink"" which set the scene of the afternoon. 
After each of us had chosen our teas and the children were offered milkshakes, our waiter arrived with the children's afternoon tea.  This consisted of sandwiches cakes and scones and a wonka bar.  Each of the children were very excited at what was put before them.  We were then served our afternoon tea which was just lovely.
The staff were very attentive and explained in detail what was served to us.
Throughout the sitting the staff were asking if we wanted anything else.
As our time was coming to the end the staff arrived at the table with a cake on a decorated plate and sand happy birthday to my niece. And to top it off there was a visit from mr wonka who gave each person a golden envelope.  Mr wonka explained that each envelope contained a prize but couldn't be opened until we returned for our next visit!
Overall I throughly enjoyed the afternoon tea as did the children.  The food was fabulous and the staff were extremely polite and took the time to speak to the children.  This is a wonderfully themed afternoon team and would be sure to recommend it, I am already booking to return so I can open my golden envelope! ",5,2016,02,21
105,An Amazing Stay and a real Gem of a Hotel,"“AMAZING STAY AT THE CHESTERFIELD”

This hotel is amazing, everything was above our expectations. We were upgraded to a suite by Letitia and Louis and was told ""we hope you like the room"". On opening the door we could not believe the room. My wife had tears in her eyes. AMAZING. Wish we could have stayed longer as it was only a 1 night stay. We would recommend this hotel as it is very central to the sights and tube. A beautiful Hotel and we were made to feel very special.

",5,2016,02,21
105,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"I visited with three friends for the Charlie and the Chesterfield Afternoon Tea. Quite simply - it was the perfect afternoon. 

We had a vegetarian in our group so needed a couple of tweaks to the sandwich menu and the staff were very accommodating. The selection of teas was excellent and we were topped up frequently without having to ask. We were offered more sandwiches, scones and cakes as the afternoon progressed and everything was freshly prepared and very tasty.

A visit to our table from Mr Wonka with our everlasting gobstoppers and golden tickets was a fun touch! 

We never felt rushed and managed to spend the afternoon eating, drinking and gossiping to our heart's content. Having tried a lot of London hotel afternoon tea experiences, this is certainly one of the very best. Highly recommended for special occasions or a treat with friends or family.

Thank you to The Chesterfield for looking after us so well -  we will be back!",5,2016,02,20
105,Wonderful experience,"The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel deserves five stars instead of four. My husband and I had to go to London on bussiness, but at this hotel we felt like on holidays. The room was very nice, comfortable and complete.The staff is simply perfect, always ready to help. Highly recommended, next time we go to London, be sure this will be our choice to stay.",5,2016,02,19

105,Outstanding,"My wife and I visited the Chesterfield Mayfair in February 2016. We only stayed one night but wished it could have been longer. Our room - on the seventh floor - was comfortable, warm and had a comfortable bed. Tea-making facilities were provided, a handy plus. The bathroom was finished to a high standard and everything worked fine. The hotel also has a lovely bar. The position of the Chesterfield Mayfair cannot be beaten - Central London is right on your doorstep. Also, the full English breakfast was excellent. We cannot say enough good things about the place.",5,2016,02,17
105,Chocolate Afternoon Tea,"This experience was for my birthday and from start to finish it was absolutely incredible!
I'd highly recommend this to anyone and would be delighted to repeat the experience. The food options were delicious and we were offered extras of sandwiches which was an unexpected and most welcome extra.
Thank you so much for a wonderful experience for my close friends and I.",5,2016,02,17
105,Birthday Treat for Hubby,"After having a really enjoyable stay at this hotel before, I booked it for my husbands birthday weekend in London.  Excellent service again from original booking, checking in right through to check out.  The hotel is situated off Piccadilly and is easily accessible via Green Park Tube Station.  Easy walk to Oxford Street, Grosvenor Square, Hyde Park etc.  The hotel staff whilst very professional are really friendly and caring about your stay. A lovely birthday card and small cake was left in our room on the first night.  We also pre booked a pre theatre meal in the hotel and we had breakfast all meals and service were excellent with a good choice.",5,2016,02,17
105,Charming Hotel,"I don't write many reviews however when I stayed at this little gem I found it hard not to. The staff are incredible, check in was friendly, efficient and seamless, doorman also very warm and welcoming. We were allocated a charming room called ""The Study"" which was perfect in size and had all the necessities that one would require including a china tea pot, cafetiere and cups and saucers and not mugs which made a nice change. Bed was extremely comfortable and had a wonderful touch of controls for your blinds, lighting and a do not disturb option. The bar is stylish, comfortable and warm and the service is second to none, not to mention the quality of the offering, the gin experience is an absolute must. Hard to believe that this is not a 5 Star to be honest as the service was better than most 5 star establishments I have visited. The GM came and introduced himself and welcomed us to his lovely hotel which was a nice touch - especially on a Sunday evening. We didn't eat in the restaurant because it was fully booked! So I can only presume it was very good. We did have breakfast which needless to say was a balance of an excellent Buffet offering and a very extensive A La Carte, very reasonably priced compared to other hotels in Mayfair. Actually I'm not going to say any more - hotel was perfect and a well-run establishment in a great location and if I could give it 6 stars then I would have.",5,2016,02,15
105,"Great hotel / perfect location, clean, comfortable, charming ",We loved staying at the chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel is centrally located and the the staff was wonderful. Letitia at the front desk was very thoughtful and went out of her way to make us comfortable. The rooms were well appointed and clean. I would definitely stay here again ,5,2016,02,15
105,Perfect in every way ,"We booked the Chesterfield through Secret Escapes for my birthday weekend . I always check trip advisor before I book & the reviews were glowing . 
We got a fantastic deal which included dining credit & breakfast . 
The reception staff were very welcoming when we arrived & although we were a little early we were given our room key. We booked the restaurant for the evening. 
We dropped our bags in the room & before we left we received a call to make sure that we were happy with everything . 
Food in the restaurant was amazing . Beautifully cooked & presented. Staff were attentive without being intrusive during our meal . Best food we have had in any hotel . We went back for breakfast in the morning & again service & food were superb . 
We had a lovely sleep in an extremely comfortable bed. I loved the quality of the linen & towels etc. There were a lot of nice little extras in the room . 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough & will certainly re visit in the future. 
A very nice letter arrived thanking us for the feed back we filled in before we left . I hope they like my review on here too . 
This hotel & the staff fully deserve all the positive feedback it receives. 
I had a lovely birthday .

105,Truly enchanting welcoming hotel,"A truly enchanting welcoming hotel! Never been to a hotel where the friendless is second to none! Service from the whole staff  is fantastic with nothing being too much. This was our first weekend away in some time and we can certainly say it will go down as our favourite yet. The atmosphere is nothing we've experienced before and it is certainly worth paying that extra bit for. Watching cocktails being made whilst listening to the lovely pianist play takes you a miles away from any stresses of the day. Joseph from concierge is such a happy gentleman who clearly enjoys his job and always has a smile. Letitia the reception manager went out of her way to help us and has the most warming friendless that puts you right at ease the moment you meet her, a true asset to the company!! We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Chesterfield as for us it was the best! ",5,2016,02,14

105,"Spacious rooms, great service, good for business too.","A boutique hotel with all of the touches that make traveling a little bit more bearable with a more masculine flair in decor with dark greens and navy. Very nice atmosphere. Amenities have the business traveler in mind with large desk, great wifi, huge television. Good if you want to be near the palace or Piccadilly, or if you are looking for the larger than average small London hotel room. Great for those accustomed to American size hotel rooms and want that kind of space. Fabulous comfortable bar where I saw a few business meetings as well as tourists taking a break. Very comfortable rooms with turndown service, slippers, and nice bath products. Able to really relax after a long day, nice and quiet. Loads of closet space too, which was great as I had 2 large cases. Closets are lit, a nice touch. Slept really well. Complimentary newspaper was appreciated. I saw people in the afternoon having what looked like a gorgeous afternoon tea. Wish I had had time on this visit.
The hotel is tucked away in the heart of Mayfair, but is just minutes walk from 2 underground stations and several bus routes. Easy to return to after the theater. Central location is a good home base for sightseers and close to the Royal Academy of Art if you are headed there. Bar staff was very attentive and doorman helpful with taxis. Did not have occasion to use the concierge though he was very kind and eagerly willing to help with any request. Service was excellent but not intrusive. Perfect! Good breakfast too. Recommend highly!",5,2016,02,13
105,A Hidden Gem,"Just had a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Hotel. This really is a Hidden Gem. The whole experience shows you what a proper English Hotel should be like.
The Hotel is stunning with a real  Quintessentially British feel. I stayed in room 309 and it was perfect just a shame I was only staying one night.  The staff are outstanding very friendly without being robotic and in your face, The two Ladies in the bar deserve a special mention as they are so professional yet welcoming even at 1 in the morning 
The breakfast was fit for a king and again the service was something to be proud of.
Thanks for a great stay, Hope to be back soon",5,2016,02,12
105,Christmas Children's Tea,"If you are looking for a special and very Christmassy way to spend an afternoon with children around the holidays, I can highly recommend the Chesterton's Christmas Tea. The Hotel is practically made to be seen during the holidays, with lights and holiday festoons every where you look. The tree in the lobby is simply gorgeous and the giant gingerbread house amazing. The Tea was absolutely lovely, with a christmas touch to everything on offer. The children were treated like royalty with a little gift for each of them, as well as an activity pack, and a specifically catered menu for the little ones (PB&J?! Yes, please!)  It was truly a lovely holiday experience.",5,2016,02,11
105,Old fashioned service and charm,"My husband and I stayed here on a Secret Escapes special offer . I had been before on many occasions for afternoon tea and gad always been impressed by the service and old world charm of the hotel . I was not disappointed during our stay . The staff were so friendly , interested and helpful . The room was smallish but had many extra touches , and was extremely comfortable . The meal in Butlers restaurant from the Al a carte menu was beautiful and service impeccable . We only live 30 miles away but I had the most amazing 2 days being a tourist in our beautiful city . Thankyou Chesterfield - we will definitely be doing this again .",5,2016,02,10
105,Afternoon Tea,"As a birthday treat we wanted to have Afternoon Tea during our trip to London. We chose the Chesterfield because it offers a Willy Wonka themed Afternoon Tea which made it stand out from all the other places offering a more traditional Afternoon Tea. We weren't disappointed. The hotel is grand and we were almost made to feel like royalty. The Afternoon Tea was superb and Willy Wonka himself even made an appearance offering ever lasting gobstoppers and golden tickets and giving lollipops to the children. The Willy Wonka Tea was delicious. We had plenty of sandwiches, cakes and scones which were unlimited. Upon arrival we were given a very sweet fizzy cranberry juice with popping candy which was delicious. Cannot fault the place. There was a pianist playing beautifully which made us feel so relaxed. If you're considering having Afternoon Tea book Charlie and the Chesterfield and you won't be disappointed. ",5,2016,02,10
105,Professional yet pleasing,"Attended an oils forum with a buffet breakfast provided for several hundred delegates. This involved a range of fresh juices, coffee and tea served from tables plus plated offerings or warm canapés including poached egg and tomato in brioche bun, smoked bacon in focaccia slices and omelette slice, bacon in ciabatta roll. These mini breakfast bites were absolutely delicious and probably the best seen and eaten at such a large event. Full marks to the hotel catering and waiting staff. The conference rooms were excellent with large screens and good sound.",4,2016,02,09
105,To many superlatives to 'summerise'!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield in January and had two nights in a standard room on the second floor. The room was really well appointed and decorated to a high standard with all the accessories you expect from a top quality hotel. Only down side for us was the ensuite because it was adapted for wheelchair access. That in itself wasn't a major problem; lovely large shower area and spacious all around. It was just the sink height which was too low for general use. (Minor point in context)
The hotel staff were ALL brilliant from the reception staff to the restaurant staff and the excellently knowledgeable Concierge. We were really made to feel very welcome and it's only a shame I didn't remember any names to mention on here!
The restaurant was superb for both breakfast and evening meal please we had a wonderful experience with the gin tasting in the Bar thanks to the excellent Selman(?).

Overall we thoroughly recommend this Hotel sited in the great location of Londons Mayfair a good base to explore central London and beyond. We can't wait to go back!",5,2016,02,09
105,A really lovely Hotel,We used this hotel for our Christmas party and it was really brilliant.  The staff just could not do enough to help.  The manager Oliver was on hand when needed.  The party was brilliant and we would definitely recommend it to others.,5,2016,02,09
105,Almost too good to share,"I almost don’t want to write about this wonderful hotel as I would hate for it to be over-run with people who might not appreciate its very traditional English style which is full of old-fashioned courtesies and a real sense of welcome and hospitality. We stayed for two nights and can’t speak highly enough of the graciousness of the staff and the quality of service. You can tell that the owners have great taste and enjoy a high degree of comfort themselves, because this is what they pass on to their guests. The room and bathroom were really comfortable and very well appointed and they had thought of everything – there was even a full stationery tray in the desk drawer complete with stapler, scissors, Post-it stickers, paper clips, rubber bands etc! 
Breakfasts are abundant, well-presented and a real skill is the way in which the staff seemed instinctively to know which guests were in a hurry and which guests had a little more time to linger over that second cup of coffee. We also enjoyed tea in the library and a room service supper, all good and again we enjoyed wonderfully welcoming and courteous service.
The Chesterfield is an absolute gem.
",5,2016,02,08
105,An unforgettable experience,"I want to say about the Chesterfield Mayfair the great team that is working in, we felt very well attended all the time, the people from the entrance to the room service as well as in the restaurant were paying very careful attention to us being to our disposal all the time and making us feeling as someone very special. 
I deeply recommend not to miss such a beautiful and luxury place to stay in the heart of London sourrended by emblematic places.
Also we met Leonor who spoke to us in our own language. Spanish which was nice.
Also the food was really good.",5,2016,02,07
105,Excellent Hotel,"We had an excellent stay at the historic Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel!
On our honeymoon we got an extra bottle of champagne to celebrate. Thank you very much! 
The Service ist unique and courteous! Delicious breakfast too (eggs benedict!!)
Only the rooms are kind of small for this high-price hotel - but bearable in this vibrant city.
Altogether an excellent hotel!",5,2016,02,07
105,Wonka Afternoon Tea,"My husband, two children (9&6) and I had afternoon tea yesterday at The Chesterfield. It was brilliant the little touches of the willy wonka theme just make the tea that little bit different and special. The children loved their tea especially the wonka bars!!! The adult tea was delicious too. My husband is coeliac so has the Gluten free option and he said it was very nice, as he has had some other GF teas which haven't been very nice and the scones were dry. But the Chesterfield ones were warm and not dry at all. The guy that played Mr Wonka was really good and the kids loved it. 
Thank you and we look forward to using our golden tickets soon.  ",5,2016,02,07
105,Quintessentially British,"My sis and I attended our friends wedding and had a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield. excellent rooms, breakfast, and very friendly staff.  Thank you Biaggio for your kind attention and care and for making our friends wedding a truly memorable day. loved the blue themed bedrooms. felt like we were staying at downton abbey with all the modern amenities.  a turn down service in the evenings also!  breakfast was exceptional - hot full english breakfast with buffet of yoghurt, fruit, ham n cheese and all kinds of breads, all for 15 pounds if you pre-book.  tried to save a bit by going round the corner coffee shop to get a very sad cup of coffee, tea, sandwich and yoghurt which also cost 15 pounds.  we stayed in and had breakfast every day after that experience.  also arranged for our cousin with a baby to stay the night and everything was arranged, cot bed all in the room ready and waiting.  thanks to all the staff at the counter, butler restaurant, room service etc who made our stay very special

a true gem in mayfair.  will certainly be returning to stay.",5,2016,02,04
105,A wonderful hotel,"I've given 5 stars simply because of the excellence of the staff at The Chesterfield. The hotel itself was extremely comfortable, breakfast was delicious, but what stands out for me is the warmth, friendliness and courtesy of the staff. We were made to feel like honoured guests, as if nothing was too much trouble, and this was the case with every single member of staff we encountered. It was a special birthday weekend for my husband and as a result our room was upgraded (huge and extremely comfortable bed, fantastic shower over a bath, all the usual toiletries) and when we returned from a trip to Tate Modern, we found a little cake and a birthday card signed by the staff 😊  Highly recommended",5,2016,02,02
105,"The Chesterfield Mayfair,","The staff and all the little touches helped to make our birthday weekend special. I have been to many hotels to celebrate birthday's etc and you generally get a little card or chocolate but this was the first time time my wife received a card that was signed by the staff ( lovely touch).
From the minute we walked in to the minute we left all the staff, housekeeping, dining, bar, doorman, reception were a delight. 
Ten minute walk from Oxford St.
5 minute walk to the Ritz and Green Park Underground.",5,2016,02,01
105,Sue's 50th !!,"We had a two night break to celibate my wife's 50th, she will not be happy that has gone to print!  
The stay was first class, from the moment we arrived and staff wishing her a happy birthday to checking out.  
The food is excellent both at breakfast and the evening.  
All the staff make you feel welcome and a credit to the Company that they represent. 
This is a hotel that we would have no hesitation recommending and recommending with confidence.",5,2016,01,29
105,great hotel in a great neighborhood,"Gorgeous hotel in a very nice part of London. I stayed for two nights during a business trip in January.  Comfortable room with good water pressure in the shower (got to have that!), clean linens and very comfortable bed, quite at night - overall I was very happy. The hotel restaurant has good dinner and breakfast, I had both and the quality of food was excellent.  As I'm from the US, afternoon tea is a foreign concept but I gave it a shot (they have a tea room, it's a really nice bar type area) - if you do the same you've must try the willy-wonka tea, it's made just for this hotel and smells like high quality milk chocolate! 
If you stay here, and it's in your budget, I'd highly suggest The Greenhouse for an amazing dining experience.  Two Michelin stars and it's literally 1.5 blocks away. During a free day i walked to Bond Street, Savile Row, the British Museum, and piccadilly circus, all easy walks from the hotel. 
The concierge was excellent, helped me get a reservation at The Greenhouse and made excellent suggestions for walking around town during a free day I had. 
I would definitely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again, all around a great experience.",5,2016,01,26
105,Apple,"Stayed for two days with friends excellent hotel superb service from all departments very friendly staff rooms all seem to be different quite quirky really very well run
situated in a quiet road about quarter of a mile from Leicester Square very central would certainly recommend",5,2016,01,26
105,Comfortable excellent hotel in wonderful location with absolutely amazing staff and service.,"My Son and I especially enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  It was just in a class of its own, made perfect by friendly, helpful wonderful staff, who really want you to have a special visit.  The rooms were lovely, the food divine and the service excellent.  Thank you and keep up the great work.  A mention to all the staff but particularly Jade in the bar, what stunning G and T's, thank you.  we will be back again. ",5,2016,01,26
105,A fantastic place to stay..,"Having stayed in a few of London`s so called finest hotels, i have got to say that for some unknown reason i overlooked this one, what a mistake. From the outside you could be fooled into believing it to be rather dated, due to the obvious age and characteristics of the original Mayfair area, but from the moment you enter into the hotel it is far from that. Traditionally English, fantastic character, and service to go with it. We stayed in a superior king room which was nice and spacious for a london hotel, and a great bathroom to accompany it all of which was immaculately clean as you would expect.
It was my husbands birthday and later on in the evening we returned back to our room to find a small cake a card signed by all the staff, what a very nice touch.
In the evening we dined in Butlers restaurant once again service superb (a tad slow), and food was simply fantastic, the location couldn't be better, and many traditional pubs very close by (`the punch bowl` being our favourite), all in all this is going to be hard to beat, and certainly we will be going back here again. ",5,2016,01,26
105,Chesterfield never fails !!,"So the Chesterfield does it again - just perfect.

Booked my parents in law into the Chesterfield as a late Christmas present, as I just knew that they would enjoy it.

What a stay they had - perfect service - the staff just seem to get it right as though they can read your mind - perfect location - a safe and lovely area to stroll around, right next to Shepherd Market and Green Park- perfect bar - piano playing in the evening whilst having a night cap and to top it all the comfiest bed !!!!

The best hotel in London, part of a fantastic group Red Carnation - a must stay.",5,2016,01,25
105,Best Hotel in London,"""This hotel is more than 4 stars********""

From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were treated like royalty with a pleasant and professional welcome from Lois at the front desk. We have come for the past 2 years around the same time to celebrate our anniversary and it is always such a treat to stay at the Chesterfield. Green park is the nearest station with the jubilee, Piccadilly and Victoria line meaning London is literally at your doorstep. We had a beautifully appointed room that they call the Philippe suite and received an anniversary card signed by all the staff which is always such a nice touch. We had dinner in butlers restaurant where we were greeted by their brilliant restaurant manager Loris who even remembered us from last year! Glad to see the lobster omelette is still on the menu! We were surprised with a lovely 'happy anniversary' plate at the table which just made it extra special and such a personalised service.  We only stayed one night and upon departure received a warm send off by Leonor on reception and Tony the concierge. This hotel should have more than 4 stars and we hope to return again next year. From start to finish this hotel was amazing. Thank you to all the staff at The Chesterfield!
Itayi and Natasha Chinehasha",5,2016,01,25
105,A warm and friendly atmosphere in the heart of London,"Every member of staff were so friendly and professional.  The atmosphere throughout the hotel was welcoming.  Would highly recommend the ""Gin Experience""in the bar with Jade. Also check out ""Afternoon Tea"" for another treat.  We will definitely be back.",5,2016,01,24
105,What a great experince,"What a lovely place. From the welcoming staff at reception, to the pretty room, to good food and the exceptional service from everyone at The Chesterfield. We had a very enjoyable stay and would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2016,01,24
105,The Perfect Proposal Venue,"My now fiancé secretly booked us an overnight stay here in November and lured me to Mayfair under the pretext of a bonfire night party. 

Beautiful hotel with boutique feel, welcoming staff and traditional, old/worldy decor and atmosphere. British luxury vibe. Letitia at reception was in on the surprise and generously upgraded us to the Phillips Suite; blue decor, huge four poster bed, spacious bathroom, elegant second room and dining area plus great views. 

After he popped the all important question we celebrated with champagne and popped down to the bar for cocktails before heading around the corner (literally a 2 minutes walk) for an amazing dinner at The Greenhouse. The next day we had a lovely breakfast delivered to the room and then a great Sunday lunch at the Only Running Footman - again just a short walk away.

Overall great service, polite and friendly staff, luxury surroundings and well-situated to explore London; particularly easy access to the Theatres and West End shopping from here. Would recommend for special occasions, this is not your average hotel. 

We shall certainly be returning and a special thanks to Letitia for accomodating us.",5,2016,01,23
105,A little haven of cozy luxury in London,"We stayed overnight on a secret escapes offer. We had originally booked for the previous week but unfortunately I was ill and unable to travel, I really thought we would lose the booking but the hotel were very understanding and allowed us to carry the booking forward to the next week. Letitia the reception manager was amazing, in fact all the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel itself is so comfortable and welcoming, we had a themed room 'the study' - amazing, the food was exceptional as well thank you red carnation you never fail to please!",5,2016,01,22
105,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea - better than the Ritz!,"What an amazing experience.  There were four adults and two children (ages 3 and 5) in our group.  I had booked our table a couple of months in advance and paid £50 deposit.  We started the meal with Fizzy Lifting drink (cranberry juice with popping candy) in a small glass bottle.  There was a good choice of drinks, we opted for a rose tea, coffee and a hot chocolate.  The sandwiches were very tasty and a good variety.  The cakes were delicious.  Oompa Loompa cakes (orange coloured sponge cake with green buttercream icing), chocolate eggs, chocolate scones, plain scones, Wonka bars and a good selection of cream cakes.  There was one large cake stand for the adults to share, the waiting staff replenished our food quickly.  The children had a milkshake (with a chocolate straw), ham sandwiches and a selection of cakes.  Willy Wonka himself was walking around and would happily pose for photographs!! He gave out gob stoppers and lottery tickets with discounts for future visits.  There was a mix of young families, hen parties and older women.  At the end, we were invited to help ourselves to the sweetie bar.  There was a lovely atmosphere in the hotel.  You could have as much to eat as you like and were encouraged to take any leftovers away in a nice box.  We have previously had afternoon tea in the Ritz and they were very strict, no photos to be taken and you are not allowed to take food away.  I would definitely recommend.",5,2016,01,21
105,Small but perfectly formed,"The bed was comfortable, the pillows fabulous and there was plenty of room to walk around the bed (often a challenge in some London hotels!).  There was plenty of space around the sink for makeup and beauty bottles.  The lighting was excellent in the bathroom and there was also a having/makeup mirror.
The shower dripped on the bath and someone came and fixed it immediately.
Beautifully quiet, convenient for shopping and the West End...pretty much perfect!",4,2016,01,20
105,The Best location in London- with the best overall service!,"We were welcomed like family and felt at home immediately. From the doorman to the front desk, to the operator and the head man, we loved every minute of this stay. Romantic cozy private bar area, excellent Tea service- super for all ages- rapid responses with requests for plug converters and help with the safe...even gave us great restaurant tips.....could not have had a better stay!!! Highly recommend for business or personal holidays",5,2016,01,19
105,Great Place to Stay terrific locations,"Stayed  for one night what a treat

Perfect Location in heart of London great access to transport links and city landmarks.

Very nice clean room decorated in traditional English style.

Lovely  Bar very good service, arrived a bit early but lady on reception was very accommodating directed us for delicious afternoon tea.

We had wonderful stay and will defiantly return.",5,2016,01,19
105,Fantastic birthday celebration,As it was our first visit to the hotel we were upgraded to suite which was very spacious and nicely decorated. The hotel very kindly wrote a birthday card and left a cupcake in the room for my fiancé's birthday which was a thoughtful touch. We ate in the hotel restaurant and had excellent service and delicious food. The bar had a great choice of drinks and cocktails. There were plenty of details which enhance our stay including turn down service. We would come back to the hotel without question - we had a wonderful stay!,5,2016,01,18
105,Weekend stay before Christmas ,My friend and I stayed at the Chesterfield before Christmas on arrival we were made very welcome by all the staff a very warm and friendly atmosphere. The room tho not large was really clean and well set out  we spent the evening in the bar the staff were so totally professional and proficient I'm sure they could read our minds.  Breakfast was excellent I could not fault anything would recommend a stay here.   ,5,2016,01,18
105,"Wonderful hotel, terrific location",We ( along with 2 sons and daughters in law) stayed here over Christmas / New Years and could not have been happier with this hotel. Beautiful hotel. Terrific location. And just as importantly a superb staff that made us feel at home. Special recognition to Chris/ Tony the concierges who were so helpful with restaurants; Carolina who was so attentive every morning at breakfast and Jade along with  her colleagues in the bar. We ended many evenings with a stop in the bar to learn more about London and England from Jade. Great fun. Anxious to return.,5,2016,01,16
105,"Old style, proper, fancy British hotel in mayfair","We had a company meeting here and I stayed five nights. I had a suite, so no complaints on size of the room, and the complementary fruit, drink, and canapes delivered to the room were a very nice touch. 

Overall I enjoyed it, and would recommend.",4,2016,01,15
105,Afternoon tea is superb,"Cannot fault the afternoon tea I had here, looking forward to doing it again soon.  Had the tea with friends and nothing was too much trouble for the staff, extra sandwiches or cakes were there just for the asking.  Even after our afternoon tea had finished we were able to continue drinking tea in the comfortable reception.  Wonderful",5,2016,01,15
105,Superb Afternoon Tea,"Visited for Afternoon Tea for Mums Christmas treat. The hotel, all its staff, the tea and food were all an absolute delight. Nothing is too much trouble, the staff were wonderful.
Brilliant value for money. We loved it.
Thank you Chesterfield for a lovely time.

Just one point, if you drive here book a parking space thru 'just park' as the NCP car park is £8 per hour.",5,2016,01,14
105,A Merry Christmas,"My wife and 4 kids stayed 5 nights over the Christmas Holiday and we couldn't have had a better time...from the minute we walked into The Chesterfield until the time we left we felt like we were at home! The service, the food, the fun hotel bar, concierge services and the front desk were all excellent. This hotel does things the right way and knows how to treat their guests...they asked ahead of time the kids ages and had presents for them on Christmas Day...we had Christmas dinner at the Hotel and it was fantastic! I highly recommend The Chesterfield if you are visiting London...",5,2016,01,13
105,Fabulous,From start to finish we treated so well for my birthday weekend. Myself husband and son really enjoyed all aspects of our stay. We especially loved the mad hatters afternoon tea! It really is a must if you stay at this hotel!,5,2016,01,13
105,Another wonderful Red Carnation experience,"We booked, with a non-refundable & heavily discounted rate, to stay here after a christmas outing to see the Nutcracker. It was absolutely the perfect choice. Unlike some hotels, when you book a discounted package, Red Carnation hotels make no distinction and you still receive the same quality and service as everyone else. 
The hotel itself and the room were immaculate and the staff, as ever, were polite, friendly and efficient.  I loved all the little details such a tiny mince pie left on each side after the bed has been turned down in the evening. 
We had breakfast in our room and it arrived promptly and was delicious. 
I would definately recommend this hotel, I just wish we could afford to stay here more often! 
I absolutely love this hotel chain and very much look forward to checking out what else they have to offer.",5,2016,01,13
105,Beautiful and charming,"We arrived on December 26 and stayed a week.  The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holiday season.  The staff were all extremely kind, warm, and helpful.   The rooms were lovely and included very comfortable beds and soft linen.  The room was small but arranged so efficiently we never felt it was an issue.

Every night our bed was turned down and we had a fresh baked treat on our pillow.  The hotel had a full service restaurant and wonderful bar with pianists to soothe after long days.  We were not ready to leave and would go back in a heart beat.",5,2016,01,12
105,Great location near Berkeley Square and Green Park.   Very attentive and helpful staff.,"We enjoyed three nights in December 2015 at the Chesterfield.   The staff was outstanding and very fair in handling a couple issues we had with exchange rates and credit cards.   I'd like to call out Chris, the concierge who was great at finding us dinner reservations at Simpsons at the Savoy and the Lamb and Flag near Covent Garden.   The room was nice, although the bathroom was little small (only room for one at a time) - the shower head was in the ceiling and was a great experience.   The full breakfasts were outstanding, with a very nice buffet and the cooked to order was delicious.    This hotel is very well situated only a block from Berkeley Square and three blocks from Green Park, including the tube station.   I would give an unqualified recommendation to the Chesterfield for both business and pleasure.",5,2016,01,11
105,Excellent location for a short break,"We have stayed here on several occasions and once again enjoyed our stay. Staff from doorman to room service were always polite and helpful and registration and check out were efficient and quick. The piano bar on the ground floor is a delight and the service there was impeccable. Our room was on the fourth floor and was well appointed with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was on the small side - I was able to sit on the loo and wash my hands at the same time!!  On the whole though the room was ideal for a short break. The location was perfect for us being within easy walking distance from Piccadilly, the National Gallery  the theatre district and many superb restaurants. We will stay here again on our next visit.",4,2016,01,11
105,"Wonderful English Hotel - Great Neighborhood, Great Staff!","We spent 3 days here in a Junior Suite.

The Mayfair neighborhood is nice and quiet - close to Hyde Park and nearby restaurants.  It's a short walk to the Tubes and Oxford street.

This is a classic old-style luxury hotel.  The service is excellent.

Nice Linens, beautiful marble in the bathroom, quiet.

We stayed here for Christmas.  Both the Christmas Eve dinner and Christmas Day lunch was excellent.  Our package included breakfast - which they'll deliver to your room (if you so desire).

This will be our first choice for our next visit to London.

The only downside was that there was a 'hole' in the carpet and floorboard in the middle of our room.  We notified the hotel.  They offered to change our room - but we were otherwise happy with it (and had a lot of luggage).",5,2016,01,06
105,Wonderful place to stay!,"We had a wonderful time at the Chesterfield Mayfair!   All of the staff were exceptionally kind, friendly and helpful.   The location is convenient to restaurants, shops and sights and the hotel is a lovely place to spend time eating, sleeping and relaxing.    I will definitely stay here the next time I'm back in London!",5,2016,01,06
105,An Incredible Stay!,"I just returned from a week in London with my two young adult daughters. The Chesterfield Mayfair made our vacation just perfect. We had booked a junior suite and were upgraded on arrival to the Dormer Suite. A huge bedroom and bath with a separate study, where a bed was placed to create a second bedroom.Exquisite appointments in the suite and incomparable service throughout our stay. Anything we asked for was there in minutes. The suite was spacious and beyond comfortable. It really felt like a home away from home. This was my second stay at a Red Carnation hotel and their staff and attention to detail is simply outstanding in every way. The concierge and front desk staff were excellent. We had breakfast every day, it was plentiful and delicious. The Chesterfield will definitely be my ""home"" in London whenever I visit. Great location, walking distance or a quick cab ride to anywhere. Excellent restaurants nearby as well. Perfection.",5,2016,01,06
105,"Amazing Hotel, great style and features","Nice plush, elegant hotel. The hotel is set in Mayfair. There are no tube stops in mayfair which makes the area quieter as you are away from the hustle and bustle.  The nearest tube station is green park which is 0.3 miles away so a short work.

Back to the hotel, lovely staff and immediately as soon as you walk you feel as if you have escaped to a magical world. The decorations are all to a high level and look very exquisite.

The room we were in 206 had the view towards the rear of the building (so nothing special to look at), however that is over shadowed by the beauty of the room. The bed if very comfy, decent TV, complimentary biscuits, tea, coffee etc.  

Breakfast is served in the Bulters Restaraunt, again a splendid room, highly decorated dining area.  Breakfast is cooked on request and there is continental options as well as English options.   The staff working in the restaurant are good.  
We had dinner in the restaurant on our second night and the food is cooked and served to a high standard. There is not much more we can say 5/5 for food!!

Would definitely return to this hotel",5,2016,01,06
105,Fabulous Wedding Anniversary,"We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with a 5 night stay in this wonderful romantic hotel. Everything was perfect starting with the location. More than half of the major monuments and shopping are within walking distance, For the rest, the subway line is only 3 minutes walking. The breakfast buffet is top quality and the in room breakfast for 2 was a feast for 4 people. The bedroom was just as beautiful as pictured on their website. The linens were plush and seemingly brand new. The personnel are helpful and discreet. We definitely plan to return as we could not imagine better.",5,2016,01,06
105,Charming Chesterfield!,"You will not be disappointed by staying at The Chesterfield! Nice, quiet location. Staff excellent from the time you arrive, greeted with genuine warmth and attention. Front of House, Bar, Restaurant, Housekeeping; all very polite, friendly and attentative. The hotel has a very warm, relaxed & homely atmosphere with luxury style throughout. Stayed over Christmas and enjoyed an excellent lunch in the Butlers Restaurant. Good selection of wines and Sommelier, William, recommended a very good red. Good selection of drinks at the bar, I enjoyed the Gin that came with Strawberries! I must try the highly recommended Gin Experience on my next visit!! Breakfast, lots of choice and variety. Our room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. Centrally located for shopping, sightseeing. Hyde Park very close by. Added bonus the Hotel is Pet Friendly. If you enjoy the personal touch than the Chesterfield is a must for you. I very much look forward to returning and will definately recommend to family and friends.  Thank you Chesterfield for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,01,05
105,Great stay yet again - Well Done Chesterfield Hotel,"This is a great boutique style hotel, the staff go above and beyond and are so helpful, friendly and polite.  We love staying here and this is now our favourite hotel in Mayfair !
The rooms are a great size and the whole feel of the place is good.  Not far to walk to the local shops if you fancy and some great restaurants nearby - all in all a great stay once again for 2 nights over the New Year festivities !",5,2016,01,05
105,Extraordinary Hotel Splendor and Atmosphere from Another Era,"Located in the center of West London, the wealthier and oldest ""Victorian"" part of the magnificent city, this hotel is just so unusual that it is worth spending a bit more money on -- though it's so much less expensive than other hotels that share its throwback qualities. Neither splashy nor gauche nor gigantic nor busy nor loud -- the Chesterfield Mayfair is virtually invisible from the street (it looks like an aristocratic home), is quiet, low key, subtle, and warmly atmospheric. It is small, boutique. The staff are mannered and not intrusive, but very helpful, from concierge to room service. Bar absolutely fantastic: we had a ""gin tasting"" that was unforgettable and the best martinis ever. The young woman who reigns over the bar area is named Jade Nelson, and she's absolutely unforgettable -- commanding, funny, smart as hell, to an American seems like a professional Mary Poppins: ""practically perfect in every way."" Restaurant not star worthy but certainly first rate -- we had an enjoyable Christmas dinner there. Rooms are cozy and elegantly decorated. I hate to write this recommendation because I'm afraid the hotel will get too crowded but I feel obligated to offer huzzas.",5,2016,01,04
105,A Welcome Smile Sets the Tone,"As an American, let's face it, customer service is something we compartmentalize to one department.  Good thing London sets a standard of excellence light years ahead of Los Angeles.  First the porter at the front door had a warm, welcoming smile.  Reception, registered me in minutes, and I was in my room minutes later.  If it's raining they provide umbrellas, if it's cold they have a full bar to warm you up, and if you re hungry Butler's Restaurant is ready to serve.  A special compliment to the hostess, Aleksandra, and my two waiters Marius and Rebecca deserve something special for going above and beyond they're duties.  Not only did they cater to my every need, but after my first breakfast they truly made me as though they were excited to see me return.  The rooms are heated to perfection for cold nights, the bed could fit  four people well, or one person exceptionally.  I would stay here again if I could afford it, but honestly The Price is Right put me here, and we all have them to thank for this exchange.  All the more reason to get rich.  A hotel that goes out of the way for the guests, if you get the chance stay here do it.  Centrally located in the shopping district of London, tube stations all around, but still removed just enough to feel like a peaceful side of London.  Not recommended for younger people, but middle aged and above will absolutely love this hotel.",5,2016,01,04
105,Post Christmas break,"What a gem this hotel is, great location just near Green Park underground and a very quiet location. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was fabulous. Very nice room, friendly helpful staff and the restaurant is first class. We had dinner there on Saturday highly recommended.  Great breakfast with great service. Definitely will be back. Don't really want to say how great it is as want yo keep it to ourselves 😀  ",5,2016,01,03
105,Winter Wonderland Afternoon Tea,"Second visit to this hidden gem! Situated 5 minutes walk from Green Park station, it's friendly atmosphere is very welcoming. Staff are very attentive and efficient. 

We had the Winter Wonderland themed afternoon tea, which consisted of fresh cranberry scones, Chritmas tree shaped shortbread, cranberry shots, huge selection of sandwiches and teas. 

The hotel is always beaming and busy but yet quite enough to hear the pianist. Another delightful visit! Will visit again!",5,2016,01,02
105,New Year's Eve,"We have just returned from 3 nights at The Chesterfield over New Year. I have reviewed this hotel many times and all the excellence of the past continues as the hotel continues to deliver. I will restrict this review to our stay at a special time of year. The Christmas decorations, especially the magnificent tree, make it feel festive and fun. On New Year's Eve the Gala Dinner is expensive but the food is wonderful. Many courses all special and  the Dover sole was particularly excellent. We enjoyed the live music, always quiet enough at this hotel to allow conversation. On each evening in the bar the staff were very accommodating, always smiling and happy to make any cocktail asked for. The piano player matching the relaxed and happy mood. As ever all the staff are wonderful in knowing your name and making you feel special. A special thank you to the lovely housekeeping staff who work so hard to keep the room perfect. 
The location is of course perfect and if you are there over New Year it is a short walk to Buckingham palace where you can get a good view of the fireworks looking over St James Park to the London Eye and the Thames. On New Year's day you are perfectly placed to walk down to Piccadilly to watch the parade. Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is five minutes away in the other direction. 
We often stray to other hotels in London but we always feel more at home at the Chesterfield and after this visit we decided to just book again in the spring, why consider anywhere else? Already looking forward to next New Year. Thank you everyone once again for a lovely stay.",5,2016,01,02
105,Classic Britsh Hotel,"Spent 5 days at the Chesterfield last month and loved every minute. It is a small boutique hotel with a ton of British charm.The rooms were not large but were well appointed with a substantial bathroom, wonderful shower and great towels. The common areas were very nice and the free hot chocolate in the afternoon was a nice touch. Butlers restaurant was super. From the classic British ambiance to the traditional British fare to the faultless and friendly service the experience was first rate. The breakfasts were excellent. We also very much enjoyed the afternoon tea, especially the gluten free offerings that thrilled my sister. The hotel staff was wonderful. The front desk was very friendly and willing to help with any need. We especially enjoyed the doormen with whom we had many great conversations.  The bonus was the superb location of the hotel. In beautiful Mayfair, walking distance to much of what you want to see, and the Green Park tube very close by. It is difficult to imagine a better choice for a visit to London. This gets my highest recommendation. Try it you will like it!",5,2016,01,02
105,"Classic Mayfair Luxury with a Warm, Welcoming Staff","Another stellar stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair. Not only is this hotel filled with classic Mayfair luxury, but their service is outstanding. Outstanding, like…ordering a hot chocolate with Baileys at the Terrace Bar and your friend says to you that the only thing that would make the drink even more perfect would be mini marshmallows, and a few minutes later, someone quietly appears behind you and places a plate of mini marshmallows at your side. Yeah. That kind of outstanding service. In addition, the rooms are comfortable, the rain-shower shower heads will make you happy to climb out of the comfy beds, the in-room tea service comes with lovely cookies (my faves are the Butterscotch biscuits), the street is super quiet for a good night’s sleep, they have an arrangement with a nice local gym, the location is central, and you’re greeted on each entrance and exit by friendly desk staff, doormen and concierges…and I mean sincerely friendly staff, not just fake friendly. Keep it up, Chesterfield Mayfair…I’ll keep coming back.",5,2016,01,01
105,Excellent,"In London looking for new car in Mayfair so hotel was well located for the show rooms close by, also a short walk to the shopping areas, hotel is 1st class would recommend it for location and value, food is really nice and well presented",5,2016,01,01
105,"""Loved it""","A lovely hotel, everyone was friendly and helpful. We stayed eight nights and friends of ours joined us for a few nights. After a day of touring we looked forward to the welcoming staff at the terrace Bar. Enjoyed ourselves so much that we look forward to visiting again.",5,2015,12,30
105,Butlers Restaurant,"I took my Parents for lunch here yesterday and I have to say it was simply fabulous. The food, the service, the setting was amazing and the butterscotch ice cream was to die for. The Maitre D and his staff were top notch and absolutely outstanding and despite the fact it was expensive it was well worth every penny. 

I hope very much to visit The Chesterfield again.",5,2015,12,29
105,Afternoon tea,"This was my 4th visit to have afternoon tea and I absolutely loved it. The food was lovely and so was the experience, I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. The hotel itself is very clean, all of the staff from the concierge to the waiters were very friendly and polite and made the experience what it was.",5,2015,12,29
105,10/10,Beautiful furnished establishment and the location was perfect! The staff we're inviting and nothing was too much trouble! Would recommend to friends and work colleagues.. And I would personally stay here again. The facilities were more than adequate.. 10/10 🌟  ,5,2015,12,28
105,Wonderful hotel in London,"It was my fifth time at the Chesterfield Mayfair and as always an excellent experience.
The location is perfect, near all the most important places. The hotel is really nice and comfortable and the staff very helpfull.",5,2015,12,28
105,Afternoon Tea,"Having spent much time researching the ideal place to take my family for a traditional Afternoon Tea in London with a Christmas feel I found the Chesterfield Hotel. From start to finish the whole experience was great! Staff were so friendly and able to interact with guests well. Surroundings were lovely and food really enjoyable with numerous offers of refills on food and tea. Not only were we able to take a little box home of the leftovers but they offer you sweets on the way out too! However the food supplied is more than enough and you really leave the place full up. Thank you to all who made us feel very welcome, the Butler's Restaurant staff and the door men who happily took photos. Looking forward to the next visit.",5,2015,12,24
105,A Warm Welcome,"The Chesterfield is a small intimate hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The staff are friendly & welcoming & nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is very good so try to get it included in your package. The bar is cosy & friendly. Didn't eat in the restaurant, as the Chesterfield is just 2 minutes walk from one my favourite restaurants, the Green House.
It is 5 minutes walk to Bond street shopping & 3 minutes to Piccadilly. Love this hotel,it is very ""English"" my second visit so would recommend.",4,2015,12,22
105,Wonderful London Experience,Wonderful hotel with fabulous facilities and super friendly staff. Great location and the best nights sleep in a hotel for a very long time!! Fabulouschoice of breakfast buffet and full English cooked to perfection. Great cocktails and would recommend the Chesterfield martini!,5,2015,12,22
105,Once again a perfect stay at the Chesterfield,"We had again (for the fourth time) the pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield for two nights to celebrate the 60th birthday of my father in law and the staff went out of their way to make this stay unforgettable ! First Mrs Bousbia arranged for us to get, not one, but two really nice room upgrades, then Loris and Marius at the restaurant helped us set a ""surprise cupcake birthday song"", they were so nice we visited the restaurant twice for dinner and once again for an afternoon tea.

We have already booked our fifth stay for Easter (for four nights this time) and we cannot wait to be there !",5,2015,12,22
105,Amazing,"I visited the Chesterfield Hotel with a group of friends for afternoon tea. The service was fantastic, food was delicious and staff were very happy! They had a beautifully decorated tree in the lobby which added to the Christmas Sprite. Champagne prices very reasonable for an elite London hotel. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great afternoon out. ",5,2015,12,21
105,Amazing afternoon te,"My friend and I visited last Saturday and had looked specifically for a festive afternoon tea and this one didn't disappoint. On arrival we were given shots of mulled wine which was a great touch!
The staff catered for our every need and if we needed any refills they were quick to bring them round; drinks or food!
When I made the booking I told them I was vegetarian so was given a selection of vegetarian sandwiches to myself, but I also told them my friend was pregnant, in case there was anything she couldn't eat. Knowing this, my friend was presented with a little teddy bear wearing a Chesterfield hotel t-shirt!  It was a lovely personal touch.

The food was delicious, the staff wonderfully friendly and the price didn't break the bank! Highly recommended.",5,2015,12,21
105,Just perfect,"An amazing property, sensational location with a warm and friemdly staff.  Stayed  nights and they were running a stay 3 nights and the 4th is free. RestarUnt is terrific and Shepard's market is right around the corner with Picadilly blocks away. This is THE place to stay in London. Classic interior and at Christmas time.... Amazing!",5,2015,12,20
105,"Our 3rd Visit, Amazing !!!!","This was our 3rd Visit for afternoon tea and we are already planning our next!.

Service is simply amazing (Thanks to all the Staff in the restaurant). The food is also excellent and the waiting staff are happy to refill cakes/sandwiches etc as many times as you would like.

We have been to many places for afternoon tea (including other more famous London hotels) and this is without doubt the best!! 

We have our Wedding function booked here for next year and cannot wait!!

Many Thanks

105,Welcoming hotel in excellent Mayfair location.,"We stayed one night at the Chesterfield as part of a birthday celebration in London. The hotel is very welcoming, warm and comfortable. Although the room and bathroom were small, and decor very colourful,everything was extremely comfortable with high quality bed and bathroom linen and big comfortable bed.
The staff were all excellent especially the young lady in the bar who was very attentive and friendly.Breakfast was very good, again with very good service in a very attractive restaurant.. Good location for many London sites. We would be very happy to return.",5,2015,12,18
105,"Our Mayfair ""Home from Home""...","This is the fifth year that we have chosen to stay at the hotel for our “Ladies in Mayfair” weekend. The location is just perfect and within easy walking distance of shops, restaurants and the like. The hotel staff are always genuinely very welcoming and really do go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Every and any request is dealt with promptly and without question. The hotel has a lovely intimate feel and the reception hall even more appealing at this time of year with its beautifully decorated Christmas tree.  The Classic bedrooms are compact but well-furnished and equipped and maintained to a high standard of cleanliness.  As single travellers we feel very safe in this hotel – an important consideration in our choosing to stay there.  Breakfast offers a good selection of choices and the Afternoon Tea unexpectedly very good.   We were served our tea this year by Maruis, a delightful young man, who really did give us outstanding service.  He did the same at breakfast the following morning.  A special mention to the charming Edgar, the Bar Manager, he was attentive, looked after us very well indeed and always greeted us with a lovely big smile.  We’re looking forward to next year already!",5,2015,12,17
105,"Very disappointed, depended on reviews.","Tiny, tiny twin room...it had a step to get to the desk and chairs. Shower was hand held only and it was a very high tub to climb into in order to take a ""shower"". 
The bed was fairly comfortable, but, small. Housekeeping was just ok. The room was clean, but, she never removed red hot chocolate cups that were from the lobby, even when it was cold, the next day. 
I have a very, very sensitive nose and could smell mold. For most people this would probably not be an issue. The hotel was a very ""British"" experience, charming. 
I have learned I prefer MODERN, and NEW. If you prefer modern and newer, this is not for you. I depended on reviews, despite the fact that I knew it was an old building. Friends also told me they love the hotel.
The breakfast was nice. The staff was nice, especially the doormen. Location was fabulous.",3,2015,12,14
105,"A warn, wonderful place in a great location","My wife and I get to London every other year or so and we have never settled on any one hotel as our favorite. Sometime the location is wrong and sometimes the price has just gone too high. 

After a week-long stay recently, the Chesterfield Mayfair is very likely going to be our London favorite. We liked just about everything about the hotel: location, quality of service, our room, the meals snd the ambience.

It is one of the Grand Luxury Hotels of the World and we booked through their central reservation service. They represent a dozen or so London hotels and this was among the most reasonably priced. It was $200 less per night than the last London hotel we stayed at and $700 less per night than the famous old London hotel where we once spent Christmas week. 

Hotel is in the heart of Mayfair, a short walk from Berkeley Square and a shorter walk from the charming old Mayfair Village. Piccadilly, with shops and many bus lines, is a short stroll and the Green Park Tube station is a 10-minute walk.  

The hotel is charming--both lobby and rooms. Because we booked through Grand Luxury Hotels our room was upgraded to a suite. Service is warm and attentive. Every request we made was answered promptly. Breakfast was excellent--with both a buffet and full English. At night the dining room becomes Butlers, an excellent restaurant which claims to offer the ""best Dover sole in England.""

A make or break test for us is how the concierge service meets requests. On that basis, the hotel easily rates a fifth or even a sixth star. We had two really challenging requests:

--tickets to a sold-out Mark Rylance play.

--last-minute luncheon reservations at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. 

Both requests were placed with our Grand Luxury Hotel's guest experience manager in Paris. Both were executed by the concierge staff in London. Against all our expectations they went two-for-two. We ended up with excellent seats for the Rylance play and a table for lunch at Gordon Ramsey. To say we were thrilled is an understatement. Our great visit to London became a memorable visit to London. 

Finally, just one of the many nice touches we found. The hotel has a Willy Wonka tea on Sundays and in keeping with the theme, there are jars of candy around the lobby. The staff quickly noted I liked the white chocolate mice. After that, when I came into the lobby I would be handed a napkin filled with white chocolate mice--a small touch but a loving one.",5,2015,12,13
105,Fantastic,"Stayed here previously (Easter) and will be staying here again before Christmas.

Very nice hotel with very nice staff; I would commend the Restaurant Manager as we ate in the restaurant ever night and enjoyed it.  

I also tried the Gin experience and found it to be very informative, I now understand which Gin to ask for and for me it’s Dry Gin.  

The Relationship Manager was keen to help and we enjoyed our stay.

The hotel is clean and the rooms well proportioned.  It has good decoration and is decorated in a classic style.

Looking forward to seeing their Christmas decorations.",5,2015,12,12
105,Very Nice Stay,"We stayed for 4 nights in 2 rooms, location is great, brakefast is reach, and the staff are without exception welcoming friendly and attentive.
The only comment we have is the size of the rooms which are a bit small for a couple with two suitcases.
Will definately return.",4,2015,12,12
105,"A wonderful, cozy, personal experience","We loved our stay at the Chesterfield!  The room was small but perfectly-appointed, and each and every staff member -- from the doormen to the concierge to the bartenders -- were absolutely lovely.  They were so helpful and went out of their way to wish us a good day as we left the hotel in the mornings and to ask us about our day as we came back in the evenings.  They really made the stay a memorable one.",5,2015,12,09
105,Just perfection in Mayfair,"Stayed at the Chesterfield for my 60th birthday.

This hotel is our favourite destination in London. 

From the moment you reach the door of the hotel first class service is the norm. We were upgraded to a wonderful suite (Room 229 Phillipe Suite Four poster bed and sitting room) which was very much appreciated.

As we had booked the Mayfair Weekend rate a bottle of champagne, afternoon tea and a late checkout was part of the package.

The hotel is just wonderful - a scene of tranquillity in London. We enjoyed dinner in the Library on the Friday night which was both in terms of quality and quantity outstanding. 

Afternoon tea on Sunday was just a delightful and a perfect way to end a perfect weekend.

What, however, makes this hotel so special are the staff. 

The staff are very attentive to your needs but never intrusive. They are unfailing courteous, recognise you by name and are just a delight to meet.

If you want to be treated as an individual rather than a ""customer"" you must stay at the Chesterfield.

We loved every aspect of our stay and I have no doubt we will return again.",5,2015,12,06
105,Stayed here two nights for my wedding,"From the moment we arrived till the moment we left, staff literally bent over backwards to make sure that we had special stay. I stayed in the Chesterfield suite with my bridesmaids the night before and they had left us luxurious pampering packs each. The rooms are beautifully decorated and reception are happy for you to come and view the rooms before you book if they are vacant. My husband and I stayed in the same room and when we got back, a lovely bottle of champagne had been left with a card personally signed by all the staff. Such a lovely thoughtful touch! Breakfast next morning was delicious! I had such a wonderful wedding and the Chesterfield and its staff were a big part of that. I highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2015,12,05
105,A beautiful stay! ,"Excellent personalized customer service that makes you enjoy every minute of your stay! I had my 2 year old son and we found a beautifully prepared cot , not to mention a special gift from santa in his name under the tree! Beautiful vintage setup , cozy atmosphere snd brilliant staff!  Oh and did i mention that in our room we found a drawer full of stationary like sticky notes, a stapler and other stuff - i mean who thinks of something like that? Superb experience and great location! ",5,2015,12,05
105,Christmas shopping trip ,"We came back again this year and stayed extra night - so glad we did! 
Duchess suite was still at a high standard and lovely touch with fruit/ card from Oliver plus advent calendar from Matthew with another lovely card to welcome us back .
The staff make you so welcome ,they remember your name and always greet you with a smile ,cheery word .
Our meal in the restaurant was delicious and very good value at £25 for two courses and breakfast had a good choice of food too.
This hotel is in a perfect location for shopping ,taxis easy to get and you can walk to lots of shops ,bars ,restaurants .
First class hotel with first class staff .

105,Winter Wonderland Afternoon Tea,"The Afternoon Tea is exceptional, lovely setting, friendly staff, a real treat. You can have more if you wish, but there is plenty, we were stuffed and couldn't find room for anymore.  Sandwiches are varied and yummy.  The scones are the lightest ever and melt in your mouth. Cakes and pastries are quirky and fun as well as a taste of heaven.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,12,01
105,Wonderful 4* hotel in Mayfair,"This hotel is a joy to stay in.  Staff are second to none and their service is perfect.  Prices at the bar are a little on the pricey side but not over the top.
Room was lovely, comfortable and spotlessly clean.",5,2015,11,30
105,Personal Service Lives Here!,"Lovely hotel in a upscale neighborhood, near many embassies. Prior to arriving, I had returned the preferences form they had sent and sure enough, all my requests were handled. The staff were warm and accomodating; anxious to please.The room was snug, but I was expecting this. For the money, this was a great value for a traveler on his/her own. Only problem during my stay was that a neighboring room complained about noise when I was only speaking on the phone (no TV), which I thought was a bit much. And this was fairly early. Moreover, when we checked out, the staff all knew about the peculiar complaint, which I found a bit creepy. Not sure if this was a hotel (wall thickness) issue or a particularly picky guest. That said, I would stay here again when in London. The hotels in or near the City that I have often stayed in when on business here are not in this class. I have stayed in the Park Lane and Intercontinental not far from this location and this hotel is much more personal and British. If you're curious, it is about a $9-$14 cab ride to most of the major Oxford /Bond Street shopping as well as West End theaters; cabs are easy to get. And its about a 6-8 minute walk to the Green Park tube station. If you are solo, the Chesterfield's ""Single Traveller"" rate is an excellent value for this location. I found this rate on Trip Advisor.",5,2015,11,30
105,Service Plus,"I have walked past the Chesterfield on many occasions and  was surprised when my team booked me in for a one night stay when recently visiting London on business. I was due to arrive late but my plans changed at the last minute and the hotel could not have been more accommodating in insuring that my room was ready and that I had every convenience required.  As it was Thanksgiving the ground floor was busy welcoming visitors to enjoy the festive fair but the front desk team were especially helpful in insuring that I was prepared for my evening event with a map of directions, timings and one even produced a new bag to replace a rather tatty carrier bag I had brought to carry a package for my evening out. From the doorman who greeted me to the receptionist who check me in and then phoned my room after I had arrived to check that I was comfortable, to the room attendant I met in the corridor they were all friendly, helpful and made my stay at the Chesterfield stand out and will insure that in future it will be  a requested destination not a destination of luck!",5,2015,11,30
105,"Great Location, Lumpy Bed","I've been to London several times, but never stayed in the Mayfair area. The Chesterfield is a great location for walkers as it is 1.5 miles or less to the theater district, Covent Garden, Hyde Park, Westminster, museums, shopping, galleries, and more. It is also close to the Green Park tube station. The Piccadilly line runs all the way to Heathrow airport.

The hotel is located on a quiet street just a few blocks from Piccadilly. I slept in late every day and was not disturbed by the housekeeping staff. They must have waited to vacuum the hallway until after I left each day. I also never heard loud maid chatter as I have in other hotels. 

The room, while small, was a miniature study in luxury—luxurious bed linens, thick light-blocking drapes, wood desk and chair, attractive wall paper, and ample storage space.  It was, however, lacking in floor space. If you use a walking aid or are a particularly large person, you might find the quarters a bit tight. 

I booked a superior king, but the ""king"" bed turned out to be a zipped king. It's not really a king bed, but two twin beds pushed together. Some sort of linen is placed to cover the gap between the two beds. What results is a bed that looks large, but has an unsleepable center section. The center is lumpy and hard. This particular bed had an uphill slope from my side to the center. I quickly learned to sleep near the edge of the bed. Once I learned that, I got a decent sleep. Being that the bed is not a true king, it is short. If you are taller than average, you will find your feet hang over the edge of the bed. 

The room was warm which made the heavy duvet that was on the bed quite unnecessary. I got housekeeping to leave a simple sheet. Otherwise it would have been too hot to sleep. In fact, on the first night when I had only the thick duvet, I had to turn off the heat and open the window. There is also a heavy bedspread that I had to toss into the corner of the room each night. Otherwise, I found it slipped off the bed blocking the passageway to the bathroom, thus creating  a tripping hazard.

The bathroom was sparkling clean and marble lined. The heated floor was delightful. Like the bedroom, the bathroom was lacking in floor space. It's a tight fit for one person. The shower had ample hot water and flow, but it is a converted tub, and a narrow tub at that. The towels and robes were thick terry cloth. If you prefer bar soap, you'll have to share one bar between the shower and the sink, as housekeeping seems to want everyone to use liquid soap.

The tea setup in the room is wonderful. It includes a teapot, a French coffee press, biscuits, and a  selection of hot drinks (ground coffee, instant coffee, several teas, and hot chocolate). If you don't like the skimmed milk that's provided, you can have cream delivered.

I did not take advantage of the complimentary shoe shining, as there was a shoe shining kit in the room. 

Despite the lumpy bed, the Chesterfield is a good value in Mayfair. Next time, I might try a double bed.",4,2015,11,29
105,Here for afternoon tea,"I'm so pleased that I found the Chesterfield as an option for Afternoon Tea in London. From the initial enquiry by phone, to the greeting at the door on arrival to the winder full tea, the experience could not be faulted. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle yet very convenient for Regent Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street.
Unlike some others, there is a generous two hour allowance for the table but we know that we could have lingered longer if we'd wished.
Sandwiches, scones and cakes were excellent and frequently replenished.
Another of those experiences where you're not sure you want to share but keep to yourself.",5,2015,11,29
105,Afternoon tea - above and beyond...,"A truly wonderful start to the festive season with the Chesterfield's Christmas afternoon tea - from entering the main hotel entrance we were made to feel welcome, in a special yet unpretentious and very comfortable environment. The decor is very grand and traditional, yet warm and homely - it reminded me of something out of a Christmas film to see a dad running round the corridors with his young children!

Our waitress was delightful - explaining the sandwiches and pastries in detail, and smiley and enthusiastic throughout.  All the food is replenishable at your request and our waitress came round on numerous occasions to try and encourage us to eat more food, even insisting that we left with a goody bag of treats because she didn't think we had eaten enough during our visit! We did use her generosity to our advantage, managing to blag another round of mulled wine ""shots""! 

Our reservation was for 2pm and upon being seated we were told that they required the table back after 2 hours, though our waitress was still offering us more food at 4pm and no one seemed in a hurry for us to leave.  The whole afternoon was very relaxed - there was time to enjoy the surroundings and company before tea was brought out and just the right interval before the food stand then appeared. The pianist playing in the background provided a lovely backdrop to proceedings. 

Overall, a wonderful experience and great value for money given the ""all you can eat"" arrangement - I should mention at this point that the quality of edibles was second to none - soft sandwiches, delicious sweet treats and the BEST scones I've had at any afternoon tea! Can't wait to go back to see what's in my secret envelope...",5,2015,11,28
105,Best hotel we have stayed in in London,"From the first moment you walk into this hotel you know its going to be good, and the friendly and personal service you get certainly proves this.

The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and well maintained. Being at the front of the hotel we thought it might be a little noisy but owing to the hotels location it was remarkably quiet.

The room service menu is extensive and delicious and the ordering and delivery system really excellent.

Its true to say we enjoyed every moment of our 3 night stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2015,11,26
105,Excellent stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We had booked a small room with a king size bed, but upon arrival were upgraded to a suite which was large and had 2 full sized bathrooms.

The room itself was very nice, with a very pretty and comfortable bed and pillows.  The 2 bathrooms were really nice, with comfie tubs and even a bath pillow in one.  The amenities were plentiful but my husband thought they smelled too girlie.  

We had a fridge in our room and we were able to take some of the items out (without being charged) so we could make space for milk and juice.  There was a Sainsburys grocery store about a five minute walk away so we bought some drinks and snacks there, which was convenient, especially as we did not want to pay the asking price for breakfast at the hotel.  We happily ate our breakfast cereal in the room.  When we arrived we had supper in the hotel lounge.  As it was past 10:30 pm London time (5:30 pm our time!) only sandwiches were available, but they were tasty and the service was good.

We had one sweater and 2 sets of pyjamas laundered by the hotel and it cost 30 pounds, which was expensive by even hotel standards, but we were aware of the price prior to sending the clothes out.  Otherwise, I washed out some clothes by hand and hung them on the towel driers, which worked well.

The location of the hotel is good. We had a fun morning wandering around St James Park and Green Park which are so close.  We were able to walk to them within a few minutes.  Buckingham Palace was also a short walk away.  It took us about 15 minutes to walk to Hyde Park for the Winter Wonderland, and about 40 minutes to walk to the Tower of London.  

We did take the underground and the Green Park station was really close to the hotel, about a five minute walk away.

There weren't a lot of restaurants on the block of the hotel, but we did go to a recommended pub (The Only Running Footman?) for fish and chips and it was OK.  Our friends came to visit and we wandered with them a few minutes away to the Mount Street area and found a number of nice pubs there, which I think were a lot better.

The staff at the Mayfair were excellent and very friendly and helpful.  The room was cleaned and made up well - just a few minor things I'd recommend some attention to ie the toilet wasn't always cleaned each day, and cookies were not replaced at the mini bar.  The bath salts ran low without being replenished.  All in all, these were just very minor inconveniences.

The wifi was incluced and worked well in our room.

The taxi ride to and from the hotel was expensive at about 60 pounds in each direction, but we didn't want to take the underground or Heathrow express with our luggage.

All in all, we had a very good stay here and were really pleased that the hotel provided us with an upgraded room.

We would stay here again.",5,2015,11,25
105,LOVED IT!,"As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. 
What can I say, this is now my new London fav. Its a very high end boutique hotel located in Mayfair. Very short walk to the tube. If you know Mayfair its packed with great little stores and restaurant. Vincent at the front desk went above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. The young man was clearly trained well and understand what it takes to deliver good customer service. 
The room was large for Europe and was very comfortable. It was in a very decorated in a ""ritz"" style. We had one meal dinner in their restaurant and it was wonderful, we had breakfast daily while we were there and were never left disappointed. We did the high tea which was cute but expensive but still very good. Overall I will 100% return to this location.",5,2015,11,24
105,"""Classic"" as a synonym for slightly shabby","Yes, this hotel is in a top-notch neighborhood. And yes, if you can get into it, the decor is what you might think of as classic ""Brit"" -- all fabric wainscoting, crown moldings and ""royal red"" carpet with plenty of wood thrown in for that ""downtown club for rich old men” feel.

But I really don't like the style -- it makes me claustrophobic. And, in the case of the Chesterfield Mayfair, this ""classic"" look is primarily an excuse for being slightly shabby. Not weathered...but just this side of too worn to be top notch. Scratches all over the wood furniture, discolored-from-use upholstery on the depressingly “office” roller chair in the room, dimly lighted closets, dated TVs, skimpy towels and exposed picture hooks on the walls make calling this hotel a four star property a stretch.

Even if you pre-pay for the room (as we did) upon arrival the staff informs you of a £50/day hold on a credit card for incidentals. I don't mind that as much as the ""offer"" of charging those incidentals in USD -- meaning the hotel gets to knick you for a few extra basis points. It cheapens the experience -- and summarizes the initial impressions of the hotel. Luxury hotels should offer real conveniences and service -- not something thinly disguised as a perk that simply lines their pockets.

Don't get me wrong -- the room is clean and for London you could call the room spacious. There is room (barely) for two people to get dressed in front of the bed. But next time I’m in London, I wouldn’t go out of my way to stay here.",3,2015,11,24
105,Beautiful and Fabulous Hotel,"We have just spent the most splendid Birthady at the Chesterfied Mayfair. We stayed to mark a wedding anniversary and a birthday and the staff couldn't have done more to make it a special occasion - an upgrade to a fantastic suite 
From our  arrival to the end of our stay everything was perfect.Checkin was efficient and helpful and the welcome was more than warm. Our Junior suite ( free upgrade) was lovely , immaculately clean and so comfortable.  
We enjoyed the afternoon tea and the service ensured we were well looked after yet still had the privacy we wanted. What a great experience ! The food was fabulous and the staff so informative and welcoming.
 Lovely assortment of sandwiches, freshly baked scones with delicious homemade jams followed by some really amazing selection of cakes. 
This hotel is outstanding , the staff are the friendliest I have ever known and also a big thanks to 
Laetitia,Roberta,Lois,Cristina,Wasim and all Chesterfield Family !

Everyone at this hotel seems so happy all the time, giving out positive vibes to everyone.

105,Fun Filled Afternoon,"Recently visited the hotel for afternoon tea with family and friends, whether its for a special occasion or not the staff make it special.  Very attentive and cheerful service. Great selection of sandwiches and scones, the pastries were fun and fabulous. Delightful Willy Wonka theme.For a truly English afternoon tea experience visit The Chesterfield Hotel.",5,2015,11,23
105,Old time understated elegance with a perfect human touch,"I did not stay at the hotel, but I visited a few weeks ago for an evening function. The entrance of the hotel is discreet, but elegant, as is the entire building. The lobby feels like a living room in a stately home. The welcome by the reception staff was warm and inviting. The function itself was very pleasant and the food and drinks provided were both aplenty and of the highest quality. There are many five star hotels in London, but this one definitely deserves it. 
Hope to come back one day for a stay!",5,2015,11,22
105,What a fabulous hotel,"Stayed at the Chesterfield for a couple of nights and what an experience! A truly wonderful hotel, very grand and we couldn't fault the staff at all. They couldn't do enough for us. We will definitely come here again when we next stay in London. Thank you for making our stay extremely enjoyable.",5,2015,11,22
105,Amazing,We stayed for our wedding in Mayfair. Everything was beautiful. We were made to feel so welcome. Perfect. We'll be back. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so lovely (especially Leticia - front desk). Cannot recommend The Chesterfield enough. Thank you,5,2015,11,22
105,OMG - wonderful,"What a fabulous hotel. Could not fault anything and although I do tend to only review things I have enjoyed (bad habit I know but I always hope any negative experience we have will be immediately corrected without having to go "" public"") this hotel tops the lot ! Fantastic. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a junior suite which was gorgeous, the staff, without exception, could not do enough for you, professional, warm, friendly, knowledgeable, the breakfast both in the restaurant and room service was excellent. We were in town for a wedding and some friends staying at a 5 star around the corner, were nowhere near as satisfied with their hotel as we were and I am the fussy one ! Will be our first choice hotel for London from now on.",5,2015,11,17
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,Our party consisted of 8 adults and 4 young children. We were made to feel very welcome and the service was first class. In addition we could have as much to eat and drink as we wanted and our food stands and teapots etc were refilled when required. This is a charming hotel with charming and very efficient staff. This was a tea for the children but equally enjoyed by the parents and grandparents. Highly recommended.,5,2015,11,16
105,You couldn't ask for better service,"It is wonderful to be made to feel welcome and the Chesterfield did it in spades - the front desk, the concierge, the wait staff, and the bar tender. The room was a little small, but it is London and I knew that when I booked. Location is fine with loads of spots in Shepards Market only a block away. The Piccadilly line is a reasonable walk, so you have access to the whole city and taxis  seemed to always be available. 
If you are looking for a charming hotel with excellent service, you have one here.",5,2015,11,15
105,Excellent as ever!,Just returned from another superb stay at this lovely hotel. This was a weekend birthday treat and the Chesterfield was fabulous as always. The location is perfect staff so welcoming and helpful the rooms are great food wonderful just cannot fault it. The only place to stay in central London!!,5,2015,11,15
105,Great location and very professional service,"if you are in London this is a great location very central, the staff and restaurant team are very professional, nice old design, the bar is very cosy and enjoyable area, I went there a few times for dinner, good food, always happy to get there when I'm in town",5,2015,11,15
105,Charming London Stay,"If you're looking for a charming, luxurious escape in the lovely Mayfair.... Look no further! 

Extremely welcoming, polite, courteous and helpful staff; beautiful bar, restaurant and bedrooms; delicious food and a great location.... Perfect in every way. 

Thank you for such a wonderful experience!!! 

",5,2015,11,12
105,A gem of a hotel in the heart of London,"The Chesterfield is my first choice of hotels in London. It is small and intimate and you instantly feel at home amongst the warm and friendly staff.
Whilst there are grander and more luxurious hotels in London, it's the small things that makes the Chesterfield special. Any request is met with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. I will be back again and again
",5,2015,11,11
105,1st year wedding anniversary,"Yet another amazing stay and dinner at the Chesterfield! One of the best nights stay and dinners! They made our first year wedding anniversary one to remember. The room was perfect accompanied by a perfect dinner. Definatly recommend the scallop starter! And try the quirky ""ice ball cocktail"" we had to crack the ball of ice to release the cocktail such a nice touch. I cannot recommend this place enough if your in London you have to go!! Thank you again for a great evening",5,2015,11,11
105,Excellence Repeated,"So, here we are basking in one of the glorious rooms on the third floor of The Chesterfield Mayfair. My lovely girlfriend and I have just experienced the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea, for the second time. It was never in any doubt, we expected it to be as splendid as it was in February 15, and the whole team delivered perfection on a plate once more. Seductive sandwiches (and generous refills), were followed by the lightest, most delicious scones accompanied by jamazing jam and triumphant clotted cream. Then the imagination of Mr Wonka himself was channeled into the giggle-making cupcakes, bubblegum eclairs, golden chocolate egg, fruit filled tartlets and magnificent macaron. There are no faults to identify here, Butler's Restaurant staff are second to none and give you that warm feeling of welcome throughout the visit. We were smart to come to the Mayfair Chesterfield, we were super-smart to return. Feeling very happy, can't wait for breakfast tomorrow. ",5,2015,11,07
105,Very friendly and professional,"Our room was a little too small, but very well appointed and comfortable.
The restaurant and its personnel were excellent. Great food and service.
We enjoyed hanging out at the bar after a long day sight seeing or after theatre.",4,2015,11,06
105,The Terrace Bar at the Chesterfield Hotel  is a London gem!,We love the Red Carnation group of hotels; they really get customer service and deliver it with understated elegance every time! While we weren’t staying at the Chesterfield Hotel we did take the opportunity to stop in at the Terrace Bar for a relaxed light lunch. The bar tender was delightful and seemed to make every customer feel important and welcomed. What could be better for a brief respite from sightseeing!,5,2015,11,06
105,Many thanks to the caravan club,"We spent a fantastic afternoon at the Chesterfield. The caravan club put on a superb treat for some of their site owners and could not have found a better venue! 
The warm welcome , friendly attentive staff and classy decor are 2nd to none. The food was the best we have ever eaten and it was a pity it had to come to an end.
Hopefully we will be able to return one day, many thanks.",5,2015,11,05
105,Afternoon tea,"Came for afternoon tea, and was lovely, couldn't fault anything! We had free complementary champagne as our food was slow, but in fairness we didn't think it was slow. 
Food, service were amazing would definitely go back. 

Were seated on time, hotel easy to find as well. ",5,2015,11,04
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair...A Gem,I spent 7 nights here and could not have been happier. The staff were all cheerful and helpful. Excellent location in the heart of Mayfair. About a quarter mile from the Green Park tube stop on the Piccadilly line made for an easy trip from Heathrow. Welcome fruit and a farewell cupcake!,5,2015,11,04
105,Disappointed,"Having stayed at the sister Hotel The Rueben, I was not expecting a small room in which the bed extended within 3 feet of the desk ...No room for a chair therefor had to use the bed to read the newspaper...Chair at the desk had to be turned sideways to use to put my shoes on my feet..Also, the room was not fresh and my traveling companions had the same experience...Both of us tried to change rooms with no success ...The Hotel is well located,the staff is great but be sure you know your room prior to arriving",3,2015,11,03
105,Weekend break for shows at the Royal Albert Hall,Enjoyed my stay at the Chesterfield. Staff very pleasant and room fine although not much of a view as it was at the rear of the hotel. It was very quiet though and peaceful. Location is very good as it is a ten minute walk at best from Green Park Station and the buses that go down Piccadilly. As a female travelling alone I like hotels that I feel comfortable getting to especially in the evening. I would definitely stay again.,4,2015,10,31
105,Enjoyed our 1 week stay,"My wife and I spent 7 nights at Chesterfield in Mayfair.  The room was a bit small and lacked a view but very comfortable.  We truly enjoyed the staff, breakfast, pub, convenient location and strong wi-fi.  I give it 4.5 stars and will recommend to others and return.",5,2015,10,28
105,Willy Wonka themed High Tea = 5*!,"My partner and I went here on weekend of the 24th, he had booked us in for a surprise for the high tea and wow, we were not disappointed!! 
Having previously attended high tea at places like the Ritz, which was great but somewhat stuffy and uncomfortable, the Chesterfield just ticked all the right boxes! From arrival staff were more than welcoming and pleasant, and took us to our seat in the conservatory area. A little quiet when we arrived but it filled up very quickly with an array of guests - couples, birthdays, children (very well behaved too!), friends, etc. 
Staff were very knowledgable about everything on the menus and so chatty. The willy wonka was such a fantastic quirk, but let me assure you this did not sacrifice the quality of food. Everything was just fantastic and we had a brilliant couple of hours - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 
Hopefully next time we will book in for overnight stays :) 
Thanks so much Chesterfield - made for a truly great weekend! ",5,2015,10,27
105,Afternoon Tea,"We had Afternoon Tea here and was absolutely delicious! In beautiful surroundings, excellent customer service. Tea, sandwiches and cakes were very tasty a mixture of vegetarian and non veg was catered for.  Would highly recommend visiting for any celebration.",5,2015,10,27
105,The Final Word in Gracious Hospitality,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for 4 nights in mid-September.  Everything about this hotel was wonderful, from start to finish. The room and bathroom were beautifully appointed, with every imaginable amenity. The old world apprearance of the public spaces and fine attention to detail was impressive. The staff were not only efficient and friendly, but nothing was too much trouble and they happily assisted to make our stay memorable. The hotel is very well located for an easy walk to Berkley Square, shopping areas, many theatres and restaurants and Green Park Station is a 5 minute walk away. Our stay included a full English breakfast- which still allowed a choice and which was freshly prepared upon request.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,10,25
105,We did not want to leave!!,"Stayed here recently with my husband. Loved it so much we did not want to leave! We stayed for 2 nights. Our deal included a bottle of champagne and afternoon tea for two. Check in was fast and efficient, staff were friendly. Our room was not quite ready on check in but as we had the afternoon tea booked in we were happy to leave our luggage and coats and were told that they would be delivered to our room. 

The afternoon tea was delicious. You can order as much as you can eat. Excellent choice of teas, cakes and sandwiches. Service was very good and staff were attentive but not intrusive.  

Our room was on the 7th floor, perfect. The room was clean and tidy, nicely decorated and very quiet. Our luggage and coats had been placed in the wardrobe as promised. A bottle of champagne was waiting for us, nicely presented and very drinkable, it did not go to waste!

Breakfast was delicious. Plenty to choose from and all diets catered for. Very leisurely and relaxed.

We had drinks in the bar in the afternoon and an evening.A pianist plays in the evenings, very nice to listen to but not intrusive so you can still hear yourselves talking. Complimentary snacks are served with the drinks, a nice touch and you cant resist!

Dinner was amazing. Lovely food. Again the staff were very attentive but they did not rush us at all. We were made to feel special. 

We cannot wait to return to the hotel, especially if we can get the same deal!

Staff were lovely and always polite wherever we went in the hotel, even when waiting for the lift.",5,2015,10,25
105,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Just returned from a week at the Chesterfield and I can fully understand why the hotel gets such glowing reviews. The staff really does try to make you feel welcome and at home in this charming ""very British"" hotel in the heart of Mayfair. ",5,2015,10,24
105,This is London,"My Wife & I stayed at the Chesterfield for 9 nights in June 2015. We took the Boomers Package which included a full English breakfast, staying in a Superior King Room. We requested room 525 on the top floor when booking and we were delighted when our request was confirmed at check-in. The room was of basic size, very ""English"" décor but comfortable & cosy.The Hotel is perfectly located for all major attractions and shopping. Without exception, staff & service were excellent! Breakfast was scrumptious although the waistline was being seriously challenged after 9 mornings. Obviously there is plenty of fine dining in Mayfair, but there is a great little pub, The Only Running Footman, just down the road to quench-a-thirst after a long day of sightseeing and the food is Michelin rated. There is no mistaking that you are in London when staying at the Chesterfield - a lovely and charming hotel",5,2015,10,24
105,Feels like home,"This was our second visit to this hotel and we felt as if we were visiting family. We were welcomed warmly and thanked for returning with a lovely note and a gift. The area around the hotel is wonderful and it is easy to walk to main attractions. The room was delightful and very spacious!  When we sat down for drinks at the bar, they immediately brought out goodies to have with it- even if the drinks were cokes or complimentary sherry. The staff is amazing and the concierge service was outstanding. Chris made fabulous reservations for us, got us tickets to shows and made suggestions that we loved! Every employee was informed and delightful. It's a go- back- to- place!  If you follow the hotel website for offers you can catch a great deal.",5,2015,10,21
105,Small-enough hotel; large enough rooms; wonderful staff,"A charming small hotel in a quiet corner of Mayfair. Posh decor, professional, solicitous staff, and rooms that are, for this price, large enough by London standards...or any standards, for that matter. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,10,20
105,Charming Hotel in a Top Location,"I loved the service at this hotel.  It's nice when you walk through the lobby, and you're greeted by your name.  The staff are very attentive, and they pay attention to little details.  The room was charming, clean, and spacious. The bed was comfortable, but perhaps the down comforter was a bit too hot for my taste.  I loved the turndown service in the evening. The hotel has a restaurant and I ate there for breakfast, dinner and afternoon tea.  Excellent food and service.  The location of the hotel, in the Mayfair area, is close to a lot of great restaurants, bars and shops. It's a quick walk to places like Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, the underground station, and Piccadilly Circus. I plan on another trip to London soon and because of my great experience, I will be staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair again.",5,2015,10,19
105,Terrace Bar,"Great facility, hospitality and friendly staff, especially Jade who bartends in the Terrace Bar.  Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade.........

Great restaurant (The Butler) had wonderful food; try the Dover Sole!!  Rooms are comfortable and cozy.  

Great location in London. Can get to a lot of local pubs. 

",5,2015,10,18
105,An exceptional Hotel delivering high quality service and facilities,"The Chesterfield provides high quality rooms and service .. Service starts at the door and continues from the reception desk to the room. This is a boutique hotel with very good food, an intimate bar and a relaxing environment with staff that are helpful and who go that extra step to help you. Rooms are at a very high standard with all the extras that make that point of difference between the Chesterfield and other hotels. Location is excellent. The only minor issue is the lack of a mini bar to keep the supplied water cold. Air conditioning is excellent .  Bed linen  and towel quality are a delight to use.",5,2015,10,18
105,Slept like babes.  Excellent in every way,"We always prefer to stay in Mayfair, when we visit London.  We were excited to find a fairly good price on this hotel via Booking.com.  Unfortunately, our reservation was nowhere to be found when we arrived at the hotel.  The young lady at the reservation desk was perplexed but when we showed her our confirmation from the hotel, she honored our reservation and even put us on the top floor to accommodate our ""quiet room"" request.  This hotel is older but they have outfitted it with extremely plush linens, mattresses, robes, towels, carpets, etc.  We felt very happy being here and enjoyed our stay very much.  The doormen are extremely friendly and accommodating and the hotel is very clean.",5,2015,10,15
105,Another lovely experience,I cannot say enough about the Chesterfield ... Pleasant accommodations ... Charming surroundings ... Excellent dining ... But the best is the staff who care so much about the guests and their comfort. Whether for business or leisure I continue to select The Chesterfield without a second thought and will continue to do so. ,5,2015,10,14
105,British Old World Charm and Excellent Service,"This is our second stay at the Chesterfield hotel and our seventh stay at a Red Carnation hotel. The room was comfortable, quiet (even though we were facing Charles Street), always clean, and tastefully appointed. Service, as usual, was impeccable. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. 

The location is ideal for shopping in Piccadilly, Oxford Street, and Regent Street. It is near several parks (Hyde & Green) and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, St. James, and Soho.",5,2015,10,13
105,Elegant small hotel.,"The Chesterfield is a small, elegant hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  The rooms are beautifully furnished and the restaurant serves an excellent breakfast and dinner.  For a Central London hotel, the Chesterfield is very, very good value.",5,2015,10,13
105,Top,"Our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was, once again, great in all respects.

The staff is nice and attentive to your needs, the hotel is ideally located in Mayfair and our room was quite large for London and really confortable. 

Another enjoyable stay.",5,2015,10,13
105,Charming traditional hotel,"I stayed here for one night as we had a works function being held there.  It has a fabulous traditional old school type of feel to it.  Sure it shows signs of wear and tear but don't we all!  The staff were incredibly helpful and attentive not to mention very polite!  

I stayed in the Jungle Suite which was a beautiful room, the bed linen was crisp and white and the pillows and duvet just perfect.  I even had housekeeping turn up while I was at the function and turn down my bed and tidy my room!  Apologies to the Housekeeping team as I had no idea that this was going to be done and left my room in a hurry and in rather a mess!

Breakfast was delightful - I only wish I had a bigger appetite so that I could have eaten more!

The only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is because sadly through all the comfort that the room offered the noise from the road below was non stop all night long.  Being a light sleeper this didn't help and so I spent most of the night in my very comfortable bed awake!

I would definitely recommend the hotel but would next time round would ask for a quiet room away from the roadside.",4,2015,10,13
105,Impeccable service,"The hotel boasts a motto ""No request is too large, no detail too small"". Our experience confirm that they do live up to their promise.

This is a traditional English hotel, with an atmosphere of a traditional club. It is also an old and old-fashioned hotel, and there are signs of wear like in any old house but those do not matter.

The staff makes the quality. Although we had to remind them about a few things during our stay, they always responded promptly. All our requests wee fulfilled.

We dhall return.
",5,2015,10,09
105,Chesterfield Hotel,"Have been visiting this hotel for 5 years now. Friendly, comfortable  with character.  Will continue to stay there in the future. The only criticism would be that the choice for vegetarian meals could be be improved.",4,2015,10,05
105,"Wonderful! Elegant, Friendly & Extremely Comfortable. Fantastic location.","Once again the Chesterfield delivered on all counts! Beautifully decorated comfortable rooms. Superb Breakfast with very good choice of freshly cooked items & Excellent Afternoon Tea, cakes are delicious & quirky! Very attentive staff, from the moment our taxi door was opened to when we were checking out the service is excellent. Fabulous choice of cocktails - the Gin Mixology session is amazing, very entertaining with very knowledgable bartenders!",5,2015,10,04
105,Once again Perfect,"What a delight to stay at this lovely appointed hotel. The rooms each decorated differently and very tastefully.  All of the comforts of home, you need not worry if you forget anything. The staff delightful, everyone has a smile on their face from the front door , restaurant to maid staff. Made to feel comfortable from the moment we arrived
Great location. We keep thinking we will try another place to stay but  know we would never find another as good.",5,2015,10,02
105,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I have enjoyed quite a few afternoon teas at this fantastic hotel. We have also had the pleasure of staying - not for a few years now but we are looking forward to a few nights early next year. 
We most recently came for afternoon tea. We love the bar/lounge area so made sure to arrive earlier to enjoy some time there first.
The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea really shouldn't be missed. I think the chicken sandwich is my favourite sandwich of all time and I would love to have one of the macaroons now! 
As with the rest of the hotel, service is second to none with everyone being friendly (but not over the top) and attentive. 
Loris in particular really should be commended for making us feel so welcome each time we visit. 
Sarah has also been incredibly helpful assisting us for our upcoming hotel stay.
Thank you Chesterfield - you really are our No.1!",5,2015,10,02
105,ANOTHER WONDERFUL STAY!,"This is our 2nd visit in 3 years. The staff is always attentive to your every need. The hotel is centrally located to all sites. The food , especially the breakfast buffet is excellent.
We plan to stay here again at our next trip to London.",5,2015,09,30
105,Elegant London,"My husband and I always like to stay in Mayfair when in London and have enjoyed some other very lovely hotels in that area.  Our former ""favorite"" hotel was booked for this trip, so we tried the Chesterfield Mayfair -- and a fortunate thing for us!  The Chesterfield Mayfair is lovely and very elegant. It's rather small, quite charming, and in a great location, but we were most impressed with the quality of the hotel staff.  Every employee went above and beyond to take a personal interest in having us as guests. They actually seemed to enjoy their work! The lounge is cozy, a nice place to have a before dinner drink or even a light supper.  We began almost every evening there, enjoying the pianist and maybe at least one glass of wine. The room was small, no view, but then we were not exactly looking for that. The closet space was large for a hotel, plenty of places to put our belongings and keep the room tidy.  The bed and bed linens were very fine, fresh flowers in the room, free wifi, lovely surprises everyday, including a farewell cupcake delivered to our room on our last night.  We now have a new favorite London hotel!",5,2015,09,29
105,A wonderful hotel,"We have been coming here for quite a few years now, it has never disappointed.  It feels like coming home, the whole place has an undefinable comfort factor.  We were in a Junior Suite on this visit which was wonderful.  It had a lovely long bath - not always something you get in London!  We have only stayed elsewhere in London when the Chesterfield was fully booked.  Nothing compares, from my perspective, because of the staff, they are, and always have been, wonderful.",5,2015,09,28
105,A truly wonderful experience!,"I am in my seventies, and have visited many hotels over the years, but the Chesterfield is without doubt one of the finest in every way - from decor to staff to food to comfort. I was in a rather large wedding party, and everyone of us agreed that it was a perfect weekend. Particular thanks to Food and Beverage Manager Biagio, who rates as superb - so pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable - not to mention patient with all the many requests at breakfast.",5,2015,09,27
105,Charlie & the Chesterfield Afternoon Tea is amazing,"My friend took me here for my birthday and it was amazing. The hotel is incredible and all staff were so helpful. Setting was beautiful, food was delicious and our waiter was so attentive and kind. Really recommend the Charlie & the Chesterfield Afternoon tea. Such a good idea! ",5,2015,09,26
105,Nice hotel ,"Very nice hotel from the red carnation hotels.
Staff friendly,  comfortable bed, and the bath shower very relaxing.
Nice pre theatre menu and lots of choices at breakfast. 
Really spoiled stay with my partner. ",3,2015,09,24
105,Accomodation & Food,"The accommodation and food at the Chesterfield is top notch. The staff are amazing, very attentive (without being intrusive) and so knowledgeable too.

The accommodation is second to none and the food is glorious!

Highly recommended",5,2015,09,24
105,Business Travel Stay at The Chesterfield,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks and it was blissful. The service was incredible, the room service food was always delicious, housekeeping was on-point and I was thoroughly comfortable throughout my stay. The one nit i have is with the toiletries. I try not to bring travel-sized shampoo and conditioner, etc. because of the hassle, etc. The toiletries are billed as ""luxurious"", but i believe they are simply Gilchrest & Soames repackaged as Fragonard? Anyway, this hotel has such high-caliber service, that i expected something a little more luxe. Tiny nit and one personal to me. The neighborhood is very safe. Very close to Green Park, which was a great place for a morning walk.",5,2015,09,21
105,Excellent,"Very good hotel. Friendly staff, exceptional service standards. Rooms are in keeping with other London establishments, somewhat small but comfortable, clean and bed linen is changed daily.
Great location for a number of really nice and good value restaurants, walking distance from the heart of the city. Great access to all types of shopping.",5,2015,09,21
105,Last Minute London Visit,"Enjoyed my 4 days at the Chesterfield, staff was wonderful, complimentary breakfast was excellent. Rooms a little too small for my liking especially at high prices.

Great location right of Barkley Square.",4,2015,09,19
105,Five-star Service!,"I had the pleasure of staying here for four nights recently.  Check-in was easy and efficient, and the lobby is lovely with a wonderful British club-like feeling.

I booked a ""superior"" king room which had all the usual complements of a fine hotel.  A large desk for working and spreading out papers, plenty of plugs (including a US plug...greatly appreciated!) for laptops, etc. a TV, and good lighting.  Of particular note was FREE internet, for as many devices as you carry, and plenty of writing paper for taking notes on (I hate hotels that give you three puny sheets of paper for notes...here you get a full stack!)  The bed was very comfortable, and the hotel located in a quiet street two blocks off of Berkeley Square, and about four blocks from the Green Park tube station.  The room was serviced twice a day to top-notch standards. also, unlike so many British hotels, here you actually got a teapot to make tea in!  Not just mugs with a teabag.   My only complaints ... the desk chair was banged up, and sorely in need of a paint job, and the room was tiny.  I dread to imagine what a standard room would be like.  If you were working at the desk, there isn't enough room for someone to go behind you to get to the other side of the room.  So for one person this was fine, for two this would feel very cramped, especially for a number of days.

The bathroom was large, with a small bathtub and a wonderful shower.  Fluffy towels and robes, and all marble clad and clean.

There was a restaurant on the premises, but it was expensive and there was rarely anyone inside.  There are numerous facilities for dining out within a block or two at a range of price points, so don't be afraid to venture out the doors!  There is no health club on the premises, and on the weekends the facility they use is closed.  So don't expect to workout on Saturday or Sunday.

All in all a charming hotel with great services and staff and an excellent location, but small rooms.",4,2015,09,19
105,Location & service compensate for small room,"The Mayfair location is convenient & a nice area.  The service is outstanding.  My room was very small - even by London standards.  I liked that they provided bottled water, coffee service in room, little cookie/biscuits and drink coupons for the bar.  Even with small room, I'll stay again.",4,2015,09,18
105,My wedding hotel with the best staff on earth,"I don't think I can sum up in a short review quite how marvelous everyone is at this hotel. I stayed here for my wedding for the weekend with many friends and family, and it was perfect. The location, afternoon tea, rooms, amenities are all wonderful, but it was the service that made the weekend that little bit extra special. 

I understand wedding parties require attention but there is nothing this hotel would not do or provide for us. Adam Lake who was the duty manager that weekend went above and beyond for me. He even drove with my dad and i to the ceremony office so we got there on time and didn't have to worry about the car. When we arrived back from our day in London all the staff were waiting with champagne. Sylvain who was in charge of events and groups spent 6 months working closely with me, getting my guests in the right rooms, and giving me the Stanhope Suite which was the perfect Bridal Suite. The hotel put a dvd in at my bridesmaids requests so we could watch the movie Bridesmaids :) When some guests missed flights, or needed special things, the hotel just fixed it all, no question asked. It made the wedding planning that much easier.

The food, ambience, decor, tea, bar, service and staff were incredible. I can't wait to return for our anniversary. Thank you to all. I love this hotel.",5,2015,09,18
105,The staff make this very good hotel excellent,"When you arrive at a hotel you want to be looked after. You may need advice ,help with luggage..you name it. Arriving places can be stressful.
This place sets its store out on the door and this continues at the desk and
at the very good breakfast. The people at this hotel exude a happiness which suggests
that whatever goes on here is eminently human and they respect and understand guests.
Rooms are well appointed and you can't think of much you might need. It is an older property and has a well looked after aged feel. Decent vintage wine rather than vinegar.
I don't particularly like people charging extra for some services but least they give you the choice. 
Beds are comfy. Linen is good,towels are big, soap is decent as is the shampoo.
all the small things are done well.
So in the expensive city if you want a decent value excellent hotel look no further than here. Knocks the socks off bigger 5 star plus better known hotels adjacent to Hyde Park at 50% the cost.
If you want tate modern this isn't it. If you want the leather well made chesterfield this is it. Also all the staff wear carnations so they do like flowers !!",5,2015,09,16
105,Beautifully stylish,"We have just turned from a trip to London where we stayed at The Chesterfield in Mayfair twice for three nights each at the beginning and end of our trip  We loved the hotel, the staff and the location.  Both times we upgraded to the Chesterfield Suite which was spacious, quiet and beautifully decorated.  The style of the decor is traditional and plush with every mod con.  I loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom and that there was a spa tub as well as a separate shower. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming. When we returned after a two week hiatus our welcome by the staff made it feel as if we were coming home.",5,2015,09,15
105,Traditional hotel with a great location and friendly professional staff,"We chose the hotel primarily based on location (and reviews). Located a few blocks from the Green Park Tube station, many attractions are easily reachable on foot and all others via the Tube. It was very much a classic British hotel (patterned carpets), not for those who insist on an ultra modern boutique hotel. It had a nice quiet feel. The room was quite comfortable and big enough with plenty of storage space. The shower had great water pressure! Our room was always made up promptly. The breakfast selection was good, although there are many coffee places nearby for those who prefer something less formal. The concierge helped us with restaurant choices and directions. 
AND .... it is one of the few hotels which actually only replaced towels we threw in the tub. It is SO irritating to read the signs ""we want to protect the environment"" and then you receive TWO sets of clean towels a day!",5,2015,09,15
105,"Location, Location, Location",Understated elegance in the middle of one of London's best neighborhoods describes what I like best about this Hotel. Walking distance to great Pubs and the Tube makes this place an ideal location either for business or pleasure. Staff is friendly and attentive. English Breakfast served daily is quite good and sets one up for a busy day ahead in London.,4,2015,09,15
105,Hidden Jewel in Posh Mayfair District,"The Chesterfield Hotel offers outstanding service in a very quiet, upscale Central London neighborhood.  The hotel is extremely well located a short walk from the Green Park tube station.  The room was well appointed but a bit small.  However, the service from the staff was superb.  We stayed 6 nights and would not hesitate to stay again.  The included full English breakfast was delicious and provided an elegant Continental breakfast buffet as well as many menu choices of cooked items.  The hotel bar had several groupings of very comfortable chairs and friendly efficient bartenders who can expertly mix any drink.  The Concierge was extremely knowledgeable and willing to help with advice and suggestions.  We enjoyed the Chesterfield very much and would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2015,09,15
105,Afternoon tea,"Fantastic Willy Wonka themed afternoon tea was had by the whole family a group of 10. Would highly recommend. Very reasonably priced, catered for all allergies. Unlimited sandwiches, scones and cakes yum yum!!",5,2015,09,15
105,Such a great stay,"After a long research on hotels in London,  we chose to stay in the Chesterfield. 
We needed something close  to the center of London,  becase of relatively short stay (5 days). 
Hotels location is only 5 minutes walk from the Green Park train station.  The check in was fast,  the service was great,  nice clean room,  which was cleaned daily with water bottles and tea refreshing. You have free Wifi in the room and in the loby.  The breakfast was fantastic too. The price slightly expencive for us,  we dont regret.  For high season in the center of London those are the prices. 
Would love. to visit again.",5,2015,09,15
105,This is a gem in the heart of London.,"You'll be struck immediately by the elegant decor and detailing of the lobby.  Our  room was exquisite, and even provided office supplies, like staples, paperclips, etc. for business travelers. Sign up for complimentary breakfast. it's a feast to behold in a beautiful dining room, that serves lunch and dinner, as well.  All are excellent!   But, most extraordinary at The Chesterfield Mayfair is the service.  Whether they are opening your door, serving a meal, parking your car, offering a cocktail, bringing ice, or just answering questions.....everything is done with a goal of perfection. We can't wait to return.",5,2015,09,14
105,A Great Location and Great Stay,"I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for 8 nights, having booked a very good rate through their website (which I recommend checking out before booking elsewhere, because it was about 40% lower cost, though I may have just gotten lucky).  The room is very comfortable, with all the amenities you'd like, including a good-sized bathroom with a great soaking tub.  The location is amazing.  It's steps from Shepard Market and Berkeley Square, less than five minutes to Green Park (and the tube station there, though I walked the whole time I was there), and just about 10 minutes to Hyde Park.  I never ate there, nor did I partake in their afternoon tea, though I could see it was very popular. I tend to prefer modern hotels to ones that have more of a historic feel, but this was quite a nice change.",4,2015,09,12
105,A smaller hotel with good quality and Mayfair location,"We visit London frequently and have stayed in dozens of hotels there, but the Chesterfield is one of the few that we frequently return to -- as far back as 25 years ago, but most recently both in May and last fall -- because it is a good blend of location, quality, charm and value.

The location in a quieter, upscale area filled with townhomes and small offices, a couple of blocks from Berkeley Square and Bond Street. There are many excellent restaurants scattered around the neighborhood.

The hotel is about a ten-minute walk from the Green Park tube station, which provides a convenient connection to the heart of the West End theatre/Covent Garden area via the Piccadilly Line and to Heathrow, 40 minutes west. It is also only a 15-minute taxi ride from Paddington's Heathrow Express line, and a 15-minute walk to the shops along Oxford Street. It does take a little longer to get a taxi here because Charles Street isn't a busy road.

The rooms are clean and of good quality, with modern marble baths and most amenities, including free Internet. We usually try to upgrade to the roomier superior king from the typical classic room to have enough space to spread out luggage on the floor. If possible, request a room with a street view -- we sometimes have overlooked Queen Street, but have never had a view of Charles Street. Street noise isn't a problem.

We also find the breakfast a good value if purchased as part of a package. As we usually stay 3-5 nights, we do note that the selections don't vary much from day to day. The dining room is quite pleasant and staff provides attentive service. We haven't dined there for dinner, however, because of the many nearby restaurants. I also recommend the small, friendly bar as a good place to converse with other travelers.

The hotel has done a good job in balancing comfort with charm. The rooms are warmly decorated, with lots of wood and padded fabric wall coverings. Bedside controls operate room lillumination and a privacy light on the exterior door. Nothing is out of scale, as the lobby is small, and the bar is just steps away. 

For what is offered, the rates are reasonable for London, although it pays to shop around as the rates do seem to vary significantly among various providers. We have recently used the ""Red Carnation"" rates and one of the breakfast packages, and typically get a rate of around USD 400.

We have often recommended the Chesterfield to friends, who have then remarked that they enjoyed their stay.",5,2015,09,12
105,Superb boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"This is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location in London. The rooms are very clean and neat with all the necessary amenities. The staff is very professional, warm and courteous. We greatly enjoyed breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant, Butlers. The dover sole was excellent! In addition to their breakfast buffet, you can order omelets and other items off the menu. We especially thank Alessio Marang and Biagio Sarubbi, who were very friendly in the restaurant. The hotel is a short walk to the Green Park Underground, as well as a short walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace. Mayfair is a beautiful section of London. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair and will return upon our next visit to London. I recommend booking reservations directly with the hotel using their website. The hotel website often has good deals and specials.",5,2015,09,11
105,Afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair,"On the 5th September 2015 I visited the Chesterfield Hotel for an afternoon tea with my family (10 of us, ages from 4 to 73) . We had the Willy Wonka tea and it was a really fabulous afternoon. The staff were amazing and NOTHING was too much trouble, so kind and very attentive. The hotel is beautiful and the area where the tea is taken is just as lovely, the conservatory area especially so. The actual tea was delicious, fresh sandwiches, fruit and chocolate scones with jam and clotted cream, fantastic pastries to follow! The supply was never ending!! I have been to quite a few hotels in London for afternoon tea and this has to be one of the best. We were never rushed, three of the family had allergies and these were accommodated very professionally. All in all a wonderful tea and we can't wait to go back, especially for the Willy Wonka tea with all its many lovely surprises!",5,2015,09,11
105,"I came back for eight nights, it was so good ...","This is my second stay at my favourite hotel in London, and this time it was for eight nights. I find The Chesterfield to be a quintessentially English hotel: elegant, sophisticated, well-mannered, friendly and run like clockwork.

It cleverly balances the characteristics of the five-star aura with one of a true, professionally managed boutique hotel. You are made to feel special, as, indeed, you are to them… and it is genuine on behalf of all the staff, right down to the housemaids. Quite unusual and very endearing.

I could not recommend The Chesterfield more highly as the most ideal hotel in London in which to stay.

Oh, and an added benefit: this location is central to all of London’s attractions, yet it is very quiet.",5,2015,09,10
105,"Top-Drawer, as they used to say","In the heart of Mayfair, easy walking access to Hyde, Green, and St. James's Parks and Piccadilly St./A4. 15 min stroll to Oxford St., 8 minute walk to Green Park Underground station.

We went all-out with 10 days in the Duchess Suite with breakfast plan inclusive. Room very well-appointed, nicely quiet after 7PM, posh bath and glass shower. Nice Nespresso machine with capsules refreshed daily (no milk provided tho -- buy your own). TV not much to write home about, but you're in London, what are you watching the telly for? The Only Running Footman pub just down Charles St. it you're into that.

Minor quibble was lack of day-to-day variety in the breakfast buffet--excellent prep and quality, but got a bit monotonous after the first few days. Probably most stays are shorter than ours, so who would notice? Other fine meal options exist nearby, including a Pret A Manger grab-n-go at Berkeley Square--one of dozens in London--which has varying offerings and is open when most shops are closed.",5,2015,09,09
105,Hotel Charm surpassed by excellent service!,"My wife and I had the good fortune to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair for a week. The hotel is absolutely charming in decor, the food in the restaurant was delicious, but the main standout for me and my wife was the excellent service. From the doormen to the front desk, from the concierge to staff we passed in the hallways, they could never be friendly enough or any more eager to assist us. Truly a memorable stay and we look forward to our next visit.",5,2015,09,09
105,Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea,"We came here for the afternoon tea for a family birthday and throughly enjoyed he Charlie and the chocolate factory theme. Each person serving was polite, friendly and helpful. Especially the Irish man ( sorry not sure of his name) who made our time there very enjoyable. Well worth the visit and food was lovely. 
Thank you",5,2015,09,09
105,"Stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair hotel in London, England","I spent 5 nights at the hotel.  Everything was excellent.  The location is great and I have only high praise for the staff.  They were extremely helpful.  Certainly would recommend the hotel.
The room was great - very comfortable.  Very good value.",5,2015,09,05
105,"Great location, wonderful staff","The staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair were unfailingly helpful and friendly, from the desk clerks to the concierge to the doorman.  The location in elegant Mayfair was top-notch, and an easy walk to Tube stations restaurants.  Breakfast selections were ample and served quickly.  The only thing this refined hotel doesn't have that I wish they could add is a gym/workout room.",5,2015,09,05
105,Gorgeous and quirky,"We stayed here for one night and wanted to stay longer! The service was typical old style London service and was impeccable-butlers, doormen, proper room service, free paper in the morning. When we arrived into the lobby it had an elegant, antique but quirky feel to it which I really liked and thought was quite different for example big jars of sweets around and quirky paintings. We were checked into the 'Music Suite' which was absolutely beautiful and had lots of lovely touches decoration wise - the ensuite bathroom was incredible. The location was fantastic and everything went very smoothly with our stay.",5,2015,09,05
105,Best kept secret,"The personalized attention unfound in larger hotels is found here.
Every greeting is personal, every bit of assistance is personal. The Butler's restaurant staff most accomodating.
Charles street is tucked away in the heart of Mayfair, a five minute walk to Green Park tube station on Piccadilly.
It's no surprise that returning to this hotel after many years it is still a personal preference.",5,2015,09,02
105,"Beautiful hotel ,friendly, helpful staff and great location","Great hotel .The staff are welcoming and go out of their way to help you,The room was  large , clean with free wi- fi.Whilst the hotel is in a very expensive location,the hotel is in unpretentious.
The breakfast buffet and dining room were excellent.I would stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,09,02
105,Amazing afternoon tea experience!,"From start to finish we were treated like special old friends. The staff went out of their way to help us and make us comfortable including helping with a lost shoe situation involving our toddler. Service was impeccable and always with a smile. We had a wonderful experience and the children loved all the little touches that referenced Charlie and the chocolate factory: the gobstoppers, the golden ticket, Mr wonka himself and the marvelous food. We thoroughly enjoyed all the tasty treats and were able to take home what we couldn't eat . My daughter who was celebrating her birthday was treated to a happy birthday song and cake with candel, a little teddy to remind her of her day and a menu to take home along with a red carnation, she truly felt like a princess for the day. Thank you.

105,Afternoon tea,"We visited the chesterfield hotel as a family for there Charlie and the chesterfield afternoon tea WOW! Made to feel welcome on arrival,when we all sat down for tea what arrived was amazing the wonka bar was the best! We will defiantly be back to use our golden tickets. ",5,2015,08,31
105,Mike Toolan,"We had the most amazing meal last week at The Chesterfield. 
The service and attention to detail is the best in London. The waiting and bar staff really make you feel like you're incredibly important.  (Which actually I am). 

Excellent choice of wines too, which the waiter seemed incredibly knowledgable and passionate about. 

The pianist really added to the ambience in the bar area, like something from the colonial days. 
I highly recommend you try the gin experience. As a Bombay Saphire lover, I really had my eyes opened.  I did accidentally send a glass flying, but thankfully nobody was hurt. 

Price wise, the whole meal I thought was surprisingly reasonable given the luxurious settings and location. 

All in all, the finest dining experience I've had in yonks. I will be back again next time Im in London. ",5,2015,08,30
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"Went here with my partner and three children (8,8 & 11), Willy Wonka was great as was the service and restaurant, we all absolutely loved it and the food was fantastic.
Willy Wonka brought round gobstoppers to start, then they had fizzy lifting drinks followed by a selection of sandwiches, cakes and chocolate bars.
They each received a teddy bear at the end and a golden envelope (containing a prize only upon opening at their next visit, which they wanted to be tomorrow!)
Definitely recommend.",5,2015,08,29
105,Core values duly fulfilled,"Red Carnation Hotels' core values are:
To give personalised, warm and consistently exceptional service.
To value, respect and support each other (staff). 
To create positive, memorable experiences for every guest. 
To care about and give back to our local communities.

The Chesterfield fulfills Red Carnation Hotels' core values admirably and it really is like 'a home form home'. The Curzon Suite was sumptuous. We're now looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,08,29
105,Sincerely friendly and helpful staff,"There's nothing like a hotel where the staff are sincerely friendly. At the Chesterfield Mayfair there is no sense the staff is friendly and helpful just because it's their job. They are just plain nice people. 
Add to that a bar where you always feel welcome even if you are like us and order coffee or coke and not a drink.",5,2015,08,29
105,A real treat!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a beautiful hotel. We stayed in room 528, and it was fantastic. The room was immaculate, with everything one would need. The staff were friendly and very helpful. A real treat to stay here!",5,2015,08,29
105,Afternoon Tea at The Mayfair,"As a birthday treat my family organised afternoon tea for us all at the Mayfair. As we had 2 children , age 5 and 1' with us they opted for the Willy Wonka tea party. It was absolutely wonderful. The sandwiches and cakes were fresh and plentiful, with lots of special touches.The staff were excellent, and nothing seemed too much trouble for them. They even presented me with a little cake with candle , and, of course, a carnation. I was then serenaded by the staff with a recital of the birthday song. An afternoon to remember for me, enjoyed by young, and old, and even older!
Thank you to my family, and all at the Mayfair for making my birthday so special. Xx",5,2015,08,28
105,Fab,"Staying at The Chesterfield is like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket. The staff are so amazing.

105,Great hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"I spent a week at the Chesterfield and loved it!  It is such a nice hotel with a very quaint and unique vibe.  The staff is the best!  They are extremely friendly and efficient and help to make the stay a very pleasant one.  The location is great!  On a quiet street, and very centrally located to most everything.  The rooms are immaculate, and you are taken care of wonderfully with night time turn down service.  The hotel has all the amenities you could want without losing the feeling of a small boutique hotel.  The cost is more than fair for what you receive.  I would highly recommend a stay here!",5,2015,08,27
105,Londons Best Gem,"My husband and I stayed for 6 nights last week for my first trip to London. The impeccable service and attention to detail were amazing. The moment we walked in this beautiful and charming hotel, I could not stop smiling. Charming is a understatement. We did the afternoon tea, which was amazing. The chicken sandwiches were the best I have ever had and the eclair with bubblegum flavored filling was a delicious surprise.  The concierge arranged several tours for us and we could not have been more pleased. The Dover Soul in the restaurant is a must have. The food was excellent and the service was the best I've ever seen. This charming hotel made my first trip to London perfect! I'm looking forward to my next visit.",5,2015,08,26
105,Highly recommend a stay here,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband. I think the best things about this hotel are the service and the location. 

Upon check in, the woman was very kind and politely chatted away (I think her name was Sarah). We were given an upgrade (bonus!) and offered help with our bags. Within 10 minutes of settling in, we got a call to check the room was suitable. Impressive! I'm not used to such great service. The room was indeed excellent. 

The closest tube station is Green Park. It's about 500m from memory but pleasant and easy enough to walk with a suitcase. Great tube station as it covers two lines with most of the touristy things covered by these lines (saves changing lines at other tube stations). 

I did not eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food. But there is a great place that serves coffee down the road and cheap breakfasts for on the go. Carnaby village is nearby and has excellent dinner options. 

Our king room was a good size and enough room for suitcases and walking around the bed. Bathroom was a reasonable size and the bathrobes are a nice touch. Fresh flowers in the bathroom and nightly chocolates on the pillow - this hotel is all about the little extras! 

The hotel staff are exceptional and a real credit to this hotel. 
I would love to stay here again on my return to London.",5,2015,08,26
105,Staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at, the staff were so friendly and accomadating, it felt like we never left home, the doorman Micheal was superb, i can't praise him enough, he took the time to chat with us like we were old friends and was very informative, also i woud like to praise the restaurant staff, especially the hostess, unfortunately i cannot remember her name,  think she was French,what an amazing lady, so warm and sweet, there is nothing that we didn't like about the Chesterfield Mayfair and look forward to another visit in the future.",5,2015,08,26
105,Great stay!,"After a tiny disappointment with our room not being ready until 4pm (rather than 2pm!) but all was made up for. Great bar service (4 drinks tokens to make up for the late room check in) 'Happy Anniversary' cupcakes and card. Breakfast room service with everything we asked for. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. Decor was lovely. Great to know they are dog friendly for next time we may bring our dog! :)

Room was a little small, but fine for one night.",5,2015,08,25
105,Good,"The hotel was amazing ! We stayed for a whole week ! Staff was amazing, room was big enough . The only thing was the breakfast . They nned to work hard for that though ! The rest was amazing I really liked the furniture and the theme ! We didnt try the afternoon tea and thats it :) ",4,2015,08,25
105,Just can't be beat in London ,"I've stayed at a full range of London hotels and I have to admit the Chesterfield is just heads and shoulders above the others on what you get for the money. Their impeccable service, old classic style and charm is just a bonus on top of fantastic rooms, food and central location to everything. All the shops, restaurants and bars are a stones throw away yet the Chesterfield is located on a nice quiet street a block up from Curzon and Piccadilly. I booked a small single on line but when I arrived was offered a 2 level upgrade for just a bit more, took them up on it and what a deal! Had a larger King room which also included free breakfast every morning which is brilliant. Not only is their food fantastic and lavishly presented but you can choose as many items as you like and customize as well. Can't go wrong with their breakfasts. I didn't eat any other meals here since I was exploring around and sampling the great diversity right in the neighborhood. ( Make sure to try the ""Burger &  Lobster"" a block away. You won't regret it) 

It's not a lage hotel but not sure how that's a factor other than allowing any room service or special request you make to be delivered in lightning speed with a smile. Can't say enough obout this place and if you are looking to stay in the area a can't recommend any other hotel. ",5,2015,08,25
105,Honeymoon Stay,"We stayed here at the start of August, 1 night stop over before heading to Thailand 4 our honeymoon. Also, stayed again for one night on the way back before heading home to Belfast. This hotel is something special, the attention to detail is incredible, it has such a charm to it that can only be experienced. We stayed in the Music Room, superb, with a bottle of complimentary champagne & a signed card from staff congratulating us. Breakfast was outstanding. We also had afternoon tea, such a great experience. Location of hotel is absolutely ideal, 10 min walk from Green Park tube station which takes you straight to & from Heathrow, also 5 min walk to Buckingham palace & other major attractions. We were 10 mins from the West End, we went to see a show & got a push bike taxi back, that was something special. Letitia, on reception,  is such a lovely girl, so helpful, knowledgable & a great asset to this hotel. Every member of staff were brilliant, but she went above & beyond. We felt like absolute royalty & can say with absolute certainty we'll be back. I prefer the boutique style hotels to the larger chains as they have much more character & this hotel is pure class. I done a lot of research before booking this hotel as I wanted value for money & also something a bit special, thank you so much to all the staff for making our honeymoon so unforgettable!!!!",5,2015,08,24
105,Great location,The hotel is very quite. The room is nice and clean. They had chocolate covered strawberries for us. You can walk to a lot of the major landmarks and shopping areas from the hotel. The Green Park station is just a few minutes away. The room is bit small. The shower doesn't have pressure balance so it can be a bit trick.,4,2015,08,23
105,An incredible experience!!!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair was our first stop for our month long honeymoon through London/Europe. We stayed for 4 nights and it was top notch from the moment we arrived. 

First, greeted by the door man and front desk, you immediately feel like royalty. They are so pleasant and welcoming. 

The lobby is elegant and feels like old world charm. The perfect feel for visiting London IMO. Very quiet and classy. 

They checked us in promptly and had or bags brought up to our room for us. 

The room is beautiful. Not huge but it never felt too small either. Nice coffee maker, decor, linens. Bed was super comfy!!

View was open to a few other buildings...but they were in the distance so we felt like we had a nice open view.

Very quiet all day and night. 

AC worked very well. Temperatures in London never really got too hot so this was never an issue either way. 

Shower was amazing!! Great rain head. Loved the bathroom. Very spacious and nicely decorated. 

The service is impeccable. They had a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for us. And a greeting card signed by every staff member in the hotel!!! Wow!!!

Every night there was a treat left on our pillows. Nice touch :)

There's a bar/lounge through the lobby that we had wine and tea at 2 of the 4 nights. A great pianist played some cool, light jazz covers as we sat and relaxed after long days of running around this amazing city. 

The concierge was so helpful. Very eager to give info and suggestions. 

Mayfair is an amazing neighborhood!! You're close enough to everything but you're staying in a neighborhood that allows you to escape the hustle and noise of touristy London. And there's some great little restaurants and spots to hang at right out the front door. 

Thank you to all the staff at Chesterfield!!  You really got our honeymoon started in the most amazing way!!!!

Jon and Michelle Brown",5,2015,08,23
105,Great location,"The hotel is really impressive as a first impression, with extremely friendly and helpful staff. The servicing of the room was excellent as was the breakfast buffet. If we stay again, I would probably opt for a junior suite, as the deluxe king room that we booked was a bit cramped and the bathroom was very small",4,2015,08,21
105,Lovely gluten free afternoon tea,"I took my mum here for her 60th birthday and we both had a brilliant time. The food (both gluten-free and normal) was lovely, and I would definitely recommend it as one of the best gluten-free afternoon teas in London. The gluten-free scones are excellent - I could have eaten just them all day!!

There are lots of little surprises along the way and the theme is very well done. The staff were great, and even bought my mum a little birthday treat. Thank you for this, you made her birthday really special.",5,2015,08,21
105,Absolutely excellent ,"We have visited several times and there is no question that the excellent standard never drops. 
From arrival time the staff are attentive, and welcoming. The reception team are a credit and Letitia ensures any special room requests are looked after as much as possible. The concierge team of Chris and Tony are a wealth of information and most courteous.
Biagiou in the restaurant ensured that guests were looked after and was happy to look into and provide special requests where possible.
All in all a lovely hotel with the staff to match.",5,2015,08,20
105,Family afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea in Butlers room
The most amazing service you could ever ask for
Our waiter for the afternoon was Markus. 
Excellent service from him.
The staff from front desk to the restaurant were magnificent polite,professional & friendly.
Rebecca was as so helpful also
The afternoon tea was a delight, we rolled out quite resplendent. The chocolate tea and the karma tea was amazing along with the pink champagne.
If you are looking for a quirky yet calm afternoon tea this is definitely the place to come",5,2015,08,19
105,Great hotel in a great location.,"Everything about our stay was perfect.  Mayfair is the best location in central London, close to the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly but a nice quiet and safe place to stay. The hotel was clean and comfortable.  The staff could not have been nicer.  We'll be back!",5,2015,08,19
105,Perfection,"Everything about this hotel is absolute perfection- bellman, reception, conceigere, bar, restaurant, tea, room service, housekeeping, you name it! Highly recommend!  We will absolutely stay here again when we return to London! Love Chesterfield Mayfair!",5,2015,08,18
105,Wonderful,I booked this hotel for my sister and I for her birthday. It is a beautiful hotel set in Mayfair around a 5 minute walk from Green park tube station. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and because of them I know we will return in the future. We had both breakfast and the Willy Wonka inspired afternoon tea both were delicious. The afternoon tea was wonderful with little quirky extras that make it exciting the fizzy drink and the golden ticket I am dying to open. Fantastic hotel cannot recommend enough I could go on and on about how beautiful everything was.,5,2015,08,18
105,Wonderful Anniversary Weekend,"This was our 4th visit to this wonderful hotel .We arrived and were warmly welcomed and told we had been upgraded to an executive suite! The rooms (huge bedroom and separate lounge) were amazing, beautifully decorated with lots of added touches to make our stay so much more comfortable. Waiting for us was a decanter of sherry, large bowl of fruit, cupcakes with ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate and a card which many of the staff had signed. This hotel is a jewel in the heart of Mayfair. The staff are all, without exception, so friendly and helpful and always go the extra mile to make your stay wonderful. A trip to see Mamma Mia on the Friday( which was superb) and a boat trip to Greenwich on Saturday completed a perfect weekend.",5,2015,08,17
105,Our wedding hotel!,"I don't even know where to start. The Chesterfield Mayfair is probably one of the most beautiful, welcoming hotels I have ever stayed in. We chose the hotel for myself to stay at the night before our wedding. I stayed with my maid of honour and bridesmaids. The staff went beyond expectations to make our stay absolutely wonderful. Nothing was too much of an effort. We were immediately were upgraded to a suite which obviously made getting ready in the morning a lot easier so I could have all my closest near me. Upon arriving to the suite there was a good luck card personally signed by all the staff and a bottle of bubbly! It was like they were all one big family so hospitable. The food was exquisite, the endless choice of drinks. (The gin tasting is a must do). The rooms were comfortable and the air-con made all the difference. I would definitely return to The Chesterfield and recommend to anyone visiting the area. Thank you so much for making my stay unforgettable and perfect ",5,2015,08,17
105,Gin experience ,"Wow! If you like gin, this is the place to go. A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours learning a little about gin and enjoying a few drinks. Staff were incredibly friendly. We were not dressed well (jeans and t shirts) but were made to feel very comfortable. ",5,2015,08,16
105,Our Favorite Hotel of a two week Vacation in Europe!,"My family and I loved this hotel so much that we didn't want to leave! The staff in this hotel is second to none!  From the front desk, to the restaurant, to the the bar, excellent in every way.  This was our first stop of a two week visit to Europe.  The restaurant food is delicious and the service is top notch. Amongst our family of four, we tried almost everything on the menu, all exceptional.  One night after getting back to the hotel late we decided to eat in the bar and enjoyed more delicious food, friendly and excellent service and enjoyed listening to beautiful piano music! Our server Jane was awesome!  Location was very good and a short walk to the tube.  The beds are very comfortable and we were fortunate to have a room with a view of the courtyard.  I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,08,12
105,Consistently great hotel,I have used this hotel many times and booked it for others for business trips.  The staff are always welcoming and friendly and the rooms are very beautiful.   The location is great for both business meetings and for sightseeing and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.,5,2015,08,12
105,Excellent Hotel,"My family and I stayed at this hotel and the staff could not be any more helpful.
We spent every evening in the hotel bar where the staff was even more helpful.
I would recommend this hotel to couples of families.
The concierge staff was exceptional!",5,2015,08,10
105,Excellent location and value for money,"This place is ideally located for people who want to have everything from Green Park to Covent Garden within walking distance. Rooms, service, breakfast, bar - all typically British and of excellent quality. Rooms are clean, but not huge, breakfast is fresh and tasty, service is extremely polite, and food and drinks are top as well. If you are not in need of a spa or similar indoor recreational activities in a hotel, then this is the place to go.",5,2015,08,10
105,Fabulous afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"We arrived ahead of our booking but were escorted to our table on arrival.  Aleksandra greeted us with an amazing smile and proceeded to explain the menu.  We ordered the Champagne tea and were offered a selection of champagnes and we chose the Lanson Rose which was delicious! The piano was playing in the background and several tables had happy birthday sang which we all joined in making it a fun and friendly.  The Willy Wonka themed cakes were amazing and Alexsandra asked us if we required a refill plate of sandwiches, cakes or fresh tea she would happily order for us.
Overall, I recommend tea at this traditional hotel, which clearly specialises in old school service and making the client feel at home.
We were given a 'Golden ticket' for our next visit which may contain an array of options ranging from champagne to an overnight stay.  i will definitely be returning to the Chesterfield to sample the other delights on offer.
All the staff were very professional and friendly, but Alexsandra was exceptional with her genuine caring attitude and her lovely smile.",5,2015,08,09
105,Nice,I like design and lobby also the rooms is very big and have a good bathroom 😍 viiiiiiiiiiiiisit and drink your tea time in it and i hope to have a nice time in there so I advice all to book it and also the pieces is good,5,2015,08,08
105,Relaxing Afternoon,"We spent a relaxed afternoon in the Terrace Bar at the Chesterfield. Staff were excellent, knowledgable, friendly but not overbearing. We had drinks and some bar snacks, would highly recommend the taster plates. The food was superb, as was the service.",5,2015,08,08
105,My only fear is that more people will discover this gem!,"My wife, nine year-old son, and I recently spent a week (six nights) at the Chesterfield Mayfair and booking our stay in a junior suite there made me the family hero. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and beautifully appointed (although our junior suite was closer in size to a standard room) but what really set the Chesterfield was the staff, the service, and the overall attention to detail.

We arrived early on a Monday and our room wasn't ready so we stored our luggage and returned in the afternoon when our room was supposed to be ready. Since they were still setting it up, we were offered chits for free drinks in the bar--which gave us a nice coffee/hot chocolate/cookie snack while the room was prepared.And that was just the start. Throughout the entire stay, the staff went to great lengths to make us feel at home.

From the lovely (included) breakfast in Butlers restaurant, to the little canapes delivered to the room each afternoon (or, if you are out, a card offering to bring them), to treats delivered at turn-down (like amazing chocolate covered strawberries), we were pampered. 

Our son stayed on a cot in our room, but to make him feel included, small slippers and a small bathrobe were left for him--along with a little teddy bear on his pillow at turn-down. And every day, there was a little bedtime family treat (chocolate-covered strawberries, a small box of fresh cookies, etc.) and a fresh red carnation in the room.

The desk staff was helpful to a fault, the doorman took an interest in us and our stay--getting into a long discussion with our son one afternoon about the Cutty Sark museum and coming in early on Sunday to say goodbye as we headed off to the airport.

The entire concierge staff was excellent, helping us plan our week before we arrived and then helping to fill in details as our stay went on. Tony was excellent, but Chris was something beyond amazing. 

We had thought about going to a play and everyone raved about Mathilda--but assured us that tickets were unavailable. Wednesday morning before having breakfast, we asked Chris if there were any tickets to be found for Thursday. He said he would see what he could do. So we went to Butlers for breakfast and minutes after we settled down, Chris came to our table. After profusely apologizing for interrupting (!), he told us that he had found two sets of three tickets that had been released that morning. The seats were at different locations in the theater (and at different prices) and he wanted to know if we were interested. He advised us that the less expensive set (at the front of the balcony) were closer to the stage than the more expensive set (at the back of the floor) and that the views were great. So we took his advice and bought the balcony seats. Twenty minutes later we had the tickets (printed at the front desk) in our hands. The seats and play were outstanding and we all had a great time! 

Chris got to know our family very quickly and through our stay made great recommendations for things that we might do.

Finally, London hotels are expensive. While the Chesterfield Mayfair is no exception, we managed to get a three-nights-for-the-price-of-two deal, which made it London-affordable. The only thing that could have made it better was if we had been upgraded from the junior to a full suite (but I am not sure we would have noticed since we were so happy everything at the hotel).

After a week at the Chesterfield Mayfair, we left for home. But we felt like we were leaving our second home--and that we had left a number of very good friends behind.

We all agree that we want to return to London soon--and that when we do, we want to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again.",5,2015,08,06
105,excellent hotel with great customer service,"We stayed here the night before the 100 mile Ride London. Great location, within walking distance of Green Park and the mall where the finish of the race was. Lovely breakfast and they kindly let us check out of our room late due to the race. Also received a good luck gift and personal messages from staff.",5,2015,08,05
105,Wonderful hotel in great location,"The Chesterfield is perfectly located for sightseeing in London. It is within walking distance of some great attractions, as well as restaurants and shops. It's also near a tube stop for further afield exploration. The staff is helpful and conscientious. Definitely have afternoon tea in the restaurant.",5,2015,08,04
105,The Epitome of Customer Service,"I recently went to The Chesterfield, a hotel that I had never heard of before, for the Willy Wonka afternoon tea with my wife and two daughters. The two girls were extremely excited as they are both huge fans of both the Roald Dahl book and the movies. We arrived at the hotel all flustered after rushing to get there on time due to the Google Maps location of the hotel directing us to the rear of the hotel!

After waiting uncomfortably at the door to be seated for a few minutes, we were taken to our table and given the menu. We were quite overwhelmed as the menu was vast, with a large variety of different options regarding tea. It was at this moment that a young gentleman named Paul approached the table with the warmest of smiles on his face. He greeted us by name, explained the menu and made a number of suggestions regarding the tea, helping us along until each one of the party was satisfied. As he walked away from the table, my wife whispered in my ear ""I think we are in safe hands"".

During the entire experience he served us with the utmost care. Small details such as using our names and answering the girls' thousand questions weren't overlooked, even for a split second. We were able to get our stand replenished as often as we wanted, we could try many types of teas, and even received a golden ticket at the end!

The food was absolutely delicious, the teas were fantastic, but the one thing that the four of us will remember long after the taste of the wonka bar has left our mouth, is the service that we received.

Will definitely be back!!!",5,2015,08,04
105,WONDERFUL OLD HOTLE....,The great service started when we had our baggage unloaded.  Friendly reception and service.  Beautifully appointed wood paneled interior. Room was unusually large for an old hotel.  Nice bath with large bathtub and shower.  Great location on quiet street.  Nice breakfast and close to all transportation.3,5,2015,08,04
105,Perfect Hotel in a quiet location,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a welcome retreat while staying in London. We would unquestionably stay here again. The location of the hotel was in a nice neighborhood away from the bustle just blocks away near Green Park.  The tube is only a 4-5 minute walk and if you are walkers as we are there is so much within walking distance including Buckingham Palace which is no more than a 10 minute walk. I would suggest anyone staying here but would think it is best for couples or small families.  

Don't miss the Sunday Roast here. It was amazing and reasonably priced for such an upscale restaurant.  The bar also has a great relaxing atmosphere and the Mayfair Gem mixed drink is EXCELLENT!  You cannot go wrong with a lovely stay in this beautiful hotel.",5,2015,08,03
105,"Perfect location, good value for price","Stayed 8 days at the Chesterfield Mayfair with wife and three kids on family vacation.  London is a big city and I cannot overemphasize the value of having a centrally located hotel where you can stop and rest for a bit between activities.  The hotel is close to Green Park tube station, which is on three different lines (Jubilee, Picadilly, Victoria).  Between those three lines, you can get just about anywhere with ease.  As to the hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and eager to help, rooms were small but well appointed.  Wifi was good, not great.  Neighborhood is safe, quiet, and fun to walk around.  All around, just about perfect.",5,2015,08,03
105,Afternoon tea,"I've had an afternoon tea. 
It was simply fantastic. 
The quality of food and tea is superb. Service is excellen and the personnel very polite. 
Sandwiches are simply great!
Thank you to Mr. Sarubbi, food and beverage Manager, very polite and nice person.",5,2015,08,03
105,"Lovely stay, excellent breakfast and service, good location","We stayed here 4 nights and had a lovely stay. Hotel has very good location in Mayfair, 5 minute walk to tube station. Breakfast was delicious. Wi-Fi was included in room price and worked fine. Room was comfortable and clean. Everything was great! I'm highly recommending this hotel.",5,2015,08,03
105,Sunday tea with the kids ,A great place to spend a Sunday afternoon with the kids. They get a Childrens activity package and you can order finger sandwiches with milkshake or tea and a selection of scones and dessert for £12 and the adults afternoon tea is as lovely. All the tea selections come with a wonka chocolate bar. The kids and adults would enjoy every bit of it. Don't miss out on the karma and the Chesterfield tea. ,5,2015,08,02
105,Can't say enough terrific things!,"I recently stayed at the Chesterfield for 12 days on a last-minute mother-daughter trip with my 8-year-old. Because of the short notice, I couldn't get a room anywhere I have stayed before, so I picked this hotel based on tripadvisor. I had fingers crossed that it would at least be clean and reasonably comfortable, but it exceeded almost all expectations. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with the impeccable service of the front desk staff and concierge. Throughout our entire stay, they remained helpful, cheerful, and eager to place without a single fault. Any request was met with a desire to please and a willingness to go the extra mile.

Our room was very comfortable and immaculate. It wasn't huge, but by London standards it was certainly pleasant enough for two people. It did not have a view to speak of, so if this is important to you, it might be advised to ask if some rooms have some sort of view. Other than that, I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a single negative thing to say. The housekeeping staff was also excellent, managing somehow to invisibly appear and service the room and then disappear again. They never once knocked on the door while we were in the room, nor did we so much as see them in the hallways, but our room was always magically perfect. 

Little details were also much appreciated: from the teddy bear left in room for my daughter, to the nightly turn-down gifts (eg. bath salts, chocolates...), to farewell cupcakes on departure, they really go out of their way to make the stay special and comfortable. My daughter also very much enjoyed a Charlie and the Chesterfield tea, as well as a private cupcake-decorating lesson with a member of the kitchen staff.",5,2015,07,31
105,Chesterfield Mayfair Experience,"Just returned from an amazing stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.  The service was impeccable. The room was lovely and the staff, friendly and extremely nice.  Would highly recommend this hotel.  Looking forward to another trip in the future!",5,2015,07,30
105,Warm welcone,"No complaints from us!  The Hotel met our expectations.  Room with a view, comfy bed, excellent breakfast and the best tasting and served Peroni !!  Good location in London.  The staff are a credit to the hotel, friendly and courteous. check in was smooth and quick.  We will be back and will recommend to all :)",5,2015,07,28
105,Honeymoon Stay,"We spent one night in London on our honeymoon, and were very happy with the service from the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We wanted to have tea, and be close to both the British Museum and Ronnie Scott's, and we were able to do all 3 easily from this location. Tea was terrific- the staff are extremely attentive and pleasant. We were also gifted a congratulatory bottle of champagne and an adorable little cupcake upon our arrival in our room, which was such a thoughtful touch. ",4,2015,07,26
105,Accommodations and service are superb !,"Hotel is quietly elegant.....staff very informed and attentive.....room very comfortable....breakfast perfect, and the Hotel is well located as well! Neighborhood restaurants were excellent, as was the Hotel restaurant itself.",5,2015,07,24
105,Very nice boutique hotel but noisy at the moment.,"This hotel is lovely but there are so many choices in London at this price point.  What makes this stand out is the staff who were all top notch.  

Our first room was at the back of the hotel on the 2nd floor and looked out at the AC units.  The building directly behind is under construction and there was some sort of jack hammer tool being used.  We asked to be moved to something quieter and switched to the room across the hall facing the street.  Traffic noise is quite loud there.  Lots of taxis with diesel engines rumbling by.  Sigh.... 

Bed was firm, a little too firm for me.  Bathroom tight but manageable. Housekeeping was excellent.  Room service staff was excellent.  Being jet lagged we slept through breakfast and they made us club sandwhiches with a fried egg at noon for no extra charge. The next day we ate in the restaurant which is charming and more than you can eat. London was having a heat wave so the 5+ block walk to the tube station seemed like a trek but the AC in the room was very good and silent.  I would probably stay elsewhere next time but you can't go wrong here, especially once the building behind is finished.",4,2015,07,23
105,"Lovely Staff, But A Few Things To Know","Lovely, warm welcome, attentive friendly staff. Note that there are no refrigerators in the rooms, and that the gym is off the property, about a five-minute walk away and that the registration process as a guest is quite cumbersome and time-consuming, The gym is a Fitness First and quite cramped, machines right next to one another, low ceilings. Worst of all, it's closed on weekends.",3,2015,07,21
105,18months later... Just as good !,"Our 2nd stay here, this time in summer (air conditioning works well), and we stayed in room 506 again.
5 floors up, with a rooftop and sky outlook, which certainly gave you an idea of what the weather was up to.
The room had tea and coffee making facilities, daily cookies and mineral water .
Again, the staff were fantastic. There were smiles everywhere, and genuine friendliness.
Room was not large, but as you start unpacking, you realize that there is an unusually large amount of storage.
The daily breakfasts (included in our tariff) were great, with a wide range from the continental buffet, and a good choice from the al a carte cooked breakfast options. My favourite is always the hot porridge with a shot of whiskey !
The hotel bar is a great place for an end of day drink and a light meal, and not too expensive (for London)
The hotels Mayfair position , for us, is perfect.
Absolutely enjoyable, we will return again !
",5,2015,07,21
105,Excellent place!,"Brilliant business. Also the location is beautiful, Mayfair is very ~close~ to my heart. In this place you relieve stress, pains, clear blocks in your body-energy flow, amplify vitality and become happiest. Every trip here leaves me with a wonderful feeling of inner harmony and organization.",5,2015,07,20
105,Exquisite – a real gem!,"Four of us dined here for the first time and our whole experience was perfect from start to finish. Staff in the bar and the restaurant could not have been more attentive, helpful, friendly and professional– without being overbearing – and anticipated our every need. The décor takes you to a place of real classic Englishness with service to match. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. And when we asked for two desserts to share, we were asked if we’d like the chef to plate them up on four separate plates – a lovely gesture! This is a real gem in the heart of Mayfair – a truly exquisite experience that was faultless from start to finish – and we will certainly be returning.",5,2015,07,17
105,One of London's best!,"My fiancé and I just returned from a wonderful week long stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was so nice to be so centrally located (5 min walk to Green Park Station) and not hear any traffic at night. 

As others have mentioned the breakfast, tea, cleanliness, free wifi etc here are also great, but what really sets the place a part is the staff and their outstanding customer service. This was a very special trip for us as we were celebrating our engagement and the staff were kind enough to bring us a treat and a signed card from everyone, which was a nice touch. 

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,16
105,Perfect stay,"We had two singles for three nights.  The single rooms are narrow and may have a bit too much furniture, but the bed is quite comfortable and the bathroom is wonderful -- clean, newly done in marble and shining chrome.  We also found the staff to be uniformly pleasant and helpful.  The location is on a quiet street that is only a block from Berkeley Square and a few short blocks from the Green Park Tube Station.  I was really very pleased with this hotel and our stay.",5,2015,07,16
105,Lovely,"Really nice, attentive staff, friendly, comfy easy room, nice bar, convenient location,all positive. food was great and the room service seemed to arrive really fast, am currently staying in another hotel and really wish I was at the chesterfield!",5,2015,07,15
105,A cosy very British hotel with super staff,"Whether it be for business or for leisure, love staying at this hotel! Always so graciously and warmly welcomed by the super staff, one feels so at home here in the old English way. The restaurant headed by amazing Maitre D Loris serves excellent food that you end up eating at the hotel most of the time. Thank you always for a memorable time and I look forward to my next stay!

105,Very good staff,"first time here me and my partner panda loved it Was treated like royalty by the excellent staff Had a good laugh with Ken and Manos who was the bar tenders 
Kens Gin experience and his knowledge was terrific reception staff Chris and Emma Tony were so good as well All staff at this hotel are just great Hope hotel management should be proud off their hard working staff Rooms are beautiful good location for tube and attractions Such a lovely place to come and diffo we will be back Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair for making us feel special 😄😄",4,2015,07,15
105,Terrific single rooms,"I was traveling alone in London and booked a single room at the Chesterfield.  Loved it.  Gorgeous room, great for a woman traveling alone.  And they even brought me spa treats at bedtime turn-down.  Wonderful bedding, very clean and fresh smelling air (I have allergic asthma).

Had ice cream in the library while reading.  

Great location, great hotel.",5,2015,07,14
105,Cannot recommend a hotel more highly,"The two best attributes of this hotel are the location and the people, which shows you how great those things are because the food is also excellent.  Mayfair is a lovely area, right off of Hyde Park and close to public transit, as well as several great restaurants.  The best part of the hotel, however, is the service.  I have now stayed with my family at the Chesterfield on 3 occasions, and have received help booking everything from dinners (including Christmas and Christmas eve on 2 occasions), to Chelsea matches, to West End shows.  The staff even remembered my Mom's name as we walked in to check-in this year and it had been almost 2 years since we have stayed there, a wonderful little touch.  The rooms are small, but that's London.  They are superb and the food and bar are quality.  When talking about top-tier hotels in London, I prefer the Chesterfield's service as a differentiation point from some competitors such as the Grosvenor House or Intercontinental.",5,2015,07,13
105,Gorgeous Gin!,"I haven't stayed at The Chesterfield but I've been there for drinks on a number of occasions. The hotel bar is fantastic; opulent and great décor, with just the right amount of kitsch! 

The gin menu here is fabulous, they match each gin with a different tonic and are happy to explain why. Well worth it if you love a good G&T as their nibbles are amazing too.",5,2015,07,13
105,Afternoon tea,Just arrived back from a lovely weekend in London. Had afternoon tea for the 2nd time here and it's just amazing!! The kids love willy wonka and the cakes are delicious. Chicken sandwiches with the almonds are too die for... But the good thing about this afternoon tea is they replenish it when you want some more... Great place great staff would definitely recommend it ,5,2015,07,13
105,Loved this hotel,"Stayed here for 5 days.  Visited museums, took a trip into the country, visited friends. The hotel was large enough to have the services we needed but small enough that all the staff knew our name. Our room was spacious and had everything that we wanted - a king sized bed, two chairs for reading, and a large desk. The concierge provided excellent restaurant reservations, limousine services, and general advice. The bar was charming. The price included breakfast was excellent.  The property was kept in spotless condition with great attention to detail.  The staff all seemed to enjoy working there - a rare thing.

Who could ask for anything more?",5,2015,07,12
105,Children's tea party,"I deliberately researched a children's afternoon tea to go before  Matilda the musical. And it was brilliant, from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. Like they were little princesses and they loved it.

First the fizzy uplifting drink had popping candy in it. It was very sweet so my nieces loved it. They even asked if we could get some to take home. When the cakes came out it all looked lovely in hindsight I wouldn't of got the massive load of cakes in the tower. But it did look pretty. Better then the children's one. If there was anything I would like to see differently is to have the children's into the towers. Just because it looks pretty. 

Willy wonka came round and gave out little gobstoppers. Spoke to them. Which was cute. He then came round for pictures and also with a golden ticket. Which if opened the next time you are there. You may get something for free. Which is great. 

The girls also got colouring books and crayons and a little bear which they loved. It was expensive. But I think you defiantly get what you paid for. However I don't think they advertise it we'll. it doesn't sound as good on their website. But it is go there!!! ",5,2015,07,12
105,Best Afternoon Tea Ever!!!,"We have just got home from a weekend in London celebrating my daughters 21st birthday, and ended it with the willie wonka themed afternoon tea at the chesterfield mayfair hotel. 

The service, food, tea, ambience could not be beaten! The willie wonka theme was absolutely perfectly done and Mr. Wonka himself coming to our table with a lucky dip was the icing on the cake! 

The chocolate scones were delicious and the pastries, which had clearly been cleverly thought about in keeping with the theme were perfection.

Extremely rare to be offered the chance to top up on not only tea but sandwiches, scones and pastries too which I thought made the whole experience worth every penny!

Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful afternoon!",5,2015,07,12
105,"Chesterfield Mayfair-lovely, convenient location in London","The Chesterfield Mayfair is beautifully located for shopping, visiting Hyde Park--even walking to the theatre district.  The hotel itself is charming and cozy.  Everyone on staff; from the doorman to the front desk were lovely and helpful.  (We had a problem with our room, which they worked to repair as quickly as possible.)  Sadly, we didn't get to experience their tea, which sounded lovely.  We had breakfast their once and it was very nice.  The only downside is that the rooms are extremely small.  (When we booked, I had thought there might be a sofa or cot for my daughter, which could fit in our room....there literally was not enough floor space around the bed for one to have fit!  The staff did make sure to book her in an adjoining single...) The rooms are prettily done and the hotel is very clean and well kept up.",4,2015,07,12
105,Perfect,"We stayed here to visit a concert in Hyde Park and we wanted to be within walking distance to the venue. Great choice, I can recommend this hotel. You can also walk to Oxford & Regent Street, we even walked into Soho, so it can also be of choice if you see a show at the West End and want to walk to your hotel. However also Tube stations nearby and bus stops. We had a rate without breakfast and found a nice cafe that served good breakfast all day at reasonable prices in Duke street. As other reviewers pointed out this hotel has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Our room was spacious with a Kind Size Bed, which was very comfortable. They give you a choice of pillows. Enough storage / wardrobe space in the room. The bathroom had a very good and powerful shower. This place has it top ratings from trip advisors for good reasons.",5,2015,07,12
105,A true London Jewel.,"Just spent 12 nights at this friendly London gem. Every aspect of our stay was fantastic from accommodations to attentive staff. Piano lounge, cozy bar, great bartender.  Already looking at our next booking
Joe P.",5,2015,07,09
105,Lovely stay,"I just recently stayed here for the weekend with my girlfriend and our stay was great. The staff were all very friendly and were more than happy to help with any questions I had about how to get places and where was best to eat etc. The rooms were nice, had everything you needed and the beds were comfortable. The location is great, very close to most of the attractions in London. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,07,09
105,Made our stay in London absolutely perfect!!,"After much careful contemplation and poring over TA reviews of London hotels, we decided to book our 4-day, 3 night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. They exceeded our expectations! Staying at a nice hotel in London is not an inexpensive endeavor, and the Chesterfield Mayfair is no exception. However, we found it to be worth every penny for the luxurious accommodations, the pleasant staff, the excellent service and the delicious food! We loved that the hotel is within walking distance to so many excellent pubs, shops, Tube stops, Green Park, and Buckingham Palace! You can walk over to Shepherd's Market quite easily from here, as well as to Hyde Park. Neighborhood is quiet, safe and very friendly.

I was traveling with my son at the end of his year abroad as a Rotary exchange student in Belgium. I am a huge British history nerd, and so was very excited to see and experience all the London sights I'd read so much about. The front desk staff was very helpful in answering questions and gave me great tips about making the most of our visits to all the major historical sites.

We were in London over the July 4th week during an unusually hot spell. London was very crowded with people on holiday, and I can't begin to express how refreshing it was to return to our air-conditioned room oasis. The bathtub was huge, the water was always hot, the decor was marvelous, and we even were brought free champagne and some delicious cake to celebrate my son's birthday once we checked in! Our room was so comfortable and well-decorated that it was sometimes hard to leave to go visit the sights!

We were fortunate to enjoy free breakfasts with our stay, and I am here to tell you that they were sumptuous and scrumptious. We quickly became addicted to their eggs Benedict. One morning, my son was especially hungry and asked for a second helping, which was brought immediately and with much courtesy. The wait staff were so professional and friendly. They were so pleasant and the food was so good that each day was started off in the perfect fashion! We often didn't have to eat lunch because the large breakfasts were so filling.

We also chose to enjoy The Chesterfield Mayfair's Afternoon Tea upon returning from a morning at Windsor Castle. We were actually about 30 minutes late to our pre-scheduled time due to a delayed train, and the staff quickly accommodated us with not one word of chastisement. The theme was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - completely whimsical and very tasty! The tea was served perfectly, and we even had a glass of champagne with our tea. Great experience. Even if you don't stay here, definitely book their afternoon tea.

Communication with reservations prior to our stay was very well done. We were greeted with great courtesy upon arrival, and the friendly doormen always tipped their hat and said hello. Every single thing we needed was provided immediately, and with such friendly warmth that I cannot imagine ever staying elsewhere when in London. Red Carnation has done a marvelous job at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and I am so pleased that we chose to stay here. I had a lovely hand-written letter thanking us for our stay when I arrived back in the US. Can't wait to come back!",5,2015,07,08
105,Home from Home....friendly efficient...excellent in every way,"Faultless in every way....and as usual this is largely down to the staff who go the extra mile to ensure that the guest is their no 1 priority.
Attention to detail and personal interest has to be their ultimate forte.",5,2015,07,08
105,One of the top hotels we've ever stayed,"GREAT hotel.  Great and friendly staff.   Wonderful afternoon tea and breakfast.  Quaint, cozy, comfortable hotel. The best shower, hands down, any hotel, anywhere.   Will stay here every time I'm in London.",5,2015,07,08
105,Attention to Detail,"Staying here reminds me of our many Uniworld cruises - lots of attention to detail which makes for a most enjoyable stay. The reception staff and concierge were outstanding. Our room was most comfortable and since we were on the 3rd floor we were easily able to walk up and down the stairs.  We appreciated the robes, slippers and many quality amenities and services including nightly turn down service.  The location met our needs: close walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace or the tube station or Sheppard's Market for a pub or restaurant.  We walked to the theatre in Soho and were close to Piccadilly Square.  We shall return.",5,2015,07,08
105,Hidden Gem,"I love this hotel. Been here twice now and although it's not too large, the rooms are quite sufficient. The concierge and staff are friendly and helpful. Service is prompt. 

It is within walking distance to Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace. 

I particularly liked the gentleman named Guilermo. He always had a smile and a suggestion that was quite helpful. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who is visiting London for the first time or who wants to live in style while in London. ",5,2015,07,06
105,Great location,"I've just enjoyed a two night stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair, extending a business trip into a leisure trip.  We didn't intend spending very much time in the hotel and as such we booked a classic double room.  The bathroom was lovely and the permanently heated floor was an enjoyable touch.  The room itself had everything we needed and was very comfortable.  No additional frills, no lavish amount of space, but clean, comfortable and perfect for our stay.  The hotel was in a great location and we found that we walked everywhere.  Perfectly located for restaurants and nightlife as well as shopping if that's what you are after. Oh, and breakfast was delicious!",4,2015,07,06
105,"European vacation, away from tourist crowds and sights, but walking distance to most major London attractions","Enjoyed recent stay at Chesterfield, Mayfair. Service made us feel most welcome. Decor was elegant. We dined at the Butler restaurant for dinner one night, and Lauris was most attentive. Walking around Mayfair was quite charming, would highly recommend and stay again.",5,2015,07,06
105,FANTASTIC afternoon tea,We just loved the afternoon tea.  There was an excellent and generous selection of items. We could not help ourselves and had to have seconds of the delicious sandwiches and scones! The lists of tea on offer was second to none - just loved the rose tea - and it was nice to be offered a selection of different champagnes. The service was excellent. I hope to visit again one day! Highly recommended. ,5,2015,07,05
105,Such a special place!,"My family is visiting London for the first time, but from the moment we walked I we felt right at home.  The Bell staff are always happy to help, and the front desk staff can accommodate just about any request.  We took my Daughters (11yrs) to their first real afternoon tea, and it was an incredible experience for us all.  We plan to have afternoon tea there again before leaving London.  The decor and ambience uniquely British.  The hotel is walking distance from several major sites to visit.  Shopping and unique restaurants are blocks away as well.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,05
105,The comfort and the staff just keep getting better,"The Hotel Chesterfield provides a warm, surrounding welcome not always available in a  big city. The rooms and facilities are excellent and well-maintained by a very efficient and helpful staff. The front desk, with people like  Leonor Sepulveda and Nathalie and concierge Tony, are about as guest sensitive as any anywhere. You are in their fine home. There is little formality here and you don't miss it. Having travelled the world, the Hotel Chesterfield is my place of choice in London.",5,2015,07,04
105,Afternoon tea @ the Chesterfield amazing!!!,"Me my wife and two children visited the Chesterfield for a ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" themed afternoon tea. What an experience we had such a brilliant time, our children were in their element. The quirky ideas were well thought up from the Oompa Loompa style cup cakes to the wonka bars it was just so well linked to the film. The sandwiches were extremely tasty. Another great touch was the small fizzy drink we was welcomed with which again linked greatly to the drink in the film! Would defiantly recommend this especially if seeing the theatre show, which is what we did and this proved to be a great start to our charley and the chocolate factory day!",5,2015,07,02
105,Five Star Service- Best Afternoon Tea Experience,I had afternoon tea in the hotel with friends recently and it was by far my best experience of afternoon tea. We were greeted and served by very friendly staff and they made a fuss of us from the get go. I loved that we were able to pick our favourite sandwich/desert and get 2nd helpings of them. There was a huge variety of tea options and it was nice to see creativity with the sandwich fillings. I loved the cornation chicken sandwich. I would highly recommend this hotel and I'll be making it my London treat everytime im over from Ireland.,5,2015,07,01
105,What a treat!,"Jusy recently stayed for six nights in this special place.  Felt spoiled and safe and at-home all at once.  Great location - central to everything, lovely English decor and fabulous  service!  We'll be back!",5,2015,07,01
105,Best Afternoon Tea Around,"Afternoon Tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair is the best i have experienced anywhere in the world. This afternoon tea outshines all others in its quality, presentation, ambiance and service. 
It is very clear that each item presented has been carefully considered and compliments the wonderful tea selection perfectly. 

I would certainly recommend adding Afternoon Tea to your 'to do list' while you are visiting London and the Chesterfield Mayfair is definitely the one to choose.",5,2015,07,01
105,"Lovely Hotel in a great, central location","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from June 12-16, 2015  - The location of the hotel is terrific (close proximity to almost everything) and the service and room were great!  We did not eat in the hotel, but had a few drinks in the bar - all wonderful.  We were here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary (which I had mentioned in my online  booking - almost a year in advance) and on our first night had a nice surprise with some cupcakes and a signed card waiting in our room after returning for the night.  Nice personal touch.  The room was of ample size, and very nicely decorated.  We will definitely consider staying here on any return trips to London.",4,2015,07,01
105,Tired and in need of some TLC,"I have to start by saying our experience of check in was excellent. Full marks for the lady behind the desk who booked us in. She was great. However the rest of the experience of The Chesterfield was average. 
We had lunch in the restaurant where I have to say the food and the service was good. Afternoon tea was expensive (but then I suppose it is London). But there was far too much food on the plates. Four scones for one person? And i didn't rate the chocolate scones at all. The vegetarian sandwich fillings were fab. Well done to whoever thought them up. The Chesterfield also did well with my husbands numerous dietary requirements. Thank you. I loved the paintings in the restaurant. 
Our room was tired and in need of some attention. One of the sockets didn't work and the ceiling needed a good coat of paint. The plughole was blocked badly in the bath.
I was quite annoyed on the night time to find we were right above a disco. However I was too tired to ask to move and it did finish before 11.30. 
In the morning I was looking forward to making fresh coffee with the cafetiere provided. Sadly the cafetiere was broken. I rang reception to ask for another however the guy who answered the phone clearly didn't understand me as he set up coffee. I did manage to get a second cafetiere but that was faulty too so in the end I made do with ordinary coffee. Shame. 
We didn't have breakfast as I thought it was a bit extortionate at £22 each on top of the £202.50 we had paid for the room. 
On the morning we had a lie in and put the Do not disturb light on. The person cleaning still thought they would knock though. Is there any point in having the Do not disturb lights then?
I would go back and stay here again. It was clean and staff were helpful. I would be asking the question about my room beforehand though.",3,2015,06,30
105,Fantastic classic british hotel,"Love this place. Location is great, as are the staff and the rooms - especially the study we had on the first booking of two in a week. We didn't get chance to try the food. Slight downside is lack of parking on site.... but that's typical for the area, and the valet are efficient.
",4,2015,06,28
105,Charlie at the Chesterfield afternoon tea,"All of the food was very well presented and tasted lovely. 
Three of our party had the afternoon tea blend whilst one was adventurous and tried the turkish delight infusion, all were very enjoyable. There was of course hot chocolate also available.
We were seated in the conservatory which was bright and airy. 
The staff were all very helpful and explained what each delight was. 
Firstly your fizzy lifting drink arrives which was very enjoyable - cranberry, cream soda and popping candy! Then your three tier afternoon tea arrives. Our party didn't like egg so ordered extra chicken sandwiches instead and we were so glad we did, they were divine!! You are able to order free refills on the sandwiches, scones, pastries and even the Wonka bars!!
Would highly recommend this afternoon tea with a difference for all age ranges and we look forward to visiting again",5,2015,06,28
105,Great hotel in great location,"Loved our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair. Nice quiet hotel, great staff, and great location walking distance to theatres, shops and restaurants. Stayed 5 nights in room 707. We would definitely stay there again when visiting London. :) ",5,2015,06,28
105,Good Location,Probably fairly priced for a Mayfair hotel. Staff were very friendly. The room was quite compact. Decor / style was interesting in that you might call it grand traditional. We stayed one night and had breakfast. Lots of choice for breakfast. Would not say that the food was outstanding though and we did have to wait 10 mins for a table. The room was well served with a paper delivered in the morning. Nice but small bathroom.,4,2015,06,27
105,2nd Visit ,"We stayed in room 411 classed as a Superior Double and it faces the front, it has a round wooden table and a small armchair that unless we kept on moving it we could only get to one side of the bed. So I moved the chair that was recessed under the desk/dressing table/TV stand to the corner of my husbands side of the bed ( which then only enabled him to get out of bed via the bottom ) I then put the table under the now vacant recess ( it jutted out about 2 inches ) and the armchair I put in the small amount of space under the window by the TV, at last we could manoeuvre around the bottom of the bed. It stayed like that for the 6 nights we were there. I'm sure the chambermaid found it easier.

Another issue was our 2 windows that faced occupied property only had 1/2 net curtains and therefore you couldn't pull back the heavy blackout drapes until you were dressed and you could never get changed in the room during daylight hours unless you pulled the drapes closed.

The wardrobe was only a 1/2 length drop so I was not able to hang any full length dresses etc.

There was a lot of street noise up to about midnight every night, then it died down until about 5.30am.

It was our 25th wedding anniversary and the hotel gave us a lovely bottle of red wine and 2 little cakes however our anniversary was the 21st and we got our goodies on our first night there 16th. The thought was there though.

The bathroom had plenty of shelf space to put your toiletries on and the shower over the bath was good.

The bed was comfy and the TV was good as it has Sky Sports on and my husband was able to see a bit of cricket but not for long as he had to sit on the bed to watch it. The Wifi was good too.

I mentioned on our first morning how we found the room to be quite small to Letitia on reception and although we were willing to put up with it for the duration we would go for something bigger next time so I requested a viewing of a junior suite on any day that was convenient to the hotel and she checked her screen and said that Sunday would be the ideal day as there were rooms available, and she also said she would pass a message on to her colleague. To cut a long story short the female receptionist on Sunday was nothing short of totally not interested. After 4 attempts during the day of speaking directly to her all she kept saying was "" I'll ring you"". On our last attempt she said "" They'll look much better tomorrow !! "" and that was the end of the conversation. I spoke to a nice lady on reception the next morning and told her I was not happy with the attitude of her colleague and I didn't get her name although both me and my husband thought she had an Irish accent. She said she did not have an answer as to why her colleague would say such a thing about it looking better the following day and she had 2 suites available that she could show us there and then 8.30 am. ( which says that they were available on Sunday ) we declined, as the way we were treated the day before had totally put us off ever going back to the Chesterfield.

One more thing I couldn't get my head around was on checking in we were told we would be debited £300 and it would be back in our account when we left if we didn't spend it, well we did eat and drink in the hotel, however the £300 was not pending ( which I thought it would be ) it was taken out of our account after 2 days. Ok we had the money but I found it strange practice for a hotel to do that, we've stayed in 5 star and only had the card details swiped.

To finish we would like to say that Selmon and James in the bar were excellent, Chris the concierge is always friendly and smiling and Butlers restaurant would not be the same without Loris.

",3,2015,06,25
105,Lovely stay in central location,"I only have good things to say about this hotel:
- excellent personal customer service
- great location and quiet
- staff accommodating 
- close to public transport and a short walk to green park
- rooms spotless
- price for the area was excellent   

Would highly recommend

105,JP,"We had a wonderful experience there. Clean,  classy and close to Picadilly Curcus, Westminster Abby's, Buckingham Palace etc
Not on main road so quiet which is a plus. 
Staff was helpful and very pleasant!",5,2015,06,23
105,Willy Wonka tea,We had the absolute best experience here for tea. Our waiter was absolutely hands down what made our experience as enjoyable as it was. We happened to be there for Mothers Day that was in the US..when he found that out..he brought me back a carnation and a cupcake with Happy Mothers Day drizzled in chocolate on the plate. This is what I call going above and beyond. The tea and other food was delicious. I just can't say enough good....,5,2015,06,22
105,Afternoon tea,I took my daughter for a Charlie and the Chesterfield afternoon tea today. It was a celebration as she has just finished her GCSEs and what a special afternoon it was! A delicious afternoon tea in the beautiful conservatory. We loved the twist and particularly the fizzy lifting drink and Wonka bar! The staff were lovely and took a real pride in offering great customer service and making us feel special.,5,2015,06,22
105,50 year reunion at The International Student's House,"Had a wonderful 8 day stay at the hotel. Staff at the hotel are wonderful & extremely helpful, polite & courteous.
The breakfast buffet choices were adequate as were the accommodations made for special eggs ! 
Have stayed here many years ago ( 10 or more but uneventful ),but a huge difference in my present stay ! 
Will definitely stay here again & recommend the hotel to my friends 😀👍",5,2015,06,21
105,Very pleasant!,"We were in London for the first time. The Chesterfield was well located to see the tourist attractions, yet out of the fray (which we liked). The front desk was friendly and helpful, but not at all pushy with suggestions. Breakfast and dinner were both well done. The room was fairly small, but typical of London -- and very comfortable. I would choose it again.",5,2015,06,20
105,Very pleasant Mayfair hotel,"Chesterfield was exactly what we expected of a pleasant Mayfair hotel. The Chesterfield is elegant and cosy at the same time. The room was nicely decorated, good in size and we got a room with a view on the top floor that we had asked for. The breakfast was very good, both the buffet and the food we ordered. The service was inpeccable and all staff was very service minded and helpful. The location is superb in a quite area of Mayfair but still very close (walking distance)  to Green Park, Hyde park and Regent Street. We stayed for four nights and enjoyed every minute. Having stayed in many London hotels this will definately be our preferred choice next time.",4,2015,06,17
105,Free Upgrade,"We stayed at the Chesterfield during June 2015 on the evening of our wedding anniversary. When we arrived we were upgraded to one of the top suites, which came with such extra luxuries as a Nespresso machine, an i-pod dock, a decanter of sherry and a bowl of fruit. Throughout our stay we experienced excellent customer service and our perception was that nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We would most certainly stay there again and we would have no hesitation in recommending it to others who may be planning a visit to London.",5,2015,06,17
105,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent location","My first stay in this lovely hotel and it will definitely be my first choice when I'm back in London. A perfect 4 days.
Excellent reception team and concierge who were most helpful with all my questions. 
My room was spacious and modern with excellent facilities. Very comfortable bed and good pillows.
A great selection for breakfast with cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurts pastries and any hot dish you could think of.
This hotel is in a quiet area of busy London, with all attractions easily accessible. It is convenient to Green and Hyde Parks, with the Green Park underground 5-7 minutes walk away.",5,2015,06,16
105,First Ever Stay,"Have eaten here several times loved it extremely friendly staff ,my wife who wanted a few days with just me booked this as my mother goes to cartridges almost every day  and lives in Mayfair,what a stay lovely room very freindly staff great breakfast served by staff who could tell i was deaf and made the effort to talk clearly , great afternoon tea ,will come again",5,2015,06,15
105,JUST THE BEST IN LONDON,"This was our 4th visit to the Chesterfield and it just gets better and better !!
We were visiting for our 25th Wedding Anniversary and the staff just get it right - upgraded room, congratulations cards signed by all the staff, personal congratulations card from the Hotel Manager, iced cake in the room - they just make you feel so special.
We had a surprise meal booked by our sons - didn't know where at all - Tony and Darren, the concierges had helped to sort it out and Tony told us to be in reception for 7pm. He then proceeded to walk us out of the hotel, through the streets of Mayfair (all the time acting as if he didn't know which way to go !!), to a fabulous 2 star Michelin restaurant called The Greenhouse - took us in personally, introduced us - just the best service !! - ""Tony's Magical Mystery Tour ""

Letitia, the Guest Relations Manager was excellent - finding out opening hours for attractions, so professional, friendly and welcoming at check in and check out.

In the bar , there was a new member of staff - Jade - she was brilliant - a great addition to the team.

If you are staying in London you must stay at the Chesterfield - lots of hotels are good, but none have the staff and service that the Chesterfield has and it makes the difference !!",5,2015,06,15
105,"Home away from home, and then some...","Wonderfully located; extremely comfortable; excellently staffed. The room was so comfortable that it became increasingly difficult to leave it on our touring excursions. The desk staff (especially Leonor and Letitia) were outstandingly friendly and caring, as were all the bellhops and doormen (especially Michael). Learn their names and treat them like friends, they will do their best to treat you better than family. The restaurant, Butler's, is open all day serving the appropriate meal of the day - unlike many hotels, it is not a diner but a restaurant with superb cuisine and a great staff (look for Loris or Alessio). We can't speak too highly of this hotel and its staff, and we have traveled quite a bit!!!",5,2015,06,14
105,"good service, great location","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair because it is a sister hotel to the Milestone.  We were not disappointed. Staff were helpful, the location was very nice, just set back far enough from the main streets to be quiet at night, and close enough to the action to be a very convenient hotel for touring the sites of London.  While it definitely isn't an cheap hotel, you don't go to London to save money, now, do you?",5,2015,06,14
105,Afternoon Tea ,Absolutely amazing time in London. Afternoon tea thoroughly enjoyed by all. Excellent value for money. Service was faultless. Would definitely recommend. Already planning another trip to London and a return visit to The Chesterfield.,5,2015,06,13
105,Daughter's Baby Shower,"The Chesterfield Hotel came up trumps today!
We were a party of 18 and too large to be accommodated in the dining room so the wonderful restaurant manager and reservations manager booked us into The Library at The Chesterfield!
A perfect room for us all to enjoy the wonderful and delicious Charlie and The Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea!
We were wonderfully looked after by Alex and Rebecca who served us all with the tea in a calm and hospitable way - and with a great sense of humour!
Thank you Chesterfield for making my youngest daughter's Baby Shower Tea a wonderful occasion!",5,2015,06,13
105,Afternoon Tea,"Nothing was too much trouble for this team of amazing staff! The service was outstanding and well worth the service charge. Staff were immaculate,polite,courteous and extremely helpful. The Tea was excellent. Sandwiches, cakes and pots of tea replaced unlimited! Even when my son and wife turned up to say hello,they enjoyed our tea at no extra cost. Well worth a visit and we will be returning without a doubt! Made my birthday and my friends birthday perfect!",5,2015,06,13
105,Warmth in a marvelous setting,"My husband, son, granddaughter and I spent several days at this wonderful hotel as we swept to many of London's premier attractions.  The rooms were very comfortable, the breakfasts outstanding with impeccable service, as were the afternoon teas to which we treated ourselves.  The staff was beyond helpful and made us feel like honored and frequent guests though it was our first visit.  We found the location to be quite convenient to sights and transit as well.",5,2015,06,12
105,Perfect ,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in May 0f 2014 and were very pleased with our stay. Staff were very helpful, our room was very pleasant and equipped with everything we needed. And the restaurant food and service were exceptional. We had a corner room and never heard any traffic ",4,2015,06,12
105,Fabulous birthday afternoon tea for my daughter and friends,"I chose the Chesterfield Mayfair for my daughter's 14th birthday afternoon tea party and from the very first email to the end of the afternoon itself we were looked after absolutely beautifully.  Service in this hotel is second to none and genuinely warm - nothing is too much trouble for any of the delightful staff, all of whom have a permanent smile on their face.  The girls sat at a large oval table (as requested) with the welcome 'extra' touches of a lovely balloon, birthday card and little birthday cake for my daughter.  The Charlie & the Chocolate Factory tea was a massive success with endless supplies of themed cakes/savoury items, refreshed numerous times with the leftovers thoughtfully packed into boxes to be taken away.  Every member of staff knew it was my daughter's birthday and went out of their way to make her and her friends feel special.  Even the chef came out to say hello to them.  We adults left the girls to it and sat in the very nice bar where we enjoyed the live piano and had a very delicious G&T (plenty of gins to choose from).  For a super tea (whether or not you are celebrating a birthday) in a great location with exceptional service, look no further than the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2015,06,12
105,Beautiful Hotel!,"My partner and I stayed here for two nights. The hotel is in a great location, not far from Piccadilly. The staff on reception were very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. 
We had a double room on the second floor which was a decent size with all the amenities we required, TV, WIFI, hairdryer, robes and slippers, tea & coffee making facilities. There was ample wardrobe storage too and a safe for valuables. The bed was very comfy and we heard no noise from the adjoining rooms. The bathroom was a reasonable size with everything we needed; the only quibble we had was that the shower head was in a fixed position, and my fiancé was too tall to stand under it, so had to bend/kneel!
We ate breakfast in our room on both mornings we were there; it arrived promptly and was delicious. 
The staff are what really makes this hotel; everyone was friendly and couldn't do enough for us, from reception calling to make sure we had everything we needed not long after checking in, to the turn down service to the room service staff - all were brilliant. 
I would have no hesitation in staying in this hotel again in future.",5,2015,06,10
105,"Quality, Quality, Quality, The Best Afternoon Tea in Town!","At £69.00 for The Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea for Two, we were expecting something special and were very excited about the setting.  From the moment we arrived everything was Tip Top, all the staff acknowledged and greeted us warmly, the orangery style dining area was a little on the warm side and table setting was clean and precise.  Afternoon tea arrived promptly, and time was taken to explain that both the savoury and the pastry selection could be refreshed as required.  Everything was lovely, there was also a wide range of Tea available and the Will Wonka Cocoa Tea was exceptional, all finished with a Wonka Bar and an envelope with a Golden Ticket; how exciting!  The thing is.....you cannot open your Golden Ticket until you next return, if opened before it is invalid!  A very lovely, relaxed and un-rushed special tea in delightful surroundings, everything was just about as good as it gets for a high tea; a perfect place with quality everything; do try it!",5,2015,06,07
105,Deserves its high Trip Advisor ranking..,"Beautiful, elegant hotel in a quiet area of London but only a short walk to a tube station and attractions. The staff are polite and friendly with *genuine* smiles, which is a tiny but important feature to me. Our room, on the 6th floor was spacious, clean and very comfortable. I am, however, a little bit dubious about it being 'newly renovated', as described by the check in staff..? It was very nice; traditional, classic style decor (touch the walls! they're material; which helps with soundproofing) but the furniture and bathroom fittings didn't look very newly renovated to me.

However, the room had every amenity to make our stay very comfortable. A large, pristine white, comfortable bed, huge desk and mirrored wall, two wardrobes (nice!) tv with (yeay!) a clean remote in a bag! Great tea/coffee/biscuit supplies, ample toiletries, chair, table, slippers, robes, white fluffy towels, powerful shower, excellent, free wifi, etc, etc.

We had mentioned we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and on return to our room in the evening, we found cupcakes and a lovely card, individually signed by 'our Chesterfield family'. This was a lovely, personal touch and very much appreciated, thank you. We also had a note from the management to say that there was a wedding party that night and we may experience some noise. We didn't hear a thing and slept like logs.

We didn't take breakfast in the hotel so I can't comment on the quality of the restaurant. I found on booking, that breakfast would have added another £60 to our bill and I found this a little expensive. 

We greatly enjoyed our stay at The Chesterfield and I will certainly consider it again the next time we visit London.",5,2015,06,06
105,Absolute Perfection,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in May 0f 2013 and were very pleased with our stay. Staff were professional and very helpful, our room was very pleasant and equipped with everything we needed.  And the restaurant food and service were exceptional.   When we planned our trip for 2015 we knew we wanted to return to the Chesterfield and once again we were very very pleased with every aspect of the hotel.   We had a corner room and never heard any traffic noises at all.  This is a charming, gracious, lovely hotel in a very convenient location.  Just a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, yet in a quiet neighborhood.",5,2015,06,04
105,"""Perfect Location with the best Concierge team and hotel staff around!""","This was our first visit to London and the Chesterfield Mayfair. My daughter and I stayed in a Jr. Suite and my Mother and Aunt stayed in a connecting twin. The hotel staff was always ready to give any helpful information with directions, tours, maps, restaurants and anywhere you wanted or needed to go. The staff couldn't do enough- from the concierge bringing room service at crazy hours to the staff at breakfast, tea and dinner in the butlers restaurant. My daughter and I mixed up the morning breakfast schedule and arrived late but instead of the staff saying sorry but you missed it they set us up in the lounge and brought us tea, toast and a wonderful plate of pastries!!! Talk about customer service!! I will definitely go back to the Chesterfield Mayfair and would recommend them to anyone looking for a wonderful hotel in London!!  Oh and if your traveling with young children or even an older one go to the Charlie and the Chesterfield tea you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,06,04
105,Great location and top-notch service,"This was our first trip to London and we found the Chesterfield Mayfair to be wonderful.  From the moment we got out of our cab until we left four days later the staff was most attentive to our every need.  They were very helpful in recommending restaurants and giving directions.  They were even able to recommend a nearby store where we could buy a pair of ear buds.
Though located on a quiet street the hotel was a short walk from many major attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Parliament, Piccadilly Street, the Theater District, high end boutiques and many lovely parks.  An Underground station was also close by.
The complimentary breakfast was excellent with many types of breads, cereals, juices, yogurt, cheese and smoked salmon.
The Chesterfield Mayfair is definitely worth considering on your visit to London.",5,2015,06,03
105,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location","This was our first visit to London and the Chesterfield Mayfair met all our expectations. It is a lovely hotel and the staff is very attentive. The location could not be better and is within walking distance of many major sites and tube stations. The restaurant is great, both the breakfast and dinners were excellent. I would not hesitate to stay here again and can highly recommend it. We stayed in a junior suite the end of April for 10 days and enjoyed every minute of the visit.",5,2015,06,02
105,"What a lovely hotel, made for a wonderful stay!","Visited London for the first time and stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for our 8 days - what a wonderful hotel!  We had the African Suite - jr suite with a king bed, love seat, sitting area, marble bath and two showers, large closet and large desk.  Absolutely lovely!  The staff here are the best - the concierge was so incredibly helpful with recommendations/reservations for dinners, they guided us those first few days to the tube, the Shepards Market etc.  They were friendly, helpful and also greeted us in the morning and when we returned.  They provided a free breakfast in the lovely dining room, fresh linens, silverware, china and enough of a choice to get our day started well!  
I can't say enough about this hotel - highly recommend it!!",5,2015,06,02
105,"A wonderful place, a real treat","The Chesterfield is part of a group of first rate hotels in London and this was my first visit to this particular one. I was delighted from start to finish. I began my enquiries over the phone and then called it to make the booking. It all went smoothly and I got the deal I required. Even better when I arrived I was upgraded and from that moment on I felt exceptionally well looked after. The hotel is magnificent and the service was outstanding. There was a constant check to make sure I had all I needed and although there were a few glitches they were soon put right. We were warned there would be noise from next door due to a wedding on the Fri night, and indeed it was also noisy on the Sat also, which we weren't warned about, but it is largely out of the hotel's control and although it was a slight disruption it didn't spoil thing unduly. I guess this must be a recurrent problem for the hotel. Do go for a Junior Suite if you can afford it, and take up the 3 for 2 offer. It didn't seem available online when I tried booking but by calling I was given it anyway - thanks! Just one caveat, it does say that for a Junior Suite there are nightly canapes but this is not correct; first night only. The description also mentions CDs available but this didn't seem to be the case either. It is also worth pointing out that although the beds are large they are made up of two separate mattresses and this did cause discomfort one night. My upgrade to the Stanhope Suite was amazing - thanks again - I could never have afforded it otherwise. Everything was well thought about and provided for, though I would say the bathroom isn't quite up to the same standard as the rest of the suite. Nevertheless I felt completely at home, and with breakfast provided, fruit in the room and tea/coffee in abundance I was more than satisfied. Well done to all the staff, you are running a first rate hotel and I hope to see you all again soon, though I am tempted to try other Red Carnation hotels as well. . . .  spoilt for choice!",5,2015,06,01
105,Lovely hotel with excellent service,"My nearly ten year old son and I stayed there for four nights recently in London.  From the beginning, we were impressed by the extraordinary level of service.  Concierge Chris was very nice and helpful, happily offering to help us with all manner of requests, and clearly delighting in a helping a boy who was seeing London for the first time.  The rest of the staff was similarly amazing.  This is a gem of a hotel - beautifully decorated, and with the combination of the décor and the service, I felt like I was coming home each night.  Plus, the afternoon tea is not to be missed!",5,2015,06,01
105,Elegance!,"We were thrilled with our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff were so incredibly accommodating and friendly. The rooms were gorgeous, the location could not be beat. Near all of the wonderful stores on Bond Street. Walking distance to Selfridges and many tube stops. Will definitely be back!",5,2015,05,31
105,"""Brilliant Service""","My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel the evening prior to our anniversary trip to Bruges. We wanted a hotel that was centrally located and within walking distance to the restaurant Heddon Street Kitchen which we had booked for dinner. The service was evident from the moment I booked the hotel on line 2 weeks prior as we were immediately offered complimentary breakfast when I mentioned our wedding anniversary however the reviews were enough for us to book the Chesterfield. The hotel most definitely in a fantastic location off Curzon Street, and an area I had no idea existed in London, a little oasis in the middle of all the hustle and bustle - Shepherd Market. The staff were just wonderful, we felt their genuine warmth and caring nature the moment we stepped inside the hotel. We arrived around 2:50pm and even though the room wasn't quite ready, the hotel looked after our luggage whilst we popped out for a late lunch.  On first impressions, I felt the rooms lacked something, although very comfortable, I think some refurbishment (modernisation) would be the key to make the rooms 4* standard given the location of the hotel and the clientele it entertains.  I also felt the lack of a mini bar quite dissappointing however the hotel were most accommodating as they provided a mini fridge instantly. I feel the size of the room could have accommodated a mini bar. Nevertheless, it was comfy room with all the necessary amenities.We were given complimentary drinks at the bar and my husband bought an extra drink, a beer, which we were then charged £27 for! makes you think what was actually complimentary? I must admit, my husband was quite angry about this at the time. The star of the hotel is the staff!! they brought us up a lovely little cupcake decorated with Happy Anniversary and card with all the staffs' good wishes which was so touching. The breakfast next morning which we had in the room was so very welcome at 5am! (since we had to leave early for the Eurostar to Bruges) the gentleman who brought it to the room was so kind.  All in all, a good experience, the service and lovely staff would make me return to the hotel but as there are so many hotels in London to choose from, I am not sure we would stay here again...simply because we live in London and only stay overnight 2-3 times a year.",4,2015,05,31
105,Perfect End To Our Honeymoon,"The last night of our honeymoon was spent in The Chesterfield Mayfair and we were very happy that we chose this hotel.

First of all the location is perfect. Close to many of London's famous landmark's including Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park, with Westminster, Trafalgar Square and the London Eye all within walking distance. The hotel is also close to many West End theatres and restaurants. Green Park Underground is only a 5 minute walk away giving you easy access to the rest of London.

The staff were terrific. Check-in and valet parking was welcoming and efficient and we were kindly assisted to our room by a friendly gentleman. The highlight of their service was when we returned from a West End show to find a complimentary bottle of Champagne waiting for us in our room. Included was a decorated cupcake and a card signed from all the staff, which I thought was a lovely touch.

Staying in this hotel was the perfect end to our honeymoon. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to treat themselves to a special night in London.",5,2015,05,30
105,Great Hotel,Stayed for one night to celebrate a friends wedding. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The room was a decent size (for London) facilities were good. The barman who was working late makes a very good martini. Breakfast very tasty worth including in your stay. It's in a very nice part of Mayfair making it easy to get around central London. Highly recommend. ,5,2015,05,30
105,Fantastic service,"Staying over in London ahead of a 10k race. Chose the Chesterfield for its location close to the start line. From the moment we entered reception the service from all staff was superb. Room was well appointed and the bed very comfortable. For its location the room was of decent size. Having mentioned when checking in the purpose of our visit I was delighted to find a goody bag of healthy snacks in my room together with a card wishing me luck! Truly personal service. Similar story at both the bar and dining room for breakfast. Didn't have any other meals but certainly will next time.My partner ordered breakfast in our room which was delivered on time ( so unusual in my experience) . We are both gluten free and this was well catered for.

All in all a great experience and I will certainly return.",5,2015,05,28
105,Return trip,Having visited this hotel 2 years ago and found it to be a pleasant stay we desided to return for a three day break. Unfortunatly this time we were disappointed on arrival. The first three rooms we were given were not clean and looked tired. We were prepared to leave but the reception staff insisted we spoke to the manager. We were then offered a forth room which was very clean and spacious. The manager was very sympathetic and professional. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast served in our room and the lady who brought this was so very nice. Once we got over the initial problem upon arrival we had a very comfortable stay. We had a lovely complimentery afternoon tea. The bar area is very relaxing and serves very tasty Tapas. Staff at this hotel are outstanding.,4,2015,05,27
105,"Great hotel, great location","Terrific location...walking distance to many attractions, including shopping. Nice rooms but European size so slightly small. Breakfast was consistently good, and the bar is a friendly and lively place. Bar food is also a plus. Also walkable to several good restaurants.",5,2015,05,27
105,Special Place,"This was a very helpful and Accomodating hotel. Clean and friendly. Staff went out of their way to be helpful.
Bartender brought out a cupcake to celebrate our friend's birthday. Manager of restaurant got me a recipe of something I had for dinner. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to stay in a safe and warm place.",5,2015,05,27
105,england at its very best,"This delightful corner of British England has not changed in the thirty years that we have stayed here when in London. If anything, it has just got better and better. Yes, the rooms can be small (this is Mayfair after all, central London!) and the genuine British décor (Colefax and Fowler anyone) might not be for everyone, but this is the real deal: concierges who wear their Cross Keys proudly, dining staff who remember your tea preference, the chef who specially orders kippers for that particular guest. British propriety but not snobbery, friendly but not overeffusive; the right balance for your comfort and enjoyment always. And the location is excellent for all shopping and sightseeing. We will be back!",5,2015,05,26
105,Afternoon Tea,"What a fantastic afternoon tea we had here. Lovely setting, great pianist playing varied songs and excellent food.
Would recommend this to everyone who loves a traditional, tea, and the Willy Wonka Theme is fun too... Especially the gobstoppers and golden tickets!!",5,2015,05,26
105,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent  presentation, service and staff","During our recent trip we spent 4 nights at the Chesterfield. First visit to London, stayed here based on the fact that friends had already booked here.  I can now see why all the reviews I had read were so positive. Everything about Chesterfield is superb, from the location, the old world charm, but most of all the marvellous staff who could not do enough for us, but also  by just being genuinely friendly and polite. Really felt like we were at home and loved the bar which was very cosy after a busy day sighseeing. Special thanks to Michael who was so friendly & helpful, and for making our stay memorable.",5,2015,05,26
105,Fabulous hotel,"Everything about this hotel was perfect, the staff were wonderful, the breakfast was first class and for the first time ever in a hotel we didn't have to ask for anything to be replenished as the staff were there before we actually ran out of anything. The afternoon tea was amazing and again everything was topped up without having to ask . Also had delicious meal in restaurant, they went to great lengths to do me something I liked as being vegetarian and bit fussy there wasn't anything I fancied on menu but they were only too happy make sure I had something I enjoyed. Looking forward to staying again",5,2015,05,25
105,Another wonderful stay at The Chesterfield,"Our recent stay at the hotel was our second in the last 10 months, and both stays have been excellent. The hotel staff are so pleasant and welcoming, the facilities are very much to our liking, and the hotel's location (just a 10-minute stroll from Green Park tube station on Piccadilly) make this an ideal choice when visiting London; we have certainly come to the conclusion that The Chesterfield is now our first-choice London hotel. For this recent 8-night stay, we were upgraded to a junior suite on the 4th floor at the front of the hotel. We had breakfast each day in the hotel's Butlers Restaurant; this is a very pleasant place to begin the day, and the breakfast choices are wide ranging and delicious. We also had dinner there on four evenings, two of these being pre-theatre dinners at 5:30pm; the hotel offers a 2-for-1 deal at this time if you choose from the a la carte menu as opposed to the pre-theatre one, but there are plenty of choices on each, and it's good to know you can complete dinner in an hour or so before heading out to the theatre. All aspects of our stay were perfect, and we look forward to our next visit as guests of this wonderful hotel.",5,2015,05,25
105,Simply superb,"What can I say other than fabulous! Cheerful and helpful staff, lovely decor, fantastic location, tasty food, comfortable bed, great service! EVERYTHING was excellent. Great value for money, just wish I was there for more than one night. Made even more special with the gift of a birthday card and cupcake.  Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair for a truly memorable stay. ",5,2015,05,23
105,Above all expectation,"I already wrote a review about this Hotel the first time I staid there, as I'm just back from my second stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, I feel like a need to write another review to congratulate again all the staff and management for the great service provided and the wonderfull time spent with them. Even if only a second visit, we've been recognized and welcomed very warmly and we felt just like home. This time we staid for 4 days and 3 nights, all the efforts have been made to please and surprise us, everyday a special attention, great sense of details when making the room.
We also tried the restaurant for lunch which was really excellent, and I'll have to come back to try all the dishes I couldn't have this time :) amazing cheesecake, Lobster omelette, Dover sole, everything was so tasty, we also had the chance to try seagulls' eggs: exceptional!
Afternoon tea time has to be done there too at least once!!!! Great moment, delicious.
Then it's perfectly located in London, the hotel is lovely, rooms very nice, comfortable and well furnished... The place is a ""sans faute"" one!
Once again the warmest thank you to everyone in front desk, restaurant, housekeeping, bar... who made our stay one the best we had! I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,05,21
105,Business trip ,"Fantastic hotel, great service and excellent location. Room service here is impeccable and always on time with professionalism. The staff here are excellent very attentive and very helpful. Stayed here over Thursday Friday and Saturday checked out on Sunday and this hotel is the busiest I've ever seen a hotel in London. Amazed how well they were coping. Thanks will be back. ",5,2015,05,20
105,A flawless week in London,"We could not have had a better experience than we had during our recent stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  From the moment we arrived their friendly, helpful and pleasant demeanor was obvious.  We arrived early and our room was not yet available but they told us that they were upgrading us to a Junior Suite.  We went for lunch and when we came back our room was ready.  Our luggage was brought up and shortly afterward a complimentary fruit tray was brought as a welcome gift.  The room was spacious and very nicely decorated.  The bed could not have been more comfortable.
In room coffee service was an electric kettle and a french press which brewed a good cup of coffee.  No Styrofoam or plastic here, only china and glassware.  The room had a mini bar, complete service to serve wine or drinks, ample luxurious towels and all of the best of toiletries.  There is excellent WiFi throughout the hotel and a large TV.  The business center downstairs gave you free Internet access on two computers.  They even had a drawer full of office supplies.  From the plush robes to the large umbrellas, everything that you could expect was there and more.
We had breakfast in their restaurant daily which was included in our price.  There was a large buffet plus many items that you could order from the menu.  The service was quick and polite.  We had dinner there one night as well and enjoyed it thoroughly.
The hotel bar stays open quite late and there is 24 hour room service if you get hungry late at night.  I would like to especially compliment Biagio Sarubbi, their food and beverage manager, for going above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  He is a gem and shows that the attitude of their personnel is excellent from their general manager, on down.
They had turn down service every evening and left chocolate wafers on our pillows.  Any request was fulfilled immediately.  They even sent up a farewell cupcake to bid us a safe trip home.  I have traveled to many places but this stay ranks right at the top of my list for perfection.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2015,05,20
105,The True British Hidden Treasure,"The Chesterfield is by far one of the best 4 stars hotels in London. What a memorable stay. My wife and I stayed last year to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed we true English hospitality. Everyone was wonderful, from the doorman to maid.",5,2015,05,20
105,A luxurious and homely hotel,"We stayed 3 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair early May, and we certainly do not regret our choice. We return to London almost every year and stayed in this hotel for the first time. The charming atmosphere starts at reception thanks to a team of really profesional people. The room ( junior suite) was very comfortable , calm, and service excellent. Attention to guests is felt at all times, high qualty breakfast, many items served at your table , reducing the crowd at the buffet.
The hotel has a perfect location, close to metro stations, buses, shops, and traditional pubs or restaurants.",5,2015,05,20
105,The Chesterfield - We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London,"We have stayed at The Chesterfield many times  over 15 years and it has never let us down. From the minute you arrive at the front door you are greeted with genuine warmth and charm and this continues every step of the way. We live in Australia so when we arrive in London tired after the long journey it is so nice to come into such a friendly welcoming environment.
 The team at the concierge  Desk are very knowledgeable, friendly and will always do their utmost to help in any way they can.
The restaurant serves a delicious breakfast as well as Lunch & dinner and the afternoon tea is an absolute must do while in London.  The Terrace Bar is a great place to have a drink and Edgar & Manos whip up wonderful cocktails. We tried ""The Gin Experience"" great fun and something a bit different. Nice bar menu for snacks too.
All in all we highly recommend staying at The Chesterfield, Mayfair",5,2015,05,20
105,Business Trip to London,"The accommodations for this trip were arranged for us by our associates in London. The hotel was absolutely delightful. The room was great, an although small by USA room standards, more like a ""Boutique"" Hotel room it was very comfortable. The English Breakfast was tasty with many choices both on the buffet and cooked. We had dinner at Butlers Restaurant in the hotel all three nights and the food was great. Service in the bar was fantastic and the bartender makes a great Dirty Martini! Near Hyde Park, Underground stations and attractions. It was a great stay!",5,2015,05,19
105,As Delightful As Ever,Back at the Chesterfield Mayfair for the fifth time for a whirlwind theatre week in April.  Good to see some of my favorite members of the staff once again - all are terrific hotel professionals.  Always a pleasure being here - I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else on my trips to London.,5,2015,05,18
105,A gem in Mayfair,"Have recently stayed again at this lovely welcoming hotel in Mayfair again.  Sadly we only had time for one night, but it was excellent location for us to stay. For the shoppers not far from Oxford Street or the parks of London for the walkers. The room which was disabled friendly was well thought out and past comments to the hotel taken on board.  It is refreshing when companies listed to the customers feed back.  Had room service for breakfast which was of good quality and quantity.  Staff attentive and very friendly.  Hotel spotless and nothing is too much trouble.  We stayed with our beloved dog Jamie again, who was made to feel as welcome as we did.  Well done everyone and we very much look forward to our next visit.",5,2015,05,16
105,"Lovely, expensive stay in London","I stayed for three nights for work. The location was great, allowing me to have a run in the park every morning. My room (a deluxe King) was an adequate size - I can imagine that the single and basic doubles must be tiny - but had everything I needed. Ordered room service one evening which was quite OK but paid close to US $60 for a cheese sandwich and a large glass of wine. Breakfast was good and I enjoyed having a drink at the bar. The hotel seems to pay attention to small details and to anticipate very well what guests might need. I would have liked a fridge / minibar in the room. Overall a good, if expensive, experience.",4,2015,05,15
105,Superb Chesterfield,"Stayed at this wonderful hotel for a long weekend in London,with Green Park  Tube Station only a few minutes away it is easy to reach all the capital's attractions.The hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly and got us to our room quickly.The breakfasts and evening meals were top class with a very courteous and informative restaurant staff.The rooms were very comfortable and well maintained with little surprise gifts at turndown.Will use this hotel for any future London trips.",5,2015,05,14
105,Classic and classy,"Lots of attention to detail and thoughtfulness goes into their guests' stay. Very comfortable, quiet room, comfy bed, great bath and shower, big breakfast to get you going before a full day of sightseeing. Location is central and convenient to tube station or walkable to many sights, shopping and restaurants. Not a big hotel which makes for friendly, attentive and personal service. Would stay there again, happily.",5,2015,05,12
105,"Fastest, most reliable room service EVER","This hotel is conveniently located in Mayfair. Five minute walk to Underground.  Also, if you're taking any bus trips out of the city, it's a 5 minute walk to the central pick up point.  Green Park & Buckingham Palace a 10 minute walk.  Shepherds Market is around the corner from the hotel with lots of restaurant choices including traditional Pubs, Italian, French, and Persian restaurants. The Chesterfield Mayfair has the BEST room service.  They are friendly, helpful and attentive.  Also, when I needed a hypoallergenic pillow, they said it would be delivered in 5 minutes and in 4 minutes it was there.  I've never had a hotel exceed my expectations every time I made a request - extraordinary.  Even the climate control was the best I've ever experienced.  The weather was quite varied while we were in London for a week.  So, we had to use the heat as well as air conditioning.  Perfect temp combined with quiet location gave us restful nights.  Each room has a different theme so if you don't like the decor, you can ask to see another room. No cookie cutter decor here.  Only reason it's not getting a perfect score is the Reception. Experienced a few hiccups which were eventually straightened out but they didn't make it easy. I wouldn't have mentioned it except to manage expectations when checking in.  Anyway, if you're looking for a quiet location that's conveniently located with warm, friendly service, free WiFi in room, air conditioning that actually works in Europe, then check out this hotel.",4,2015,05,12
105,Luxury at its finest,An absolutely outstanding stay at 'The Chesterfield'. As soon as I stepped into the hotel I was in awe of its superiority. The reception staff gave me such a warm welcome and I felt as though I was really given the 'VIP' treatment. I couldn't fault our stay in the slightest. Our room was incredible and so luxurious. A really unforgettable weekend. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. So special.,5,2015,05,12
105,Birthday treat,"We stayed at the Chesterfield on 3rd May 2015 for one night for my husband's birthday. We were unexpectedly upgraded to a beautiful junior suite which had a seating area, high ceiling, huge four poster bed and a chandelier! There was an invigorating jacuzzi bath with an abundance of towels. We really appreciated the fresh fruit in the room and it was lovely to receive a card signed personally by the staff and a birthday cupcake!
In all our interactions, the staff were both courteous and efficient. At breakfast there was a wide choice of beautifully prepared food on offer and again the service was pleasant and also very prompt.
We would love to stay again, we do recommend the junior suite!",5,2015,05,12
105,Wonderful Wedding Day at the Chesterfield,"We chose the Chesterfield Mayfair for our wedding because we wanted a venue that was intimate, homely and had distinct character. We were absolutely delighted to find this hidden treasure in the heart of Mayfair, London. The wedding options were flexible and very easy to understand with a comprehensive range of services that could be added to at any time. On our first meeting, we had a long in depth discussion with Biagio Sararubbi and Sam Langaas and we didn’t look back! Sam and Biagio where quite simply brilliant - great attention to detail, real comprehension of what we wanted for our 60 guests, and they were so wonderful to deal with it felt like they were close friends who we had known for ages. The professionalism and kindness of Sam, Biagio and the extended team was just something we will cherish for the rest of our lives!

The team were well organised, made our guests feel well attended to and taken care of, in a friendly and approachable manner. We had our ceremony and dinner in the Royal Suite upstairs and the Conservatory for our drinks reception. All we can say is that the food was amazing, the service was 5 star and we all had a very memorable day. The hotel suite we had was just one of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed and it made our day even more special

The Chesterfield is just one of the most incredible venues in the heart of London to have a wedding, it is has an air of heritage but with an intimate charm which is just perfect. What makes this hotel unique however is the super-talented team - Sam is just so well organized, Biagio was great at helping us trial the food/wine/decorations etc – he and Sam have great judgment which we really valued. Ben is one of the most gifted Chefs in London – a true talent, who creates food which is just breathtaking and memorable – all of our guests were blown away by the quality of cooking. We had the most amazing wedding at the Chesterfied, and we give the experience 5 HUGE stars out of 5, we cannot recommend this highly enough. Biagio, Sam and the team will help you create a day to remember….we love you guys for being perfect x",5,2015,05,12
105,Another great stay,"What can I say, about this place its my secret in Mayfair. The room is clean and has everything you need. ALL the staff are attentive as always and the breakfast service in the morning is one of the best.... can't wait for my next trip to London.

Thank you ALL Chesterfield Mayfair see you soon.",5,2015,05,11
105,Golden Wedding Celebration,"Our 50th Anniversary stay at the Chesterfield exceeded all of our expectations. Nothing was too much trouble for the hotel; we were given an upgrade from a room to a suite, plus champagne, flowers, etc, and all of the staff went out of their way to make us and our guests welcome.  The hotel's efforts made our memorable occasion even more memorable, and we are enormously appreciative.",5,2015,05,11
105,Fabulous stay,"This hotel offers proper old fashioned, classic elegance and luxury. From the minute we arrived, customer care was the watch word. EVERY member of staff was courteous and friendly - even those you just passed in the corridor.

The car was taken and parked (admittedly cost nearly £50) but was dealt with efficiently and was back on the doorstep at exactly the time we asked for. 

The room was spacious, immaculate, and spotlessly clean. Bed was VERY comfy. Breakfast was delicious.

Couldn't fault this hotel. Will definitely return!",5,2015,05,11
105,Afternoon Tea,"I would like to take this opportunity to highly recommend Afternoon Tea at the Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair London. I visited with my daughter (and her baby daughter) on the 3.5.15 to celebrate her birthday. The array of sandwiches and cakes were simply delightful, bursting with freshness and so elegantly displayed. We were made to feel so very welcome and the excellent staff decorated a cake in chocolate wording (happy birthday) and brought out a cupcake with a lit candle, stood by our table and sang happy birthday to my daughter, she was so delighted! Last year I took my eighty three year old mother there , again for afternoon tea and I have to say much fuss was made over her, so special. The reason I recommend the Chesterfield, is the attention to detail and the overall care towards customers, is second to none. They simply have All their customers interests at heart, not just tourists every customer matters to the Chesterfield and we were made to feel very special. This was my third visit and my daughter and  I propose to visit every year on both our birthdays! Please take the chance and indulge on the exquisite care of the welcoming, helpful Chesterfield Mayfair. 10/10 rating!! I have also had the opportunity to spend one night at the Chesterfield, which was very indulgent but worth every penny!",5,2015,05,10
105,Perfect hotel with traditional style,We had a wonderful stay in this traditional and very charming hotel. The staff were extremely attentive and welcoming. Our room was clean with dark wood furnishings and the beds were lovely and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious with a full selection of continental and cooked breakfast made to order. The location is perfect for exploring London and is quiet without the high level of noise from traffic. I would highly recommend this hotel if you like a traditional style. We would love to stay here again.,5,2015,05,09
105,"Wonderful, comfortable Hotel",The location of this fine Hotel cannot be beaten.  Everything is at your doorstep. The room wasn't the largest I've stayed in but that's what one expects in London. Loved the heated bathroom mirror. The bath towels were the thickest I've ever used. It was all the little things which made this Hotel so enjoyable to stay in.  The service and friendliness of the Hotel staff was very good.  My future London accommodation has been secured.,5,2015,05,09
105,Birthday Afternoon Tea,"We first visited the Chesterfield last year for an afternoon tea and enjoyed it so much I decided to come back for my Birthday and use our 'golden ticket' which you are given at the end of your afternoons tea to win a prize next time you visit. We won 2 glasses of champagne!! The perfect accompaniment to the selection of sandwiches, scones and Willy Wonka themed cakes! The service is great, the setting is beautiful and the overall experience is relaxing, fun and ultimately enjoyable! I actually posted a little video clip on my instagram @lexiecarducci ️xxx",5,2015,05,09
105,5* Exemplary hotel which succeeds in all areas and should be an example to all others.,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of the most beautiful hotels we have had the pleasure at which to stay. 
My husband and I were greeted by the wonderful Natalie at the front desk who was genuinely kind, accommodating and hard working. She heard of our long journey from Tokyo and was sympathetic to us being a little early for check in. She also upgraded our room on the occasion of our 4 year wedding anniversary and we felt she was such a blessing!  
After finding our room we could not believe that it could get better... The Chesterfield Suite is superb.  Design features keeping with the true beauty/age of the hotel, king bed, bathroom with two showers,  magazines and newspapers galore,  a space of real relaxation and true luxury.  We could not have asked for more.
The breakfast was included in the rate and also was not to be missed. Full English breakfast or continental with all the silver on display; dining there we received the royal treatment and again felt the genuinely wonderful staff were the ones who made it so perfect.  
Located close to Hyde Park and Green Park as I believe the closest underground station it is a breeze to navigate London as a tourist from this location. 
On returning to our room one evening from dinner we found a card placed under our door congratulating us on our wedding anniversary, within it were lots of little notes from different members of the team; it was such a kind gesture and well received. Also on returning home to Australia we received a lovely letter from the team thanking us for our stay. 
Congratulations to the team at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  We stayed in many hotels around the world and none were truly from beginning to end 5* like yours.  
My only tip to travellers... Stay for as long as you can and don't for a second consider anywhere else! 
",5,2015,05,09
105,Afternoon tea,The afternoon tea was à wonderful experience. Everything about it was so lovely. From the delicious pastries to the beautiful little box with a fresh flower that we got with us on our way home. Excellent service made this visit to our absolutely favorit activity on our London weekend stay. I visited the Chesterfield Mayfair with my 13-year-old daughter and she loved it as well.,5,2015,05,08
105,Lunch at the Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair,"My wife and I had booked lunch in the Chesterfield Hotel to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. Excellent first class hotel. The service is second to none and the staff very efficient and friendly.
We ordered the Sea Bream, never had it before but what an excellent choice with Hollandaise Sauce. The sweets where as we expect marvellous.
The staff made it a very special occasion couldn't have asked for anything better. Pink Champagne and a Red Coronation for my wife.
Well Done! We love the Red Coronation Hotel Group.",5,2015,05,08
105,The Chestershire Mayfair Hotel is a jewel,"Outstanding staff, warm, friendly, helpful. Whenever I am in London I will stay at this hotel. Cozy bar. Great location, could walk to most of the places I wanted to visit, including the theater. Good food. Hotel is kept in pristine condition. The rooms are a little small, that is why I gave four stars instead of five.",4,2015,05,06
105,Premium hotel in a great location,"If you want to spoil yourself in London but without breaking the budget then this is the hotel to choose. The environment, location, decor and most importantly, the staff, made our stay memorable. Nothing was to much trouble. The rooms are not large but very clean. The breakfast was excellent. If we come back to London then we will come back to this hotel.",5,2015,05,05
105,Excellent And Luxurious Place to Stay,"I am due to go back to visit this stunning Hotel in a few days, but just wanted to write this review to remind myself of just how beautiful my stay was back in January. I stayed for 2 nights as I was on a course for 2 days. 

As The Chesterfield is situated in Central London, I arrived very late after work and one of the porters was kind enough to inform me that they would be able to sort out parking my car (in the NCP car park ) for me in the morning, which meant I got an extra hour's lie in.

The room I was in, was stunning and luxurious, the staff are incredibly polite and couldn't do enough for me and the group I was with. To be honest, its been many months, since I slept in such a beautifully comfortable bed and I had the best nights sleep ever.

I am so looking forward to going back at the end of this week to luxuriate in the beautiful bath and the beautiful bed. 

Thank you all at the Chesterfield Mayfair, can't wait to see you all very soon. <3",5,2015,05,04
105,Mixed review,"-3 nights
-Business trip with my grandfather  
-Classic king/twin room
-First time at the Chesterfield Mayfair 

Positive points:
Friendly and attentive service 
Excellent location 
Excellent breakfast
Fine food and drinks 

Negative points:
Small rooms 
Small bathrooms with unpractical shower systems 
Horrible views (see pictures)
Room service (example: a plate of pasta served with small pots of ketchup and mayonnaise(!?!), without Parmesan, without bread, without water...for a 4-star hotel in Mayfair (!?!?). Breakfast in our room at 5:45am was poor: 2 mini croissants, 3 toasts, with jam and....ketchup and mayonnaise). 

Conclusion: 
We're usually deceived by four-star hotels in London. However, I would like to give this hotel another chance. 
My grandfather will stay at the Sofitel next time. 

",3,2015,05,02
105,Average four star hotel,"Nothing really special about this hotel. Most of the taxis drivers don't know about this hotel and you need to show them the address. Service was okay. Room was quite small. We had the junior suite and still no sofa, just two small and uncomfortable chairs. Bathroom, on the other hand, was quite good. Did not have room service because room was too small.",3,2015,05,01
105,Excellent hotel with small rooms,"The Chesterfield Mayfair has impeccable service, good breakfasts, fantastic location. The standard room was very small. We had a reservation that included an upgrade if possible but it turned out that they did not upgrade us.",4,2015,04,30
105,Perfect London hotel,We have visited the Chesterfield many times now and just returned from another superb stay. The hotel is in the best possible location rooms great service excellent we would never stay anywhere else in central London,5,2015,04,30
105,AMAZING STAY!,"We have been at Chesterfield a couple of weeks ago and it has been a wonderful experience. First of all : POSITION is incredible, close to Piccadilly, Oxford street, Bond street, Green Park, Buckingham Palace and ... Green Park metro station which connects you to everything else in london is whorthy to see :)! 
We stayed in Myfair Suite which was super-clean and lovely, you could perceive the right british atmosphere, the bathroom with both shower and bath was full of comforts and amenities. 
The top was reached with the high-quality breakfast and wonderful AFTERNOON TEA, you have to try it even if you won't stay there. You will spend a fantastic british afternoon experience.",5,2015,04,30
105,Extremely good afternoon tea,"We had a wonderful afternoon tea for a friends hen do.  The food was brilliant, with a Charlie & The Chocolate Factory theme.  Beautiful decor, great service, including the offer of a (very well presented) doggy bag, and the pianist even took requests.  I almost stopped short of 5 stars because one of our waiters was a tiny bit clumsy, but I actually find that kind of thing quite charming.  And it was excellent value for money.",5,2015,04,30
105,Almost got five stars from me,"The only thing that kept me from giving the hotel 5 stars was the haughty night desk manager and the bellman.  First the good.  The hotel is well placed close to either Green Park or Hyde Park Corner Underground station on a relatively quiet street.  Walking distance to many of the sites.  It is nicely appointed with an old-world charm, but doesn't feel outdated or worn at all.  We had a king bed which was very comfortable.  The wifi is free (yay) and fast enough for email and basic web-browsing.  The bathroom was large and really nice, with an especially nice shower (rare in London), with plenty of hot water at the ready.  We had tea in the restaurant and it was delightful.  Highly recommended.  Now to the minor complaints.  I was traveling with my brother and we had booked a king bed, but I was hoping I could talk them into two singles instead.  When I asked if they had a different room the night desk manager literally looked down his nose at me and told me they had a king bed for us.  Didn't say ""I'm sorry, but this is the best we can do"" or anything nice like that... just put on a superior air and glared at me.  Now to the bellman... our room was on the third floor and next to some back stairs that we preferred to use instead of the elevator or the main stairs.  But we had to dodge the bellman, because for whatever reason I can't imagine he took it as his personal duty to make us use the elevator or the main stairs.  Literally chasing us down the hallway when we tried to use the back stairs.  Like I said, minor complaints.  You won't be sorry you booked this hotel.",4,2015,04,27
105,This Place is Special,It is somewhat difficult to describe the experience at the hotel because everything is first class.  I told the front desk staff that staying there make me feel like a millionaire.....and that is so true.  They staff have the highest level of customer service and they go out of their way to show that.  The Mayfair is part of a group of hotels in a group called RCH or red carnation hotels.   No request is too small for them nor too large; they will do their best to satisfy.  The rooms are nicely furnished and the breakfast superb.  The location is in Mayfair near embassies and a restaurant area called Shepards (sp)  Market.  We eat there often when staying at the hotel.,5,2015,04,27
105,Wonderful as Always,"I stayed here for a few days and found it every bit as warm and hospitable as always. They really do take good care of you and go out of their way to be helpful and informative, which is so important when traveling alone.
My only complaint is that those in the room next to mine were very loud. I don't know if it was because there was a door for it to be an adjoining room, I just don't remember the walls seeming so thin before. I didn't complain to management because fortunately they weren't there often. Other than that, it was wonderful and I look forward to returning there next month.",5,2015,04,25
105,Amazing afternoon tea! ,"Me and my friend came to London in March for a short trip and one of the things we were so excited for was afternoon tea.
It took us a good few weeks to find the perfect tea but I am so glad we picked this one, and with the fact that it was a themed tea (Willy Wonka) this made the experience even better!
The scones were just beautiful and a few different varieties in the sandwich was just amazing! And the Willy Wonka treats were also amazing! 
The service we received was superb, the waitress kept checking to see if we wanted any more sandwiches etc, and topping up our tea. 
To top the trip off we received a gobstopper treat to take with us and was also told to help ourselves to the sweet jars, oh and not to mention we also got a golden ticket! 
I really couldn't fault this place, really amazing, if we visit again would definitely love to come here, great value for money and really delicious food! Thank you :)",5,2015,04,25
105,Great Place to stay!,"I enjoy with my family to stay at this hotel. Stuff is friendly. Breakfast was great. Room service was great . Will stay next time again. Best location, close to a lot of sightseeing. We had a suite and had enough space for three of us. The street is quiet and neat.",5,2015,04,24
105,Afternoon Tea was a Fantastic Experience!,"We stayed at this hotel's sister hotel, the Montague on the Gardens, so I can't comment on the accommodations but the high tea at this hotel was a definite highlight of our London trip. The service was incredible, the food absolutely delicious and the tea was fantastic (my selection recommended by our awesome waiter, William). We had such a lovely time leisurely drinking our tea and sampling all of the delicious items. The little take-away box with goodies was so thoughtful too. Pricey but worth every penny. Highly recommended and kudos to their wonderful staff.
-From the happy couple from Canada",5,2015,04,22
105,Exceeded all my expectations,"I stayed here as a treat for my sister and booked two rooms online. I completely messed up the booking and within hours received an email from the Hotel checking that I had made the correct booking (which I had not). I rang and spoke to a REAL person and they were able to change the booking. From the moment we arrived at the hotel to when we left we were treated so well and made to feel special that it made our stay a real pleasure. We spent one evening in the bar with other members of my family and although they were busy, seats were found and we had a great time. The rooms were small but beautifully presented and felt very luxurious. I thought the prices were outrageous but I am more used to something a little more economical. Downsides? nothing I can think of. Thank you for all the little things that made our visit go well and my sister was very impressed.",5,2015,04,21
105,Fantastic from start to finish!,"My Husband & I along with our friends booked the special deal of the romantic package to celebrate two 50th birthdays and our anniversary, the deal was excellent, it included champagne in the room, papers, afternoon tea and a late checkout on the Sunday. We were extremely lucky and both upgraded to junior suites.  Nothing was to much trouble for the staff, but the extra touches they did for us made us feel so special, a hand signed anniversary card along with a small cake made you feel they really cared about us.  The hotel is so beautiful and full of character, the restaurant, bar, library are just so welcoming and at no time are you rushed to move on.  We would certainly recommend this hotel whether it is for business or pleasure there would be no disappointment!",5,2015,04,21
105,Ompa lumpa tea,"I came here for my sister hen do, for afternoon tea must say the service was excellent. We were looked after by Alex a very helpful gentleman, he was more than happy to help us. As we were such a large group of 15 ladies he made sure that he met our needs, with topping up out tea and sandwhiches.  

One negative was that he didn't pay much attention to my sister the bride to be, she was not happy with his response time for with her. Kept forgetting to get her water and top up her tea, she commented the sandwhich where stale but she loved the sweet. 

The venue is beautiful the staff are really friendly, I spoke to one lady at reception she was really nice took the time to chat to me. Overall for afternoon tea its value for money, the staff are great would visit again and recommend this to more of my 15 friends.",5,2015,04,20
105,Just fantastic,My daughter and I went to stay at the Chesterfield Hotel for a long weekend. Everything about the hotel was perfect and the service was outstanding. Staff were so helpful and friendly. Felt like a (luxurious) home from home. The afternoon tea is well worth trying too.,5,2015,04,20
105,Classy Establishment,"Two nights here whilst meeting up with friends staying in other parts of London.
Having passed this hotel many times and being aware of its reputation, decided to use it for this short trip and was not disappointed. 
The single room was rather small, although not excessively so. It was very well maintained and tastefully decorated and the exceptionally comfortable bed provided a restful night's sleep. All the usual facilities including mini bar, tea and coffee making and flat screen TV. Very good shower in bathroom. My room was at the rear of the hotel, so external noise was very limited, and was blessed with respectfully quiet neighbours! 
The single rates at weekends are very reasonable, helped by having dedicated single rooms , unlike many large chain hotels. I thought the package was good value, particularly considering the standard of the hotel and its location. True, breakfast is not included, and although I'm sure it is very good it is a little pricey, but there are plenty of establishments within walking distance if you prefer.
The surrounding area is very pleasant and relatively quiet for the West End, though there are a myriad of attractions within easy reach on foot, by taxi or public transport. The  ""Chesterfield"" is a peaceful haven to return to after a busy day's shopping or a visit to the more bustling atmosphere of theatreland.
Front desk service exemplary at all times.
If you are looking for a quintesssentially English style of hotel, this is a perfect choice.",5,2015,04,19
105,Anniversary celebrations made even more special,"Booked the Chesterfield Mayfair via Secret escapes for our pearl wedding anniversary. My husband had ordered roses and chocolates for our arrival. When we checked in we were informed that as this was a special occasion we had been given a free upgrade to a junior suite. We were thrilled with this, the room was very spacious and beautifully decorated.
When we returned later that evening the staff had left an anniversary card, hand signed by all the staff plus a celebratory cup cake, which was another lovely touch.
We booked afternoon tea for the Sunday and this was amazing. So many choices of teas and the sandwich and cake selection was marvellous.
All of the staff were really friendly and helpful.
Thank you Chesterfield at Mayfair, we will be back soon",5,2015,04,19
105,Just Perfect!!,"Great service, clean rooms, efficiant staff, wonderfull area, close to Green and Hyde Park,circled by lots of intimate coffee shops and restaurants, 1.5K on foot from Soho and Covent Garden. Will come back for sure..",5,2015,04,18
105,Excellent!!,"We loved the Chesterfield Mayfair from the moment we arrived. After check-in, which was welcoming, friendly and professional, we were shown to a beautifully decorated room with all the amenities and more. Breakfast was excellent as was location close to the Green Park tube station. It was my mum's birthday and we were particularly impressed that all the staff signed a card and left a little gift in the room. It made our stay very special. We have booked again for some Christmas shopping later in the year",5,2015,04,17
105,Love this Hotel,"This is one of my fav hotels in the world. A great boutique right in the heart of the West End in London located in Mayfair. A lovely little, comfortable, elegant hotel. The rooms are so comfortable and for London, decent size. A great bathroom with a real shower and big, bath towels not to mention such comfortable beds, work desk, plenty of outlets and even french press coffee in room with real ground coffee!! Hotel is clean and nice, staff is so friendly and professional, couldn't want for more.",5,2015,04,16
105,Superb!,"The Chesterfield is a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location! Staff are eager to please and want to ensure that guests enjoy their stay. Breakfast is a culinary delight and the service is superb. Dinner is to be enjoyed; menu is varied and quality of food is five star.

An extra delight ; Easter Sunday a personalized Easter egg was placed in our room!

Our waitress at breakfast ( unfortunately,  her name  eludes us ) was so helpful, pleasant and attentive to all our requirements. She is a star who deserves special recognition.",5,2015,04,15
105,Great Location 7 Service,"This hotel was super close to most of the attractions for us.  The service was great as well as the amenities.  It was pretty cool to have both sparkling and still water at your finger tips.  The rooms were nice, and the pullout was even very comfortable which was a first.  I definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,15
105,For the solitary traveller too!,"I've just completed my second stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. This time I was alone, not with family, and was interested to see whether this experience would be as agreeable as the first, family trip. It was. Unlike some establishments that treat the single traveller as some sort of unwelcome intruder, the Chesterfield couldn't have been more accommodating. In this review, I'd like to single out the Concierge staff. Two examples of service above and beyond: I asked for a referral to a local restaurant. The Concierge knew exactly where to make the reservation. Not only was the food excellent but they too treated a single diner with respect and grace (see separate review of the Boudin Blanc.) it was not the least bit ""touristy"" and I had no sense that the concierge was ""just"" sending me there out of habit. The second example, I asked where I could find a certain, high quality, product that I could be sure was the real article and not a substandard copy (product safety was a concern.) Rather than simply referring me to a large chain, the concierge called the person in the hotel who was a subject matter expert. He got the name of the best shop from him and gave me detailed directions. Deeply appreciated. A quick word about the restaurant. They too were very attentive and ensured that I finished my meal in plenty of time to keep my appointments, without any sense of being rushed. Yes, the Chesterfield has truly lived up to my expectations.",5,2015,04,15
105,Birthday,"From the time you enter the hotel you are met with warm and friendly staff. Very good experience and would highly recommend. We booked via Secret Escapes and got a good deal on the price, which included £100 meal allowance. Plenty of food on offer at breakfast.",5,2015,04,15
105,Really great service and awesome location,"I went to London with some friends and my colleague somehow found this hidden gem on the internet. The staff is really friendly and helpful. It started when we arrived quite early and we didn't thought we could already check in, but they made our rooms ready right then. Also during the stay there was no flaw in the service and the rooms are quite large for London standards.",5,2015,04,14
105,"Great London Hotel, great staff, location","I stayed here with my daughter.  The rooms are not large but fine for two and very comfortable.  The bed was unbelievably great.  We arrived from the US at 8am and our room was ready- how great is that!  The staff were so nice and helpful.  They helped us with activities, directions, restaurants etc.  The location is great- close to Buckingham Palace, Bond Street etc.  We walked everywhere.... I would stay here again at a moments notice.  Thank you for making great memories!",5,2015,04,14
105,Wonderful London weekend break,"Love this hotel.  The service, the location, the ambience.  A good quality hotel with a friendly atmosphere.   Will be recommending to family and friends. And we will definitely be back as I went to try the set 3 course lunch menu.",5,2015,04,14
105,Pity about the building works,"Hotel good, I'm well travelled and this hotels service was there with the best but so disappointed at being woken at 8am by building works. We didn't know they were taking place before our visit and although not at the hotel itself was very very close. We did receive an apology via an email but nothing after that from my reply. The lady on the reception was ""covering"" and although I did feel for her, our checkout was far from professional as I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. The room was comfortable as was the bed, pity we didn't get to stay in it longer!  Take the building work away and I would definitely recommend it.",4,2015,04,14
105,Wonderful Wedding,"Having experienced country weddings with my two other children, when my son and his bride decided to get married in London I wasn't sure what to expect. I need not have worried the team at the Chesterfield Mayfair were excellent, everything went like clockwork and nothing was too much trouble. The food for the wedding breakfast and the evening buffet was delicious. The atmosphere was so warm and friendly, we were all very relaxed and couldn't have enjoyed the day more. Thank you to them all for making the day and our stay so special!",5,2015,04,13
105,Afternoon Tea at Chesterfield Hotel,"Amazing experience very comfortable with a three year old. He really enjoyed the cakes. The food was really nice and the host was very helpful. Overall would love to go again. My little boy was delighted when he received a cute teddy from the host, the atmosphere was friendly and warm. Willy Wonker paid a visit to all the tables, which was an added treat. Nice piano music in the background.",5,2015,04,12
105,Wonderful Hotel in a Great Location,"Excellent location just of Berkley Square made it so easy to walk to all the main places in central London (e.g. Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, theatres, Houses of Parliament, Covent Garden, etc.). Very friendly staff who made us feel most welcome; nothing was too much trouble for them. Exceptionally comfortable room, which had a music theme decor. Finally, delicious breakfasts - as superb choice. We couldn't ask for or have expected any more for our holiday. We will certainly return to the Chesterfield when next in London.",5,2015,04,12
105,Gin tasting,"We had experienced beer and wine but not heard of gin tasting.  What a wonderful palate experience.  Jade was educational and entertaining at the same time.  I would recommend this experience. All of the bar staff is wonderful, engaging and inquisitive about you.  They all make you feel like you are the most important person at that exact moment.",5,2015,04,11
105,What a special place!,"I booked the Charlie and the Chesterfield afternoon tea for a birthday surprise, and wasn't disappointed! The hotel itself is gorgeous and from the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome. Every member of staff gave 5* service and were so friendly. Lydia, our server, was an absolute star and so friendly!
The afternoon tea is the best I have had by far! Endless supply of cakes, sandwiches and scones. You also start off with a cute little fuzzy lifting drink, and as I don't drink tea they made me a gorgeous mystery non-alcoholic cocktail. Hibiscus and passion fruit, yum!
Nothing was too much trouble for Lydia and she should be congratulated on her customer service!
I highly recommend this afternoon tea!",5,2015,04,10
105,Tranquil oasis in bustling Mayfair,"4 night stay end of March. Excellent service and friendly helpful staff in all areas. Charming and cosy bar with relaxed ambience and serving tasty well prepared bar food. Loved that they have a piano player, not intrusive and open to requests. 
Delicious breakfasts top quality bacon. Ideal and quiet location for Mayfair's bars, restauraunts and green park tube station. Not stayed here before but will definietly stay again.",5,2015,04,07
105,Mother /Daughter trip,"Thine Chesterfeld staff as friendly and helpful.  We stayed for four nights and had exceptional service throughout.  The location is idea, close to so many attractions and major Tube lines.  Breakfast and WiFI were a great bonus.",5,2015,04,05
105,"Outstanding stay, Exceeded all Expectations, much improved, Well done and Thank you!","Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was a combined anniversary and birthday celebration for my wife and I, and feel its very important to let them know how exceptionally good it was ASAP, as our last stay wasn't so good and I let them know that time pretty quickly how poor it was, so credit where credit is due, and here goes. 

Check in was a breeze, where everyone was happy and smiling, Our complementary upgraded room was very appreciated, but complementary aside, its well worth the extra money! Beautiful decor, very comfy bed, superb room service, and breakfast in the room was probably one of the best I've ever had, Seriously it was! so please pass a thank you on to the breakfast staff.

Everyone could not do enough for us, and you could see It was genuinely sincere as a lot of the staff did not know we were return guests.

My wife and I travel the world an awful lot, and this experience was truly one to remember, I've stayed at the Dorchester, the Mandarin Oriental, the Mayfair plus many more and this was just so much better and more intimate, so don't waste time with the others and stay here!

With this in mind I would just like to thank Oliver and his team, it was a great stay and all involved deserve a pat on the back for just knowing how to do things right.

So, Thank You very much, and will without doubt, will be our new London Hotel!",5,2015,04,03
105,Chocolate afternoon tea,"As a treat, I took my mum and 7 year old daughter for the chocolate afternoon tea. We had an amazing afternoon, the staff were friendly and courteous and 'Willy Wonka' coming to chat to my daughter made her afternoon. The children's tea is very good value and we had so much food, we bought some home in a nicely presented box.",5,2015,04,01
105,Exceeds every time!,"I choose always to stay here when visiting London as the staff always make you feel so special, smiles are the norm! On my last visit I was meeting my niece in Covent Garden, prior to a show at the Albert Hall and was running late.Consequently as I checked in I remarked I would have to leave the luggage with the Concierge because it was a birthday treat for her and I didn't have time to go to my room..
When we returned in the evening we had cocktails in the beautiful terrace bar listening to the Pianist. Imagine her surprise and delight (and mine!) when, on going to her room, she found a card signed by all the staff and a Birthday Cake. All this from a passing remark on check in - this demonstrates one of the things which make this hotel such a gem.

105,Perfect location in London,Great hotel for a family visiting London or a business trip close to lots of great restaurants. The service is terrific and the rooms are cheerful.  London is the most fun city to live in - lots of museums and parks to explore.,5,2015,03,27
105,Very nice place,"We stayed at Chesterfield for 4 days. Its not easy to find such a nice and pleasant place in London. Nice room, central location, very professional and friendly staff. We specially liked the bar with very nice atmosphere and good snacks.
The only problem- the taps in the bath and sink. Should be fixed and replaced.
Otherwise - perfect!",5,2015,03,27
105,Chocolicious,"The staff are incredibly welcoming, attentive and helpful. We opted to have champagne and it was delicious. I couldn't manage to eat all the sandwiches, cakes and scones, each of them the best I have ever had. I would definitely come back again and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking of coming here. Don't think, just go!",5,2015,03,26
105,Afternoon tea.,"had a lovely afternoon with family at the Chesterfield hotel. 
We had afternoon tea the selection of food, teas & Champagne made it such a wonderful day. 
It was a Charlie & The Chocolate themed afternoon tea and all the added details made it special like the wonka bars the little fizzy drink and finished off with the golden ticket at the end of the day. 
We were offered more food and was glad the selection was not limited as some other places are. 
Service in this hotel was really professional, polite and friendly. 

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,03,25
105,A lovely relaxing weekend break,"My other half and I stayed at The Chesterfield Hotel for the first time. It was absolutely wonderful.  The staff could not do enough for us, everyone was so friendly and professional.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, our room was so comfortable.  We would  have no hesitation in recommending.  We can't wait to stay there again!",5,2015,03,24
105,Wonderful stay. Excellent location.,"Having lived in London for 5+ years, my husband and I thought it would be nice to come back for a little getaway, a trip down memory lane. I know Mayfair area quite well and love its location, so conveniently located near Hyde Park, Green Park and just a 15 minute walk to both Oxford Street as well as Piccadilly Circus. You cannot be more central!

I must have mentioned at time of booking that our stay was a special occasion, as upon arrival to our beautifully appointed room we found some nice little welcome back treats, such as box of chocolates. This little gesture just shows the attention to details their reservations team pays. 

What I love most about our stay is that all their staff– from front desk to the restaurant and housekeeping – seem to understand that it is important that their guests feel at home, you are called by your name instead of by room number which is such a small detail, but it makes a huge difference.

We would definitely recommend The Chesterfield Mayfair to friends and family visiting London.  London hotels are pricy, especially in an exclusive area such as Mayfair, but a stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair is well worth every penny you spend.",5,2015,03,24
105,Afternoon Tea in style,"We enjoyed one of the famous afternoon tea events at the Chesterfield Hotel during our stay in London.
The staff was very professional yet warm, friendly and eager to assist.  The luxurious and stylish British décor and divine refreshments was absolutely awesome.  The interesting variety of very special kinds of tea was, as the saying go, the cherry on top! Thank you to the wonderful staff at Chesterfield Hotel, you gave a much deeper dimension to my visit in London.",5,2015,03,23
105,"Fabulous hotel, Fabulous staff","What a find ! We have just come back from a two night stay here and it certainly won't be our last visit. Everything about the hotel is superb beautiful clean rooms, even the standard rooms are beautiful, a wonderful restaurant, all added to by the excellent staff who waited on you from the moment you arrived. Nothing was too much trouble. The attention to detail in this hotel was second to none.
Very well situated for both sightseeing and shopping.",5,2015,03,23
105,Sublime space in Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a wonderful, historic property with traditional British charm. You can tell the staff enjoys working there maybe more than the guest enjoy staying there. They are warm, friendly and eager to assist. I traveled there for a business meeting and found the meeting room to comfortable, having all the modern amenities such as WiFi, projectors and such without losing its charm. The rooms are spacious for such a property, sometimes historic hotels are a little bit snug. That was not the case here. I love dark wood and tapestries in the room. I can live or die by the bed and bath. The tub is one of those deep, old style (but very nice and updated) ones that you can submerge yourself in. The bed and bedding were ultra luxurious. I imagine this might be the closet thing to sleeping on a marshmallow I will experience. I wish I had more time to ask for the retailer of those pillows. The location is perfect. Walk one way and you are at Oxford Street and the other and you are at Hyde Park and Harrod's with plenty of small shops and restaurants in between.",5,2015,03,20
105,Our home from home,"The Cheterfield is unique in that it can combine all the facilities one expects from a big commercial hotel and yet has the attention to detail and intimacy of a  family run  hotel.
I've often described it as our ""home from home""",5,2015,03,19
105,Fairytale night in classy hotel,Magic!  We were overwhelmed with the fantastic service and special attention to detail at this  beautiful central hotel in London!  Our 1 year old son was with us and they prepared a special gift bag for him and cosy slippers.  We were also invited to a cupcake demonstration with a chef the following day.  The room service was excellent!  I would easily recommend this hotel to someone!,5,2015,03,19
105,Fabulous stay,"The service at hotel began the moment we pulled up outside in the taxi. A nice chap asked our name and luggage promptly taken inside. The team on reception greeted us very warmly. They asked in conversation our reason for visiting and I said it was a treat for my daughter as she had just graduated as a nurse with a first. They all congratulated her and off we went to our room. We had the Garden room and it was beautiful, there was a bit of construction outside but it wasn't a problem with noise. That evening we went out and on our return a little card was under our door addressed to my daughter. It was a congratulations card signed by 8 of the staff! That was sooo nice of them and we had two lovely cupcakes too. We would like to give a special mention to, Letitia and Chris on reception, Biaggio who was so nice and Selmon in the bar who kept us supplied with twigglets. In fact all the staff where so friendly and warm. I will definitely go there again on our next trip. Thanks everyone.",5,2015,03,19
105,Perfect stay away,"My husband and I have stayed here a few times and always have a great time. The location is amazing and you cannot get any better. We love the friendly warm service from all the staff, from the moment you walk in, all those you encounter in the hotel, until the moment you leave. The rooms have always been incredibly comfortable and luxurious, and always with good nights sleep. Our absolute highlight is the breakfast and being able to order it to the room – the best way to start your day! Absolutely love this hotel and will stay there without a doubt every time when we’re back in London. I'd recommend it to everyone.",5,2015,03,19
105,Cherry on top ♥,"Visiting from South Africa, we had 10 days filled with new and exciting experiences from the moment we landed at Heathrow right up until boarding the plane again.
But one of the most amazing parts of our trip was our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.
We were treated like royalty and friendly staff was at our every beck and call. My little brother could not understand where our waiter magically appeared from every time he just thought about pouring himself some more tea. Rooibos tea , i might add. Making us feel right at home.Thanks for a delightful stay.",5,2015,03,19
105,The MOST AMAZING Afternoon Tea EVER!!,"My sister and I had afternoon tea in this hotel end of January. It was the best afternoon tea I have ever experienced, from the food, selection of teas, Champagne and the service made it such a wonderful day. It was a Charlie & The Chocolate themed afternoon tea and every detail was covered to make it such a memorable day. 
We were offered more food and was glad the selection was not limited as it usually is in other places I have visited. 
You get a 'golden ticket' at the end which added to the fun! I would highly recommend this. We were seated in the conservatory which was lovely and set the mood. 
The service was amazing as usual in this hotel and we were made to feel amazing. 
Will I go back? Without a doubt - I cannot stop talking about this to my friends! Highly recommended :)",5,2015,03,18
105,Best hotel and service ever!,"I have stayed at The Chesterfield a couple of times and I have nothing negative to say about it. Great facilities, extremely clean, cosy rooms, fantastic atmosphere, etc. A special remark for service; all the staff are extremely helpful and very friendly. they will always make you feel like at home and they always strive to give the best service. The food at the restaurant is amazing. I have tried several dishes and they are all just delicious! Good selection of wines too. Try the afternoon tea as well. I would highly recommend the Chesterfield to anyone staying in London. All in all a great hotel.",5,2015,03,18
105,Splendid,"Really enjoyable stay here in February 2015, together with my wife. We really couldn't fault the service, from reception to dinner service. The dinner was lovely, with explanations too about the food & suitable wine suggestions

The room was very comfortable and a very relaxing stay. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,03,18
105,Perfection at the very least,"I arranged for me and fiance to stay at the chesterfield mayfair to celebrate our two year anniversary, the service was exceptional and the prices were very competitive for the area of Mayfair. We both loved our room with a Beautiful view and very clean trendy design",5,2015,03,18
105,Who let the dogs out,"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves for Valentines weekend and the unanimous choice was the Chesterfield.  Weekend started on a great note as, for the first time, we flew into London City Airport on an excellent BA flight.  A short train /tube hop and we were at Park Lane and on our way to the Chesterfield.  We were greeted warmly on arrival and there was a lovely sense of familiarity as the staff popped out to say hello and welcomed us back.  We were meeting up with some friends and had a really lovely lunch in the refurbished bar.  (The dog motif cushions have been replaced although the barman said he still gets asked everyday where they were and if the old ones are  available to buy)  Our room was fabulous with the novelty of twin bathrooms.  As always on city trips we walked everywhere and had no difficulty getting to Buckingham Palace (always a must for my wife on a London trip), Kensington, Hyde Park, the West end  from the hotel.   The V&A museum was a particular hit and if you can, try and avail of a guided tour which really brought the exhibits to life. Went to see the Commitments ( thoroughly recommend although a lot of 'Dublin' wit.  Back in the hotel, we were treated to the Valentines cocktail which rounded off one of those perfect days.
Thanks once again to the Chesterfield gang who added immensely to a really enjoyable weekend",5,2015,03,18
105,My go to hotel in London,"Have stayed in the Chesterfield on several occasions when in business in London and I will not be changing any time soon. Amazing staff, amazing location and personal touches that other hotels can not match.",5,2015,03,18
105,Faultless,Full marks to The Chesterfield. Wonderful service. Friendly attentive staff who make you feel welcome and special. A spur-of-the-moment request for an extra bedroom was organised in the blink of an eye as if by magic. Beautiful bedrooms. Outrageously good breakfasts. Another jewel from the Red Carnation group.,5,2015,03,18
105,Loved every second,"I stayed recently at The Chesterfield for my boyfriends birthday, and we were both so happy with smiles our faces from check-in to check-out.

Every member of staff is so affectionate and accommodating, their company motto 'no request to large, no detail to small' is definitely always in practice.

Beautiful room, every aspect connoting luxury. We also had the surprise of 'welcome' chocolate dipped strawberries, and a plate of fresh fruit.

The whole hotel has such a relaxed atmosphere, you forget you're in the city. We had a wonderful evening meal and breakfast. May my return to the Chesterfield be as soon as possible.",5,2015,03,17
105,A lovely haven away from the maddening crowd!,"I was overwhelmed with the amount of hotels to pick from when organising a weekend away in London and spend a considerable amount of time reading reviews. The reviews for The Chesterfield were good and after my stay I was so so pleased I had picked this hotel.

The staff are all so so polite and helpful they could not be faulted. The room was lovely, well furnished, well decorated and quiet. 

A very relaxing bar with a wonderful selection of cocktails available. 

Breakfast, which is very important to my husband !! , was probably one of the best we have ever had - well stocked buffet selection and a good choice for your cooked breakfast. Excellent.
Will definitely have no problem in recommending The Chesterfield and hope to return. Thank you.",5,2015,03,17
105,Wiily Wonka Tea Party,Went with friends to the Willy Wonka Tea Party. Restaurant very busy  and very welcoming. At £ 34.50 per head £ 41.50 if you have a glass of champagne you are definitely paying London prices.The Sandwiches and Scones are miniscule and to be fair were okay. The cakes were a huge disappointment. I had very nice coffee but some of the teas were not liked. On top of the price there is of course service charge. We then went into the bar again very comfortable and welcoming. The drinks definitely London prices. Maybe I have been living too long in the country !,5,2015,03,17
105,My favourite place to stay,"The hotel is immaculately clean,the staff are charming and the food is excellent. There are few places better than this anywhere.
I normally avoid hotels wherever possible but am always delighted by the CHESTERFIELD",5,2015,03,17
105,The Definition of Classic Service,"This is the first time I have had the pleasure of staying at any Red Carnation property. A very close friend recommended the Chesterfield Mayfair to me. I owe this friend a great deal....
From the moment we arrived, the classic and epitome of service greeted us. In todays era of mega-properties, it is so nice to relax and step into a hotel who actually remembers what great service really is all about. Each time you come down, either to breakfast of to set off on the days adventures, the staff will call you by name. Upon your return those working in the lobby will ask how your day was, not in a cursory manner but in a way that you know they genuinely care. 
When trying to determine what sites you will visit, the staff will offer up assistance to you. They will not be intrusive, but allow you to determine the time frame in which you wish to ""conquer"" the day. The recommendations they offer up are done so that will allow you to maximize the time you have scheduled. 
While each member of the staff is first rate, I feel compelled to mention the Concierge, Chris. There could not be a more diligent, dedicated, thoughtful, and genuinely warm person who goes out of his way to ensure that he delivers the finest service to those whom he is serving. He would take the time and focus on his guest that he was serving at that particular time. No one else matter when he was attempting to help someone. He was not trying to accomplish multiple tasks for several guests at a time. 
The rooms were perfect. As you enter them, you get a nostalgic feel. The appointments are timely and yet not of the typical cookie cutter hotel décor. 
I travel to London several times a year, I will return to The Chesterfield Mayfair each time. 
If you are going to London, bypass the others and stay here. While I'm sure the Savoy, The Ritz, and the like are good properties...they will pale in comparison. Why go to a city that is full of corporate properties and fall in line...You can impress those you are with and not break the bank.",5,2015,03,15
105,Great Hotel,"This was a lovely place to stay, warm & friendly staff, room was quirky and a great size, loved the fact that someone will knock on your door late evening and ask to turn your bed down (great personal service).  Ideally situated and 5 minutes from Oxford Circus, I would definately stay there again and highly recommend.",5,2015,03,13
105,4  Day stay with late check out,"Great place to stay and central to getting around. The staff were excellent as was the accommodation! The room was of good quality if a bit tight - large bed, work desk and a side table with one chair - really comfortable for one, maybe a bit tight for two if you were going to spend a lot of time in your room. Which is unlikely considering where you are. The hotel bar and service was top notch.",5,2015,03,10
105,Tiny room!,"I stayed here for 1 night on business. I had booked well in advance and paid £200 for a single room. My colleague subsequently tried to book in and the price had gone up to £600!
The staff were friendly.  The room was tiny!, but well appointed and clean.  Pretty quiet too.
Didn't eat there as breakfast didn't start till 7.30, and I had to leave early.
Room was very warm, couldn't control temperature and windows were painted shut!",3,2015,03,10
105,Great location!,"Lovely location next to Berkeley square, off Kurzon street. Comfy room, excellent wifi, good breakfast, amazing afternoon tea. Service oriented, always happy to help personnel. We had rooms 408 and 413. Clean, nice, and peacefull. Thank you!!!",5,2015,03,10
105,Good location and cozy bar area,"Since we normally stay at the Chesterfield in Palm Beach, we assumed that the Chesterfield Mayfair would be similar.

We did not feel that the service was that great when we arrived, since it seemed somewhat busy and stressing at the checkin, with the exception for the porter/concierge who was very nice and helpful.

The rooms were very small, but did the job for one night, but the size was quite a surprise. The hotel location is very good and close to the sights and we just about walked every where.  We can recommend the hotel for the location and coziness.  Breakfast was also very good.",3,2015,03,08
105,Fabulous afternoon tea!,"We celebrated our friend's birthday having Afternoon tea at The Chesterfield.
I was very impressed with the delicious and creative afternoon tea contents. The serveware was beautiful. Most of all the service and atmosphere was fabulous. Truly 5 star. No request was a bother.  A big thank you to all the staff that made our tea enjoyable. I am curious about what wonders my golden ticket contains and will definitely be returning in the future.",5,2015,03,07
105,A warm welcome from The Chesterfield!,Our wonderful evening in London started with the warm welcome we received as we arrived at The Chesterfield. The staff were friendly and efficient and we were soon checked into our elegant though comfortable room.  We enjoyed a walk around the surrounding area nearby then returned for dinner at Butlers Restaurant.  The food was delicious - I particularly enjoyed the dish of the day Salmon en croute. The restaurant manager was very attentive and my husband got some great tips on Italian wines!  After a very comfortable nights sleep we ended our stay with a lovely breakfast - only one night but felt like a much longer break away. Thanks to all at The Chesterfield.,5,2015,03,04
105,We Love The Chesterfield!,"On our recent 20th Anniversary trip to Europe we stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 3 nights.   We loved every minute of it!

The rooms give you that old world luxury you yearn for when in London.  The restaurant was fantastic for both the included breakfast, and the dinners and lunches we had while staying.   We also took advantage of the lounge and the excellent food you can get there as well.  My son had a chance to play the grand piano much to our delight, and fortunately to the delight of the other guests and employees as well.

The location is superb, not as expensive as some locations, but just a short walk to anything you really need.   The staff was magnificent, the hotel is impeccable really.

We hope we have the chance to return someday!",5,2015,03,03
105,Elegant & Comfortable,"So often those two things do not go together. It's nice to stay at an elegant hotel that is not pretentious. We were made to feel welcome immediately. Every single staff person was friendly and helpful. They are the true stars of this hotel and made our stay incredibly enjoyable. The bar here is great place to cozy up for a drink or two. (great snacks by the way!) Butlers restaurant was delightful with delicious menu choices and wine selections. The room service breakfasts were some of the best we've ever had and very punctually served. Very clean, well appointed rooms with lovely bedding. I would have liked slightly better lighting in the bathroom for make up, but that's my only very minor complaint.",5,2015,03,02
105,Excellent for Afternoon Tea,"A group of about 10 of us went to the Chesterfield for a baby shower afternoon tea.  From the moment we arrived the service was 5 star! The staff were absolutely amazing and very accommodating.  We had a private room for the baby shower and the interior design is fabulous.  
The afternoon tea itself was one of the best i've had and was very affordable.  I would definitely recommend this place for afternoon tea!",5,2015,03,02
105,"Beautiful hotel, great location, good value","we stayed their for 3 nights and really appreciated our stay. The room was large , the view not exceptional as we were facing a wall, but decent.
The bathroom was very large with a nice bathtub, very helpful after a long day of visiting. We liked the contemporary setting, with colours of black and red.
Special note for the breakfast buffet, which was large and very diverse 
to please anyone's taste. 
Also great location, right in the Mayfair district, close to the tube and to all the nicer hotels. we truly enjoyed our stay there; the staff was friendly also.",5,2015,02,28
105,Wonderful weekend break,"We stayed here for a weekend romantic getaway - it was our first night away since the birth of our little boy 16 months ago.  It was the best choice of where to stay we could have made.  Staff attention to detail and their approach of putting the guest first started from the moment we'd made our booking.  We got everything we asked for and more.  The location is perfect - within a 15-20 stroll of many the major attractions but hidden away in a nice part of town for you to feel you're going home to a peaceful night sleep.  Our room was very quiet, spacious, clean, beautifully furnished and the bed was gloriously comfy.  We had afternoon tea on the day we arrived (we've had it before and it's always great) and were spoilt rotten by William who served us with great humour and style.  The hotel really did feel like a home away from home.  We finished up our night in the hotel bar, which, again, was another hit for us - relaxing and intimate but also with a late night private club feel.  The breakfast was a great finish to the stay.  The general manager, Oliver, and his team run a great ship. All I can suggest is that you book your stay now - it'll be worth it.",5,2015,02,27
105,An absolute haven during a difficult time,We had planned 4 days at the Chesterfield and I had just begun to realise what a special place it is when I was taken very ill and admitted to hospital. It was a very difficult time for my husband as I was so ill but every time he returned to the hotel he was treated with the utmost care and consideration - nothing was too much trouble. Now I am recovering I am starting to be envious of the wonderful meals and exceptional service my husband enjoyed and as soon as I am better we will return. Thank you so so much everyone.,5,2015,02,24
105,Excellent Hotel,"We visited for the Friday and Saturday nights for my fiancée's birthday and our engagement.  The hotel was fantastic overall but I have to mention the staff especially who went out of their way to make the stay special (I sent the general manager an email directly to thank him and his staff I was so impressed).
Room was clean and comfortable, no rush to leave (checkout is 12 and possible to 2 if available according to the paperwork I read).  We ate there both nights in the end as we were worn out after the day.  Enjoyed both meals and the Lindaflor wine (best chardonnay we've tried).  Definitely recommend!
Oxford Street/Regent Street are a short walk away and there appeared to be taxi's outside ready every time we looked at least.",5,2015,02,24
105,Lovely stay,"We stayed here for one night for a romantic getaway. Lovely hotel, very clean rooms, comfy bed & lovely breakfast including the best Smoothie I have ever tasted! The staff were all very friendly and most of them were English which was very refreshing and I'm sure foreign tourists appreciate this as it gives them the real taste of England!  We were on the 7th floor and the room was lovely and quiet with no noise at all so sleep quality was perfect.",5,2015,02,22
105,A lovely hotel and superb service!,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend break in London and we loved it.  Our room (we stayed in the Music Room) was lovely, the service is impeccable and the food is excellent (try the Dover Soul - you will not regret it!). This hotel is part of the Red Carnation group of hotels who pride themselves on proving ""Service Excellence"" and from our experience every single staff did not just provide service excellence - they embodied it. We felt very well looked after by people who genuinely care for their guests. We will be coming to stay again!",5,2015,02,22
105,Happiest Hotel Heaven,"I gave 2 nights at the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair as a Christmas present to my girlfriend. We stayed on 16 & 17 Feb 2015. BEST DECISION EVER! This hotel is the best and happiest hotel I have stayed in. I cannot thank the staff enough for the way they made us feel so welcome and the warmth they exuded, not to mention the fact that nothing was too much trouble. Room 315 was so comfortable and immaculately designed and presented with a huge bed and gorgeous marble bathroom. We got there mid-morning, and the concierge took our bags while we went to explore Mayfair and Piccadilly - The Ritz and Fortnum & Mason a mere 7 minutes walk away. We returned for the Charlie & The Chesterfield Afternoon Tea in Butler's Restaurant. Wow! The freshest most delicious sandwiches - chicken and almond was mind-blowing. The scones (double choc chip) were beautiful with lashings of clotted cream, and the cakes simply rocked. A great start to an amazing stay. The best present I have given to anybody, I am so grateful for The Chesterfield for making us both feel like the only two people in the world for two days. We cannot wait to go back there, it is our new ""Happy Place"" and we already miss it. Do yourselves a big favour and book in for a couple of days, there is no better place to stay in England and the whole of London is a few footsteps away. But be careful, it may steal your heart....",5,2015,02,21
105,First visit in eleven years,"Stayed for three nights recently, having decided to go back eleven years after our first visit. 

Pros: Warm welcome from front desk staff and assistance with luggage from doorman and porter; nicely decorated bedroom and bathroom; great tea and coffee (cafetiere) in room; easy to use safe and excellent free wifi; spacious bathroom with Fragonard toiletries; good quality breakfast with excellent service; lovely bar for relaxing; great location in upmarket Mayfair and within easy walking distance to the Shepherd's Market - good pubs and restaurants. 

Cons: Our bedroom was small (420); decor in bedroom area corridors is very dated.

Generally, we had a great stay and would stay again in a flash - at the right price, of course. The staff make this hotel what it is.",4,2015,02,21
105,Superb break as always,"Just back from a superb short break at the Chesterfield, not our first time and I honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else in London. The quality is top drawer in every department, as you would expect in all hotels at this price bracket. The staff are well trained, polite and efficient, again as you would expect. What really sets the Chesterfield apart is the friendliess oozing out the entire establisment. It feels just like a home from home, every member of staff we encountered appeared happy and cheerful, from the housekeepers through to the management. We can't wait to return,",5,2015,02,21
105,Great Staff; Pleasant Stay,"Cosy and very comfortable rooms.  Fabulous location and great staff.  We didn't get a chance to eat dinner in the restaurant or have afternoon tea, both of which looked delicious. However, breakfast was fantastic and nibbles served with drinks, in the bar, are complimentory. Lots of people there on business and most others appeared to be lovely tourists.  They cooked and served the most delicious pancakes in the reception area, on 'Pancake Tuesday' a very tasty surprise. Would defininitely recommend. We stayed in 419 which is on the corner and therefore slightly larger than the other rooms and very peaceful.",4,2015,02,21
105,"Best afternoon tea I've had. Perfect for chocolate lovers, great service.","Myself and 5 friends went for the Charlie & The Chesterfield afternoon tea for my 30th birthday and I cannot fault it. You were greeted with a little bottle of ""Fizzy lifting drink"" as from the story itself & it was a lovely touch. 
The afternoon tea itself was delicious with a wide range of sandwiches, fruit scones & chocolate with chocolate chip scones. The cakes were varied & all based on the theme & were also very tasty. 
We all went for the Willy Wonka chocolate tea & couldn't get enough of it, beautiful. 
Most of us also enjoyed a really enjoyable glass of rose champagne too. 
The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful, constantly checking we had enough of everything, bringing you more of anything you asked for & even brought out a little cupcake with a candle & a carnation & sang happy birthday to me. 
The little touches like receiving a gobstopper at the end & picking a golden ticket from willy wonkas hat to see if you had won a prize really made it special. 
I would definitely return & recommend. ",5,2015,02,21
105,Love this hotel,"This is always my first choice hotel in London.  The staff are welcoming, bedrooms are spacious and there is always a quiet spot in the library for a relaxing read.  Ideal location for the West End and parks.  Delicious breakfast.",5,2015,02,20
105,Unparalleled service and staff ,"I have stayed here 4 times in the past 4 years and I am more impressed with each stay. The service is just fabulous. In fact I recognize so many staff members from my first stay 4 years ago. And they remember me too which I really appreciate. The rooms are spacious, the ambiance is wonderful and m you can't beat the location. Trendy restaurants on every block, runs in Green Park and Hyde Park 400m away and all the big shopping attractions within walking distance. In a big anonymous city it's rare to find a hotel with such a warm, personal yet professional service. ",5,2015,02,17
105,Willy Wonka Afternoon Tea,"My daughter (18) and I had a wonderful time at this beautiful hotel from the moment we walked through the door. We had got caught in the rain and as soon as they saw us they gave us towels to dry our hair and returned us from drowned rats to normal people again. The hotel was warm and welcoming in decor and tea was served in a charming garden room. The table  looked so pretty and I adored the little bottles of fizzy pop that we were given at the start of our meal. Food was lovely, especially the chicken and almond sandwiches; and the attention from all the staff especially the Food & Beverage Manager, Biagio Sarubbi, was second to none.  They could not do enough to assist us or find out answers to any questions I had. It was cheaper than other afternoon teas we had experienced in Mayfair before but was just as good. If anything we both felt more comfortable there. It was a shame to leave and we will visit again.",5,2015,02,17
105,Afternoon tea in the heart of London.,"I have tried to book this hotel for Afternoon tea for three year had to cancel each and every time due to illness, weather and forces beyond my control.  I booked it for Valentine's day which my girlfriend loved. 

The Afternoon Tea with the Willy Wonka theme was good.  I loved the chclocate favour tea, works a treat with brown sugar and milk.  The Sandwiches where great typical cucumber style, egg and my favouite chicken with almonds in a round style.  I loved the scones  the chocolate scones with jam.  The only issue i had was the cake at the top of the Afternoon tea set.  The Wonka Bar is very filling and a little too sweet. We could not finish some of the sweets.  Loved the champhigne which was an experience, I never really drink it.

The only down side is that Willy Wonka did not come to our table.  

I never say I will come back to the same Hotel as there are a lot of Hotels in London.  I would come back to try their lunch or dinner.  Their bar looks good.

We had a good time.  Thanks Chesterfield for everything.",5,2015,02,16
105,Perfect for any occasion,"Probably one of the most comfortable stays in London....Ever!
A valentine night stay in the heart of London meant we could enjoy the sights of the City feeling refreshed and ready to explore. The only down side was actually leaving the hotel after check-out. Why take the chance of other hotels when the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel offers a true 5 star experience.",5,2015,02,16
105,Sustained hotel excellence,"My wife and I always stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair when we are visiting or passing through London.  The location is excellent in a quiet Mayfair residential area but convenient to Green Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly and shopping.  The rooms are each unique since this boutique hotel is a conversion from several older buildings, formerly home to the Earl of Chesterfield.  Breakfast is traditional with individually cooked choices unlike the buffet style that many hotels have moved to.  But what sets the Chesterfield apart is its staff, many of whom we recognize have been there for years.  Their service is impeccable and performed with sincere care.  We will continue to return to the Chesterfield for as long as it continues to serve.",5,2015,02,16
105,Valentines Willy Wonka afternoon tea,"My boyfriend booked this for a valentines treat and we certainly was not disapointed. The sandwiches were divine, the chocolate scones were amazing, the selectiin of teas were vast and the mini desserts fit the theme of Willy Wonka superbly.

We had a visit from Willy Wonka who presented us with a golden ticket. Unfortunatly we arnt allowed to open the envelope until we visit for afternoon tea again but there is a years validity.

It is a bit on the expensive side, £96 for two with a glass of champagne, but you afe able to order more sandwiches and scones etc without no additional cost. We made full use of this as we picked up a slight addiction to the chicken sandwich with a crust of almonds.

The staff were attentive, charming and nothing was too much trouble.

All in all, a fantastic afternoon tea, throughly enjoyable experience and would definatly reccomend to friends and family.

Cannot wait for the next visit.",5,2015,02,16
105,Very good but.......,"Hotel and staff very good and everyone very friendly however......we stayed for two nights in an executive suite on the hotel's special 2 for 1 offer and because this seemed such a wonderful deal I decided to call rather than book online so that I could confirm that the price was as given on website i.e £375 for the two night stay. This was indeed confirmed to me verbally and I also received an email advising this rate with the words underneath ""2 for 1 executive suite offer"" and I , naively it seems, took this to mean total cost of £375! Imagine my horror therefore to receive a bill at the end of our stay for £836 including drinks bought at the bar along with breakfasts on both mornings! So, as I say, a good hotel and pleasant staff but.........",4,2015,02,15
105,a Valentine treat,"What an amazing find. From the moment we entered the hotel to leaving we could not fault a thing.  The room was small but well equipped and had a really comfortable bed. 
All the staff were extremely professional and polite. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,02,15
105,The best hotel in London,"I stayed there for three nights last weekend as I was attending the BAFTAs. There are two things I will remember about that weekend, winning a BAFTA and the unbelievable Chesterfield. From the amazing building itself right down to the attentive staff who were as professional as I have ever seen, I cannot wait to come back to London as I will be straight back to the Chesterfield.

Thank you for everything, absolutely outstanding, you are the best!

Brian J F",5,2015,02,14
105,Amazing afternoon tea,"Wow, what a lovely afternoon tea at this hotel. Amazing for children staff so lovely and would definitely return, we took our nan for afternoon tea and also took my 6 yr old daughter so cater for all ages
Highly recomended xxx",5,2015,02,14
105,40th Birthday celebration,"Myself and my partner recently stayed at this hotel as a surprise for his 40th birthday and what a special occasion it was. The room was fantastic, very spacious and beautifully decorated. The staff are so attentive and welcoming without being too intrusive. My partner received a cake and a card from the hotel staff for his birthday which was a lovely touch and just added to the special occasion. The hotel bar is, in my opinion, one of the best in London and the restaurant is great..... the breakfast spread is great!! Location wise it is in the heart of MayFair walking distance from Hyde Park, Park Lane and Oxford Street with everything you need on the doorstep. I cannot fault the hotel and we very much look forward to staying again for a future special occasion.",5,2015,02,13
105,Anniversry stay,"Recently enjoyed a three night stay as a part of our ruby anniversary celebrations. Our lasting memory of the hotel is the excellent, friendly and attentive staff. We even had an anniversary cake ( small but beautifully constructed) a card and glass of bubbly. We felt very special and will return.
Perfect? No, as the showers would benefit from having a thermostatic valve and the bathroom needed an extractor. That said I did not mention ventilation which I should have.

And the television should be easier to use. Not really  difficult but lots of button pushing to get BBC1...every time.",5,2015,02,12
105,Beautiful hotel and helpful staff,"We had a special deal and stayed at the end if November paying £180.00 for the night! The doorman was extremely accommodating and helpful, moving and parking our car to avoid the parking fees, something which he offered to do. Beautifully decorated, located in Mayfair and a good walking distance from Hyde Park, Park Lane, Oxford Street etc. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,02,11
105,"You have to stay here, wonderful","We just finished our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair for a special birthday and it was wonderful, cannot fault it, we were delighted with the kind African Suite allocation. The staff were friendly and we got a cake and a card signed by lots of staff on the first night for my husband. It's the little thoughtful touches. Great location and the terrace bar is lovely, the cocktails are some of the best we have had. Overall wouldn't hesitate to go back and looking forward to it! It deserves its high ratings.",5,2015,02,11
105,Wonderful London Hotel,"The Chesterfield is in a perfect location for the sights of London, and it's located on a quiet street.  Everything is in walking distance, including the great parks of London and restaurants.  The rooms are typical ""European"" size, but well appointed.  The breakfast is fantastic.  I will not hesitate in staying there when I return to London.",5,2015,02,10
105,Another lovely visit,"This was my third visit to this wonderful hotel and once again it cannot be faulted. As you enter the doors I feel as if you are stepping back in time to a world of courtesy, respect and old fashioned manners, the staff are welcoming and always the same members I don't think they have a big turn over of staff which is always a good sign, and although all good hotels make their guests feel welcome, The Chesterfield staff really do seem to care, and whatever the request it is happily dealt with. I went on a girly weekend and it is the perfect location for shopping be it window shopping at the gorgeous but expensive shops on Old Bond Street or the rather more realistic Regents Street or Oxford St, and when weary and shopped out The Chesterfield is lovely to come home to. As my friend and I had our delicious breakfast in bed sat in our white bathrobes we decided we couldn't wait to return.",5,2015,02,08
105,Excellence all the way,"We stayed for three night right before Christmas and found the staff to be most attentive and welcoming. If you are looking for a hotel with character and ambiance along with comfort and great personal service, this is the place to stay. The location is perfect for accessing the 'sights' as well as shopping and theatre. The breakfast is very good and offers plenty of selection for all the family. We enjoyed a delicious pre-theatre dinner in the restaurant and were sorry not to have the time to have the afternoon tea which looked amazing. This was an perfect base for our explorations and we'll be back again later in this year.",5,2015,02,05
105,Excellent staff,"spent 3 nights and the hotel was fantastic - staff super and breakfast fantastic. also nice lounge area and bar.
only negative is that the normal double room is a bit small - but overall impression and location is great",5,2015,02,03
105,overnight stay,see a show in london had the pre theatre dinner which was excellent the room could not fault it .................. 5 star all the way ...............warrants a visit ...............take time out go and see for yourself,5,2015,01,29
105,Great location made great by its staff,"A really pleasant 4 nights provided, what my wife and I agreed, was one of our best ever hotel experiences.  A very well presented hotel but without the bling which is found in so many establishments these days - and which adds absolutely nothing to the experience.  As an alternative to this, the Chesterfield offers a really peaceful base in Mayfair from which to explore London. The reason we intend to return is because of the genuinely pleasant experience of interacting with a staff who seemed to care about doing a good job in a manner which seemed to combine being both relaxed and efficient.  Well done and thank you.",5,2015,01,25
105,Great place for traditional afternoon tea,"We have been here a couple of times for a traditional tea time and every time it has been a really pleasant, relaxing experience. They go out of their way to fulfil all your wishes. 
Having two hours of tea time with soft piano music in the background makes you feel like in a total different time and era. 

Even though the hotel is very grand, you don't have to be afraid to drop in right from your shopping trip. Whether you come in jeans or a three piece suit, they make you feel welcome. ",5,2015,01,25
105,Value for money in Central London,"Very good value for money for a hotel in the heart of London. 

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so we were given a complementary drink at the bar. The bartenders gave excellent customer service and the bar was a nice place to sit and relax.

The room was comfortable but in need of updating. The bathroom was spotless and a good size. 

Overall this was a great value for money choice in terms of location! ",4,2015,01,25
105,Wonderful staff and hotel.,"I have visited this hotel on a number of occasions - for dinner, drinks and overnight stays. It is a stunning hotel to look at, and the staff are always amazingly attentive. The Terrace Bar is a very relaxed place to have a drink, and the rooms are uniquely decorated and a great way to unwind and get a good nights sleep. Their Afternoon Teas are also always popular (book ahead if going on a Saturday) and often have a fun theme to them.",5,2015,01,25
105,"A mini ""Downtown"" abbey.","The Chesterfield, located close enough to walk easily to Berkeley Square, Bond Street and Piccadilly and just far enough from each to be very quiet, is extremely well-appointed with an efficient welcoming staff to match. Example: During our stay, Ms. Leonor Sepulveda at the front desk seemed to be there 24/7 to advise and arrange our ever-changing interests. It's the kind of place where you feel at home, if your home might be a mid-royalty getaway townhouse. Think: a mini ""Downtown"" Abbey.  Comfortable restaurant, with fine breakfast selections, and a well-tended bar that understands the idiosyncrasies of a martini, an important consideration between museums and the theater.",5,2015,01,24
105,DON'T TRUST THEM WITH YOUR LUGGAGE,"First time in London, I chose this hotel because of TA reviews.  I am giving this hotel a poor review due to customer service.  At check in, I was told by the staff that I did not reserve a twin room.  After producing the confirmation where I had reserved the twin room four months earlier, I was informed our room was not ready and we should wait in the bar.  We were given a voucher for 2 free drinks.  The vouchers were not good for the drinks we wanted so that was a bust.  We were approached by the staff and told it would be a little while before I room would be ready.  We decided to leave our luggage at the desk and start our sightseeing.  Upon arriving back at the hotel very late in the evening, I was given our room key at the desk.  We were extremely upset to discover that our luggage had been left in our room with the door to our room not only unlocked but wide open!  I immediately notified the front desk who apologized and said they would send the manager.   The manager did not come to our room right away and it was around midnight and we were exhausted so I called the desk and told them we did not want to talk to anyone right now.  I have never had this experience where a hotel has such little regard for their guest belongings.  Never, NEVER again would I stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",1,2015,01,23
105,Very special place with extraordinary staff,"When you stay in a place like the Chesterfield you expect it to be lovely. What you don't expect, however, is that you will be greeted like a friend and treated like royalty by the wonderful people who work here.

When we walked through the door, we were greeted warmly by the delightful Natalie at reception and shown to our room - the Garden Suite - which was lovely in every way. There was a large jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom and plenty of cosmetic supplies, bathrobes and a huge shower. The bedroom is spacious and extremely comfortable with a bed you can sink into and a small lounge area for relaxing.

When we headed out for dinner, the doorman stopped us, told us it was about to rain and offered an umbrella (which came in useful as it soon started to pour). When we came back after dinner, the reception manager, Letitia, greeted us warmly and spent a few minutes chatting and laughing before we headed up to our room. At first, we couldn't find the coffee supplies so Letitia suggested we call room service any time as they would be happy to bring up a cup or two (we ended up finding it so didn't need to call).

At breakfast (which was excellent), Biagio, the F&B Manager, spent time chatting at our table and our waitress, Lydia, was personal, sweet and warm, While hanging out in the lobby, we spent time with the extremely gregarious and entertaining concierge, Chris, who pointed us in the right direction with a smile.

After staying in the Chesterfield for only one night, we left with a glowing feeling of being treated like welcome guests instead of impersonal customers. Well done to management for hiring such a wonderful staff. We will be back, I'm sure.",5,2015,01,22
105,Excellent service and great location,"The best thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the great location. Really close to bond st, oxford st etc if you like shopping. We spent three nights at the hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday - the staff wrote a gift card to him and left it at our room together with a cupcake. Really sweet of them.

We tried the afternoon tea and Butler's restaurant - really nice and well worth the money. We would be happy to come back! A classic english hotel with a great breakfast! Free wi-fi is a big plus!",5,2015,01,22
105,The staff are so good they remember your drink preferences even if you can't!,I love this hotel. The Chesterfield was originally three private houses on the corner of Charles and Queen Streets in Mayfair. This has resulted in a slightly quirky design with some rather odd shaped rooms with low ceilings but that adds to the charm of the place. We had a room on the corner which was fairly 'compact' but made to seem much bigger with some smart interior design. The entrance is also relatively compact but very inviting.  The location in the West End is excellent with just a short walk to Piccadilly and Green Park station and lots of good restaurants nearby. These days hospitality staff are trained to be friendly to guests but these people really seem to mean it - everyone from the chamber maids up were extremely welcoming and friendly and added a lot to the enjoyment of staying in this smallish and lovely hotel. The combined knowledge of the staff behind the reception desk is invaluable when picking which show to go to. There is a busy bar and a good restaurant with impressive staff who take the trouble to remember your drink preferences even if the jet lag means you can't. This is an excellent four star option if you're staying in London.,5,2015,01,20
105,Charlie at the Chesterfield Afternoon Tea,"We booked the afternoon tea to celebrate my daughter's 30th Birthday and prior to seeing Cats at the London Palladium. We were seated in Butlers Restaurant, lovely surroundings and a great ambience with background music and later live piano playing. We absolutely loved the whole experience! The friendly staff were always unobtrusively on hand to attend to your every need & requirement and offered replenishment & refills more than once. The food was delicious & as much as you could eat - anything you couldn't or any extras ýou might fancy can be taken away in a box. My special dietry requests were efficiently dealt with too and was of no problem to them. This was the first day of the new ""Charlie "" afternoon tea and we thoroughly recommend you go to the Chesterfield and try it for yourself! Willy Wonka  himself made a special appearance and presented my daughter with a cupcake with a candle on a specially decorated plate & all the staff sang to her. A lovely extra touch. We would love to return!",5,2015,01,20
105,A very happy New Year !,"Excellent service from the moment of booking  to a courteous follow up letter.
I had concerns regarding concert tickets being delivered to the hotel. I was notified immediately on delivery . Best service ever !",5,2015,01,20
105,Great hotel,Stayed here recently for a weekend in London and I can see why it is so highly rated.  The service is exceptional and they pay great attention to detail.  The hotel also has fantastic character and charm and it could hardly be in a better location.  Overall superb.,5,2015,01,19
105,Wonderful staff,"i have rarely come across such pleasant and thoughtful staff in a hotel. Lovely old world comfort, thoroughly recommended .
Slight quibbles, nowhere to put folding clothes , and bathroom , despite radiator being on full, was a little chilly. 
Would love to return",5,2015,01,19
105,This is the only place to stay in london,"Words cannot describe how amazing this hotel is. It is an oasis of calm just moments away from the hustle and bustle of Bond Street/Oxford street. Natalie on check in was efficient, personal, friendly and helpful. We had two rooms and as usual they were perfect, a true home away from home. We had dinner late there was no one else in the restaurant, the food and service was impeccable, there was no rush for us to leave thank you William. We had excellent breakfasts. Nothing was too much trouble from all of the staff. We had excellent cocktails, including virgin mojitos for our son, my mum is desperate to know where you get your candied walnuts from! Many thanks for a truly wonderful stay, hopefully we shall return soon.",5,2015,01,18
105,Above and beyond in all regards!,"This hotel exceeded our high expectations from the moment we made our reservation. The concierge was highly efficient and helped secure a private car transfer from the airport with less than 12 hours notice. We also received a complete tour of the hotel upon our arrival which was very generous. Our room was impeccably clean and beautifully decorated. We also returned to our room later on our first evening to find complimentary champagne, fruits and cake to celebrate our honeymoon. The hotel is very well located and only a short walk from major tourist attractions, shops and tube station. Despite its central location, the hotel is in exceptionally quiet area. Food was outstanding (particularly afternoon tea and room service) and the business centre ensured we could print electronic tickets in a hurry. A wonderful stay made even better by the staff that treated each guest as a VIP. ",5,2015,01,17
105,Flawless,Our family of 5 spent a fabulous week at the Chesterfield! The main dimension for praise is service: every member of he staff was helpful and friendly. We stayed in the Duchess Suite that was big enough for our family. Breakfast was included and was outstanding. Room clean and with small details that show care. Locations is exceptional. Definitely we'll be back!!  ,5,2015,01,17
105,Good quality in the heart of Mayfair,"Not as extravagant as its sister hotel 41 Hotel, this quality establishment right in the heart of Mayfair still has the distinctive touch of Red Carnation founder and president Beatrice Tollman. Afternoon tea is a must, concierge service and transportation/meetings coordination exceptional. Standard rooms are very small, suites are reasonably sized and tastefully decorated.",5,2015,01,16
105,An enjoyable afternoon tea,"We decided to do afternoon tea here during a day stop over in London. Hoping for a 'traditional' English tea experience I think we did well. The hotel is old fashioned with doorman, and they greet you warmly. The first impression is always important and the staff did this well.
The restaurant manager personally came over and spent quite a few minutes talking with us and made us feel valued. Big Tick there for his simple thing.

The location of afternoon tea is outside in a covered room and also inside. There were only 2 other parties there when we arrived so we were outside and I think this only enhanced the experience. 

The tea itself is well done; the food was good but not great as I think the sandwiches had been pre-made and were ever so slightly crusty on the edges. Big deal but not when they cost you £34.
However, the tea selection is what shines with a large selection of tea varieties. I didn't know you could get white tea but they have it.
The black tea selection was good and ranges from a delicate light tea to a dark black tea. I am no way a tea expert but I had 3 pots and enjoyed every one.

The food selection is basically 'all you can eat' and they will replenish what ever selection of sandwich, cake or pastry you wish. The waitress serving the tea had good knowledge of each one chosen and gave us a brief description of each tea as she poured it.

With 1920's music playing in the background and a quite atmosphere I really enjoyed this afternoon and would happily return. We did try to get into the name places but they were all booked and now I am glad we didn't go to them, as this was a much more enjoyable, relaxed and pleasant experience.

Don't pass this one by in your research.",5,2015,01,10
105,Good old days of London,"I liked this hotel, there is something authentic about it. 
The room was beautifully decorated, I mean beautifully!
The staff are wonderful, you cant but feel that you are receiving special treatment by almost everyone of them. 

The room is comfortable, clean, no noise, good food, good and safe location since it is an area of embassies. 

What I liked most is the staff, they seemed like a good team.",5,2015,01,10
105,Cozy and quiet hotel in a great location!,"With my second trip to London, it took me weeks of agonizing to find the perfect hotel. Luckily, I feel the Chesterfield Mayfair hit all the important items on my list! 

First off, the hotel is an easy 5 minute walk to the Green Park tube station (Picadilly and Victoria lines) which made transport to major attractions as well as to/from the airport super easy (no switching lines with luggage which I learned on my first trip to London should be avoided at all costs). The hotel is also easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace which was a pleasant stroll. The neighborhood the hotel is in is quiet with a few boutique stores and eateries. Definitely not off the beaten path but a nice break from busy streets near Oxford, Regent St, and Soho.

Upon arriving at the hotel, check-in was fast and simple. The concierge took care of our bags and gave us a tour of the hotel all the way up to the room-- where he explained everything from the electrical outlets, heated tile floors, to room service! 

Room was clean and classically decorated. Have to say the bed linens and bathroom towels/robes were top-notch. I literally looked forward to going to bed after lounging in my bathrobe for a while! 

Maid service was impeccable and they didn't start super early in the morning either which was appreciated. 

Traditional English breakfast was included in our rate and it was just that: a traditional english breakfast, nothing fancy or over the top. Was nice that breakfast ran until 11A on weekends and near 10A on weekdays so we didn't have to get up super early. 

All in all, a pleasant and convenient stay. Could you find something a bit more modern at the same price point? Probably. I wasn't looking for that so this fit our needs perfectly :)",5,2015,01,09
105,Still the Best in London,This is my third stay at this lovely hotel.  The staff welcomes you home and you feel like it is your home.  Everyone is warm and friendly and to me the most distinctive characteristic of this hotel is that the staff thinks of what you need even before you have thought that you need it.  When I go to London it is still only to this hotel.  You will not stay at a better place.,5,2015,01,07
105,Made us feel at home,"My wife and I took are entire family here and booked 2 rooms and a suite.
They just completely bent over backwards to make us happy. 
On Christmas EVE they even put stockings in our rooms filled with goodies.
Their recommendations on dining and places to go were right on. 
Chris the concierge, was an outstanding resource. Better than Goggle.
Wifi was free and excellent.
The breakfast was one of the best we have ever had at UK hotels. 
They made our Christmas in England not just great but outstanding.",5,2015,01,06
105,Afternoon Tea,"Had the best afternoon tea, service was above and beyond excellent.  The food was fresh and well presented, plenty of each for everyone to enjoy.  Recommend this to everyone and looking forward to going back again in the future.",5,2015,01,06
105,Fantastic Hotel ,"Have stayed in many luxury hotels, but the service here really is second to none ! Special mention to Lydia at breakfast who went out of her way to serve us ! Will definatly stay here again when in London. ",5,2015,01,06
105,"Charming Boutique Hotel, Great Location, Excellent Service and Hospitality","Our family of four had a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair over the New Year's holiday.  The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Oxford Street.  The hotel is on a quiet neighborhood street, a plus for restful sleep.  The hotel is very quiet, noise from other rooms is minimal.  The rooms are immaculate and the beds and bed linens are very comfortable.  Our room rate included breakfast which enabled us to choose from their buffet or order from their menu.  Breakfast items and service were excellent and reasonably priced.  As it was our first visit to London, we relied heavily on the concierge and other staff for recommendations on restaurants, transportation options, and help with tours.  They responded to every request with insightful recommendations, always eager to help.  We'll be staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair the next time we visit!",5,2015,01,04
105,Magical wedding at The Chesterfield Mayfair,"My partner and I chose The Chesterfield Mayfair as our wedding venue because we liked the well-organised wedding package and its location in the heart of Mayfair. We were having a small intimate wedding with 25 guests and were able to use the library for the ceremony and reception and the beautiful conservatory for the dinner. We viewed the hotel with the food and beverage manager, Biaggio who truly sold the venue to us!  The Chesterfield is a perfect venue for a very special wedding: grand without being stuffy, cosy and charming but what makes this hotel very special is the excellent customer service. We would like to thank all of the staff with special thanks to Samantha Langaas (events manager) and Biagio Sarubbi (food and beverage manager) for helping us organise the perfect wedding. The staff truly went our of their way throughout the day to make sure everything was perfect, from dressing of the rooms to accommodating our complicated dietary needs. Sam very kindly searched for a pianist/singer for us and provided meals for our photographer and our pianist. We also received a room upgrade and lovely card and bottle of champagne in our suite on our wedding night! The rooms were beautifully decorated and the food and wine excellent. We spent a very memorable wedding weekend and could not recommend this hotel highly enough whether it is for a special occasion or a relaxing stay.",5,2015,01,03
105,Christmas Treat,"Really welcoming and friendly staff, perfect location (away from the traffic and bustle), great standard room and the best hotel breakfast in Mayfair. Close to some nice little public houses, independent and international shopping and only a short skip away from Hyde Park. On the whole I can't recommend highly enough and if you've time on your hands the excellent little reading room is worth a relaxing post-breakfast hour. We're going back in May and most certainly again Christmas 2015.",5,2015,01,02
105,Great hotel for families,"My family of five stayed at the Chesterfield arriving Christmas Day and leaving New Year's Eve.  We arrived around 8:00 am and we were able to check into our rooms right away which was a blessing as my children were very tired.  We got the Africa Suite which was a junior suite and another room accessible by a common door.  The junior suite was perfect for my three girls (18, 16,12).  The housekeeping staff met us in the room to try and see how we wanted to configure the beds for my girls - keeping beds as a king or separating into two twins.  The brought in a cot for the third bed.  The room my husband and I had was on the small side but fine for two people.  The rooms were supplied with both bottled still and sparkling water.  Every night there was turn down service.  On Christmas night, the hotel gave each of my girls a present and there was a stocking filled with treats in my husband and my room.  On a few other occasions we would find gifts with the turn down service - cookies, candies, rose water facial mist.  All very nice surprises!  The staff were all very friendly - especially Chris the concierge.  He made it a point to get to know my girls' names and he was very helpful with dinner reservations.  We had breakfast included with our room.  Toast, fruit, cereal, juices, croissants and other pastries, yogurt and you could also order something hot from the menu. The hotel's location is in the wonderful neighborhood of Mayfair.  For the underground, you would have to walk to Green Park.  Hyde Park, shopping and Buckingham Palace are all within walking distance. The underground wasn't easy to use as a few of the lines were shut down due to the holidays.  Taxi was the best way to get around.  There is a great pub diagonal from the hotel called The Only Running Footman which was very nice.  We ate dinner there twice.  The hotel will make reservations for you.  There is also a Tesco Express around the corner for snacks and drinks.  Shepherds Market is around the corner which has some pubs and restaurants.  We have stayed in Mayfair before at the Flemings which is around the corner from The Chesterfield.  I really enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield and would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,01,02
105,Hidden Gem!,"Thanks to Tripadvisor, my husband and I chose The Chesterfield as a base for a two night trip to London to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary, and we are very glad we did.
We loved everything about it: its central location (only five minutes from Green Park tube station), its decor (very tasteful, though traditional), comfy bed with luxury bed-linen etc., excellent afternoon tea (and breakfast), and especially the wonderful staff. We have travelled extensively, and prefer to stay in smaller. boutique-type hotels, but never have we met so many caring staff in one establishment. It is very unusual for any of them to remember your name, yet on several occasions we were greeted by name by more than one member of staff.
A special thank you to Biagio, the restaurant manager, and Juditta who served our afternoon tea. If you are thinking of booking, do as I did...I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,2015,01,02
105,Birthday treat,"I did leave a card at the hotel, but finally have time to tell on tripadvisor, how special this lovely home from home made me feel on my birthday late November. I never want to stay anywhere else when in town, (and rarely do!) Thankyou to all of you so much X.",5,2015,01,01
105,We thoroughly enjoy the Chesterfield stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights during the Christmas vacation,
We thoroughly enjoy everything that the hotel offers
The concierge Chris is very knowledge and patient in helping us 
the room is very clean and comfortable although it is small
the internet is very fast, it is a big plus",5,2014,12,30
105,A Wonderful Honeymoon!,"We stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel for our honeymoon in early November.  It was by far the most wonderful trip.  The management and staff were warm, friendly and extremely helpful in every way.  The room was luxurious and beautifully decorated  Most evenings we were happy to have a drink in the bar and listen to the piano playing in the background. The location is excellent and within walking distance of many lovely restaurants and shops.   We are already talking about our next trip to London and will definitely stay here again!  A huge thank you to the staff who made this so special for us. Susan & Clive",5,2014,12,30
105,Great Service with old world charm,"This was our second stay at this establishment. Feels like home away from home. Impeccable service. The rooms are not modern but it has all the needed amenities wifi etc.. The only drawback is a lack of a separate shower and bath instead a in bath shower is provided. Rooms is more along the lines of old London. Breakfast buffet is extensive every need is fully catered for. The bar is a nice bonus with live Piano music a bit more stylish then the normal pub. Location is great near the tube, royal parks and a host of restaurants. I will be going back in February for my third stay!",5,2014,12,30
105,A Family Christmas Stay,"The warmth and quality of this hotel was clear from the moment we entered the lobby. The staff was all smiles and, much to my granddaughter's delight there was even a present with her name on it under the tree! This hotel goes well above and beyond in its treatment of guests. It all starts when they receive a reservation. The hotel sends a questionnaire asking for guest preferences, likes/dislikes, etc. They also are very welcoming to children, offering special activities just for them. My granddaughter got to decorate cupcakes with one of the chefs. The location is great: close to Regent, New Bond, and Oxford streets, and Hyde Park, yet in a quiet neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I plan to make this my hotel of choice in London.",5,2014,12,27
105,fabulous hotel   fabulous staff,"I was fortunate enough to have a stay in this charming, excellently located hotel. The attentive,helpful staff were a joy. We stayed in the fabulously decorated Music Room. The clean,modern bathroom even had a  rainfall  shower. Highly  recommended",5,2014,12,27
105,A Gem of a Hotel,"By far the friendliest and most helpful staff we've encountered in a long time!
We just spent 5 nights at this hotel and cannot speak highly enough of how welcome we were made. The staff are genuine in their desire to make all their guests feel at home and go the extra mile to be of assistance in any way possible. We had an early departure before breakfast was open. They had four breakfasts waiting for us in boxes to take with us was well as hot tea and coffee.
As in all London hotels, the entry point rooms are small but if your budget allows a suite, there is ample room. 
We've stayed at other hotels in the Mayfair area but keep coming back to the Chesterfield as it is by far the best.",5,2014,12,27
105,A good standard,"A little disappointed with the room - a little scruffy and very dated décor. Good size though and a comfy bed. We didn't have time to use any facilities of the hotel.
Front of house service excellent.",3,2014,12,23
105,Festive cream tea,Lovely Christmas atmosphere on arrival staff very polite creamtea very nice good selection of sandwiches freshly baked scones tasty cupcake chocolate log festive tart small taster of mulled wine a nice treat,5,2014,12,20
105,lovely stay at the chesterfield mayfair,"I stayed here with family for a couple of days of festive christmas shopping. The rooms are small but beautifully furnished. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful. The concierge booked a couple of restaurants for us and gave some great tips on local hang outs. The hotel is located on a quiet street, but within easy access of shopping and the tube.",5,2014,12,16
105,Quintessentially English,"A beautiful hotel in Mayfair, Great service. Good freshly cooked breakfast, friendly staff, busy atmospheric bar. Good attention to detail, including bed turn down & fresh towels. Really good find & reasonably priced for Mayfair so close to Christmas! Would recommend & return. Thank you to all the staff for a lovely if not short stay! Vey quiet given its location. Room was quite compact but had everything we needed.",4,2014,12,16
105,really good quality london hotel,"My favourite part of this hotel was the bar, loved it, friendly, humming, comfy and not over priced.  Bed in room was very comfortable and the basics work, good shower, well placed mirror, warm floor etc.  Very clean, staff were friendly and helpful.  I will go back",4,2014,12,16
105,Very average ,"Not impressed for the price. The location is just ok, a bit removed from where I tend to spend time when in London. But that I knew before booking. I did expect more of the hotel itself, though. I found the room shabby and small. The window had a crack, there was a crazy mirrored wall, and the decor was very tired. We had no cold water initially and the sink did not drain.  This wax fixed, but no compensation - even a small cookie or something - was offered. The restaurant was eye-poppingly expensive so we didn't try it. There was an issue flushing the toilet. I've experienced the same problem at another hotel in London owned by the same chain and was told that this is a common issue with older buildings (not an excuse if you are charging 5-star prices). Disappointing ",3,2014,12,16
105,Loved it,"This is a fantastic hotel, the room was nice and big. Fresh flowers were in the room. Location was about 15 to 20 minutes from most things,  the staff were very helpful also. Breakfast was included in the rat as well, breakfast was really good too.  We had room service at least twice as well. fish n Chips were very good.  Most nights we got a small gift in the room.  We also did high tea. That wad nice. Scones and desserts very tasty.  Some of the rooms are older but very nice.

It is a family owned hotel. At tea, we saw the owner if the small chain having tea and conducting business.  

I also loved the pictures of all of the dogs around the hotel.

I can't wait to go back and visit.",5,2014,12,12
105,Best Boutique Hotel in London,"The Mayfair area is lovely neighborhood centrally located in London and The Chesterfield fits right in. Our room was spacious, handsomely decorated with two full bathrooms, we were generously upgraded to a suite! The staff was inviting, helpful and extremely accommodating some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. Check in/out was a breeze. I highly recommend The Chesterfield and hope to be returning soon.",5,2014,12,10
105,Best hotel in London,"I think this is the best hotel in London and it is consistently good.  I have stayed in this hotel at least once a year for nearly 20 years and it is full of character, friendly and run extremely efficiently.  The service is excellent, rooms are comfortable and breakfast superb.

I really cannot fault it - I just wish they had a loyalty scheme so that I could return for pleasure rather than business.",5,2014,12,09
105,Comfort and Location,"Quality accommodation in an ideal location. We had the benefit of a promotional off-peak rate which made this possible for us. Near to Green Park Underground, Hyde Park and Shepherd's Bush boutiques and eateries, it put the gloss on our holiday. Rooms are not expansive but adequate for most people. Common areas including bar and breakfast room are very appealing. Staff friendly, not just polite. We'll be back. ",4,2014,12,09
105,Nice hotel in the heart of London,"Very correct and nice reception at arrival by Guillaume. Beautiful room, with impressive tapestry and heavy curtains. Clean room and excellent room service. Continental and English breakfast in classy dining room. Nice bar and library for relaxation.",5,2014,12,08
105,Wonderful setting for splendid Afternoon Tea,"We booked here as a special treat for our Mother to have an afternoon tea in Mayfair.  How fortunate we were to have selected this lovely traditional hotel. From the warm and genuine initial greeting as we arrived to the care with which we were shown to a table to accommodate Mother's slight mobility issue, we felt welcomed and appreciated.  My dietary intolerance to wheat was handled with charm and the resulting tea was splendid, tasty and abundant.  The staff were attentive to our needs, kept the tea coming and made the whole experience that little bit special.",5,2014,12,08
105,Great afternoon,just had afternoon tea at the chesterfield and what a great experience.from the moment you enter the beautiful dining room you are treated like royalty.you have a great choice of tea's to choose from and can try them all if you want the food its self was excellent with a great choice of sandwiches and cakes all beautifully presented.a great experience which we thank the hotel for we will return ,5,2014,12,08
105,Is there a word better than excellent? ;),"I've been to Lindon many times and stayed in different hotels every time and the Chesterfield Mayfair is by far the best hotel I've stayed in London, not to mention the world. The staff is so friendly and genuinely wish to help you. I can't say enough about Chris the concierge who was such a nice guy to meet and really helped a lot during our visit (but of course all the other staff personnel were just lovely). The hotel is beautiful. I read many reviews about the room being tiny but for us it was just fine and very pretty. All amenities required were there. Breakfast was delicious. The hotel is located in a very posh neighborhood and there are great bars and restaurants around like Nobu. Shephard's market is around the corner and the entire city center is just walking distance away. 
This is definitely my choice for the best hotel ever in London. Hope I'll be able to visit again next time I come. Thank you for the lovely experience.  ",5,2014,12,07
105,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel has a very classic  appeal to it. The staff and butler service is exquisite. We had a beautiful stay here, any requests that we made were granted. Turn down service was excellent! I highly recommend this hotel, and upon our return in 3 months, we will return here for sure. They truly aim to please!",5,2014,12,04
105,Good Mayfair option,"i've been fortunate enough to stay in all the London red carnation hotels this year so it's good to see how Chesterfield Mayfair compares against its sister 4 and 5 star hotels.

The hotel is in a great location close to Shepherds Market in Mayfair but also quiet enough to get a good nights rest, this is an asset of all the hotels in the group.

Check in and service are professional and efficient and the hospitality is great, another key feature of the red carnation group.

The rooms are not large but very comfortable with good showers and little touches in the rooms that are thoughtful. 

The bar is great as are all the public areas and again every member of staff greeted all the guests with smiles and a genuine wish to make sure you have a great stay.

I didn't get the chance to eat in Butlers restaurant which I hope to rectify next time but breakfast was very good with plenty of choices.

It's a good option if you want a great 4 star hotel for a leisure break. For business, I'm more inclined to go for the Rubens at the Palace or Montague on the Gardens primarily based on bed and breakfast rates. The Egerton is great if you have a bit of a higher business budget and the bar is good for meetings and relaxing with client. I'd pop into the bar for a martini or two even if I'm not staying at the hotel.
Hotel 41 is my absolute favourite for special occasions and superb hospitality when I've got the money to splurge (and maybe even when I haven't!)

So, I would recommend the Chesterfield as a good base for a weekend in London that balances indulgence against rates and I do hope to have the opportunity to stay again in 2015.",4,2014,12,04
105,Perfect afternoon tea .,"We came across this hotel while we were looking for somewhere to have afternoon tea,  we were not disappointed, everything about it was so wonderful, the tea and the food were very tasty and in abundance. The price was very reasonable and unlike most big hotels the prices have not increased for Christmas, so we have booked to go back . Well worth a visit.",5,2014,12,03
105,Excellent and elegant hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Great little hotel in a quiet elegant location in a sophisticated area in the heart of the capital

Minutes from Green Park tube and in striding distance of the Ritz, Langans and the wonderful Greenhouse. A great spot to enjoy shopping and sightseeing but when you want to get away from the bustle and crowds a warm welcome and a quiet night's sleep can be expected. Old world elegance and great room service. Pop into Victoria Beckham's new emporium and try dinner at Alloro. Excellent stay all round. ",5,2014,12,03
105,A very nice surprise in the heart of Mayfair,"I've have been last weekend and everything has been wonderful. First to mention the great location in Mayfair, with plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in this quiet area. All the hotel is lovely, with an old British style that makes it very charming and warm. Very nice room and bathroom, also in old style and decor but all seem to be brand new and extremely clean. Very comfortable beds, and silent rooms. Breakfast superb, with a la carte dishes included. A beautiful bar with nice cocktails not too pricey and a relaxing library to read the paper. All the personnel is very friendly and helpful, with an special mention to the Spanish speaking personnel: Leonor (from Lisbon, Portugal), Maria (from Almonte, Huelva) and the Barman (I dont remember his name). Thanks to them I really felt that it was ""my home away from home"". For sure I will come back to this Hotel (I missed the awarded afternoon tea but it looked delicious) or to another Red Carnation hotel.",5,2014,12,03
105,Olde worlde comfort,"A weekend in london and we always prefer the chesterfield. Very warm and welcoming feel as you walk through the door,you can help yourself to hot chocolate, maltesers and choc drops while in the lounge, the bar is the best huge comfy armchairs to relax and listen to music, and the snacks are great, we ordered breaded prawns and dip and duck rolls.the breakfast room is decorated for christmas and looks great the food is wonderful too, the only downside is the rooms are small altho i have also stayed in a suite but this is expensive but a wonderful hotel in a great quiet location in mayfair ",4,2014,12,03
105,London Special,"The Chesterfield Mayfair, situated right behind Shepherds Market, is a true English hotel with beautifully decorated rooms and a charming hotel bar. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is quality but not overly stuffy. All in all, a most pleasant experience.",4,2014,12,02
105,"Afternoon Tea in Mayfair, what a fantastic treat.","We visited The Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair on Sunday 30th Nov 2014 as a group of 8 for afternoon tea and what a treat, what a way to finish off a fantastic weekend in London, very enjoyable indeed, from the moment we arrived and we were late, delayed on the tube!  We received a very warm welcome from the very lovely doorman and were then escorted into the beautiful dining area festively decorated, attentive service, lovely dainty sandwiches, scones and pastries and of course a compulsory glass of champagne, would love to return. Stunning hotel, right down to the fabric wall paper in the toilets. Maybe one day I will have the pleasure of staying here, if only in my dreams. A really lovely experience, everyone should try to have at least once. Thank you.",5,2014,12,01
105,"Service Amazing, Stylish rooms","I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair with a friend for my birthday celebrations. I did mention to the hotel upon booking it was a big celebration. Upon arrival the doorman knew my name and took me to reception, the hotel has upgraded my room to room 526. What a beautiful, stylish, feminine, stunning room. It had everything we would have wanted, a well equipped contemporary bathroom, with a shower. The towels were huge and so fluffy too, the products in the bathroom were lovely to. The beds were very comfortable with a cosy duvet and throw. We had breakfast in our room and it arrived at the time we wanted, it was laid out well and had everything we had asked for. All the staff at this hotel show the best service, they are all courteous and very helpful. I thoroughly recommend staying at this beautiful hotel.",5,2014,11,30
105,Good hotel but small rooms,"I stayed here on a recent midweek trip to London. Can't fault the staff or service (both were great) but the rooms are slightly small. One of the points that was a negative was that the shower, along with being very complicated to work, if you wanted a full overhead shower, was nearly impossible to get to the right temperature. Overall this is an good hotel if you are going to something in the area and favour more of a cosy, service orientated hotel over modern/larger rooms.",4,2014,11,29
105,Well worth the money,"My husband and I stayed here for the first time on our last trip to London and have already booked here again for our trip next year.   The hotel is in a fabulous location - close to shopping, attractions restaurants and the tube yet away from throngs of tourists.   The rooms are small so we did upgrade and have done so again for our return trip.  The breakfast is great and the staff are all very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend",5,2014,11,28
105,Superb!,"My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield Hotel in November and had a superb stay.
We drove there and from the doorman taking our car away (with our permission!!) to stepping into the warm and welcoming hotel we knew this was yet another superb Red Carnation hotel.
Letitia who served us on reception was so friendly, professional and helpful, especially regarding a request for cheese on toast! and even upgraded our room for us.
The whole atmosphere is of a gentleman's club -  traditional furnishings, atmosphere and extremely pleasant staff - from the doorman to the housekeeper.
We have stayed in many Red Carnation hotels in London and this has just 'pipped' the others in our opinion for attention to detail.
One slight issue was the very small shower room in the suite, but it would have been churlish to complain when everyone was so kind,",5,2014,11,27
105,Wonderful Stay!,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for two nights in November. For me, the location was just perfect. Mayfair is quite convenient to many of the sites, but still in a fairly quiet area. The hotel itself very nice. The rooms are smallish (what room aren't in Central London), but very well appointed. My room faced the street, but was still very quiet at night - no issues sleeping. The staff was very nice and helpful. 

The rates were on par with many other options for London. So, if Mayfair is your thing, check out the Mayfair. You won't be disappointed.",5,2014,11,27
105,Always a pleasure,"Each year I make the journey to London to attend a function that is close to my heart and I always stay at The Chesterfield and it never disappoints.  The attention to customers' personal comforts is second to none other of my experience and I especially appreciate the friendly atmosphere in which every member of staff that I encounter has a pleasant greeting accompanied by a bright smile, which I am sure is not always the way they feel!  My requirements in the hotel are normally very modest, but in the past when I have needed some personal assistance the staff have gone to considerable lengths to provide whatever is necessary to overcome the problem.",5,2014,11,26
105,A jewel in the heart of Mayfair,"A beautiful hotel, friendly  professional staff, great location. Attention to detail to all their customers and even to the four legged kind. We are looking forward to visiting the other Hotels in the red carnation group. ",5,2014,11,24
105,Fantastic stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for three nights in November 2014. It was an amazing stay.
15 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, 15 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square and only 10 minutes walk to Regent Street.
Highly recommendable.",4,2014,11,23
105,Shopping trip,"We stayed Friday/Saturday to do some Christmas shopping in town .
All the  staff are friendly,helpful, nothing is too much trouble .
The Duchess suite was fabulous beautifully set out over two rooms lots of extra little touches fruit,sherry and hand written note from Oliver ( general manager) to welcome us .Beds very comfortable ,excellent shower .
Breakfast had a lot of choice all cooked food piping hot and excellent coffee.
Great location easy to walk or get taxis .
Do come and try their lunches and afternoon teas - super .",5,2014,11,22
105,BEST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER,"I love this hotel. Celebrating my big birthday I was given (unexpectedly!!!) the beautiful Philippe Suite. It really is beautiful . The staff , customer services 5 stars. Management should be proud of their choice and training. First class. Location off Berkeley Square is perfect to all the places we needed to be around Mayfair , W1. The brilliant coffee and selection of JIANG tea ( I am now hooked) in the bedroom. The best of British produce absolutely delicious meal we had at Butlers Restaurant. We had  ( & more!!) exactly what  I was looking for : 100% quintessentially Boutique, quintessentially British . Old school old fashion but first class. Thank you for a brilliant stay and making my special year very special indeed.",5,2014,11,19
105,Expensive but elegant and excellent services/staff,"The staff at this hotel are very well trained. A young Irish man, Cian ?, handled my registration every efficiently and effectively. I had a slight problem with the room location after arriving, and Cian and the concierge took care of the situation very quickly. 
As most London hotels, it is expensive, but the Chesterfield Mayfair is elegant. The room has a very comfortable king-size bed, all the extras are of excellent quality, each room has its own decor, the breakfast, while limited choice, is delicious and servied in a very cozy environment. The concierge and doormen were particularly helpful and available. Finally the location could not be better: next to Green Park, a tub station and the shopping area. 
If you have the money, choose this hotel. You'll not be disappointed.",5,2014,11,19
105,"Quite pricey, even for central London","I recently spent one night at the Chesterfield as a solo business traveller. Although it is a lovely hotel, my room was quite small and I thought the special ""corporate rate"" of £335 per night was steep, even by central London standards. The staff were very helpful, apart from the fact that I did not receive my early morning call and consequently missed breakfast; as I had a business meeting to attend this was disappointing. I asked about this at check out and received no explanation or apology. The ""service recovery"" could have been better.",3,2014,11,17
105,10 out of 10 points!!!,"Dear readers,
 
I have travelled a lot and have a huge experience of living in luxurious 5 star hotels. So I can make a fair comparison. 
As you may already know the hotel's location is brilliant.
Let's go inside now:
The very first thing to mention is the excellent service! The staff was always there to help me out with any arising issues. Individual approach was at the highest level possible.
The atmosphere in the hotel is extremely friendly, which makes you want to come back as soon as you have left. 
The restaurant is very nice, in a traditional English manner. We enjoyed having our breakfasts there.
An excellent place for working people. There are computers and a printer available to use on the LG floor. Also you have useful stationery in the room in case you need to work on some papers and don't have the common necessities for that at hand.
To sum up, I highly recommend staying there, if you are into cosy boutique hotels.",5,2014,11,13
105,Wonderful hotel and amazing restaurant!!!,"Me and my wife decided to have a mini honeymoon in london and stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel after our wedding. We wasn't disappointed!! This was by far the front runner of all the places that we have stayed in london before. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are friendly & attentive, the location is perfect and our favourite thing about the hotel was the restaurant the food was absolutely amazing the chef who cook our meals should be knighted! I could go on forever about our experience at the chesterfield it was perfection. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in london after our stay here!",5,2014,11,12
105,A great home base for London,"If you're a regular visitor to London and are looking for a place to set up camp for several days, this is it. My partner has stayed there for nine years, and this is my second. The rooms, while not a ions, are well-appointed and maintained. The breakfast room and the bar have staffs who will look after your personal preferences. If you ask once, they remember the second day. Same goes for the front desk and concierge. Of course, Mayfair is close to everything.
We will back next fall.",5,2014,11,09
105,A fabulous find in centre of London,"What a fabulous find in the centre of London.  Am almost reluctant to share this gem of a hotel for fear it will become too popular and won't be able to secure a booking again!  From the moment we arrived until the time we left, the attention and service from ALL staff was truly superb.  The door-men, the front of house staff/porters, concierge and reception staff were so helpful, attentive and efficient in everything they did and their attitude towards their various tasks was exemplary. 

The hotel is not ultra modern so if it is characterless glass and marble etc you like, this is not for you.  The Chesterfield exudes class and comfort reminiscent of grand old mansions of by-gone days.  Our room was not the largest ever (common in most London hotels) and maybe just a little over-furnished for the space available but the decor was beautiful, the beds so comfortable and it was spotlessly clean with all necessary facilities/toiletries etc in the bathroom and bedroom. It was also extremely quiet  - we heard no noise whatsover from nearby rooms or from outside the hotel.

We only ate breakfast in the hotel but again the decor in the restaurant was beautiful and appropriate for the style of the hotel.  There was plenty of choice on the large buffet breakfast table and the hot food was freshly and individually cooked - not always the case in many hotels. Where this hotel scores so highly is on the quality of its staff and this was again very apparent in the restaurant.

The location of the hotel is another strong aspect.  Easy walking to the nearest tube station which makes most central attractions easily accessible. Taxis also always available. 

Thank you everyone at The Chesterfied Hotel - you should all be very proud of your lovely hotel and what you have achieved.  Would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel when next in London.",5,2014,11,09
105,We will be back,"Great central location in green park near Buckingham Palace, old bond street etc., lovely rooms, great breakfast. The stuff was very helpful too. Chris is the king and Christina is fantastic. We definitely are coming back. Great restaurants near by like nobu, novikof, maze...
",5,2014,11,08
105,This hotel is one of a kind,"This hotel employs the most friendly, attentive and simply wonderful staff.  They aren't 'stuffy' they are so personable and can't do enough for you.  Ask for one of the refurbished rooms - but I'm sure all of the rooms are great anyway.  Amazing trip to London.",5,2014,11,06
105,Simply Wonderful!,"My husband and I traveled to London in October to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. After extensive research we chose to stay at The Chesterfield. And what a perfect choice. The hotel is lovely, the staff are excellent and the restaurant is divine. We dined in the restaurant each morning for breakfast and for dinner on our wedding anniversary and again on our final evening. The food was excellent. 
We stayed in the Chesterfield Suite which is amazing. What a beautiful room. The decor is luxurious. 
The hotel is conveniently located near the Green Park tube station and there is a pharmacy and grocery store within walking distance. My husband and I love to travel and we are always looking for someplace different to stay. In fact, the list of places we have stayed more than once is very short.  The Wentworth in New Hampshire and the Bayberry House in Boothbay Harbor, Maine.  Should we travel to London again, The Chesterfield will make our list. We would love to return to The Chesterfield.",5,2014,11,03
105,Great Stay In London,We had a great 10 night stay in London at The Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We had the Chesterfield Suite which had plenty of room and a nice king size bed and was very clean. Turn down service every night in which you had a small token waiting for you. Room service was very quick. I would recommend that you stay here for your next trip to London.Hotel is located close to Green Park and is walking distance to all the sites.,5,2014,11,03
105,A wonderful first stay at the Chesterfield !,"We used to stay in another hotel in Mayfair, but now the Chesterfield is our destination of choice. As other reviews pointed out the staff is really what makes this hotel shine : from the waiter in the Butler's restaurant to the staff in the lobby all were very professionnal and always smiling ! We sampled this hotel to decide if it would be the perfect spot to celebrate my father's 70th birthday in december and the answer is definitely yes ! It was so good we will be returning again in April. Granted the room was on the 'tiny' side but it was well laid out and very quiet which is very important to us. We can't wait for december for our next stay with a Xmas twist !",5,2014,11,03
105,Exceptional hotel and staff!,"We just returned from a ten night stay at this beautiful London hotel. The staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating. We were given the Chesterfield suite and it was beyond lovely and very comfortable. The room was extremely quiet which is always a luxury! It was loaded with eminities and plenty of towels. We enjoyed coming back after a long day to the ""turndown service"" with a special treat waiting for us. We had a lovely dinner at The Butlers restaurant and our waiter was friendly and very helpful with the menu. We also enjoyed our first ever afternoon tea and loved the chocolate tea!  The hotel is in a great location and very easy to get a taxi or walk to the underground and shopping. Thank you for giving us a great London experience at your fabulous hotel! Your hotel and staff are absolutely charming!",5,2014,11,02
105,"Compact, but nice.","The hotel is beautiful in classic English style. We had a king room, and even that was extremely ""compact"", but nicely decorated and clean. Good Fairtrade ground coffee complimentary in the room is a nice touch.

The bathroom was the smallest I have seen anywhere in the world for a hotel in this price range. You have to clamber over the bath to get to the shower, and then you will be touching a wall and the shower screen, which is the same when using the loo.

The dining room was faultless, as were all the staff we encountered.  The barman made an excelant Bloody Mary.

Great location, and easy for Uber taxi pick ups.",4,2014,11,01
105,The employees are so friendly,"We were lucky enough to spend 4 nights here on one of the hotels special deals (4 nights for the price of 3) in one of their double rooms. The room itself was comfortable, not large but then rooms in London are not that large. It was however very ""old world"" - more like a room from an old fashioned mens club (not that I have been to one!), may suit some but not to our taste. The bedroom itself however had all that was required for a comfortable stay but the bathroom was minuscule. As in all hotels - the bigger the room, the better the layout, the plusher the design, the more you pay!! The location is very good in a quiet area in Central London (15-20 mins walk to Piccadilly Circus) however there is a building next door which hosts events/weddings and although we were not bothered by much noise you could hear some. The Management leave a letter in your room (when there is an event on) to state that the music will stop at 2330 - could be a problem? We didn't have any meals or drinks at the hotel, preferring to eat out so cannot comment on the standard of food. The standout thing about this hotel are the employees - so helpful and friendly. This is a very welcoming boutique hotel. We had a very enjoyable stay.",4,2014,10,26
105,It's the staff who really make this hotel stand out...,"Just checked in here for the first time based upon reading all the glowing reviews, I can happily confirm the hotel lives up to all the accolades and praise on day 1.  The staff are so sincere and really helpful.  Location is excellent.  Looking forward to the stay as we celebrate our wedding anniversary.",5,2014,10,24
105,Prestigious meeting venue...,"I've attended a few meetings of The Royal Town Planning Institute's General Assembly at the Chesterfield, the most recent was yesterday. This is a beautifully presented hotel right in the centre of London. It's small enough not to get lost in it but close to all the attractions that Central London has to offer. On arrival the concierge opens the door for you, making you feel quite special even if just for the day. Food is good and there's even individual flannel towels in the Gents! One day I'll treat my fiancée to a say here!",4,2014,10,23
105,A charming hotel in a perfect location with great staff,"My wife and I stayed for one night in this charming hotel as we were in London for a theatre visit to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.

From the moment when we stepped out of the taxi we were made to feel so special. We were greeted by happy smiling staff who escorted us to our beautiful room with a very comfortable bed. We were asked the purpose of our visit and we explained.

On returning form our trip to Piccadilly that evening, we had a drink in the bar while the piano played. As mentioned in other reviews, this hotel definitely has a homely cozy feel which to some may be a little old fashioned but is part of its charm.

When we entered our room, we found a beautifully decorated plate with two cupcakes wishing us a happy anniversary (in chocolate) with a card signed by many of the staff with very thoughtful messages. What a lovely surprise and obviously undertaken with care.

In the morning we had a delicious breakfast delivered to our room which set us up for the day ahead. 

Having stayed in a number of 4 & 5 star hotels in London, the Chesterfield clearly focuses on fantastic customer service which was a joy to experience. We will not be staying anywhere else in London in future having discovered this gem of a boutique hotel in a perfect location with great staff.

Thank you all for a truly memorable stay, we look forward to seeing you again soon.",5,2014,10,23
105,My London Secret,"This is my London best kept secret,! When I step inside the hotel I feel that I have reached home. The staff are always friendly and always attentive to all my needs. The breakfast is a must especially after my morning walk in Hyde Park I can really enjoy what is on offer. Rooms are always clean with all the requirements needed….. Can't wait until my nest visit….",5,2014,10,21
105,The best hotel in London,This hotel is fabulous. The people who work at the front desk are very helpful as is the concierge. It is a terrific location near the tube and very close to trendy eating establishments. The rooms are gorgeous. Stay here and you will not be disappointed. They even have a huge supply of umbrellas to help you in the London rain. ,5,2014,10,15
105,Perfect boutique hotel,"Quintessential London hotel, located in a lovely quiet Mayfair neighborhood. Lovely rooms, great bath. Breakfast, high tea comfortable and fairly reasonable. I love small boutique hotels, that make everything so easy and this is one of the best.",5,2014,10,14
105,An enchanted experience,"How I found the hotel: I was planning to be in Piccadilly area for 2 nights and was booked at Best Western hotel which was very close to Chinatown and the theaters.  After being miserable the first night a that hotel, I found chesterfield Mayfair by accident at 2 am in the morning on Saturday. I called the hotel and the kind, professional and wonderful Mr. Hani Morsi answered the phone. I let him know about my situation and that I need a room for only one additional night in London. He booked me right away for Saturday stay. He set up for the early check-in, included breakfast in the rate and complimentary drink at the bar in the evening. My one day/night stay in London started feeling much better from that point on.
By the way, Hani has been working at the hotel for 40 years. That tells you something about the place....

The staff:  In the morning around 10 am, Leonor greeted me with her wonderful smile. She already knew my name and expected me. She made sure I had early check in. Darren and Englebert were extremely attentive carried my luggage out of the taxi, to the lobby and later placed them in my room once it was ready.  They were ready to help and answered any questions patiently. In the evening I got t meet Hani whom gave me and a friend the free pass for drink, the waiter at the bar ( forgot his name. He told me he is from Cyprus) was very professional and friendly. I felt at home at this hotel. The piano bar feels as if you are in someone's living room while piano man is playing beautiful music. Everyone who works in this hotel feels proud to work there and do their best. They make your experience that much more wonderful.

 Location: Located on James street just 2 blocks off Piccadilly  street, The location can not be better.  Easy walk to all central London attractions. Green park tube station is in one block. 

The room: I asked for a room for one person. I was lucky they had any room available, given that I called the same day, albeit 2 am in the morning.  My room was small but the bed was very comfortable and very clean. Attention was paid to all the details in the room. I had everything I needed. Shampoo, hair drier, plenty of towels, adapter etc. 

Breakfast: the dinning area is beautiful. The food was great and plenty to choose from. The service was great. 

Overall I had an enchanting experience in this hotel and I think people who work there in combination with the atmosphere at the hotel makes it feel so very warm and welcoming with a touch of old fashion luxury. 
I strongly recommend this hotel, over any chain hotel to anyone who is in London for pleasure or business. I will definitely come back to this hotel. Next time I will  give advance notice and ask for a larger room.",5,2014,10,13
105,Beautiful Afternoon Tea,"After some research we chose this hotel for Afternoon Tea. It was a soggy Saturday so we were delighted to reach the hotel for some warmth and comfort - we weren't disappointed.
The reception and dining areas are beautifully decorated, all very plush, classic and opulent. We were seated in the conservatory which I was very pleased about as I'd seen photos in other reviews. 
There was a pianist who played modern as well as classical tunes while we dined. There is a list of options for tea and food types, including gluten-free and vegetarian. We had the classic option consisting of sandwiches, scones and cakes - all delicious! And, much to my boyfriend's excitement, they will refresh your stocks of tea and treats so you definitely won't leave disappointed!",5,2014,10,12
105,Wonderful afternoon tea at the Mayfair ,"A large group of us went to the Mayfair for afternoon tea, it was wonderful! The staff were all polite, professional and friendly, we were seated in the main restaurant which was beautifully decorated.
The food was lovely and very filling, everyone enjoyed it, we even took some home which had been neatly boxed up to take away. We loved the teas, a highlight being the Chesterfield chocolate tea.",5,2014,10,11
105,Everything I wanted,"We had a lovely stay at the Chesterfield the end of Sept.  After a long overnight flight we arrived at the hotel to find our room ready and upgraded.  Needless to say that was a wonderful and much appreciated surprise.  The staff was very friendly, and our room was charming.  The hotel is quiet, but close to resturants and attractions.  Would love to stay here again.",5,2014,10,10
105,Good Old Times,"This has become my No. 1 hotel in London. Unfortunately, very often fully booked. Location Excellent, Style, exactly the way I like it. Not too modern but not old fashioned either. Great service from all the staff and just nice to be there. Price, reasonable for London standards.",4,2014,10,10
105,Great Stay,"A wonderful hotel located in a great area of London.  Short walk to Hyde park, Buckingham Palace and great shopping.  Hotel staff were very friendly and were able to book site seeing attractions to make our visit very enjoyable.",5,2014,10,10
105,Lovely Stay in Mayfair,"My mother, aunt, and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 6 nights in late September.  The staff at the hotel was wonderful and the Chesterfield is perfectly situated to easily walk to many of the sites in London.  I highly recommend booking a suite; we stayed in the Dormer Suite which was lovely, well appointed and very quiet.  Our stay was wonderful from start to finish and I will have no hesitation in booking at the Chesterfield in the future.",5,2014,10,09
105,Charming hotel with superb staff,"This is our second stay at the Chesterfield. We were treated royally. The staff is superb, very professional. They would greet us everyday with a smile. They were tremendously helpful when we were getting railway tickets, which we really could not have done on our own. 
The rooms are small , but well appointed with every comfort of home.
Excellent location.  We will return.",5,2014,10,08
105,"Perfectly located, Perfectly staffed London location","My Wife and I have just returned from a stay(25 Sept. - 30 Sept) in Room 306.  Although this room was on the smallish size, it was no problem.  We didn't spend much time in the room.  Sorry, I digress. 

  On arrival, we were greeted very warmly by the Front Desk staff.  They were very efficient in handling our check in and any special requests we might have had.   The Concierge group at this property was one of the best that I have come across in my International travels they could not have been better.

   The bar staff along with the Dining Room staff did an excellent job during our stay.  They have an excellent piano player in the bar that made cocktail time a special way to kick off the evening.

   The location of the property could not be better Charles Street is quite BUT, it is within walking distance of everything.  Close to Shepherds Market, a reasonable walk to the Green Park tube station and Picadilly.

   There are a number of Pubs in the area and Shepherds Market provides a number of excellent dining options.  If you like Indian cuisine there is an excellent choice right around the corner.

  Have come to Londing on several occasions over the years.  I can say that the Chesterfield Mayfair will not disappoint and it will exceed your reasonable expectations.  We will be back soon
 for a return visit.",5,2014,10,08
105,We will never stay anywhere else in London!,My sister and I spent 5 nights in late August/early September at the Chesterfield Mayfair and couldn't have been more pleased!  The staff was amazing and our room was so comfortable (and not too small as I had previously feared from other reviews).  The location was perfect - we could either walk or take the tube everywhere we wanted to go (or they quickly got us a taxi when it was needed).  The daily breakfast was also really good and just what we needed to get us off to a good start.  And they were always prompt to welcome us back with a smile after our daily adventures.  I just wish we could have stayed longer and also had a chance to eat at their restaurant (in addition to breakfast).  Book it on your next trip to London - you won't be disappointed!,5,2014,10,04
105,We will return to London just to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"Our stay at The Chestrefied Mayfair was the highlight of our trip to London. I cannot say enough about this beautiful and well appointed hotel. Everything was top notch, from the lovely linens, the friendly and helpful staff, to the many beautiful restaurants , tea room and bar. Each night there was a piano player who performed in the bar. Such a warm and yet luxurious hotel.It is located on a charming street not far from everything. Close to The Ritz hotel and Buckingham Palace. pubs and a charming group of shops are around the corner in Shepards Market. Great location! We are looking forward to our next trip to London just to stay again at The Chesterfield Mayfair and will look for other hotels in this group of  Red Carnation Hotels. Absolutely fabulous!!!",5,2014,10,04
105,fabulous hotel excellent service,I stayed here with my mother for a birthday treat in  and we had a deluxe room which was just fabulous we had room service for breakfast.  Service second to none.  Friendly efficient staff who could not do enough for you. highly recommend.,5,2014,10,04
105,Very Nice,"A very good friend I haven't seen in a long time was staying at the chesterfield and we arranged to meet for lunch , Food was very good and it is always great when staff can explain what is on the menu , and I thought it great value ,the soup was hot and was very tasty ,a really nice steak and I just couldn't manage any thing after ,As a disabled customer who is deaf I was spoken to very well and would say the staff are very well trained with a deaf or partial hearing person ,Will be taking my wife for afternoon tea next week as I looked at the menu looks great",5,2014,10,02
105,Home Competition,"Last night I left the Hotel as I have done now several times, after having been there all day and evening in mtgs. Previously, I was there a few weeks ago my daughter and before that with my wife and several times on my own for biz.
The service sets this hotel as a model of excellence for every other hotel and management to learn from. I hope that the manager lets his staff know that from the doorman to cleaning folks to the amazing front desk crew and the restaurant staff they make you feel better than at home.
wow. Jeff Kahn",5,2014,10,02
105,Quiet and pretty rooms.,Great stay at the Chesterfield in May. Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Room was spacious for London standards and only a few blocks from Green Park tube.  Hotel was pretty and had a great British feel. They allowed me an early check in when i had a overnight / long flight.  Breakfast was yummy! ,5,2014,10,01
105,Afternoon tea at The Chesterfield,"It was a birthday present from our daughter. We were told to be nicely dressed and that we did very well understand on arrival. The hotel and the staff are so polite and correct - it gives us as guests an extra feeling of luxury. Also nice to see the other guests as well arrive in suits, shirts etc.
We enjoyed the afternoon tea( working through the whole menu) with a glass of champagne as a starter. The tea we did test in several types and it gave the ""lunch"" an extra touch of luxury as well. The staff is so polite and helpful, we enjoyed the meal. For myself being a person very fond of cakes, this was perfect, continuing ordered a new one of the different types. Only one thing missed; the scones seemed to be a little old. Perhaps because we ate on a Sunday? 

Go there? Of yes, I think you should - it is a British tradition well taken care of.

Thank you.",5,2014,09,30
105,Shame on me to be so late to review,"I was never a Trip advisor person but now i decided to take the keyboard and share my experiance with other, i stayed here abut 4 months ago. 
Location get the 5 star here as you will love the hotel and the places around, My room was big and nicely set up.",5,2014,09,30
105,Fabulous hotel in Every Way!,"My husband and I have stayed here many times so it was an easy choice to Stayhere to celebrate my Sister-in-Law's birthday taking advantage of the Mayfair Weekend Package! Wow! Fantastic rooms, delicious freshly cooked breakfast in the most beautiful dining room served by the most polite professional waiters and waitresses.  Couldn't fault anything at all, every member of staff were extremely helpful, all served up with huge smiles and good humour! In the beautiful conservatory we dined on The most scrumptious bountiful afternoon tea! Fully deserving all of its' awards! Just can't fault the fantastic service, it was an absolute pleasure to stay there! We will definately be back! Thank you all so very much!",5,2014,09,28
105,chesterfield hotel Mayfair,"What a wonderful experience in a wonderful hotel. The rooms were bright and spacious,the staff were friendly,helpful and professional. Thoroughly recommended for that special trip you have been planning.",5,2014,09,28
105,Last minute Friday night decision,"We arrived without a reservation and was treated very well by the loverly lady on the desk.  We got a very good rate and she even through in Breakfast.  Room was nicely decorated with nice soft furnishings and had good wi-fi and TV channels.

Great location for a wonder around and very helpful staff.  Breakfast was great and service overall excellent.  We will return.",5,2014,09,28
105,"Great location, service and amenities","One of the best locations to spend a weekend in London. Walk to the palace, stroll in the parks. Just a fantastic location. Great on property restaurant. Tried lamb on one occassion, drinks on another. Breakfast is great, and so is the room service. Very strongly recommend for both seasoned and first time visitors to London",5,2014,09,27
105,Wonderful stay ,"Great room choices.  Great rooms for price.  The single room really is an amazing choice for London. It is small but has everything you need for a very comfortable stay. 

The locations is perfect.   Staff was great.  Highly recommend. 

Breakfast was the only thing that was good but not perfect. ",5,2014,09,27
105,Very good classic English hotel,"This classical english hotel has a very warm inviting atmosphere. The staff are very polite and helpful. The room, although slightly small, is very clean and well furnished with classical design. The bed is very comfortable. Everything is provided in the room.  The only two things I did not like about the hotel: the bathroom is very small, specially for a big person like me. Second, they had to charge me 50% of the standard room rate to get a late check out at 4 pm instead of 12pm! Which is too much considering other hotels offer this for free. ",4,2014,09,24
105,"super location, great choice in London","I came to London for a convention.  Eventhough the venue was the London Excel which was quite far from downtown, we still decided on staying at the Chesterfield.  It was the best decision ever.  Mayfair is in the center of everything, 15 minutes walk to the best sights and best shopping. It was a 10 minute walk to Green Park tube station which is in the center of the tube map.  It is one straight ride even to Heathrow.
The hotel had a classy flair to it.  The paintings, furniture and color motif were very British.  The doormen and reception people were courteous and smiling all the time.  The room was not that large but the bed was huge and very comfortable.  This to us was important after a whole day of walking around town.  
Overall, I would recommend this hotel because of its location, convenience to getting around London, the comfortable bed and the staff that make you feel welcome.",5,2014,09,22
105,Honoring The Earl of Chesterfield,"The Chesterfield is the epitome  of pretending to Live I'm Mayfair. We had a fascinating view of the American Union Courtyard. I so loved walking in early morning catching the Greengrocer bleaching the sidewalk anticipating his fine customers for the day. The concierge service was the Finest, and the fresco domed dining was very Mayfair!",4,2014,09,19
105,Great Tea Compared to Others,"We had a weekday tea at The Chesterfield a couple of years ago and enjoyed the quality of the food and service. The waiter asked us often if we needed more hot water, sandwiches--anything we needed. I didn't write a review but after the bad experience we had just last week at The Royal Garden hotel, I feel that I have to give credit where credit is due. When I asked the head waiter for a few more sandwiches at the Royal Garden, he replied ""there is a charge for extra."" Is that so, then ""why do other hotels offer you more, they don't charge."" Reply, ""well we don't."" But no one offered my wife and our friend more hot water for their tea or refills of my coffee which was brought by the cup and not in a carafe. it tasted like Nescafe instant. Also,if you offer Devonshire clotted cream then bring that as Chesterfield does--not yellow whipped butter--which is very cheap. If we return to London tea, it will be at the Chesterfield and not a pseudo and arrogant place as The Royal Garden's Park Terrace restaurant.",5,2014,09,19
105,Lovely hotel with lovely people in lovely Mayfair,"I liked the cozy,  small, single rooms,  the decor, the bedwhites, and the extra powerful shower. The shower is really a highlight! But the best at Chesterfield ,apart from the very British ambience, is its people. They made us feel really welcome since the very first moment we stepped inside, the hallporters, front desk, concierge waiters and lady in charge of the room service, they couldn t be 
more caring . They made us feel they were really happy to have us there and that makes all the difference, it was really nice. We left our luggage with them after checking out for 48 hours,  as we left for a different town for 2 nights.  Back in London we found ourselves with our small carry ons  not able to walk around comfortably for 6 hours until it was time to go to the airport so decided to go to back to the Chesterfield and ask them to book the smallest room for us for just 5 hours  to leave our carry ons etc,  before it was time to  pick up the big bags they already kept for us and finally go to the airport.  They were really  kind and immediately offered to keep everything in the left luggage with no charge,  until it was time to go, so we were free to go around till it was the right time. Very nice. Of course we tipped everybody as it should be... but the real feeling of being truly welcome has no price.  We will definitely recommend it and go back. The Chesterfield is comfortable, elegant and welcoming and employs people that really love what they do and care for the guests wellbeing.  In beautiful Mayfair neighbourhood, close to Piccadilly and the Green Line Underground, one block away from the best indian restaurant in town (Benares). I strongly recommend it.",5,2014,09,19
105,Traditional Luxury and Services,"We stayed in this hotel as we were attending the R2 Festival in the park and decided to make a long weekend of our trip.  We were greeted by the traditional doorman in top hats and our cases picnic chairs etc were quickly whisked into our room without anyone hanging around for a tip.

Our room was not going to be ready until 15:00hrs as the checkout time is quite late at 12:00 which we took advantage of on our day of departure. We had a delightful champagne afternoon tea with the most attentive staff while we were waiting which was well worth the quite high price tag when you take account of quality of food, teas, service and beautiful surroundings.

We used the bar on our return from a show and after the festival and was treated to a pianist on a grand piano which was so relaxing and charming matching the setting so well.  Again couldn't fault the attentive staff.

The room was nice and the beds incredibly comfortable.  I particularly liked the turndown service, the pillow menu.  The room did not have the luxury of the rest of the hotel but chocolates on the pillow and fresh carnations still made it feel special.

The food is excellent and the cocktails expertly made.  A must stay",5,2014,09,16
105,Fabulous,"Absolutely fabulous in every respect but two - the cost of breakfast at £22 per head and a shot of whisky at £11.  Really?!  However, this would not put me off recommending this hotel highly nor stopping at it again given the first chance I get.  Particularly worthy of mention are the staff who are courteous, efficient, friendly and extremely attentive without being pushy. The location is absolutely perfect being a few minutes walk away from Green Park Tube Station.  It is pure luxury at a very reasonable price (except for the drinks and breakfast!).  The bedroom was extremely well laid out and spotlessly clean.  Everything was thought of, even down to  a mini stationery set in one of the draws including pencil sharpener, stapler, post-it notes, paper clips etc.  The management and staff should feel rightly proud of their hotel.",5,2014,09,15
105,Our new favourite London hotel!,"Every aspect of this hotel is perfect in our eyes, from the extremely helpful and attentive staff to the food. 
Our room was spotless and more than adequate for what we wanted with a very comfortable bed. 
We ate in the restaurant, the food was excellent could not fault a thing.
We will definitely be back here next time we are in London!   ",5,2014,09,15
105,Our new favorite London hotel!,"Having stayed at many, many London hotels over the years, my wife and I can now say definitively that the Chesterfield Mayfair tops them all for service and facilities. Our 4-night stay at the end of August was excellent, and we were most impressed with every aspect of the hotel: our room was spacious, spotlessly clean, well equipped, and extremely comfortable; the staff were all most pleasant and helpful; breakfasts and dinners were delicious and served in the hotel's first-class Butlers restaurant. In addition, the hotel offers some great packages, so do look out for those. We reserved a Superior King room, taking advantage of the Boomers' Package; as our stay was over a weekend, this included full English breakfast daily, a bottle of champagne, afternoon tea for 2 on one day (excellent!), and late check-out if required. The hotel is well located, being just a 5-10 minute walk from Green Park tube station. The restaurant offers the possibility of pre-theatre dining, beginning at 5:30pm; this was another aspect of our stay that we appreciated. All in all, we can recommend the Chesterfield unreservedly; it is an excellent hotel.",5,2014,09,14
105,Wonderful hotel with attentive staff!,"Stayed recently one night with my daughter in a twin bedroom which was spacious even with two of us. Mentioned on check in that we were there for a shopping trip before my daughter started her second year at university. When we returned to the room after a few hours there was a card and a cupcake on a plate decorated with good luck wishes for my daughters return to Uni!!! Lovely touch and very thoughtful after only a brief mention!! The staff could not do enough for you, we rang room service twice for fresh milk for our cups of tea in the room, extra sugar etc which was delivered promptly. Breakfast was lovely, in a beautiful restaurant with garden room off it. Again the waiting staff were very helpful and made sure we had everything we wanted. In all a great stay and one we would love to repeat soon. Very quiet area of London but still within walking distance of shops tho took taxis on the way back!!",5,2014,09,14
105,A wonderful afternoon tea!,"We decided to try afternoon tea at the Chesterfield as it has recently won a Tea Guild award and what a treasure we found! Nestled in the heart of Mayfair, it has a wonderful feel as soon as you walk through the front door and we were taken care of immediately. All four of us were taken to a lovely table with lots of room and not too close to anyone else so we could have a good old catch up! 

We were informed that it was honey based afternoon tea as they have bee hives on the roof of the hotel at the moment, which was amazing to hear! The tea menu was great and I chose a chocolate tea, which was delicious! The tiers quickly arrived and we delved into the sandwiches, the chicken with almonds around the bread was a particular favourite and we were very happy when they offered to refill the sandwiches, always a bonus! The scones too were delicious and we enjoyed the honey that they provided from their bees. The cakes to finish with were also wonderful, we split each one so that we could try them all. My mum's favourite was the honeycomb chocolate egg and the mousse in a flower pot with a little bee was so sweet!

Just before we left they asked if we wanted to take any sandwiches on our journey which was great as my parents had a long train journey back to Dorset that evening. The staff were so attentive, which is not always the case at other afternoon tea's that I've been too, and they were very friendly, making it even more memorable.

We always go to afternoon tea when the parents come to visit and we all agreed that it was one of the best we've ever been to, I shall be bringing my friends soon enough.

Thank you too all the wonderful staff!",5,2014,09,13
105,Great Location Friendly Staff,"I stayed at the hotel in September 2014. I stayed here for a few days and enjoyed my stay. My room was large enough and the amenities in the hotel were good. I didn't have much of a view, but I was there for site-seeing. The staff was quite friendly and amicable. Always available and ready to help, whether it was from room service or the doorman fetching a taxi. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Green Park underground station. It is a short walk and you can get to the rest of the city from there. It is an upscale area with lots of restaurants within walking distance. The one complaint I have was that my bathroom was a bit cramped. I would have liked a larger space there. Everything else was great though.",4,2014,09,12
105,Amazing hotel - excellent attention to detail,"The service in this hotel is absolutely fantastic, we stayed for my 30th birthday and the check in was really personal and I received card signed by the hotel staff and a birthday cake in room. 
The rooms are small but beautifully furnished, bathrooms and luxurious and the showers are fantastic. 
Would recommend having cocktails in the bar there too... yummy!
Great for walking to the main attractions not far from the palace and houses of parliament. 
 We have stayed in other similar priced hotels and have not had the service that is offered here. Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,09,10
105,Great hotel and location,", service is impeccable, rooms small, but lovely, great shower, and restuarant food EXCELLENT!

Helpful staff, and doorman was unbelievable helping with an issue and guiding us to best areas for shopping and dining.  Location is great for many sites.",5,2014,09,09
105,Great Place to Stay in Mayfair and best value in London - ask for room off main street is tip,"Stayed here twice, last trip. Great location in center of London. Well run. Well staffed. Quiet area only recommendation is request a room off the main street, which isn't really a main street but a few motorcycles and mopeds do rip by at night otherwise. Value-wise this Carnation hotel is best you can get in London, I promise you that. I find it great for shorter stays like 2-5 days when you need to get in and get out. For longer stays I would stay at the Soho hotel. Thats just me. All in all I'd recommend to anyone ESPECIALLY first timers to London who want to make a safe pick and have super service value and location.",4,2014,09,08
105,"great stay, great location and great service","check in experience was very personal...i even had a birthday cake in my room that was a lovely touch. room is a good size, was quiet and is in walking distance to main attractions in london.

room was light and airy. no downside, it was just expensive but that's london for you!",5,2014,09,08
105,Excellent stay in mayfair,"My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights, during August, and it was a very good choice indeed. The staff was excellent, very friendly and helpful and the property itself is very well maintained. Location is one of the biggest highlights as it is located in a calm area of mayfair, where, at night, was very quiet, it is also very close to the tube ( greenpark station ) and berkeley square ( where you can find some options to eat ). The rooms are nice but small, with good amenities and fast wifi. Overall experience was quite good, with a very good value - I would stay again.",5,2014,09,07
105,What a wonderful Hotel & Restaurant,"This is second time to stay here.  First time last year, and all wonderful experiences were confirmed again this year.   The heart of any wonderful hotel or restaurant is an experienced and well trained staff.  These employees seem to love serving guests and making them welcome and comfortable.  All are very gratuitous and a joy to be around.  My wife and I appreciate being treated so very well.  
The chief prepares excellent food and it is served elegantly.  Our compliments to these folks and they made it almost impossible to eat at any other restaurant in a city full of great restaurants.
The hotel is convenient to the heart of the city and entertainment.  We whole heartedly recommend to all.",5,2014,09,06
105,Very glad we chose this hotel,"We stayed here on a 4 night visit to London.  I had read good reviews on this property and it turned out to be an excellent choice.  The staff are excellent and the hotel very nice.  The rooms are small, but nicely updated.  We were upgraded to one of their suites, which was still pretty small but enough space.  The hotel is very quiet, which was a pleasant surprise so close to central London.  There are nice restaurants close by and food in the hotel was good as well.  The location is great, with the Tube only about a 5 minute walk and Buckingham Palace only about a 15 minute walk.  It's just another 15 min or so to walk on to Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey.  The rates compared favorably to other hotels in the area.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,09,05
105,Excellent,"Stayed there for 5 nights. I arrived well before normal check-in time and the receptionist was very friendly and immediately allowed me to check in at no extra charges. 

Room was excellent, comfortable bed and with all the facilities you'd expect. Room service was superb.",4,2014,09,05
105,A Bit of Heaven in London,"From the moment we entered this lovely hotel we were warmly welcomed by the staff.  Every day when we left to go out, and when we returned from our adventures, the staff greeted us and really make us feel as if we were coming home. This small hotel is located on a beautiful street right near the hub of everything any visitor would want to see.  The premises is very British and very warm and cozy.  The food is excellent~ breakfast and dinner were faultless. While it may not have a gym or some of the other amenities of a 5 star hotel, this is 5 star in every other way. The concierge, Chris,was amazing and helped us with everything, including making phone calls for us.  The rooms, while small are immaculate and the linens are very high quality, which is unusual for such a well priced hotel. I am hoping to go back again next year.",5,2014,09,03
105,Beautiful,"We had an amazing experience in this gorgeous hotel! Pampered from checking in until
The moment we had to leave! The bed was so comfortable and the room was really quiet considering the location, breakfast was a real treat. Perfect location .. Cannot fault this place at all",5,2014,09,02
105,Extraordinary,"What a wonderful, outstanding hotel!! Service was impeccable and concierge, Chris, extraordinary. Breakfast was far more than one could imagine. Excellent location close to everything yet in a quiet neighborhood. We can't wait to return.",5,2014,08,31
105,Home from Home,"Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.  Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.",5,2014,08,29
105,Overall excellence,"My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield.  The Chesterfield never disappoints.  This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name!  She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself!  This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty.  Well done!",5,2014,08,28
105,"Quaint, cozy and lovely","Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou!
The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport.
I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in.
Hopefully will get to return soon
",4,2014,08,27
105,Excellent Hotel in a perfect location,"Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding.  Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals.

The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience.

Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

Already looking forward to a return visit.",5,2014,08,27
105,Excellent,"Excellent service. Excellent location. the rooms are a little small, but everything else makes u forget the tiny space and forces you to fall in love with this authentic English hotel. The concierge service in this hotel is phenomenal! A superb hotel!",5,2014,08,26
105,Perfect Mayfair Hotel,We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.,5,2014,08,26
105,RHARDIE10,"This hotel is magnificent. Rooms are bright and cheery. Staff is more then helpful. Area attractions are in walking distance. Taxi service is right in front when necessary. Restaurant is top quality. Concierge service staff is exceptional, answering all questions with expert",5,2014,08,25
105,Wonderful hotel and attentive staff,"I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield.  Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed.  From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome.  We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special.  We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one.  Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team.  Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.",5,2014,08,25
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel,"CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND
The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process.  The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.  It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub.  If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you!  I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.  Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. 
My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present.  No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday.  The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in today’s world.  However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic.  I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.  Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the world’s inhabitants are morning people.  For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. 
We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.  I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dog’s, literally).  I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear.  Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel.  Well, if the room is facing active building construction and it’s adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet.  Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing.  Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught.  Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someone’s published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen).  After several days I spoke to the hotel’s assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite.  Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.  We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out.  Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid.  Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.  The hotel’s night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.  No problem for us, da night people.  
Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotel’s staff and management.  They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn.  Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotel’s general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant.  He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in.  In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere.  I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staff’s behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner.  I believe it is largely due to the hotel’s staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time.  It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering.   
The Chesterfield Mayfair’s room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.  The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; it’s a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.   The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand.  You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel .  The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower.  Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect.  Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just won’t work for some folks.  Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped?  Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on.  We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC.  We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts).  Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. 
The Chesterfield Mayfair’s hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister.  We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done.  My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our home’s staircase; not.  The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collection… or is the one in the Wallace the copy?  I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dog’s head in his right hand.  The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels.
The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel’s restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere.  The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isn’t.  We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers.  They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation.  Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurant’s high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.  If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium.  The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field.  You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image.  Butlers’s staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field.  Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrée specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table.  We sampled it both days and were very pleased.  The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful.  Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par.  Bon Appetite! 
In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list.  And if London is not on your goto list, put it there.  We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that.  London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ).  London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers.  Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion.  We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage.  On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy.  That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project.  Don’t miss today’s London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty.  All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display.  London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction.  After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.",4,2014,08,24
105,Like Coming Home,"We stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair on the way to and coming back from Africa.  The hotel is lovely, the staff was wonderful and tried very hard to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  We had 4 days in London prior to flying to Capetown and when we came back for an additional 4 days before flying home to Los Angeles it was like coming home.  Mayfair is a great location, we would most definitely stay at the Chesterfield again.  Thanks for a great stay!",5,2014,08,22
105,Delighted to return to Chesterfield excellence.,"The Chesterfield was once again our most comfortable base for exploring London and southern England for 12 days.  This is the perfect location for walking, accessing Green Park Tube, exploring all of the wonderful areas of London, yet being able to return to a delightfully quiet and safe neighbourhood for the evening.
The hotel staff are exceptionally obliging and a delight to chat with over a leisurely breakfast or a late night glass of wine in the bar.  The rooms are beyond comfortable and truly elegant.
An added bonus is the hotel's proximity (3minutes) to Shepherd Market. This is a small three street area filled with great pubs and terrific, very small bistros that deliver great service and wonderful foods of all varieties. All in all, the Chesterfield is the perfect London location.",5,2014,08,22
105,Truly a magnificent hotel with staff that loves their job,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is truly an amazing hotel.
I have stayed here as a solo traveler in June, bc I had an event to attend in London . 
The location is perfect, in a quiet street in Mayfair within walking distance of parks, restaurants (such as Scott’s) and shops.
The staff and service are outstanding. From  the doorman, the people at reception , the breakfast service, every single employee  knows how to make you feel welcome and special. You can see that they love their job and their hart is in it.
The rooms are lovely and cozy, bathrooms are well equipped. The internet is free and works well.
There is enough and good quality tea provided in the rooms (without great biscuits).
The breakfast is part a buffet, while cooked breakfast is ordered, thus very fresh and just like you want it.
The bar is again very cozy and the food is excellent. 
I used to go to the Montcalm whenever I went to London for a private visit, however as of now, I will go to the Chesterfield Mayfair",5,2014,08,22
105,perfect stay,"First time we've stayed at The Chesterfield ( we have usually stayed at their sister hotel) and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
The room was lovely and cool (such a relief – we’re not used to heating!), quiet and extremely comfortable. My husband often doesn't sleep well in strange beds but he had two wonderful nights’ sleep (as did I!).
The room was clean and spacious and well equipped. We really enjoyed the turn down service which many hotels seem to have abandoned now.
For the first time ever, we had breakfast in our room both mornings and it was delicious. My husband particularly liked having the tomato ketchup and brown sauce provided. Alice, who brought our breakfast up on the first morning was lovely – friendly, chatty and helpful – and remembered our name when she saw us by the lift later – amazing! A young man brought breakfast on the second morning and he was also very nice (although maybe not quite so many extra touches such as asking if we wanted the plate covers removed etc).
The ladies on reception were all extremely helpful and friendly and the doorman was brilliant – directing us, loaning us an umbrella, and generally making us feel very special guests.
When we left, three men fell over themselves to take our luggage out and pack it in our taxi – it is so nice to have that special treatment!
Good central position - and perfect for Buckingham Palace (just across the Park), theatres, shopping etc.
Wish we could have stayed longer! And am now counting the days until we can return!",5,2014,08,21
105,Wow!!,"We went for afternoon tea for my friends 8 year old daughters birthday. I cannot enthuse enough about the whole experience! The food was lovely, the hotel was charming, but most of all, the staff were amazing! They really made the experience wonderful for us and we felt that there wasn't anything that they wouldn't have done for us!! Well done to all the staff that served us on our special treat xx",5,2014,08,21
105,Amazing,"Our experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair was amazing!  We spent six nights, and each one was memorial.  We would recommend the Curzon junior suite.  The very professional staff was always available to assist with dining reservations and thearte tickets.  The dining room in the hotel was just brilliant.  The food and the service great.  Location is ideal, being convenient to sightseeing, shopping, parks, restaurants, and theatres.  We hope to return to the Chesterfield Mayfair in the future.",5,2014,08,20
105,A Special Hotel,"As per usual an excellent stay at this wonderful hotel.Nothing is too much trouble, and the staff are so attentive,and treated us so well.The service and food is beyond par.We love this beautiful hotel and the location is perfect.We will definitely return again as soon as we can.",5,2014,08,19
105,Love the feel of this hotel,"I stayed here for a couple days last year and enjoyed the look and feel of this hotel.  The rooms weren't large though typical of European sizes but it was close to a few pubs and Hyde Park so the location was amazing.  Prices seem to vary, depending on the time of the year but loved how close this is to the park, tube stations, etc.",4,2014,08,18
105,London at it's Best,"We just returned from 3 weeks in Europe spending the last 4 days at the Mayfair.  From the time we stepped out of the taxi and met Chris at the door to the time we got back in to leave 4 days later, everyone and everything was incredible.  The desk staff was welcoming and attentive.  As a frequent traveller, most hotel desk staff are non-interactive and non-social.  The Mayfair was just the opposite... actually carried on conversations with everyone.  The restaurant staff was outstanding both at breakfast and dinner (David, Lonis, et al).  Everyone made you feel like you were special guests.  The cuisine was great - especially the roast lamb and salmon!  The hotel location was great.  Away from the hustle of the city yet in a great location.  A 5 minute walk to the Underground and a 15 minute walk to St James park and Buckingham.  We even had a great time with our floor housekeeping staff!!  The accomodations were upscale and I thought worth the fare.  We would definitly recommend the Mayfair to others and if/when we return we would return to stay with you-all.

A special thanks to the staff for making us feel at home...It is a 24 hour a day effort and they were excellent.",5,2014,08,18
105,Best of British,"We have just returned from a trip to London, and we spend 4 nights at The Chesterfield. We were very impressed with this hotel and would without a doubt stay here again, and we would happily recommend it to people. The location, in my opinion, is the best spot for exploring London. It's set in a quiet street and set back from the hustle and bustle of London, yet you're only a few minutes away from Piccadilly, Hyde Park, Bond Street/Oxford Street, Green Park , Piccadilly Circus and the West End. In terms of public transport there are non stop busses running along Piccadilly which will take you in all directions and Green Park Tube for the Underground.
The rooms are traditional decor, and very comfy. Service was excellent and staff were always willing to help you with whatever they could.There is also free high speedWiFi throughout the hotel including the rooms . This hotel really felt like our ""home from home"" during our time in London.",5,2014,08,16
105,Home from Home,"What a fantastic hotel this is, it was a treat for my friends birthday and they went that extra mile to make our trip wonderful, from the Doorman to the Manager everything was perfect.
Thank you so much to all the staff at this beautiful hotel.
I would especially like to thank Kathryn who took my booking way back in January, it was lovely to meet you face to face.
My husband and myself visit London at least 4 times a year so The Chesterfield will be the top of our list of hotels from now on.
The rooms 603 and 605 are fantastic, and to say we were in the middle of Mayfair there was no noise and we could sleep with the window open, which is a plus for me as I live in the country and hear no noise at all when home, so to go to our capital city and be able to open windows was great for me!.
Thank you once again to all the team of the Chesterfield for making two 65+ ladies very happy.",5,2014,08,16
105,Great Hotel and staff,"My wife and I spent another wonderful long weekend availing of the weekender deal which included Afternoon Tea and a complimentary bottle of their own Champagne at this hotel. We joined family from the USA that have stayed here many times in the past because of the friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is just a short walk away from the main shopping areas, Hyde Park and tube. The staff all go out of their way to ensure your stay is memorable. The restaurant is excellent and the wine list includes fine wines from their own French vineyard and winery. All in all a great central base for a visit to London.",5,2014,08,14
105,Perfect!,Situated in a great location in the middle of London's heart with a luxurious and cozy atmosphere and excellent service (delicious breakfast!). Thank you for this lovely experience during our 5 nights of stay!,5,2014,08,14
105,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair for 5 days.  Perfect location, we could walk everywhere.  The bed and linen were so comfortable, the service impeccable, breakfasts were delicious and very professional and friendly employees.  When we go back to London, we will not consider going anywhere else but the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2014,08,13
105,Lovely Experience,You get what you pay for with this lovely hotel. The location is ideal in Mayfair accessible to all tourist and shopping facilities. Staff and food were excellent.   I would always book this hotel for return visits to London.,5,2014,08,11
105,English class for less cash,"We were very impressed with the hotel amenities and pleased with the central location within walking distance of restaurants, shops, and the Green Park tube station (10 minute walk). we were fortunate to be able to check in very early and freshen up after a long flight for a nearly full day of sightseeing. The ""Boomer special"" full English breakfast included in our rate was fantastic with a full range of buffet and customized orders. But the staff is what makes this hotel exceptional. Everyone including the doorman, reception, the breakfast waitresses, a maintenance man explaining the TV setup, and Christine the housekeeping supervisor were extremely experienced, friendly and helpful. While not inexpensive, such first  class facilities, location, and service were well worth the charges compared to other hotels in the area.",5,2014,08,07
105,Amazing service and lovely hotel,"Chesterfield is a wonderful hotel, their staff is so lovely and nice and makes me feel as though at home. The location is great because it is next to Hyde park and walking distance away from Oxford street and the picadilly circus also with close access to a subway station. ",5,2014,08,07
105,A perfect stay!,"I browsed many of the other reviews of this property before writing this and I am in full agreement with all of the positive remarks about the excellent staff, immaculate property and rooms, quietness, and location.

Afternoon tea was an experience to relish, and we did.  Absolutely no reservations about giving this hotel my highest approval.

The room was typically small compared to US properties but clean, well appointed, and fabulous bed.  What more does one need for a great night sleep!?

We will go back and look forward to it!  Wish we could spend a few months there.",5,2014,08,06
105,"Fantastic Hotel in Fantastic Location, but the best thing is the Staff!","We stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel on our wedding night in August 2013 and we had such a lovely time that we came back for our first wedding anniversary!

It's a lovely little hotel in a great location but what made us come back were the staff. At every level from front of house to housekeeping, the service is exemplary, professional, personal and friendly - we can't speak highly enough of everyone at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  

Thanks again to the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair - the little touches you do leave a big impression. We will be back!",5,2014,08,05
105,Like second home,"I have stayed more times than I can remember and not once gave I ever been disappointed. The hotel is immaculate and the rooms if not always the largest are beautifully finished. The staff are always so helpful and friendly, many having worked there for years, they make staying there a pleasure. So conveniently located for all the London has to offer with added bonus of having Shepherds Market just a stroll away, like a village in the city",5,2014,08,05
105,Oasis of calm in bustling London,"Just back from our 3rd visit to this amazing hotel, The Chesterfield staff never fail to amaze with their professional and courteous approach, especially given the fact that I got my dates/days mixed up ,letita at reception took it all in her stride without a flicker of panic(think I was more flustered!) . We even received a little anniversary surprise and a card from the staff to help us celebrate our weekend,we are genuinely starting to feel more and more part of a family with each visit,already looking forward to 2015 !. Thank you all for making it such a great weekend.",5,2014,08,05
105,Lovely retreat in a perfect location,"We just returned from an eight-night stay here, and if you're looking for a boutique alternative to the big hotels in Mayfair, I highly recommend this hotel.  As others have said, the bedrooms are beautiful; we stayed in a superior twin bedroom that is quite large by London standards and nicely decorated.  But what impressed us the most was the staff, all of whom were, without exception, friendly and helpful.  We had stayed here a few years ago, and contacted the hotel to request our old room, which they readily agreed to set aside for us.  A third member of our party joined us for two nights, which we had mentioned in our email, and the extra bed and toiletries/supplies were duly set up without us having to mention it again.  All our requests (for more bottled water, etc) were answered within literally a few minutes, and with an unfailing smile.  (Peter, at the front desk, was especially helpful!)

We had breakfast there every day, and were impressed by the quality of the menu and of the waitstaff.  Abigail, the hostess, was wonderful; she greeted us every morning with a radiant smile and (almost) got me to try tea instead of coffee with my meal!  We also enjoyed a fantastic afternoon tea, with attentive service from our waiter, Antonio.  The hotel bar is a pleasant place for a nightcap in the evenings, with a well-stocked bar, plenty of seats, and a very good pianist.

All in all, we found the Chesterfield to be just as wonderful this trip as it was our first time, and I consider it a very good value for money in this part of town.  We definitely would stay here again!",5,2014,08,04
105,You will be spoiled here!,"A perfect stay for us as we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary. From the minute we arrived til a departure cab was called for us, we were treated like royalty. Our travel agent had thoughtfully informed the staff that this was a very special anniversary for us and they certainly made the most of it--complimentary pastry, a lovely very personal card signed by the staff, champagne and late afternoon tea. Our room was quiet and lovely yet it was a very easy walk to all the ""action""---Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Harrod's, to name a few. We splurged on dinner at the hotel and it was worth it---food, atmosphere and service are really top notch. Our room, The Study, was elegantly decorated so we could overlook the small size of the room. I guess room-size would be the only drawback to this exquisite hotel, and it is a minor issue considering all the amenities and excellent staff. We would definitely go back and look forward to our 60th!",5,2014,08,04
105,Liitle pocket of calm in the bustle of London,"This was my 3rd visit to this hotel and with each and every visit it gets better and better!, there was a slight mix-up on our reservations(entirely my fault right days wrong dates!) but it was all handled with a quiet calm no fuss no histrionics, we had a fantastic surprise of a card and two smashing cupcakes to celebrate our anniversary weekend with, you are not so much a guest more a part of a extended family and I believe that is what sets this hotel apart! see you all next year :)",5,2014,08,04
105,Lovely stay,"We loved staying here, the staff are friendly and warm. The hotel is beautifull and has a real boutique feel to it, very romantic, great for couples who want to get away, also wonderfully located. All in all considered, it is good value for money considering other hotels in this range. I would stay again and recommend this hotel.",4,2014,08,03
105,Fantastic hotel!,"Stayed for one night at the Chesterfield for a romantic night away with my partner. The experience was brilliant from beginning to end, from the friendly staff on the front door and reception, the BEAUTIFUL bedroom and an amazing afternoon tea. My partner had been in contact with the chesterfield prior to our visit, and had arranged to propose to me during our afternoon tea, staff were only too happy to oblige and hid the ring in the scones as a special surprise! They were all really friendly and lovely, it really made the experience for both of us. We were also given a lovely personalised cake and beautiful handwritten note from Alice who looked after the rooms, to wish us congratulations, and the front desk organised a complimentary bottle of champagne! The chesterfield is a fantastic hotel and has brilliant staff, a great place to stay.",5,2014,08,03
105,Great location with a friendly and helpful staff.,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for one week at the end of June.  The staff was very attentive, the accommodations were comfortable and the bar and dining room were first class. Location was perfect for our needs (the Green St. underground was nearby) . After a busy day of sightseeing it was nice to come back to hotel and greeted by Biaggi and all the friendly staff!",5,2014,08,02
105,ALMOST GREAT .,"Good location in central London within walking distance of Oxford St / Bond St shops and numerous restaurants and Clubs. Valet parking available and a knowledgeable Concierge. Rooms comfortable / cosy and public areas easy and sparkling clean. Good Bar, well run, well stocked and seated. Found all employees helpful and friendly. The one let down...Dining Room...no ambiance and service whilst attentive was not observant. Food was just OK, and the roast meat was dry and over cooked. The Executive Chef and restaurant manager need to wake up. They have a lot of competition outside the hotel. Would I go back...yes, but eat outside!",4,2014,08,01
105,Fantastic afternoon tea experience,"My wife and I had a fantastic afternoon tea experience. The reception welcome was the warmest we have received from front of house staff. Quality of food, attentive staff and excellent location all went towards a very enjoyable afternoon in great surroundings.",5,2014,07,30
105,2 night stay,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights before a British Isles Cruise. The location is a 5 minute walk from Green Park Station and it's a short walk to Hyde Park. The National Gallery, Buckingham Palace and many other sites are within a 30 minute walk from the hotel. The room was small but had all the emanities we need. We booked the breakfast and afternoon tea package and were delighted by both. We were also supposed to get a bottle of champagne that they forgot to deliver but gladly posted a credit to our final bill.",4,2014,07,30
105,Amazing Stay! Highly recommended,"We stayed in The Chesterfield Mayfair the last weekend in July, we were staying for 1 night. It was our anniversary and we were greeted in the room with 2 cards congratulating us on our anniversary, one from the general manager and the other from members of the team working in the hotel. I was nicely surprised to see that detail was remembered and thought of. Our room was lovely and the beds so comfortable, I wished we were staying longer! The bathrooms are a really nice size and they are generous with the bathroom toiletries provided, along with bath robes and very comfy slippers! 
We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant that evening and the service was really excellent. We were made to feel so welcome and important. The food was really incredible, topped with the excellent service, I would go there time and time again! I have eaten in many restaurants in the Mayfair area and would question the service in some restaurants but in this hotel you are a person and a very important one at that! 
For breakfast, there was a array of food to choose from along with the menu for a cooked breakfast, it catered to both our needs. 
I must say the professionalism demonstrated in this hotel was excellent, clearly the staff are trained to a high standard and not once did I see this slip. Would I go back? Most definitely!",5,2014,07,30
105,"Traditional, with a Modern Twist","When I was searching for a hotel for our six night stay in London, I was a little hesitant to choose the Chesterfield Mayfair, because it looked a little stodgy in some of the pictures.  But numerous people had recommended it as a great option in Mayfair, so I decided to take a chance and, boy, am I glad I did!  What a great stay! We were assigned a room that had been recently updated. It was really lovely, with modern bathroom fixtures, including a heated bathroom floor which was really nice to have, even in the summer. The bed was extremely comfortable and between that and the very effective air conditioning, we slept very well.  The staff was very helpful and gave us great advice on the best way to see the sites during the busy summer season.  Breakfast was included and excellent.  And the location is fabulous.  Within walking distance are lots of great cafes and restaurants, plus easy access to the tube.  The Chesterfield Mayfair was not at all stodgy....it was modern, yet traditional.  A gem of a hotel in London!",5,2014,07,29
105,Chesterfield,"Stayed at the Chesterfield for 5 days with our 10 year old grandson.  Rented a Junior Suite.  Service was excellent as was the value (one free day) in an area (Mayfair) where there is not much value to be found.  Room was a bit tight especially by American standards.  Continental breakfast was good not great.  Overall experience, driven by the service, was very good.",4,2014,07,29
105,Excellent night's sleep,"A charming hotel with lovely staff and very welcome air con! An anniversary treat we stayed for one night and it's location was perfect. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The full breakfast was excellent. A good price as a late booking, deservedly popular. Only negative was bathroom was a little cramped.",5,2014,07,28
105,A great experience,"I attended a wedding celebration at this lovely hotel and was very impressed with the overall experience. 

Friendly attentive staff, wonderful setting and excellent food.

The level of professionalism shone through and would give me the confidence to book an event here.

I did not stay overnight but would be very happy to should I require a hotel in the area.",5,2014,07,28
105,A Slice of English Heaven,"This was our first trip to England and so we really didn't know where to stay.  After a fair amount of online research we choose this hotel.  I am so glad we did!  It was the perfect spot.  The room was luxurious compared to most hotels I've stayed in abroad.  There were a good number of plugs for our multiple devices, and even one for US plugs, AWESOME! The location was very convenient to the Tube, near the park, and an easy walk from a number of sites, activities and dining options of every variety.  Our room was well maintained throughout our stay and I found myself looking forward to seeing if turn down service would offer chocolates or bath salts, both of which I enjoyed.  We arrived at the hotel at 3 pm after a long non-stop flight from San Francisco and I was thrilled that after quickly freshening up, we had what ended up being the best meal of the trip, high tea in Butler's Restaurant.  I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who can afford the luxury price tag.",5,2014,07,26
105,"Great location, sweet, friendly hotel.","As everyone says, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a lovely hotel.  It was recommended to me by a Brit, so I was a bit disappointed, as an American, to find so many Americans there. (Americans whom seem insistent on showing their status via a high end holiday at the Chesterfield.  Crazy.)  Luckily, we did not buy the breakfast package and only ate breakfast in the dining room on the morning of our arrival.  I felt it was much more fun to venture out to other spots in Mayfair for breakfast, such as the May Fair Kitchen, which was also more reasonable than the Chesterfield with a much broader selection.

The Chesterfield is lush and quiet.  And they tweet!  Fatou runs the twitter program and loves to receive hints and suggestions.  She knew of my request for an early check in, which she acknowledged upon our arrival and was able to accommodate within an hour, despite the fact that it was a Sunday morning.  She also noted my hashtag (#30thanniversary) and sent a treat to our room on our second day.

I love the rooms.  They are decorated in lush fabrics, used in heavy draperies, a gorgeous bed quilt and upholstered walls.  While the rooms are teeny tiny, we did get a king sized bed, which was luxuriously made with pressed embroidered linens.  The rooms are really no more than small chambers, but you can’t hear your neighbors because of the upholstered walls and well-insulated ceilings and floors.  While the carpet is wonderfully worn in the hotel, the carpet and fabrics are brand-spanking new in the rooms.  You feel pampered.  

Despite the fact that this is England, the HVAC system is highly effective, adaptable and quiet (in room 401).  Truly, the only thing we heard was some plumbing from time to time.  The windows are solid and fairly soundproof, and able to be opened if you want some outside air and commotion. We faced the courtyard, which got a bit rowdy at times, but we are city people and didn't mind.

The location was superb for our visits to BBC Proms and points east.  There are some Barclays Bikes just around the corner on Curzon - we rode them at least twice a day (and late at night!) to get around quickly and efficiently.  Taxis are always at the ready in the front of the hotel, although we also Ubered quite successfully.

We loved our stay.  We finally found a spot that we can return to in London.  Thank you Chesterfied_MF",5,2014,07,24
105,Wedding weekend!,"We can't thank the staff at the Chesterfield enough for an amazing stay for our wedding weekend. We were looked after so well, with really fun staff, great service with lots of suppliers turning up on the morning of the wedding. The porters were great helping with some last minute wedding bits! We loved every minute and we felt very well looked after thank you!",5,2014,07,24
105,Pleasant small hotel,"My wife and I recently spent three nights at this hotel. Very charming staff ( very ""British"") and in a great area. Unfortunately the room was very small as was the bathroom. There are other hotels in London for approximately the same price with much larger more contemporary rooms, perhaps not as charming but more comfortable.",3,2014,07,22
105,Friendly 1st Class London Hotel,"My husband & I are in our 60s & have been traveling in Europe since we were in our 20s.  I'm American & he's British.  From time to time we have a splurge & stay in a 4 star hotel.  We decided to stay 3 nights at the Chesterfield, which is our favorite London hotel.  Unlike some other up-scale places the staff here is efficient, friendly & even chatty, especially when they're not busy.  The hotel is in the safe & exclusive Mayfair neighborhood close to Oxford Street, Picadilly & the Green Park tube station.  The exterior is cheery with a red canopy over the front door & pots of geraniums.  Inside the decor is Georgian in some areas & Victorian in others--old-fashioned, but in a good way.  They have an impressive British-style lobby like out of a Masterpiece PBS series.  If you go on their website they offer Internet specials that help save money, but the room rate is well above most people's travel budget.  The guests were a mixture of nationalities, but some were Americans traveling with their children.

Most people get the buffet breakfast included with their room, but this trip we choose not to.  Instead we took a short walk to the local Sainsburys & picked up yogurt & fruit.  We tried lunch at the Chesterfield the first day.  I had pea soup, a fantastic, fresh Cobb salad & wonderful multi-grain bread with honey produced by the hotels own bees on the hotel roof, followed by an elegantly served cup of chocolate-flavored tea.  The 2nd day we had High Tea in the Conservatory instead of lunch.  Lots of goodies--sandwiches, scones & desserts plus more tea.  This time I tried the flower tea that ""blossoms"" inside a glass teapot.  3rd day we had the Dover Sole Meuniere with delicious veggies in the dining room for dinner.  We also had drinks in the cozy piano bar after a long day of art galleries.  All the wait staff were efficient, detail conscious & very friendly.

Our room was small but clean, the beds comfortable, marble bathroom & the decor was Victorian style.  No detail was overlooked--good quality Fragonard toiletries, note pads, stationary, fluffy towels, free bottled water, wifi, newspaper, cable TV, etc.  The only downside was the noise from surrounding buildings where they were having loud parties.",5,2014,07,20
105,"Good location, nice staff, but loud music from neighboring event space.","We enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  

We had one hiccup at the start - we asked for a quiet room in our reservation.  We arrived early and our room was not ready so we were offered a room facing a courtyard which we were told would be quiet.  The first night (Friday) there was a party in the courtyard and it was noisy but not too bad.  A note from hotel management was left in our room to let us know in advance - thoughtful.  The next night there was live music that was very loud from the courtyard area.  No note this time so we called the front desk and they told us that there was an event/party in the adjacent building.  They said they had asked the music to be lowered and that it should end by 10 PM.  It was already almost 10 PM but we waited a bit.  When there was no sign it would stop or lower in volume (the music drowned out the TV in our room), we called the front desk again and asked to be moved. The response was that it was generally only on weekends, but that wasn't really helpful and we didn't want to risk there being more events during the week or the following weekend when we would still be there so we again asked to be moved.  They found a similar room (in the same hall as the room we were initially supposed to be in), no view (over the air units) but at least quiet.  As we walked to the new room, we could hear the music through the halls of the hotel.  It wasn't a big deal, but it was a bit inconvenient to have to repack, move and unpack, and we were disappointed that we were told the courtyard room would be quiet when it is known that parties are regularly held next door.  

Otherwise we enjoyed our stay.  As others have noted, the location is in lovely Mayfair and is very convenient to the Tube, parks, shopping, museums and other sites.  The hotel is on a nice small street with little car traffic. We were in a superior King room - we know hotel rooms in Europe are often smaller than those in the US/N. America, and thought the smaller/standard room would have been too small. The superior King was not large but fine for us.  The air conditioning worked well in our room.

The reviews we have read rave about the service and staff.  We thought the staff was very friendly and service oriented, but not extraordinary relative to other hotels we have stayed in other cities/countries.  Perhaps our view is a bit colored by the noisy room issue - that we were given a room that faced onto an event space known to host parties after specifically requesting a quiet room and we had to affirmatively ask twice to be moved to another room. Nevertheless, we did find the staff generally friendly and responsive, just not exceptionally more than we have experienced at other hotels.

A few additional notes:  
The coffee/tea service with french press, teapot and cookies in the room was a nice touch (the coffee was good and strong). After a long day out it was very nice to come back to the room and relax with a cup of tea and cookies. The bottled water was appreciated as well.

Turn down service - a nice touch that is sadly becoming less common.  They leave different things on your pillow, a chocolate covered wafer cookie, bath salts, small facial mist. 

Maid service - seemed to reach our room later in the day.  Some days we went out for breakfast, would come back around 10:30 - 11 and the room was still not made up, even when we hung the sign for maid service on the door.

Hot water - if your room has separate knobs for hot and cold, the hot gets really hot quickly. There is a warning note in the hotel information book in the room, but I didn't see that before my first shower.  Our bathroom was quite small.

We went out very early one morning (before 6 AM) and there were warm pastries and coffee offered in the lobby.  We didn't see it any other morning so guessed it might be for guests leaving before breakfast was available in the dining room, but not sure.

After we returned home, we received a note that we would be receiving a subscription to Travel & Leisure magazine because we stayed at a Red Carnation hotel.  A nice surprise.",4,2014,07,17
105,Afternoon Tea is awsome,"This is the first time I and my family having a traditional British afternoon tea. The service is really great. All the waiters are young, polite and extremely friendly. Even though the hotel is heavily filled with history and tradition,you can tell that those young waiters are passionate about their job, and more importantly are proud of their dinning tradition.",5,2014,07,17
105,A Gem in Mayfair,"My husband and I recently returned from a five night stay at this amazing hotel. The hotel is immaculate and the room was lovely. We were treated like royalty and any requests were taken care of in a matter of minutes. We want to thank the manager, Oliver Raggett and his entire staff for taking such good care of us!!! We will definitely return to the Chesterfield Mayfair upon our next trip to London.",5,2014,07,16
105,Best choice we could have made,"After hours spent researching various hotels for our 5 night London stay, we decided that the Chesterfield Mayfair offered everything we wanted in a hotel - wonderful boutique size, superb location for accessing all that London has to offer (as outlined by the reviewers below), a quiet street without loud commercial activity infringing on a person's sleep, and the lovely ambience of Mayfair itself.  We could not have made a better choice.  The Chesterfield is lovely, as are the wonderful people who work there.  From the doormen, to the reservation desk, to the concierge staff, to housekeeping, the wonderful people in the restaurant and everyone else, they were so friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful.  After returning to the hotel in the afternoons or evenings, we were welcomed back as though part of the family.   Truly a wondeful experience.  There is a 100% chance we will return, hopefully very soon, and I will be recommending this excellent hotel to anyone I know of heading to London.  Our stay could not have been more delightful.",5,2014,07,16
105,A great place to stay...,"Loved this place. Great boutique hotel. Don't stay at a large chain hotel. The service is awesome. The staff is very very friendly, professional and willing to help. The location is wonderful and in walking distance to many great sights, including Buckingham Palace. Short walk to Green Park subway station (Underground) which is about 45 mins to/from Heathrow with all the stops,  and short walks to Green Park and Hyde Park. Short cab or walking distance to good food, shopping and Central London attractions. Many of the tour buses stop a couple blocks away at the Green Park underground stop. Great English Buffet set up that you can enjoy in the garden room: fresh fruits, danishes, juices, eggs, breads, granola, cheese and meat, etc... Not a tea drinker but I'm sure they did that well. Rooms are very nice and clean (with tapestries on the wall for a nice touch) but small like most big cities. The concierge will get you tickets to most attractions to save time waiting in lines... Loved it..",5,2014,07,15
105,Very British and Very Lovely,"I was traveling alone when I stayed at The Chesterfield hotel, before and after a cruise.  It could be a home away from home.  The staff is superb, the dining room and bar area are excellent, as was the bedroom.  Mayfair is wonderful, you can walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace and it seems you're close to everything.  Comfy luxury is what you'll find at the Chesterfield.  Enjoy!",5,2014,07,15
105,Ideal hotel for London stay,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  It is convenient to Green Park and Hyde Park, and a short walk to the Underground.  It was a short subway ride to all the major attractions and easy to navigate; grab a day pass - you'll get your moneys worth.  The Chesterfield staff was friendly and helpful.  Although our arrival was well-before check-in, they managed to have our room ready in 90 minutes.  Fabulous dinner at the Butler Restaurant - the Dover Sole is highly recommended.  The room was clean and good-size considering the normal European hotel room.  Perfect for a couple getaway.",5,2014,07,15
105,Close to everything but away from crowds.,"I did not find any bad review of this hotel anywhere on the web. Nicely decorated in classical British club style,  located on a quite street in a very center of Mayfair Close to: Hyde Park and Green Park, Oxford and Bond street shopping, Piccadilly, multiple tube stations and plenty of restaurants.",5,2014,07,15
105,Perfect and Lovely...,This was a 2 nighter as we were primarily travelling via the Queen Mary 2. Met some friends and family straight off the ship and we all stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for a few days. The morning diningroom was a bit chaotic but tea was lovely as was a late night snack at the bar. The room was plush and comfortable. Conveniently located for a walk about and most attractions close by via taxi. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.,4,2014,07,14
105,A Wonderful Hotel,My wife and I stayed recently at the Chesterfield Mayfair and had a fantastic time for our. Anniversary. The Superior Room was fantastic and the English breakfast could not have been better. We are looking forward to our stay this October.,5,2014,07,14
105,A Rare Find!,"This is a wonderful hotel in every way: the room marvelous, the location unbeatable, the ambiance clubby but welcoming, the staff gracious. From the bell captain to waitperson in the restaurant to the footman hailing a cab -- my husband and I found everyone knowledgeable and very kind. What a find! I write this for future travelers but mostly so that a hotel so well run be rewarded for its efforts.",5,2014,07,14
105,'' The Jewel in Mayfair '',"This was our second visit to this wonderful and charming Hotel, very British with staff that just want to help and make your stay as memorable as possible, we had a refurbished room on the seventh floor which was perfect.
We booked a weekend break direct through the hotel which was excellent value which included breakfast and afternoon tea which we had on Sunday afternoon, which was very nice with a pianist playing in the background, after tea most people where given a little goody box which included a further generous portion of cakes in a lovley package to take home.
We booked the hotel also for its location as we where going to the O2 to see Robbie Williams, we had a five min walk to Green Park station which was then a further 20mins on the Jubilee Line straight to the venue.
We have booked another weekend in |December and the prices have increased !",5,2014,07,14
105,Beautiful Understated Elegance.,"The Chesterfield hotel in Mayfair , Central London with Style, Elegance and Luxury , coupled with 5 star service from friendly ,efficient staff.
Nothing was too much trouble .
The rooms were of a very high standard , with comfortable beds. 
The welcoming bar stayed open until the last person left.
The breakfast was without doubt the finest ever.",5,2014,07,13
105,A well-appointed room in a quiet street,"There are many lovely things about this hotel, starting with its staff, its location, and the sublime bed.

In the (small) room, everything works, and how often can you say that about a hotel room?  There's a heated towel-rail to dry the little things you've washed in the sink (which stoppers properly), a safe, tea facilities, multiple wall sockets to accommodate different plugs (very smart, Chesterfield);  an iron.  Some office supplies in a drawer - that's a nice touch, too.  Fresh milk for your tea, on request. 

The street noise is manageable, and you can open the windows.   Green Park tube station is a scant ten-minute walk away, as is Gymkhana restaurant.

There are a few downsides.  The shower's excellent, but there's less hot water as the day draws on.  Noise travels between rooms - TV, conversations;  enough to keep you awake.  During my stay there was something like a pump whirring in the background, too.  

The hotel shouldn't place decorative damask cushions right atop the bed's clean cotton pillows.  So a few points off for that, and for the noise and the lukewarm water in the evenings.  I'd still give it 4.5, if I could, and I'd stay there again.",4,2014,07,11
105,A nice cosy hotel in a premium area,"We have been there in a couple of occasions and could appreciate the hotel premises, the oh so British decoration and lovely international personnel. Service is very attentive, beds are comfortable, breakfast is good and fresh (not a huge choice, but everything is top quality) and the calm area guarantees good sleep.

On the downside rooms are not really roomy and bathrooms are quite small, but this is London, right?",4,2014,07,08
105,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My mother and I were given the chance to spend a few days in London, and since we wanted to spend some quality time together, we decided to go for an afternoon tea in central London. Before picking up the Chesterfield as the best place for a afternoon tea, I went through all the good reviews being written on this Hotel and the services. First, it was very easy and quick to book online. Once there, it's was beyond any expectations. 

All the butlers were extremely welcoming and kind. The Hotel is very well located and accessible. The Hotel itself was very beautifully accommodated and elegant. We were then led to our table in a lovely, calm and cosy room. 

We ordered the Afternoon Bee, which was the traditional afternoon tea with the possibility to add honey. You can also ask for a gluten free afternoon tea. The waitress who took care of us was very nice and we didn't wait long to receive our cake stand and teas. 

Everything was absolutely delightful and well dressed. The finger sandwiches were scrumptious, the still warm scones phenomenal and the pastries tasty. The great thing was to be able to ask for any food you wanted to be brought without any charge added to your bill. You could ask for scones, scones and pastries as much as you desired. Even if we wouldn't ask, they were still coming back with some more scones freshly backed. My mum also asked for a chocolate milk and it wasn't added to our bill either.

We stayed for around 2,5 hours and we were never asked to leave. When we decided to go, we still had some food left. They brought us a doggy bag were they put the left overs to take them away with us. 

We had a wonderful afternoon at the Chesterfield and I would highly recommend this place for a afternoon tea. The place and the quality of the service and the food are excellent and I look forward to going there soon.",5,2014,07,07
105,Wonderful - Beyond our expectations,"Being able to stay at the Chesterfield in Mayfair is an indulgence in luxury. While the rooms, elevator, and lobby are small, they utilize every square millimeter to perfection. Every detail has been thought out and designed with the guest in mind. Other than space and a proprietary view, I do not know how any hotel in London could be better.  

The location is perfect and well, it is Mayfair. What else can one say? A great area to take a walk and enjoy life. Hope to be back soon.",5,2014,07,06
105,Just as good,"This was our 2nd visit to the Chesterfield and it was just as good as the first time.

It really is a fantastic Hotel.

Excellent location, close to Piccadilly, Mayfair, Green Park etc.

Everything is thought of and supplied in the Hotel - Bath Robes, Tea and Coffee making facilities, luxury bath products, iron in the room, super tasty strawberries left on the room on turndown, even needle and thread and stationery supplies.

Most of all the Staff are magnificent - perfect service !!

If you visit London, you must consider the Chesterfield 
, you won't be disappointed.",5,2014,07,06
105,Outstanding,"I don't normally use superlatives but the Chesterfield earned the praise.  The staff were exceptional in their friendliness and helpful service.  We needed a restaurant on a Friday night and Tony, the concierge made two phone calls and got us a reservation at a very good Thai restaurant.  Other nights we had already booked at nearby restaurants in Shepherds Market (one block away).  
The location was just perfect for us as we like to visit Green Park (2 blocks away) and Berkeley Square (one block) as well as spend a lot of time shopping on Piccadilly.  We had a breakfast package included with our room, again something we appreciated because we don't like wasting time wandering around for a morning meal.  The Chesterfield's breakfast was perfect for our tastes ... fresh orange juice, very good coffee, 3 or 4 small, thin pancakes (very light), smoked salmon with a toasted bagel, eggs cooked exactly to my wife's order.  Restaurant is beautiful.  One thing I noticed .. of all the small light bulbs in the restaurant, not a single one was burned out.  Indicates attention to detail.
Our room was small with only one good chair to sit in but we spent most of our time outside.  I also had to adjust to the air conditioning ... it can be quite strong.  Even so, my high metabolism caused me to sweat under the sheets/blanket combination until I figured out how to separate the two components.
The bathroom was ample in size.  The shower put out water at an amazing rate .. great way to start the day.
One convenient touch that I haven't always found in London ... electrical outlets were for both UK and US plugs.  No need for a converter when charging phones or using a hair dryer.

I visited the bar a couple of times; if you like Gin & Tonics as I do, make sure you specify with a lime as the bartender was inclined to use a lemon slice.  The drink was great (but expensive) and the accompanying nuts and olives were a good snack to hold me until dinner.  The bar was quiet enough to watch the World Cup in peace.
In summary, the Chesterfield compares favorably to other hotels in Mayfair and is at the top of my list for our next visit.",5,2014,07,05
105,English Charm and Experience,"This is a small charming, full service hotel, with excellent service and friendliness. Located on a quiet street not far from points of interest where you can walk or find transportation to.. The room was well appointed, but small, however, there are several lovely spaces to enjoy on the ground floor for tea, drinks, or just reading the paper.",5,2014,07,05
105,Great place to stay,"Nice location; near plenty of eating and drinking establishments in Shepherd's market. Concierge helpful; arranged barber shop appointment for me. Rooms small but well-done, clean and comfy. 
Definitely worth a return visit",4,2014,07,04
105,Awesome boutique hotel!,"This was our first trip to London and I have to say that this little jewel of a hotel was the highlight of our trip!  From the time we arrived we were treated with the kind of TLC that other hotels only talk about and never deliver.  The small but well-appointed rooms and restaurant and bar were all great, what really impressed me the most was their staff.  They treat you so well, you feel like you're their most important VIP!  I definitely recommend you try this property the next time you're in London .. you won't be disappointed!",5,2014,07,01
105,"small room, elegant attitude","perfect service, what you expect from staff in top hats.  gorgeous, ingenious  redo of  small bathroom--making the most of space, teeny, tiny very clean room with too much furniture and a view of a brick wall.  disappointing breakfast (there are lots of places around the corner since it is in the City), definitely has the feel of the old neighborhood.",4,2014,07,01
105,Nearly perfect,"Located in a quiet residential area, at walking distance from many London attractions.
Did not dine there, but breakfast and afternoon tea were excellent in quality and service.
Room not too big but complete with many typical ""english"" accessories.
Remarks:
- Some noise from airco units on a roof close to the room window
- With all lights off, the telephone green screen is too bright: had to cover him.
- I was charged 1.5 gbp each for two short local calls... :-(",4,2014,07,01
105,Recommended,"Overall, an extremely pleasant experience at this hotel, highlighted by superb service levels. The hotel is located in a quiet part of Mayfair yet within a sort walking distance to attractions such as Picadilly, Hyde Park etc. My only problem with the hotel was that our room (Superior King) was extremely small and it was difficult to manoeuvre around with two adults in the room and our luggage, but overall, I would happily stay there again",4,2014,06,30
105,Fabulous Hidden Gem,"What a fabulous hotel, the staff go out of their way to make your stay just perfect.
Biagio the restaurant manager was very attentive to detail,  we had afternoon tea which was superb and Antonio was just a charming waiter.  Will always return to this hotel as its beautiful through out, cant do nothing but praise it.",5,2014,06,30
105,Best hotel,"A wonderful stay. Very nice and friendly staff. Had  lovely room got an upgrade in larger room, love  the location in a quiet street in the heart of London  closer to the great pubs, restaurants and the Tube. Will back again",5,2014,06,30
105,Afternoon Tea,"What a joy. A excellent afternoon tea served by a attentive staff. The hotel has two bee hives on the roof, yes in Central London, this is reflected in the cakes served and the pot of honey on the table. A excellent choice of teas. Worth the visit. ",5,2014,06,30
105,The game of Monopoly certainly had it right on the Mayfair hotels ...,"Not cheap, but rather cosy and well worth the experience.
When visiting London I like to try and reacquaint myself with the 'old town' and look for architectural character and some formalities in the restaurants and hotels I stay at.
Pound for pound, The Chesterfield keeps coming out on top for me.
The suite rooms have some lush, exotic themes, the piano bar gets vibrant some evenings and the roast of the day is always excellent in the restaurant.  I was also surprised and impressed with the extensive international wines cellared.
This Mayfair location is unbeatable and no guest will leave London disappointed, I am very confident of that.",4,2014,06,30
105,Fun time in the Capital,"We chose this hotel based on reviews here online. From the moment we arrived to the day we left we were made to feel like royalty. Beautiful suite, really quiet and a good size. The staff are so friendly, very unassuming but there always with a smile. We had a great weekend out and about visiting the museums, lazy picnic in Green Park even hopped on an open top bus and did a tourist trip. Breakfast was excellent. We didn't have dinner as ate out, but managed cocktails in the bar. Very expensive but hey it's London. Thank you all so very much. Will return for sure.",5,2014,06,25
105,Fabulous hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for a few nights.  The place is beautiful and well located in an upscale neighborhood.  The room was small as with most in Europe but at least there were places to put your luggage.  The room and bath were clean.  We had breakfast here a couple of times and the food is very good.  We also had a special dinner the first night we arrived and between the food and wait staff had a wonderful evening.  The staff is really what made this place special.  Tony at the front desk helped us get some theater tickets on very short notice and in the dining room Loris and William did an excellent job.
The only other recommendation is on the room location.  Our room was on the 4th floor and faced the courtyard.  It was busy in the evenings for most of our visit with cocktail functions and a wedding reception.  Needless to say, it was a bit noisy so if this is a concern for you, be sure to ask for a room with a different view.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,06,25
105,The BEST afternoon tea in London,"Various members of my family have enjoyed the WONDERFUL afternoon tea at the Chesterfield in Mayfair. Last month the whole family met to celebrate the forth coming wedding of our younger daughter. Wow!!!! Nothing in London could have compared. The staff were a delight from start to finish. The surroundings always make one feel so special. The food is so good you really have to experience it, all of it. Thank you to all the staff at the Chesterfield for making a special day unforgettable for the whole family.",5,2014,06,25
105,Another in a long list of great stays,"I have been coming London from Australia once or twice a year for the past 15 years or so. Until the most recent visit they have all been for business. The most recent was with my wife on holiday. The Chesterfield has consistently been the most wonderful place to stay. It close to everything and easy walking distance to the major shops and attractions. The rooms are extremely comfortable, well appointed and maintained. The staff are attentive and friendly. I was amazed when I arrived they knew who I was despite having booked using a different address and email. Great systems I suspect but it was a lovely touch. Can't wait to get back to London. It's a great city and I know where I will be staying.",5,2014,06,24
105,The best service.,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights in mid June. Everything about this hotel was excellent to say the least. The service was superlative. It was both professional and friendly. We've travelled a great deal, and have stayed at many nice places in our lives (we're 75). The service at The Chesterfield Mayfair was easily the best we've ever experienced. The staff made us feel as welcomed as we would have been if staying in the home of a gracious host. Don't be fooled by the unimposing exterior of this hotel. Once inside it is all five star quality.",5,2014,06,24
105,Our first visit to the Chesterfield will not be our last!,"Our family stayed at the Chesterfield on our first trip to London in May. We found it to be a charming hotel, well located, with a wonderfully accommodating staff. The concierge was very helpful arranging theater tickets and making dinner reservations. The bar is warm and inviting. The evening we went to the theater we arrived back at the Chesterfield not having eaten dinner and with most local restaurants closed. The staff in the bar was quick to prepare sandwiches for us! The rooms were comfortable as well. I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2014,06,22
105,Fantastic Stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"We had the good fortune to stay at this lovely hotel for 4 days in May. I cannot say enough about this great place! It is in a perfect location for sightseeing in London! The staff are amazing - very friendly and helpful! They really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable! I do agree with some of the other comments that the rooms are quite small, however the bed was amazing, and the bathroom is really well laid out! The restaurant was fabulous and we really looked forward to our breakfast each day! Hope to return to London again soon, and we will definitely stay at this wonderful place!",5,2014,06,19
105,A beautiful London Hotel,"We had the pleasure of spending 3 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel and what a 3 nights it was. From the moment we arrived (early 10am) we where made to feel so welcome, if fact like coming home. The staff where simply brilliant all over the Hotel. Nothing was ever an issue and they went out of their way to help and make you feel special. 
The hotel it's self is what you would expect an old English Hotel to be. Beautifully appointed with all the small details taken care of. Breakfast was outstanding and as was dinner. Loris would have to be one of the most attentive and lovely Maître'd we have meet. Would recommend this Hotel to anyone. Great location as well.",5,2014,06,15
105,Really nice hotel in the heart of Mayfair,We spent the last 3 nights of our 2 week trip at the Chesterfield Hotel - we really saved the best for last.  It is a beautiful hotel and the service was excellent - from housekeeping to the front desk.  Very comfortable bed.  We enjoyed making French press coffee in our room and having the delicious cookies as an afternoon snack.  Breakfast was also very good and plentiful. A very good choice.,5,2014,06,14
105,Great Experience at this Hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend. Great location, with easy access to transportation and walking distance to many sites and shopping. This operation is service oriented. We've stayed at many hotels but the service here was at the top. We ate dinner at the restaurant and the food was excellent. From the moment we walked in to the time we departed everyone was there to assist us without being overbearing. Great breakfast experience every morning also. The room was on the smaller side but clean and appropriately outfitted.  A very good value for the area. Would highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,06,14
105,Pure Indulgence,"I was invited by friends for afternoon tea in celebration of my birthday - a milestone! The experience was perfect, the food absolutely delicious and the staff friendly and attentive yet discreet. So relaxing and genteel was the atmosphere, we lingered for nearly three hours, topped up repeatedly with extra delicacies and a range of tasty teas.............pure delight.
I cannot praise the gentlemen who looked after us too highly, they made us feel very special. Thank you, we will be back!",5,2014,06,14
105,Perfect Choice for our London Visit,"Traveling with my 19 y/o daughter to London, we selected the Chesterfield Mayfair for our 8 night stay after extensive research.  Nestled on a beautiful residential street but right in the heart of Mayfair, we hoped for a true London experience and The Chesterfield Mayfair was spot on!   The lobby is beautiful and, upon arrival, the staff immediately welcomed us like family.  Our room, as anticipated, was smaller by U.S. standards, BUT very comfortable and beautifully appointed with excellent storage and individual temperature controls. 

The location of the hotel was so wonderful; nightlife is active in the area, restaurants abound and we could walk to myriad locations:  Buckingham Palace, Park Lane, Hyde Park, SOHO, Oxford and Regent Streets, Berkeley Square and the Green Park Tube stop is only 5 minutes away. While we are always aware of our surroundings, we felt very comfortable walking in the area.  But, if we preferred a taxi, we never had to wait as the Doorman quietly and consistently took care of us.

During our stay, I reached out to several departments including Housekeeping, Concierge and the Front Desk for different reasons and was consistently delighted by the immediacy and thoroughness of each encounter.  On several evenings, we stopped by the Terrace Bar after a busy day of sightseeing or a memorable dinner in town.  It was our favorite place to relax, have tea or a bit of dessert.  We completely fell in love with Bea Tollman's Honeycomb Ice Cream!

The staff are superb; the epitome of professionalism and kindness and they definitely made this a trip to remember.  We will definitely return to The Chesterfield Mayfair!",5,2014,06,13
105,Great location!,My 11-year old daughter and I spent 3 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The room with 2 twin beds was the perfect size (and price point) for us. We were able to walk to restaurants and to the Underground. The staff was helpful in making reservations for events and dinners.,5,2014,06,12
105,Afternoon Tea was Lovely !! Made it even Fantastic by the Staff !,I do not know why I picked this hotel but I did and I was sure glad. The hotel was very beautiful and welcoming. From the start to the lovely Mr. Waseem I believe must be from Reception on the phone to Restaurant Manager Loris who made our Afternoon Tea Great ! Even when we ran late they didn't mind and must not forget the Doorman such a nice young man with all his jokes. An experience that shouldn't be missed and I will definitely go back !,5,2014,06,11
105,Will return,"This hotel epitomises every thing I imagined of London. Excellent staff, service and location all friendly and welcoming, breakfast in a beautiful dining room and the evening meal ,compliments to the chef. High Tea in the most delightful surroundings was very pleasurable. My single room was small but very comfortable . As a traveller on my own the concierge and staff were very helpful I have no hesitation in recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair to anyone travelling and staying in London. Thank you for making my stay a memorial one.",5,2014,06,11
105,The best in London....,"3rd time there, and as good as ever...
Perfect location, perfect service, beautiful & comfortable bedrooms, amazing staff!
I went there with my 2 children for a 2 nights stay and we were so spoiled from start to finish, that my children didn't want to leave ;-)
Ask for the cupcake decoration course with the Chef, it's a must for kids! :-)",5,2014,06,10
105,SUPERIOR!!!,"My wife and I had a great week in this hotel. Everything was superlative, the team was very friendly and helpful. The hotel deserves to be classified in category 5 stars. 
The restaurant is fantastic, top food, perhaps deserved Michelin star. 
Breakfast is hearty, tea and lovely cakes and evening dinner were the story. 
The bar is relaxing live piano music. 
Thank you and for sure when we get back to London we will visit again.",5,2014,06,08
105,Outstanding Hotel,"This is a great hotel. Location is outstanding - walking distance to Harrods, Chinatown, and most major attractions. Service is second to none. Every request was handled immediately and with a smile. We have stayed at the Dorchester on previous visits but The Chesterfield Mayfair is our go to location in the future..",5,2014,06,06
105,Keep calm - stay at The Chesterfield in Mayfair,"After a long haul flight from Australia you just take a deep breath as you are welcomed into the wonderful charm of this brilliant hotel in the heart of London. The room was compact but but well appointed and we could open the windows. All the room amenities are first class and bed and pillows as we like them. The breakfast is sensational with the staff looking outstanding in their uniforms - like stepping back in time in a good way. I wanted to mention the head doorman was always helpful and gave us excellent advice, and all the staff matched this service level. In the heart of Mayfair means you are staying at a pretty good address so you will expect to pay a little more for accommodation but if the property fits your budget - book now. We look forward for an opportunity to leave the colony and visit The Chesterfield",5,2014,06,06
105,Fabuolous,"Top notch in every way. Little extra gem was the complimentary sherry in the lobby. My friend and I  loved our weekend shopping break and will definitely book here again. Afternoon tea is a must . All the staff were genuine , happy and extremely helpful .",5,2014,06,05
105,First Class Hospitality,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for the night as it was my 30th birthday and I planned on staying late (past the last train) in London to celebrate with family and friends.  From the moment I arrived, the service was second to none and I was made to feel very special.  As soon as I had checked in to my gorgeous room there was a knock on the door and a birthday card from the hotel staff arrived.  I got ready and went to have a drink in the hotel bar where Paul and Manos always look after you so well.  Later that evening when I returned from my party there was a Happy Birthday cupcake waiting for me on my bedside table.  
When i woke up the next morning I was in desperate need of breakfast and was not disappointed.  I had the salmon benedict which was delicious and just what I needed having been out for the evening.  The breakfast buffet also had all the usual choices, as well as some options that were very different such as the breakfast smoothie and fantastic cakes and breads.  All in all, I couldn't have asked for better service.
The Chesterfield really does treat you as an individual and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,06,05
105,A Jewel Box of a Hotel,"Having had the good fortune over many years of experiencing the hospitality of some of the premier hotels on a number of continents, I was not expecting to be ""blown away"" by the quality of The Chesterfield Mayfair. I anticipated I would be staying at a first-class Mayfair hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. There are quite a few of those, and I know some of them quite well. I could not have been more mistaken. The Chesterfield Mayfair struck me as unique from the moment I walked in the door. What I had found was a boutique jewel box of a hotel. I was greeted so warmly and effusively at the front desk by Madeline and her colleagues that it seemed they had been eagerly waiting all day for just my arrival. During the course of the next three days, I realized that the entire staff of the hotel was the epitome of professionalism, graciousness and quiet competence. This extends from the efficient doorman, through to the concierge and the excellent wait staff in the the bar and in Butler's, the superb restaurant on the premises. (Try the Sunday roast if you are there on the weekend. It is the quintessence of tradition and quality, served by the highly competent Antonio and his colleagues.) It is obvious that the management of The Chesterfield Mayfair expects nothing but the best from the staff, and the personnel deliver what is expected of them and what they have been so well trained to do. The bedroom/suite itself, like the rest of the hotel, was immaculate. It truly was a home away from home. And Mayfair, of course, is a most delightful part of London, one of the truly great cities of the world.

The Chesterfield Mayfair is a gem. I can't wait to return. I know I shall, like all guests, be welcomed as an old and valued friend.

105,Perfection!,"My husband surprised me on our first Wedding Anniversary with a romantic stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. From the moment we entered the staff were extremely friendly and made sure that our stay was exactly how my husband had planned. The room was ready early for us allowing us to leave our bags whilst having a shop around London. We went out to a show in the evening and to my delight when we returned to our room the bed was covered in rose petals, a rose and cakes both for our anniversary and my birthday and not forgetting the bottle of champagne!! We had a wonderful evening and wished we could have stayed longer! We hope to return soon (for afternoon tea as the cakes were stunning!) and I would very happily come back to celebrate every future Wedding Anniversary! Thank you again to all the staff!",5,2014,06,04
105,Best Small hotel in Mayfair,"Our stay at the Chesterfield in Mayfair was delightful.  The location is perfect to Bond Street, subway and buses on Picadilly and fabulous restaurants in the area.  The hotel is cozy and the staff is attentive.  Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys old world ambiance.  Well definitely book again next time.",5,2014,06,04
105,Consistently Marvelous,"I've had the pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair four times over the last three years and am so impressed each time.  This is an extremely well-run property in all aspects - a friendly and well-trained staff knows how it should be done.  It's as simple as that.

Bravo to all!",5,2014,06,03
105,More than home- loved every minute!,"My sister and I were in London for my 60th birthday! The Chesterfield was the perfect hotel for our stay of 9 days! We felt special from the minute we arrived until we left! We were greeted by our names in the morning for our delicious English breakfast ! We felt very special . If we had a question about anything from sightseeing to where to eat, excellent advice was given! The location was I am sure the best in London. If and when we go back to London, the Chesterfield Mayfair will be our home away from home.",5,2014,06,01
105,review of the hotel and staff,"my wife and i had the most elagent stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair in London. not only was the room great , the dinning room staff were so professional. We especially enjoyed being treated well by Biagio Sarubbi and Antonio. i would recommend staying in this warm hotel.",5,2014,05,31
105,Repeat weekend break,"The first time we spent a weekend break at The Chesterfield it was brilliant. Several weekend breaks later - all equally excellent - we have recently visited again and it just gets better! If you have never stayed at The Chesterfield then you are missing out on one of the best kept secrets in Mayfair. Everything about this hotel is geared up to ensure that you - the guest - feel as comfortable as you would in your own home, and that alone makes it special. If you want to experience excellent value in a top-notch hotel in a perfect location with an unsurpassed level of comfort, sincere friendliness and customer service then check in now!
The rooms are comfortable and well appointed and the staff are the best in the business. Butler's Restaurant, the bar and afternoon tea are a ""must"". So good, in fact, that I really do wonder why we ever needed to go outside at all!
 We are planning another weekend break soon - at Chesterfield of course - we enjoy staying there so much that we wouldn't stay anywhere else in Mayfair; and if it is fully booked, we'll wait until a vacancy occurs. Brilliant hotel!

105,A Royal Treasure,"This was my first trip  to London and I could not have found a more perfect hotel.  It is located in an ideal location, 5 minutes from the tube and the beautiful Mayfair neighborhood.  The hotel has the charm of an English hotel and the rooms were lovely.  The staff were amazing.  My daughter and I spent every morning reviewing our plans with the concierge who could not be more helpful. He became our personal assistant and our tour guide.  This staff was courteous professional and friendly. The hotel become our home away from home for the week.  We were able to get a package deal and it was well worth the price. We would definitely come back here.  A great buy a wonderful place.",5,2014,05,30
105,Great Stay,"A great stay.  Very nice staff, lovely room, got a nice upgrade and enjoyed the extra space - great size room for Europe.  Like the location - quiet street, but just blocks from great pubs, restaurants and the Tube.  Great home base for exploring London!",5,2014,05,29
105,Excellent service,"My family and I stayed here to celebrate our daugther. We had written about the occasion in advance, and upon arrival we were greated by the friendly staff. Such a warm and personal welcome. 
Our daugther was then told she had been given an room upgrade, from a single to a double, much to her delight. 
Throughout our stay the staff made us feel very much at home, and small personalized gifts were left for us in our rooms. 
The rooms were a bit small but very well appointed and kept very clean. 

The area is lovely with beautiful buildings, great shops and restaurants. 

We will definitely stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair again. 

Kind regards

105,First time in London,"Our first visit to London was enhanced dramatically by the warm welcome and charm of the entire hotel staff at the Chesterfield. Very helpful and friendly at all stations. Our restaurant experience was equally outstanding--very beautiful dining areas and great food. Our room was an upgraded suite with 2 washrooms and was roomy and pleasant with modern, clean facilities.
The location is simply the best with Hyde Park and Green Park as well as the Palace close by.
The concierge staff reconfirmed all activities and adjusted a few to our advantage with urgency and a smile. Simply no negatives to report--would recommend to all travelers. 
Thank you for a wonderful introduction to your great city.",5,2014,05,28
105,Extremely Pleasant People,"We only stayed one night and found the room to be comfortable and very clean.  Tea/coffee and water were complimentary in the room which is a nice touch.  Every member of staff we encountered was pleasant and welcoming and the hotel definitely lived up to it's ethos.  The only minus I would give it was the automatic edition of £1 for charity on the bill.  The sum is neither here nor there but this isn't a practice that I like.  I prefer to have a choice, otherwise a delightful stay.",5,2014,05,27
105,"So worth it,..","Stayed end May 2014. We'd planned a lovely meal with friends and didn't want it to end with a 1 1/2 hour trip home on public transport on Saturday night.

Fantastic hotel. The staff are very professional, genuinely welcoming and also down to earth. We had lunch and breakfast at the hotel, delighted with it. (could do better on the tea at breakfast :-) one tea bag only, and the water added was probably not boiling, far too weak -two bags please and made with freshly boiling water please. Twinnings strong breakfast tea is a good bet, or Sainsburys Red Label, or ASDA own brand, what is this whole 'breakfast tea' thing all about??)

This will be our first choice from here on when staying in London.",5,2014,05,25
105,"Perfect location, wonderful staff!","We had a great stay with our 2 year old. The staff are some of the best we have come across - very friendly, helpful and efficient.

The room was rather small especially with a cot but not a huge issue as we spent a lot of time in the nearby parks and exploring what London has to offer.

The location is exactly where we wanted it to be close to Green Park and St.James park, near the tube, close to some of our favourite restaurants and also very near shopping.

We also loved the small touches for our son - a little super soft robe and a frog for bath time, and chesterfield baby slippers! 

We would definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.

105,"Great Location, wonderful service, small room","The Chesterfield Mayfair was exactly where we wanted to be in London. Great spot to explore the beautiful parks, International restaurants and easy access to the Tubes. The staff was outstanding.
And, if you book months ahead, or find a hotel promotion, you will get good value in a very expensive neighborhood. We booked a superior king on their website. The room was too small for the bed. My wife and I had to choreograph our moves to get around. That was the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. 
On our first day, we arrived around midnight. The night manager greeted us warmly, the bar was open and delicious food was available.  Fabulous.",4,2014,05,20
105,Wonderful London hotel in the West End,"Just spent 5 nights at this wonderful boutique hotel in Mayfair area of the West End of London. I often spend time in Mayfair and have always wanted to try staying at the Chesterfield and this month I had the chance. 

Considering the quality of this hotel, the location in the middle of Mayfair and the very high expense of hotels in the West End (albeit all of London), this hotel is I believe a good value. It is not inexpensive but there are plenty of much more expensive hotels in London that are much more expensive and don't deliver the quality of the Chesterfield. 

The hotel is comfy small but not too small. The staff is really fantastic, friendly and attentive. The room was very nice, the housekeeping staff very professional, ultra clean room, not overly large (it is London after all) but extremely well appointed. Plenty of plugs for charging devices including a native US plug and and a great workspace if needed. And, a very modern and nice bathroom with a great shower (a key for Americans).

The location is also terrific, just off of Berkeley Sq., close to Shepherd's Market, Piccadilly St., Oxford St, the Green Park tube station and the center of Mayfair. But, not on main street so actually reasonably quiet street with several smaller pubs nearby.",5,2014,05,19
105,"Friendly, welcoming, great location","From the moment we stepped into the reception, even though we were a few hours early, we were welcomed by a smiling receptionist who immediately gave us the impression that we were to receive the very best of service and we did.  Our room was small but clean and fully equipped with washing utilities of the highest standards.  We would happily recommend this hotel for a central London location to anyone.  We did have a slight discrepancy with our bar bill but this was sorted out with the minimum of fuss.",5,2014,05,19
105,Beautiful English hotel with Amazing staff,"I've stayed at the Chesterfield hotel recently and I feel I have to say how great it was. The hotel is beautiful and so traditionally English located on a quiet street in the heart of Mayfair so perfect for going anywhere. I never took a taxi to go anywhere I had to go as I could just easily walk everywhere I needed to go in less than 15 minutes! Anyway what makes this hotel an experience of the real feeling of home away from home is the staff, from the doorman to the housekeeper everyone has a smile and a kind word , everyone is very chatty but always extremely professional and they know your name. The food in the restaurant is excellent and beautifully presented, but once again the best thing about the whole dinner experience was the lovely William who served us.
All in all it was a beautiful experience and I will definitely be returning soon! ",5,2014,05,18
105,A great hotel in a perfect location!,"I absolutely loved this hotel. Our room was not big but it was incredibly comfortable and the wonderful  service was something that seems to have disappeared from many hotels. Everyone was helpful an cheerful. The hotel has a lovely welcoming atmosphere. We will definitely be back. A fantastic nights sleep followed by a wonderful breakfast , highly recommend!",5,2014,05,18
105,Great Service,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for 9 days to explore London for my birthday.  From suggestions on dining to coffee to go on the way to the airport - the staff was always friendly and helpful.

The room was very comfortable with a view over the neighborhood. Comfy slippers and robes were available in the room to relax after a of exploring. Easy walking distance to shopping, pubs, the underground and buses made it a perfect home point for our adventures.

Certainly recommended as the place to stay.",5,2014,05,17
105,Outstanding hotel in an excellent location,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week. It is a wonderful hotel, located in Mayfair in Central London, relatively close to all the major attractions. It is located only a 10-minute walk from Hyde Park and less than a 10-minute walk from the Green Park Underground station. We were upgraded, on arrival, to a ""suite,"" which was a large, very quiet room (#422) with a king bed and two bathrooms and two closets. The room charge included a full English breakfast. The staff was very attentive and very helpful with suggestions for places to go and how to get there. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,05,17
105,A great choice in London,"We just returned from a nice stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. They are part of the Red Carnation group which has a well deserved reputation.  We usually stay at the highly rated Milestone, but loved this hotel as an alternative. The staff was was well trained, friendly and helpful. The location was safe and in an upscale neighborhood. It was a reasonable walk to the theater district and many nice places to eat. The hotel has comfortable common rooms, and good bar and restaurant services. The room service was superlative, and was a pleasure to stay there.",5,2014,05,16
105,Great service,"The room was huge and lovely, and everyone in the staff was very nice helpful, especially the Concierge. The location is also fantastic, just 10 mn walking from Piccadilly Circus.
Definitely a hotel I would recommend!",4,2014,05,16
105,A New Home In London,"When staying at an RCH property, I usually have high expectations- I am glad to say that they were all meet, and exceeded by this beautiful property in the heart of London nestled in a residential area a stone's throw away from all the hustle and bustle, giving you a true relaxing stay. 
    Weather it be the beauty of the property itself, the attentive nature of all the staff bar none or the beautiful, unique decor of the property, I found the establishment to be both excellent in terms of hardware and software, while remaining an outstanding value. It pleases me greatly to say that I shall be back, and I have found myself a new home in London.",5,2014,05,14
105,Kindness of the staff!,"Everyone on the staff at the hotel was extremely kind, caring and helpful to all our needs and wants.  They went out of their way to help us with anything and everything we asked for asap!
We also liked the non fog mirror in the bathroom after a shower or bath!  Plus the heated floors in the bathroom were absolutely wonderful.

Enjoyed afternoon tea there and it was delicious!  They have gluten free for afternoon tea as well for anyone with celiac or cannot tolerate gluten.  The desserts are just to die for!

The area is close to pubs with delicious foods and drinks as well.  Looking forward to our next visit at The Chesterfield Mayfair!",5,2014,05,12
105,Thumbs Up,"Recently my boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend and now wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in London! Cracking hotel - rooms really nice decor etc, staff were really friendly and so helpful; restaurant very chic with a great, laid-back vibe going on.  and is also within easy walking distance of some great bars and restaurants, as well as exciting boutique / vintage shopping opportunities. I Can't wait to go again!",5,2014,05,10
105,Amazing Hotel,"Second time we have stayed at this lovely hotel, and we were as impressed this time as last. We had a beautiful room, extremely comfortable and all the staff were so friendly and helpful. We had breakfast in the hotel, which was the best breakfast we have tasted and enjoyed dinner in the Butlers Restaurant, which again was delicious.  Would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone who is visiting London.",5,2014,05,10
105,Second home,"Recently returned from yet another wonderful stay in my second home from home. 
I cannot say enough about this wonderful hotel and perfect staff who just seem to know what I want before I know myself! 
The restaurant team look after me so well, particularly when I am dining alone on occasion and the food is simply Devine! The bar staff are equally attentive and a credit to Paul the bar manager. The rooms are  beautifully managed by all concerned and last but not least the concierge and reception staff are always welcoming. Have I missed anyone? See you all very soon.",5,2014,05,09
105,London Gem,"During my recent 10 night visit in the U. K. I stayed at 3 lovely hotels.  My last 4 nights in London were at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Beautiful hotel and spacious room.  As in other European hotels ac/heat cannot be made cooler than 19 Celsius, but I could open the window.  Good, thick towels and good, free wifi.  Perfect location.  Chris the concierge went out of his way to be helpful.  Small, free bucket of ice delivered quickly each afternoon when I called.  I would love to return to the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2014,05,08
105,the name said it all,"staff right down to the doorman was fantastic, food out of this world, everything just walking distance away, a must if in London, one o the best ever experience in a hotel I have ever had, world wide traveller",5,2014,05,08
105,Chesterfield Great London Hotel,"I stayed at the Chesterfield during the month of May 2014.  I have stayed in all three Mayfair properties in the same area and was very pleased with the Chesterfield.  It is an easy walk to Piccadilly, Green Park and other notable sites.  The area around the Chesterfield has a number of cozy pubs and restaurants. Particularly in  Shepherds Market just around the corner.
The Hotel is in the Boutique Category with quaint location and amenities .  The staff was excellent from doorman/front desk to the head bartender.  It has an excellent bar with very comfortable seating and a great piano player.  One of my favorite features was a very large well appointed library area for reading, coffee or a glass of wine.  The rooms are small in the European tradition but comfortable.",5,2014,05,07
105,Perfection in Mayfair,"The Chesterfield is a superb hotel in Mayfair, intimate, friendly, quiet and extraordinarily well-staffed and managed.  Well-located just off Berkeley Square, it offers understated British elegance.  Afternoon tea is a fine experience.",5,2014,05,03
105,Perfection,My family an I spend four wonderful days in this hotel pearl with the finest location. We were totally pampered by the very nice staff and had a terrific breakfast every morning. We will cetainly return.,5,2014,05,03
105,A spectacular hotel!,"Three friends and I stayed at the Chesterfield, based upon my recommendations, as I had been a guest there several times.  Naturally, the staff were on target as being a group of professionals, who possess exquisite charm!  We would not even consider another hotel.  The room cleanliness, warm decorations, feel of privacy and exclusivity simply add tp the overall charm of this site.  The location is perfect in order to shop, catch the underground;/bus/taxi, and nothing is a large task for the staff.  Every dining reservation was handled superbly - the hotel bar was the most intimate bar I have ever visited for relaxation,  Food, including breakfast and lunch superb!  I look forward to going to London, first and foremost, to stay at the Chesterfield and once again shake hands with the team!!!  A winner by all standards!!!!",5,2014,05,03
105,The Best in London,"We have stayed in many hotels in London over the years including several of the ultra-lux properties (Dorchester, Connaught, Park Lane).  The Chesterfield has consistently provided us with the best experience in London.  The staff's attitude and the overall level of service is beyond even what you might expect in a much more expensive property.  This is not only the best value for your money but also is outright the top service hotel you can find.  Also a great location.  Go for the junior suites - charming and very spacious rooms.",5,2014,05,02
105,Amazing,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel....by far one of the best experiences we've had at a hotel. The staff was great, our room was beautiful, location was perfect and the service provided was above and beyond expectation. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the doorman Michael who was amazing. He was immediately ready to help us plan our four day visit by mapping sights out on a map for us. Next we experienced Englebert who was equally wonderful and never tired from our constant questions and genuinely wanted to help. I have to mention Abigail who greeted us every morning with a smile as we entered the restaurant for the breakfast buffet. She made us feel very welcomed as she asked us our plans for the day.
The hotel is close to many of the cities attractions but is located on a beautiful quiet street. Our room was decorated in proper English style and was very spacious. Such service and surroundings made it hard to leave, but will definitely stay there again when in London.",5,2014,04,28
105,A great hotel with great dining and staff,"Live in NYC where most hotels are top shelf.  The Chesterfield Mayfair holds that standard.  I do not like comparisons and this hotel is the best. Staff is so accommodating and helpful.  Bed was THE most comfortable in my 64 years of life.  The staff is so knowledgeable.  
I will go back next year, yes it is that good.  The staff always works the hardest to make sure any problem is addressed and fixed. Definitely recommend this hotel for anyone.  I give special thanks and commendation to Hani, Edmund, Damien and in the delicious Butler restaurant William, and Biagio.  You gentleman, all, are a credit to your company.  Bravo!",5,2014,04,26
105,Mayfair Gem,"We stayed at the Chesterfield in mid-April 2014 and we'd recommend it.  It's a pretty building (a series of joined-together town houses) on a very attractive and quiet side street in Mayfair (one block off Berkeley Square) and is well situated for walking to a lot of places one might want to go. The Tube also is nearby.  Its public rooms are very attractive, including its pleasant bar, which stays open late and serves food (overpriced, but this is London). The dining room has a pre-theater fixed-price dinner that is a pretty good deal -- generous helping of food that is not gourmet but just fine. Very generous breakfast that can be buffet or served; your choice.  Our room was small (again, this is London) but had all the amenities one could ask for and was very attractively furnished.  The rooms appear to be different, not cookie-cutter.  But the most attractive feature was the universally pleasant and helpful staff -- they really do a good job in that area.  We will go back.",5,2014,04,24
105,This hotel is well on radar!,"Simply excellent.  The best London hotel we've stayed in.  Staff welcoming and helpful, room lovely, the style of the hotel is quintessentially English and finished to a very high standard.  Best cosmopolitans we've tasted in a long time, compliments to the waitor who made them!",5,2014,04,23
105,"Second visit, just as good","This was our second visit in December and it was once again very good and enjoyable. Service was good and very clean and tidy. Parts are looking a little dated perhaps but so far this hasn't detracted from our stays. Breakfast appeared a lot more efficient than our stay the previous December and we didn't have any problems.

The hotel is perfectly situated for the main tourist and shopping areas and only a few minutes walk from Green Park tube station if you don't wish to walk to Oxford street.",5,2014,04,21
105,Amazing,"I was not only welcomed as a guest but also as part of the Chesterfield family! 

A fresh birthday cupcake was left daily in my room ! And I was overwhelmed by the signed Birthday Card from the staff!

Last but not least while on my way to the airpor the hotel called the taxi driver to check whether I was dropped on time!

Amazing stay ! Thank you !",5,2014,04,19
105,Convenient hotel,"Friendly, welcoming staff, especially Letitia on reception and Carolina at breakfast. Lovely surprise of champagne and cup cakes as we were visiting on our anniversary. Really convenient for West End. Nice room (Garden Room, 528), although the walls were a bit thin. Excellent breakfast!",3,2014,04,15
105,Heaven,"I stayed here during the London marathon . I couldn't rate the service high enough !! Breakfasts to die for and most comfortable and relaxed surroundings , best hotel stay ever ....highly highly recommended ",5,2014,04,14
105,Outstanding service,"Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Provided us with every assistance over our weekend stay for the London Marathon. Hotel is well located in Mayfair next to Shepherds market and perfect for a weekend. Given the great service, I will also use the hotel when I'm in London for business.",5,2014,04,13
105,Exemplary ,"A hotel where service comes first and foremost. Great staff. Surprisingly good restaurant with fantastic service (prices are high, but not undeservedly so). Lovely intimate bar with attentive service. Our room was small but very well appointed. Great location in the heart of Mayfair. Recommended.",5,2014,04,13
105,What an amazing place,"We have just recently stayed at the chesterfield mayfair on our anniversary, and what an amazing stay it was. The hotel and the staff are fantastic, the hotel is lovely, the staff are amazing with all the little touches made our stay so much more pleasurable. It was great to see london, as it was my wife's first visit. We will certainly be back. Once again thank you so much.",5,2014,04,10
105,No fridge :(,"We chose an Executive room for a midweek business stay. The hotel is in a nice, fairly quiet location just a short walk from Green Park Tube. It was fun to visit the restaurants in Shepherd's Market in the evening - some good tips from the concierge. The room was in need of a refurb, however: stains on the carpet, the fur bedcover was matted and there was no fridge. Disappointing given the price of the room.",3,2014,04,10
105,Luxury and comfort in a quiet oasis of London,"This is the 3rd time I've been lucky enough to stay at this fabulous hotel. The difference this time was that I was staying on my own, because of this I booked a single room. From check in onwards you will not meet more pleasant staff. The staff are all fantastic, so friendly, without being OTT, they are really genuine when they talk to you, they all take the time to stop and talk to you, a real personal touch which does not go un noticed. I checked in and was shown to my room which is on the small side but what it lacked in space it sure made up for it in comfort, The bed, bedding, bathroom and toiletries are sheer luxury. The phone call from reception to ensure you are happy with your room is a little tip the big hotels in London should pick up!  I ordered room service which was prompt, had a good choice and most important delicious! I had the best nights sleep its such a quiet area and went down for breakfast. The lady that showed me to my table was so pleasant and friendly, the breakfast is good too! Great choice and cooked to order. As I left the housekeeper was doing her rounds and spent a good 5 minutes chatting to me. It seems that the staff really enjoy working there and it shows with how pleasant they are. Luclkily we are back in London in a few weeks and am please to say cant wait to return as I did miss their fab afternoon tea this time! I booked via the hotel as my husband has MS and a walk in shower does make life easier for us. The manager was very helpful with this, answering emails promptly and efficiently. Cant wait to return!",5,2014,04,07
105,Still Wonderful,"This was our third visit to this excellent Mayfair hotel and it is still a favorite place to stay. The staff is friendly and accommodating, the classic rooms still small but well appointed, tasteful and in excellent condition. The location just off Berkley Square is central yet just far enough away to be isolated from the hubbub. As a boutique hotel it is a quiet oasis not the chaos of larger facilities. We took advantage of the free access to a neighborhood fitness facility and other than having to enter through the loading dock it met our needs. When we return to London this will be our first lodging choice.",5,2014,04,06
105,Predictable in its excellence,"We have enjoyed another wonderful stay at The Chesterfield after trying other good London hotels recently. We always feel as though we are returning home when we choose this hotel and love the location and security of knowing the standard is always excellent. A special thanks to Paul, the bar manager, for once again introducing us to some new cocktails and keeping us entertained in the bar at night. Thanks to Oliver too,  we appreciated his generosity regarding this stay.",5,2014,04,06
105,"I have not stayed yet, but had an amazing experience, and booked","Mayfair is the best neighborhood in London. Quiet. Close to the parks and not too close to the madness/crowds on Oxford street and the West End. I stayed at the Millennium, but was disappointed so I walked the neighborhood looking for ""Plan B"" for my visit in 2-3 weeks. At the Chesterfield, I was greeted by a lovely guy at the entrance who gave me a tour and asked if I'd like to stay for coffee. I visited 4-5 other hotels. But was I was so impressed with that original exchange, I went back for dinner that night. Manos, the Cypress born, incredibly cool bartender took such good care of me, I immediately booked a room for my next visit. It's more than I usually pay for business trips or vacations. But these people really cared about my experience (and I wasn't staying at the hotel!) Everyone I encountered, projected an endearing, professional English Hospitality style that you rarely see unless you're traveling with the some Ambassador. How will I ever go back to London, and not stay at the Chesterfield?",5,2014,04,03
105,Old world styling with a modern twist,"recently stayed 2 nights in this centrally looted hotel.  Beautiful decor great you in the entrance as dose the welcoming staff.  Room not quite ready upon arrival but we were offered a complimentary drink in the lovely library.  Our dog Jamie was also welcome in this room.  Sometimes hotel say they  are dog friendly and then when you ask to go anywhere but you room this is not the case. Not so here.   Our room was suitable for someone with mobility problems.  The only draw back was the room was very compact and you could not navigate around the room in you chair.  I am lucky and able to walk around in such a setting but if you are wheelchair bound this could be problematic.  Bed was a double, again a larger bed is alway appreciated.  Well appointed in its services, good hospitality tray with the option of fresh milk via room service.  The usual sewing kit, shoe shine,and stationary with extras as well.  The bathroom  was a ride in style with ample room and everything was at hand height even the bin.  The only thing missing from the bath room was a seat in the shower, a must for those who can not stand.. This can be a flip down one on the wall or a free standing one.  But something they definitely need to address.  Lots of lovely fluffy towels and robes and slippers as well.  Breakfast was available in your room if required and delivered by very friendly cheery staff.  But it is a tight space for a disable person in a wheelchair doing this.  Perhaps if a slightly larger room could be converted as a mobility impaired room.   Always happy to advise.  Now back to the dog.  A bed and two large bowls were waiting in the room with a back or treats for our Jamie.  A wonderful sign to hang on the door to alert staff that a dog was in the room was available.  On this I used a post it note, available in the room, to put that this was Jamie and he was friendly as well.  Part of our package was a free bottle of Champagne, lovely touch with a the trade mark of the hotel a carnation.  Also an afternoon tea was also included which we took on the Saturday.  We were seated in the conservatory which was flooded with light.  Many people celebrating birthdays or just like us enjoying a good English tradition.  A lovely choice of sandwiches, pastries and scones.  The tea choices were also good.  All these items could be replenished if you requested them at no extra charge.  Indeed if you could not eat everything it was place in a carry out box with a carnation for you to take home.  We added a glass of Champagne to add to the occasion. If you are intending on a vista to this hotel check out the reasonable deals on offer.  Our offer even allowed you check out at 6.00pm on the Sunday, what a bonus.  On our experience we will definitely use the Chesterfield again and urge others to do the same.",5,2014,04,02
105,Could not fault the service,"My partner and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair as part of my 30th birthday celebrations in London. We could not fault any part of the experience from start to finish. As you would expect from such a location, the room price is far from cheap but the experience that we encountered whilst in residence was more than worth it.

I can imagine that in such hotels as these it is easy for the staff and managemnet to have a pompous and stuffy air about them. Happily this was not the case at the Chesterfield; far from it in fact. The staff were friendly, chatty and welcoming and, whilst we didn't have many requirments during our stay, they gave the impression of always being on hand if required. The staff at the front desk were particularly helpful upon our leaving when we had left a charger in the room and it was a race against time to get to Kings Cross in time! Many thanks for that.

The room we had was clean, fresh and tastefully decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable, there was plenty of wardrobe space and the bathroom had obviously been furnished to a high standard. The view from the window was nothing to write home about but you can't have everything I suppose.

We only ate breakfast in the hotel as we had already organised other dining arrangements for dinner. However, we were never dissapointed. A large selection of pastries, cereals and juices were available self service along with some lovely ham and cheeses. There was also a wide variety of selections from the a la carte breakfast; of which we chose the eggs benedict and the smoked haddock with poached egg and bubble & squeak. All were cooked well with maybe only the bubble and squeak needing a touch more seasoning. The staff in the dining room were again superb.

If we were to ever stay in the Mayfair area of London again (which is a distinct possibility), we would definitely consider staying at the Chesterfield again.",5,2014,04,01
105,Very pleasant experience,"Just spent one night at the Chesterfield while conducting some business in London.  Never stayed here before but a contact recommended it and was staying here at the same time. Great experience, very nice and clean room.  The best part was how kind and accommodating the staff acted during my stay. From the doorman to the bartender every interaction was great. Could not recommend this hotel more and will definitely stay there during my next trip.",5,2014,03,30
105,"""Wonderful visit! Charming hotel and welcoming staff!""","This was a first trip to London to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. Everyone was very welcoming when we arrived and very helpful in arranging transportation, referring great restaurants and sites to see (Darren was wonderful in assisting us). On our first day back to our room, there were cupcakes, fruit and cards on the table, wishing us a happy anniversary. The card had handwritten congrats from numerous staff members, which I thought was incredible. I would highly recommend the Chesterfield and would stay there again if we have another trip to London!",5,2014,03,26
105,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff","Stayed for my girlfriends birthday after seeing the ballet.
The room was stunning, breakfast, gluttonously delicious, the bed perfectly soft and the shower steaming hot.
We were really impressed with how genuinely welcoming and happy to help us out every member of staff we met were and this really made the stay special.",5,2014,03,24
105,Affable in Mayfair,"Stayed here recently on a birthday visit with my girlfriend. Great location for west end and restaurants around the Mayfair area. Excellent price too. However, even though set in Mayfair and contrary to other 'branded' hotels, all of the staff were extremely polite and friendly. 
Dare I say quite unexpected for Maryfair, especially being a typical work class chap. Would definitely recommend a stay.",5,2014,03,23
105,A beautiful hotel in a lovely quiet area,"We stopped here for my boyfriend's Birthday and were not disappointed. The room was beautiful and the reception was warm and welcoming. They know it was my Boyfriend's birthday and delivered a cake to the room which I thought was a lovely touch. The room was well equipped with complimentary water and lots of toiletries and bathrobes/slippers and safe, as well as tea,coffee,hot chocolate and biscuits.
We had breakfast included and this was also delicious.
The hotel was a 5 minute walk to Green Park Underground and only 10 minutes to Piccadilly. There is a lovely little park down the road as well as numerous cafes and shops.
I would not hesitate to stop here again!",5,2014,03,23
105,My London Home,"I have been staying at the Chesterfield since I was 8 years old.  As a family we stay at the hotel at least 3 times a year.  Although many of the staff have changed over the years, everyone always makes us feel very welcomed and at home.  The location of this hotel is excellent.  We use the hotel as a base for our shopping trips as you can easily walk to Oxford Street or Bond Street.  Nothing is ever too much trouble for them and they often go the extra mile for example preparing our favourite drinks and reserving special spots in the bar!! Last summer the website said that the hotel was completely full and we were very disappointed not to be able to stay there for my birthday, however when we called, they managed to arrange 2 rooms for us to stay in.  The food is great but the restaurant can be a bit quiet.  We like this as a family though, as we feel we get special treatment.  Afternoon tea is a must, but I know that the weekends are not becoming fully booked.  Most of the rooms have been refurbished recently, which is nice.  I would describe this hotel as a typical taste of England!",5,2014,03,23
105,Great hotel in Mayfair,We had a very nice four night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Staff was extremely pleasant and service oriented. Room was small but clean and quiet. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful every morning. Location excellent for touring London. ,5,2014,03,19
105,March sunshine,"My fiancé and I stayed here for the weekend as a birthday treat. Last year we stayed at The Montague on the Gardens and loved the red carnation hotel so much we thought we'd try The Chesterfield Mayfair this time. The location is excellent, a 5 min walk from Green Park tube station and 20 mins walk to Leicester Square. The staff are very friendly, welcoming and efficient. We especially liked the doorman who was always cheerful. The hotel is immaculate and our room was excellent.

We stayed as part of the Mayfair weekend package and arrived to a bottle of champagne in our room which we didn't drink until the following day but were able to take into the Terrace Bar to enjoy in the afternoon. 

We also had afternoon tea, a lovely experience which we unfortunately had to rush due to us having to catch our train home. I would personally allow 1 1/2 to 2 hours to properly enjoy this and also book in advance as it is a very popular treat. 

One tiny suggestion is that the key cards need adjusting to allow for late checkout of 6pm on the weekend package. Both this time and at the Montague we couldn't access our room as the card had automatically expired at the normal checkout time. 

We had a great time and would love to try all the red carnation hotels as they've discovered the secret to fabulous customer service.

We we're also blessed with the most fantastic warm, sunny weather.",5,2014,03,17
105,ticks all the boxes-wonderful stay!,"We booked The Mayfair through londontown.com as they offered a nicer location and a better price ,for the same category of hotel,than what we had initially booked .otherthan that, we had no idea about the hotel.we were not disappointed
the hotel is located in the posh neighbourhood of Mayfair.we stayed here for 7 nights in last week of june2013,with our twin girls.As soon as you enter,the  aroma of fresh lilies wafts to you ...very refreshing,especially,since i am partial to lilies.
the decor of the hotel is very trendy,modern and glam.it gives you a 'good buzz', with its very hip atmosphere that pervades the hotel all the way to the guestrooms,the hotel caters to wide  a range of different visitors.
its a good chance you could run into a celebrity or model in the lobby.
you pay dearly to stay in this hotel,but its location is so good,that it is well worth it.
It is just round the corner from green park tube station.and you are within walking distance to Buckingham palace,trafalgar square,piccadilly,west end,shopping and the finest of Mayfair's restaurants.Nobu is right across from the hotel and the beloved Fortnum and mason is just a stone's throw away.
there is even a grocery store across the street to buy sodas,wine or tidbits from and no shortage of taxis...what more can you ask for!
we had arrived early in the morning from cote da'zure,so our rooms were not ready.But the check in was quick and effortless.
we had opted for a family room.it was very spacious and modern  with 2 queen size beds,which were very comfortable .the bathroom was modern,very clean,had separate shower and bath areas with open closet and dressing area.
Both the room and bathroom were very spacious by London measures.two nitpicks-no plugs close to the mirror and i had to flat iron my hair sitting on the floor!second,the bathtub had no hand held shower,which means that you had to get out of the tub if you wanted to shampoo your hair.not ideal for a $600 rm/nt!
other than that,the hotel ticked all the boxes for us.
we had a breakfast inclusive rate and  the breakfasts were superb with lots of choices and of very high quality,with good selection of British and and continental options(and had the best choices anywhere for anyone who is health conscious).the staff in the breakfast room was very friendly,especially fussed over my daughters.
this is another highlight of Mayfair-their excellent level of service from the doormen to the concierge-ever attentive,courteous and warm.,be it from procuring an umbrella or calling a taxi.even the hosekeeping was very good and discreet.
The concierge,Antonio,i think, was very helpful in obtaining theater tickets for us and also gave us suberb suggestions on  dining places...
there is a nice cigar lounge and the bar would be buzzing in the evenings and seemed popular,but we could not sample it.it also got little noisy/lively-depending on how you take it,on weekends due to the presence of clubs   nearby.but the windows are double glazed,so you wont hear any of it,unless you opened them.
Overall,a high level of service and wonderful location made for a perfect stay.we will definitely stay at Mayfair again.",5,2014,03,11
105,Fantastic,"Loved every minute of our 2 night stay just before Christmas 2013. Great service, rooms were clean and comfortable and nothing was too much trouble for them, definitely recommend this hotel. We will definitely return.",5,2014,03,06
105,Excellent Hotel with first class service,"This was our second stay at this beautiful hotel and we hope to have many more stays. We stayed three nights in January. The staff are really helpful & friendly. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They even went out to post my son's birthday card . The breakfast is a real treat and sets you up for the day. The location is good and is only a 10 minute walk from Green Park Tube station and close to good restaurants. 
If you want to stay in a high class hotel and feel pampered by good service & surroundings then my wife and I would strongly recommend the Chesterfield in Mayfair.",5,2014,03,04
105,Excellent Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night on a recommendation from a friend. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely use this hotel the next time we go to London for the weekend. The main reason we liked the hotel so much was the staff, particularly Sarah. We received a very warm and friendly greeting on arrival creating a really nice atmosphere which continued through out the whole of our stay.",5,2014,03,03
105,Great location and top notch service!,"A group of coworkers (along with several spouses/partners) were in London for a few days for a work event.  Our corporate events folks wound up booking us in the Novotel London West which turned out to be an absolute dump (see my one-star review there, spoiler: don't ever stay there!) so we were seeking different accommodations.  While out exploring the city we happened across The Chesterfield Mayfair.  My partner and mom and I stopped in to inquire about rates and availability.  No sooner were the words out of my mouth than a charming young gentleman was called to show us the various rooms that were available.  Up and down the hotel we did go popping into the different categories of rooms.  I've never seen anything like that, it was great!  Saying thank you, the front office manager (Sarah Walsh) gave me her card and invited us to call if we chose to stay there.  After talking with my coworkers we decided to go for it so I called back to book the rooms.  A little bit of back and forth over phone and email and we were all set.  The staff at the Chesterfield could not have been more accommodating or helpful.  They offered us a discounted rate since we were booking a block of rooms, and they definitely had a very personal touch on the whole transaction.  

The location of the hotel is great.  It's a few minute walk to the Green Park tube station and taxis are plentiful in the area.  Most of us walked everywhere very easily (although we all do a lot of walking when we visit cities).  The rooms are on the small side, but each is uniquely decorated and generally very charming.  There was a moment that I thought about giving this review a 4-star rating, only because some of the trimmings and decorations in the rooms are showing some age, but based on the service and location I went with 5-star since that outweighs any nominal negative in the rooms.  Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was good but not particularly memorable.  The one memorable thing about it was that you could either have it downstairs in the restaurant or they would bring it to your room for no additional charge.  Most of us chose to eat in our rooms which was nice, although on at least one of the days our order was a little mixed up or missed a couple items.  We're not big breakfast people so it really wasn't a big deal and we didn't even say anything to the hotel (I have zero doubt that they would have corrected things quickly).  

All in all it was a saving grace from the hell that was the Novotel, and a wonderful few days spent in central london (or at least a centrally located place with regard to attractions we were interested in).",5,2014,03,02
105,Attention to detail,"We stayed here for four nights for my birthday treat in January and could not have enjoyed it more.   It carries modern efficiency alongside traditional charm, grace and style.  The location is perfectly central while managing to be characterful, beautiful and quiet.   The staff are professional and at the same time friendly and personal.    In a hotel bustling with energy and business everyone has time for you.   Our room was comfortable and immaculate, with attention to every detail.   The bar and restaurant are lovely rooms, with atmosphere which makes you want to stay longer.   Unpretentious luxury.   Don't hesitate - go there.",5,2014,03,02
105,Perfect  in every way!,"The location is key , Green Park tube  stop is only a 10 min walk and Starbucks is on the way !
The staff are great and the food service in the morning for the all inclusive breakfast was superb.
So many fabulous restaurants close by The Chesterfield which  is positioned in a absolutely fabulous area for your post  day outing!
Try the bar in the evening , warm friendly and a wonderful place to chat with other travellers.
The Chesterfield Mayfair ..has been  my choice for the last 2 years as a business traveller from Canada  and I see no reason to change !.",4,2014,03,01
105,Absolutely amazing hotel,"I travel often for work and Ive never stayed in a hotel that is anywhere close to this one. Its absolutely spectacular. The service is impeccable, the food is great, they go above and beyond. Every part of the hotel is just beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous, but not too big. Great attention to the tiniest details. Would highly highly recommend it.",5,2014,02,28
105,Best stay ever!,"I normally don't do feedbacks to hotel unless is a complaint! However, I must let the world know how amazing The Chesterfield in London is. I stayed over for two nights along with my future wife. We married on the weekend we stay there. All stuff was kind, respectful, professional and always pending to assists their guests at all time regarding anything guests might need.
Concierge service was outstanding by always answering enquiries with the right answers.
Their management team regarding the booking of rooms was very helpful by providing us a viewing of the rooms before we booked. They have done such an amazing job.
I must recommend this hotel to anyone who planning to busy London. It is essential to know that the Hotel's location is in the heart of London, Mayfair.
Once again, thank you very much to all staff from the Chesterfield Hotel my wife and I really appreciated all you done for us.",5,2014,02,27
105,Wonderful location and fantastic service,"I spent 4 nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair and was so impressed with the wonderful personal service i received from the hotel staff. They had great attentionto detail and made my stay a very happy one indeed. The location is great. I ran every morning and the hotel is very close to some of the well known parks, such as Hyde Park and Green Park. There are really cute restaurants and coffee shops in the area and it is just a few 100m from Greenpark Station. All in all, a pleasurable stay made memorable by the fantastic hotel staff.",5,2014,02,25
105,Birthday Weekend,"Word of mouth, from a friend, encouraged me to choose the Chesterfield in Mayfair for my weekend retreat.  This decision proved to be a wise one.  The staff made my birthday extra special from the moment I arrived...they truly live up to Mrs. Tollman's ethos: thoughtful details, generous hospitality and passionate service to name a few.  The staff surpassed me with a birthday card, flowers and cupcake in my room after a long day of traversing London.  I will definitely book again at one of the many the Red Carnation Hotel.",5,2014,02,23
105,Malcolm,"SUPERB STAY

On arrival was greeted by friendly staff and the decor of the hotel was in excellent oder throughout
The room was light and airy the food and service in the Restarant was first class and we will be staying there again have to say nothing was to much for the friendly and helpful staff",5,2014,02,20
105,Family reunion,"A Christmas present saw myself and my daughters in the Chesterfield in Mayfair and the Hotel proved to be the highlight of the trip. A warm  welcome on arrival set the tone and there was the added surprise of a beautiful room.  The location is superb and we were able to explore the sights of London on foot in beautiful spring weather.  We had booked a nice restaurant for lunch but decided to abandon after a superb breakfast sorted out our appetites for the day. However, we did have room for an evening cocktail and the Chesterfield bar proved difficult to leave. thanks all at the Chesterfield.",5,2014,02,18
105,Home fro home,"I spent a week in the hotel whilst on business in London.   This was a return stay, having done so on the same trip last year.   So receiving a handwritten personal note from the GM welcoming me back certainly got the stay off to the perfect start.  And as so many have said on this website the staff are friendly, helpful and courteous - no wonder given the example set by the GM.

The old world charm of the hotel appeals to me, and the free wi-fi (at speeds we only dream of in South Africa!) made the business aspect so much more functional.   Being close to Green Park station was extremely handy, and allowed easy travel to my various business meetings.  Getting back to the hotel each evening my colleagues and I were quick to freshen up and get down to the bar area - lively, comfortable and a ready welcome back from James, Manos and Edgar.

The room allocated me was very quiet, thankfully, and allowed for comfortable work space, and the tea/coffee tray so much better than the average offering.  The breakfasts were excellent, the bed really comfortable and the room cleaning staff kept the room in impeccable form for the week.   Certainly one of the very best hotels in which I have stayed, and when next in London I will certainly return.",5,2014,02,18
105,Fabulous comfort and service,"My husband booked the Chesterfield as part of a surprise weekend away in London for my 40th birthday. I was immediately impressed by the location and the Reception lobby which was very grand old London! The room itself was very comfortable; the bed divine. Everything was spotless and again the decor was in keeping with what you would expect of a fine London hotel. I loved the bathroom, especially the very powerful shower and we slept very well as it was extremely quiet at all times even though our room looked over the front street. 
Breakfast was lovely with the usual buffet items and an extensive cook to order menu. It was lovely to be greeted by name by the breakfast staff and this was typical of the personal service at this hotel. Every care is taken to make you feel welcome and cared for. 
My husband had booked champagne afternoon tea which was fabulous. From the enthusiasm of the restaurant manager serving us, the piano player in the background, to the food itself and extensive tea 
list (we had chocolate tea which is brewed specially for the hotel and was delicious!) it was indeed a special treat which we both thoroughly enjoyed! We had this in the library which was lovely and cosy but the restaurant and conservatory are equally as nice and we noticed the lovely courtyard at the back which would be a nice area to enjoy a drink in the summer. 
Overall, we loved this hotel and didn't want to leave. I hope my husband surprises me again one day and takes me back to the Chesterfield. ",5,2014,02,14
105,Always the best,"I have been staying at The Chesterfield for many years now for both pleasure and business and it never fails to please. It's comfortable, stylish, like a home from home and the staff top it all off with fantastic, friendly service. I hope to return for many years to come",5,2014,02,14
105,Magical Mayfair,"Ok. This review is a tad late in posting but please don't let that deter you from experiencing this Hotel!

Located in Mayfair, just around the corner from Berkeley Square - indeed Charles Street was once part of the lawns of the old Berkeley House - is a very swish part of London. The History of the Street is very interesting and quite long so please go directly to Hotel website and read it there!

The Chesterfield is part of the Red Carnation Group, and this was my first taste. In all honesty, this Hotel had not been the first choice as I was traveling with a 19 year old and thought perhaps the area would be too ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" for him to be comfortable. Wrong. He was totally captivated by the ""Look"" of Charles Street and the architecture of it's buildings. Sadly, most have become offices of some sort and the one directly opposite the Chesterfield, on its first floor, has a beautiful chandler which is on view when the drapes are open as is the rooms decorated ceiling!

Yes, I am noisy with no apologies, but imagining 'what was' is all part of the thrill of Travel ….

The Chesterfield comprises three town homes and the entrance retains that look. The Lobby is more like that of a Private Residence and is decorated accordingly. The black and white floors add to the over ambiance and I was quite ready to move in. Reception is an area that is discreetly placed to the right of the doors and is encased in lovely wood panelling. Staff are very professional and yet warm in welcome. Chris, one of the Concierges, is fabulous and I cannot recommend him enough - he has many hidden talents and can basically find you anything!

The Bar is very Old Club and yet not pretentious. Walls are decorated with portraits and the moss green on the fabric blends well with the panelling. The bar is a delight and I highly recommend a French Martani or two! Beyond the bar one has access to a Conservatory decorated with plants and set with tables. This space is also attached to the Dining Room and where Afternoon Tea is served. A Good One! The Dining Room is fairly large and the Breakfast served is very good.

To the right of Reception and down a paneled hall lies the Library - all masculine leather and yet invites a nice curl up with a cup of tea or a cocktail. A nice place to meet friends if one chooses.

Now to Rooms. We had two separate side by side. Mine was quite large and decorated with an antique stamp theme which was very nicely done. A large closet opposite the bathroom. Bathroom was on the large and had a power shower which I loved! The bedroom as a long built in along on wall with a chair and several outlets. A flat screen tv then the windows - which overlook the inner rooftops but not too bad  and they open! Then a small table with a comfy chair. The bed was comfortable and the linens clean and fresh. Nephew's the same but a different theme. 
There is a ""business area"" down the stairs when you come off the elevator as well as powder rooms.

All in all, we were very satisfied with our rooms. Room Service is delivered by professional yet friendly staff and there was not a problem in requesting 'off the menu' which can sometime be a problem.

Charles Street is situated in a very good area in which to branch out - 

Bond Street, Regent Street, South Moulton Street, Piccadilly, Savile Row and the Burlington Arcade are very easy to get to as are Hamleys, Liberty’s and Fortnum & Mason. A taxi ride gets you a little further to Harrods, Harvey Nichols and the boutiques of Knightsbridge, Sloane Square and the King’s Road. 

If you hunger for Green Space/Parks, then a short stroll to the South or West and you reach firstly Green Park - which takes you directly across to Buckingham Palace - as well as St James’s Park and Hyde Park. You can row a boat on the Serpentine or jog to Marble Arch, as well as get to the Diana Memorial Fountain and Speakers Corner. For the horse lovers, ask the Hotel to arrange a ride along Rotten Row!  Which we wanted to try but didn't have time for. 

Museums abound and should not be missed! And there are various restaurants within walking distance of the Hotel. Shepard's Bush Area is basically a block away and down a street and we enjoyed several pubs and one terrific restaurant or two! 

I would recommend this Hotel without hesitation. My only hint would be it may not be suitable for those that hunger for the Bright Lights of The City. But if you want to experience from the inside just what it must have looked like 'back in the day' then come here! Soak in the atmosphere of a by gone era, wish yourself dressed accordingly, and simply Enjoy!",5,2014,02,10
105,Chesterfield,The hotel is set in a quite side street in an exclusive area a short walk from Picadilly and Green Park underground station. The rooms are a reasonable size for a city centre hotel and quiet and comfortable but we were a bit warm overnight but that might just be because I didn’t adjust the heating/ air conditioning correctly. The hotel does have a gentleman’s club style environment and the décor may be dated in some of the areas but it has charm and the dining area/ breakfast room is 70’s style that is now in danger of becoming retro chic. I didn’t try the restaurant so can’t comment on the food but the breakfast was excellent with all the choices you would expect. I liked the bar with its leather armchairs and with its pianist as the grand piano. The staff are friendly and the service is impeccable. Overall it’s certainly not cheap but the cost isn’t outrageous for a central London hotel where prices are typically high. Recommended.,4,2014,02,09
105,Great weekend,"We've already stayed in two other Red Carnation hotels and totally enjoyed ourselves every time but this hotel was that little bit extra special. It has a real welcoming atmosphere with warm, friendly staff who gave an excellent service throughout our stay. Our room was very comfortable and breakfast was great too. We were within easy walking distance to the Palace, Piccadilly Square and Oxford Street. Overall definitely one of the best hotels we've stayed in. Recommend it.",5,2014,02,06
105,"Outstanding Small, Personal Hotel","My wife and I enjoyed a week long stay here.  The hotel is conveniently located in mostly residential Mayfair yet close enough to walk to Kensington, Picadilly Circus, Trafalger Square, even all the way to St. Pauls and the Tate Modern.  Our rate was very fair and included free wifi and breakfast.  The room was a bit small, but well furnished and very comfortable. The staff took good care of us from start to finish. If you are looking for a smaller hotel with a personal touch, I don't think you can beat the Chesterfield Mayfair!",5,2014,02,05
105,"Very welcoming, great location","This is a lovely hotel in the heart of Mayfair and worth the little extra you may pay over other hotels in the city. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped, the staff all very helpful and attentive, breakfast was great as was our special afternoon tea.
It is close to the centre of town and St James' park/Buckingham palace. We would certainly be very happy to go back for a weekend visit.
Thank you to all the staff for making us so very welcome.",5,2014,02,05
105,Beautiful hotel.  Comfortable bed and crisp soft bed linnen,"We stayed one night for a 60th birthday present for my other half.

What we liked best, the hotel did not look tired, like so many of the older hotels. The hotel, public places and rooms were clean and fresh.  We took afternoon tea, the sandwiches and cakes were scrumptious and the cakes we did not eat, were boxed to enable us to eat later.

I booked the romantic package as a special treat, the rose petals and rose, smell of the bath bomb were a welcome greeting, I was so excited, having booked it all myself as a special birthday treat for when we arrived back from the theatre... my partner was really impressed... only hiccup, they had forgot to leave the champagne and strawberries, it didn't spoil our stay.

Breakfast was delightful.

The service was excellent and we were made to feel very welcome.

Highly recommend this hotel, if you are looking for somewhere special.  You are close to theatre land and Oxford Street for shopping.",5,2014,01,24
105,Lovely hotel and excellent service,We stayed at the Chesterfield for my birthday recently and were thrilled to discover our room had been upgraded. I also received a birthday card and cupcake from the staff which was a very nice touch. The bed was comfy and the room clean and well equipped with bath robes and slippers too. All the staff were excellent and vey welcoming and Paul was particularly helpful. The location was perfect for shopping and we would love to stay again.,5,2014,01,22
105,Very Nice,"The Chesterfield is a very nice hotel. Within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, through a nice park. You're in an upscale area. The staff is very nice and the bar and room service are 24 hours. The beds were extremely comfortable, the rooms are small but extremely clean and manageable. The staff were ALL very nice, accommodating and friendly and helpful. My son wanted to go to a football match and 5 different people worked over time trying to help him with that. I had some difficulties with my credit card and they were all very patient and helpful about that. Just a great place.",4,2014,01,21
105,Lovely city escape,"We stayed for one night in the Chesterfield on short theatre break to celebrate our anniversary. Everything was fabulous...every member of staff we dealt with were helpful and friendly, the room was spotless and cosy equipped with the crispiest white linens and bathrobes and the breakfast was gorgeous. They upgraded us as an anniversary treat and left the most amazing cupcakes in our room! Great location - 10/15 min walk to Piccadilly Circus/soho and the theatres and 5 min to Hyde park. The room was small but it's a real old world hotel so if that is your taste you won't mind in the least.",5,2014,01,21
105,"Thank you, we will visit you again","In previous visits to London we frequently left our hotels with the feeling that we had been 'ripped-off'. Not so at the Chesterfield Mayfair, it is welcoming, clean and has very, very well trained staff. The bedrooms, apart from ours being a bit on the small side, were faultless. Breakfasts are better than excellent and the location is great. In comparison to other London hotels the price is also excellent. We will certainly use The Chesterfield Mayfair for our future visits to London.",5,2014,01,20
105,Great place! Great service!,"The rooms were very nice, a little small but cute. The service was mind-blowing! So nice, so efficient, always willing to help! I've rarely had a guest service as great as this one!
The tea was very good and the room service was good.",5,2014,01,18
105,2 fantastic days at chesterfield,"Had 2 fantastic days at chesterfield what a beautiful hotel, the staff were really lovely.we had dinner there which was really really good, & afternoon tea which was amazing,also very close to shops etc, definitely will stay again",5,2014,01,15
105,Fantastic Family Trip,"We stayed at The Chesterfield twice over the holiday.  The hotel was recommended by my husband's sister and it did not disappoint.  We stayed for 2 nights, then went to Paris because everything in London shuts down for 3 days over Christmas and then came back for 3 nights.  We were traveling with our sons, 21 and 17.  We had a suite both times and the boys shared a room with two singles beds. The rooms are not huge, but they are very functional and comfortable.  Each day we had some little treats delivered to our room, which was a nice touch.

The real gems are the people who work at the hotel. Everyone at the front desk proved to be very professional and helpful.  Chris and Darren, the concierges never led us astray.  They had lots of tips about getting around and where to go.  Additionally, they suggested that we store half of our luggage with them when we went to Paris which made the travel to Paris a lot easier.

Having breakfast included in your rate is also great as it was nice to start each day with a good meal before running around the city all day.  We also had High Tea at the hotel which was a lot of fun, but very pricey.  We would definitely go back to this hotel in the future.",5,2014,01,10
105,Great Location,"What a lovely Hotel, our room was beautiful and the staff outstanding. The location is fantastic for sightseeing, walking distance to Hyde Park the best shops and all of London's attractions. The staff are very friendly and very informative making sure we had wonderful stay.",5,2014,01,09
105,Great hotel with great service,It was our first time at the chesterfield and I am confident we will come back. the hotel is very nice and the staff are very friendly and helpful. the location is very central yet in a nice quiet neighbourhood.,5,2014,01,08
105,First two days of honeymoon,"The hotel was charming and the rooms were delightful. I was particularly impressed by the small embellishments of a double room upgrade as we were newly weds, free champagne and hand written cards from the staff congratulating us on our nuptials. 
The hotel would have gotten five stars if not for the weird debate we had when checking out when we asked a phone call to be deducted from the bill as we were not at the  hotel at that time. It was unfortunate that mgmt decided to challenge us on this! Other wise a charming hotel.",4,2014,01,07
105,A haven for a jet lagged traveller,"This is a lovely hotel - with a standout staff. Friendly checkin and continuing service throughout my stay.  The rooms have character but with all the amenities you require including a wonderfully comfortable bed.

Bar was nice - though quiet - and restaurant excellent.
I was suffering bad jet lag during my short stay and this hotel was a haven.
It is not cheap - though where in London is? - but the location is fabulous, only a five-ten minute walk to  Piccadilly and Green Park,  one of my favourite areas.",5,2014,01,06
105,Very British,"Very British hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Not the top luxury but for Mayfair the room price is very reasonable.
The rooms are a bit old fashioned, but quite charming. Staff is very friendly. 
Fire alarm went off a few times. Decent apology letter from hotel management. No discount for the inconvenience.",3,2014,01,06
105,Perfect Christmas Location/ Perfect Location for Town,"We stayed at the Chesterfield over the Christmas period to leave all the stresses of organising Christmas behind. It was the best decision that we've made in terms of hotels. The staff at this excellent hotel went overboard to make sure that every need was catered for, this included chocolates and Christmas stockings in the room. Even the hotel manager made an appearance on Christmas Day to make sure the guests were happy and all our needs were fulfilled. The concierge and reception knew our names within the first day and ensured we were happy. The service of the Scottish bar manager was the best that i've received in London for a long time. The range of cocktails offered was extraordinary. The hotel was decorated with a sumptuous tree in the foyer and even Santa made an appearance. We shall be visiting again next Christmas. But this great find in the heart of Mayfair, being so close to all the action is a must go to if you want traditional service and values you cant go far wrong- even if it is to get a cocktail from the celebrated Bar Manager when in the area.",5,2014,01,06
105,Clubby comfort in Mayfair,"I live round the corner from this hotel and love walking by the charming gents that stand out front.  We had relatives in town and needed some ""overflow"" room at the house and checked in for two nights at the Chesterfield.  This hotel has a comfortable, clubby feel throughout.  The front desk and restaurant staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The rooms were somewhat small, but efficient and quite comfortable. The room was absolutely silent, which is no small thing in central London.  The location is phenomenal and most central London attractions are within walking distance.  I'm trying to think of another reason to stay at the Chesterfield for a few nights.",4,2014,01,04
105,Absolutely Enjoyable !,"Location: Mayfair: perfect for a 5 night stay. Early check in a huge bonus after 24hours of flying.
Room: No 506. At first it seemed quite small, but as you unpack, you realize that there is actually quite a lot of storage, and plenty of hanging space and bag storage for 2 people on a 5 week winter trip.
The room overlooked the rear of the hotel, and was very quite. There was an ""outlook"" from the window, but we wouldn't call it a view.
There was tea, coffee making, free cookies, and daily bottled water.
Bathroom had great floor heating, and daily toiletries.
Restaurant: we only ate breakfasts at the hotel.... And they were fantastic !
From fresh beetroot juice to whiskey infused porridge to plain bacon and eggs. There was a huge selection.
Staff: Smiles everywhere. Polite and helpful....the staff really helped make this place special.
Summary: Absolutely enjoyable !",5,2014,01,03
105,A good choice for central London,"We have recently returned from a one night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. This was our second visit, the first being several years ago. 

My husband has a very short memory when it comes to holidays and so it was a surprise when he suggested we stay at “the place that did the best fried eggs I’ve ever had in a hotel!” I knew he meant the Chesterfield Mayfair! This visit was unfortunately a short one to attend an evening party in a nearby hotel. We really just needed a bed for the night but decided to treat ourselves to this hotel. 

We arrived before 10 a.m. to drop off our luggage and were offered a room immediately, which was great as it meant we could sort ourselves out before spending time in London sightseeing. We had booked a superior double room. Our room faced the road which we liked and was very quiet. In face we heard no noise at all from anywhere. The room was geared to business travellers and provided an excellent range of office “bits and pieces” as well as large desk area. Had we been staying longer we would have asked for a room with 2 chairs as we are leisure travellers and enjoy sitting reading when on holiday. 

The bathroom had an excellent shower but a teeny tiny bath. I am 5 foot 4 inches tall and had to bend my knees, so no hope of a long relaxing soak! Sadly I am nearly 5 foot 4 inches wide too (OK slight exaggeration) so there was a moment of semi panic when I realised that getting out was not so easy!!!! Hmmm perhaps that should be my New Year’s Resolution. Maybe there are longer baths in other rooms. 

The room had a safe but it was on the floor of the wardrobe at an angle. We needed to do a double act holding the torch on my phone to read the instructions! 

Our room rate included breakfast – of course, since we were only there really to check out the fried eggs! My husband was delighted to find out that the full English breakfast was as good as he remembered. We have had some wonderful breakfasts in many lovely hotels across the world and are happy to say that the breakfast at the Chesterfield Mayfair is up there with the best of them. Perfect in every way. The restaurant looked lovely too, decked out in Christmas finery, as did the foyer with the beautiful Christmas tree and Gingerbread house. 

The doorman was very helpful and courteous as were the staff on the front desk.

The only slight niggle we had was when I tried to book the hotel. I noticed that the Boomers offer included breakfast but was the same price as the best rate offer on the hotel’s website (using the ad box at the top of the Google search) which advertised:

I rang the hotel assuming that this was what was meant by booking direct. The lady on the desk quoted a room price that was considerably more that the web price. She said her system didn’t show the web price that I was looking at on screen during our conversation. She also didn’t know what the benefit was of taking the Boomers package since it appeared that everybody can get free breakfast. All very confusing. In the end she suggested that I put the phone down and book on line, which I did! 

In summary this is a lovely hotel in a great and quiet part of London. We would recommend it unreservedly and hope that one day we may return.",5,2014,01,01
105,A great hotel in central London,"Just returned from a 4 day stay at the Chesterfield. I have stayed here before but some years ago. There was nothing to fault this hotel on. Staff, accommodation food all excellent and i must recommend the dover sole!! When i checked in i was delighted to hear that we had been ungraded to a junior suite. So that was the icing on the cake. I will definitely return again to this hotel and will recommend it to anyone. I wish a Happy New Year to all the staff.",5,2014,01,01
105,Great Boutique Hotel,"Enjoyed the stay there. The standard rooms are small, but we were lucky and got to upgrade to a larger suite. Definitely worth it. Fairly centrally located in London. The Staff was great, the restaurant in the hotel was great. We would stay there again.",5,2013,12,31
105,Surpassed my expectation,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of those special place where you know that despite an exceptional place in a unique neighborhood, their savoir faire and experience is still their biggest asset. Never have I felt more welcome are cared for in a hotel.",5,2013,12,27
105,A charming and friendly hotel in the heart of London,"The Cherstefield is a gem in the heart of Mayfair. The rooms are small but cosy and wonderfully decorated. The personnel is helpful and friendly. The restaurant is excellent for both breakfast and dinner. If you try and find a home in London, look no further. This hotel is British hospitality at its best.",5,2013,12,26
105,Great hotel in wonderful location,"My first time to London and couldn't have been more happy with the Chesterfield.  The price, location, service were a perfect combination.  Very traditional London decor, small intimate boutique feel, and the service was excellent.  We went at Christmas time and the decor was great.  In lobby, hot chocolate, candy canes , etc. available all day free of charge.",5,2013,12,20
105,Weekend Stay,"We booked the Mayfair Package which included room & breakfast, afternoon tea, a bottle of champers, and 6pm checkout.  . Its great location made it easy to explore all areas; you are so central, yet away from the traffic noise which can effect some hotels.

As lovely as this boutique hotel is,  it was the wonderful staff that will linger long in our memory, everyone without exception were so friendly and helpful, all are a credit to the hotel. 

We would not hesitate in recommending  this hotel to others.",5,2013,12,16
105,Great experience !,"We stayed here for eight nights and were extremely pleased that we had chosen this hotel. The level of service was excellent. The staff were attentive and helpful. I was impressed by the restaurant with a very high level of presentation and service, also with the more informal evening Terrace offerings. Although we are now retired, I have stayed at many of the world's best hotels in the past. We were quite delighted to find a smaller hotel which measures up to the highest standards - and is on a quieter street in the best part of London !",5,2013,12,14
105,"Exceptional service, very friendly staff","We stayed one night at Chesterfield Hotel, celebrating my husband's birthday. We found the staff very friendly in all areas most helpful and polite, they were all very friendly and made our  stay a very pleasant one: they took the time to sign a birthday card and leave it with a pretty cupcake in the room, it was a lovely surprise when we returned in the afternoon. We were able to take advantage of the Boomer breakfast offer (it was  was delicious and there was plenty of food available at 10.30 on Sunday). The hotel also looked very pretty with all the Xmas decorations up.  It's in a great location not far from Green Park where we were able to stroll before returning home. We hope to stay there again.",5,2013,12,13
105,old world courteousy,"Always a delight to visit the Chersterfield. The ambiance is relaxed, genteel and serene, the staff are attentive and its all about the personal touch. I visit the Chesterfield twice a year for conferences and it is reassuring to know that some things just dont change.",5,2013,12,12
105,Absolutely stunning with amazing attention to detail,"I stayed here last week for my wedding night. The staff were just so accommodating, to a level you simply don;t get in the big brash modern hotels. When we returned from our wedding there was a bottle of champagne, cupcakes and a card form the staff in the room. Where else do you get that? Oh, and we were upgraded to a suite as well.

Bathroom was excellent, shower coming out of the ceiling and a very deep bath. Elemis freebies.

I can not recommend this place highly enough for a special occasion. We'll be back for our first wedding anniversary. Thank you!",5,2013,12,11
105,Fine for a night,"Compared to the huge chain hotels that business travellers will often find themselves in The Chesterfield is a bit smaller and more intimate.  It has a certain 'old world' charm that you don't quite get from a big Hilton or Sofitel.

It is an excellent location for anyone doing business in the West End / Mayfair part of town, but would also be a prime spot for a tourist stay.

The room I had was fine, and ticked all the main boxes:  a comfortable bed, wifi etc. But it was rather small (not a room you could spend too much time in without feeling a bit claustrophobic) and woefully lacking in sound-proofing (I heard my neighbour's phone call back home to his wife in splendid clarity).

Breakfast was good, though the server got my order wrong, which was unfortunate.",3,2013,12,11
105,Great service...makes you feel at home,"I usually feel like a stranger in a hotel. I did not here. Stayed 10 nights in two separate visits with rooms on the 7th floor. Staff was friendly but courteous. Bar has very good atmosphere. Library useful for discrete conversations.  Breakfast was very good in restaurant. Room service was also good including food, though trays are very difficult to get out the door. The room was comfortable and but a little small especially if your are portly as I am. Bathroom was cramped and that's about my only compliant!  Attention to detail which seems to the hallmark of the Red Carnation group was remarkable. It is the little things that count! Scotch tape and office supplies so if you need to work in your room you can. Recharging my Ipad in reception. Umbrellas for rain or drizzle. Interestingly, the fire alarm rang while staying. Staff were efficient and quick to ascertain that the alarm was false. Even then two fire engines showed up within 10 minutes! Finally a tip to those arriving at Heathrow. Take the fast train to Paddington and then a cab ....you should be at your hotel within 30 minutes of leaving the Airport and right smack in the centre of town with Palace, Parks and shops all within walking distance.",5,2013,12,10
105,An outstanding hotel!,"Just spent two wonderful days at this hotel and couldn't fault it. An initial difference between our booking agency and the type of room booked, resulted in the most generous upgrade to a fabulous suite,  Bed linen was of the highest quality, towels and robes the thickest and fluffiest imaginable and a fantastic supply of lovely Elemis bath goodies made us feel completely spoilt.
Breakfast was excellent - really good coffee - and brought to our room by a most charming girl.  The service throughout the hotel was immaculate and really welcoming. Can't wait to save up our pennies for another visit!",5,2013,12,06
105,I love this hotel.,"I love this hotel. I come to London a lot, and I always end up back at this hotel. It's friendly, it's cute, I love the location in Mayfair. I love the bathtubs, which I always lounge in. I love the friendly staff. I love the Red Carnation way of giving you a special treat every night--sometimes it's a chocolate, sometimes it's some bath salts. I'm not over-the-top in love with their room service menu, but you've never seen a group of people hustle up to your room faster. On top of this, it always seems to have rooms going at a really fair price. I stayed once at Hotel 41, a five-star Red Carnation in London and the experience and service left much to be desired. The chef there doesn't know how to poach an egg! So, yeah, the four-star Chesterfield is the place to be.",5,2013,12,05
105,Wonderful stay,Second time to The Chesterfield Mayfair and it is still an outstanding place to stay. We opted for the 3 for 2 suite stay and really enjoyed our suite (Mayfair Suite). Breakfast is fantastic and staff in general very attentive and service minded - nothing is too much trouble.,5,2013,12,05
105,Fabulous staff,"My mother and I had a wonderful weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Room and breakfast was great. Loved the afternoon tea too. 

What really makes this hotel special is the staff who work there who are quite simply the most helpful and lovely people you could meet.",5,2013,12,04
105,Always good,"We visited in November on on special offer which included an afternoon tea and bottle of champagne.  It offered some of the best value we could find for a Thursday to Saturday stay. 
The service from every member of staff is exceptional. Our last stay was at the Hilton Courthouse off Regent street(fabulous location).This hotel provides everything in in personal service that was missing from the Hilton. 
We have used many five star hotels in London over the years and can't really see what they offer over this lovely establishment.    
The rooms are a little compact and perhaps a bit of remodelling is required but everything is well kept. The whole place has the feeling of an old English club. Whenever you make a request of any nature it is always completed without fuss and upon the first time of asking.   
It is not the very last word in luxury but offers good quality accommodation with service that can't be beaten any any price. 
The afternoon tea was another high quality experience, although lacking the grand ambiance of the Ritz the service and food were at least a match. In fact the service was superior in that it's just so friendly but always entirely professional. 
Breakfast was great with a reasonable buffet selection. I made a complete mess of ordering from the menu for my wife,  when it arrived and it was obvious I had cocked it all up, the waiter just whisked it all away including my order, started from scratch so that we had breakfast together. Fabulous!
We have stayed in the past and would always return if we didn't feel the need to try other locations.",5,2013,12,04
105,"Beautiful property, great staff","I recently stayed at the Chesterfield with my daughter while in London for the weekend. Everything was great about our stay! Wonderful, pretty room; comfy beds; great linens; quiet; amazing staff - from front desk, to restaurant, to the maids! Delicious, huge breakfast, delightful afternoon tea. Will be my first hotel choice when in a London!",5,2013,12,04
105,Anniversary Stay,"We stayed last weekend at the Chesterfield and cannot express how lovely this place is. The building, the rooms the staff, the afternoon tea, the breakfast, the service - all exceptional. We chose to stay for 2 nights on the Mayfair weekend package which included breakfast, a bottle of champagne and afternoon tea for 2. 

I emailed ahead to ask for one of the recently refurbished rooms and am glad I did as it was roomy and very well presented. The bathroom was nice with soft towels and a good shower/bath. The room was well equipped with an iron/ironing board, hairdryer, robes, slippers etc. It even had a drawer full of stationary including sellotape! Very handy for business visitors I guess. The bed was excellent... One of the best hotel beds I have ever stayed in!

We took afternoon tea on the first day and this was very nice (although not good if you are on a diet!). The tea's were fantastic (especially the Willy Wonka Chocolate Tea, try this without milk) and the cakes and scones were heavenly. 

The breakfast was very good with a good buffet selection followed by a choice of something on the menu. I had an English Breakfast and the Smoked Salmon and Eggs on a bagel - both were very very nice! The service was good on the first morning and average on the second (although that particular staff member seemed new?).

We were given an anniversary card signed by the manager and some of the staff and a cupcake with happy anniversary written on it which was a nice touch!

The location is excellent and is a short walk to many great restaurants in Mayfair. It is a 5-10 minute walk New Bond Street and Regent Street for shopping and 5 minutes to Park Lane.

All in this hotel goes the extra mile for it's guests and deserves a 5 star rating, I understand why this is rated so highly on Trip Advisor and will certainly be returing!",5,2013,12,03
105,Quiet & Centrally Located,"I have just returned from weekend stay at the hotel.  The hotel is very centrally located (about 5 minutes from Green Park on the Picadilly line) but on a quiet street so there is not much ambient noise when you are trying to sleep.  I booked a single knowing the room would be small and it was but it was very nicely furnished and had everything I needed.  I found the bed to be quite comfortable.  The tolietries included: shampoo, conditioner, bath/shower gel, and lotion.  Each night I was left bath salts or bubble bath with the turn down service.

The check in was very efficient - I arrived a little before noon and my room was not ready, they happily stored my luggage and I was able to head out to explore.  When I returned around 3pm they had already moved my suitcase to my room.  Departure was equally as efficient and having called down just before I headed down they had a cab waiting for me.

I enjoyed afternoon tea at the hotel.  The selection of sandwiches and pastries were tasty and the presentation very nice as well.  Although no one stopped by to check on me after the tea and food were delivered which I thought was a bit odd.

My only complaint was that the Wifi signal in my room (413) was very weak.  My iPhone could not pick up the signal at all and my tablet could only pick up the weak signal and dropped it frequently.  The signal was quite strong in the lobby and resturaunt though.",5,2013,12,02
105,Lovely Afternoon Tea not to be missed,"We--my husband and I--stayed at Chesterfield during the second part of our honeymoon in April 2013. We had previously stayed at The Arch London and wanted to try something different for a few days. Opting for a weekend package that included afternoon tea, we had excellent service during our stay. With a doorman that always helped us with the door when returning with our shopping bags, I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful service. We stayed in the Classic Double room--the smallest. But the space was more than enough for the 2 of us during our stay. The best part undoubtedly was the Afternoon Tea. My husband and I spent our Sunday afternoon enjoying their pastries and tea for over 2 hours. Certainly something not to be missed! The nearest tube is Green Park and is a 10-minute walk from the hotel. However, we had no trouble finding our way around. The hotel is located conveniently in Mayfair and we walked most of the way. I loved the time we spent in Chesterfield!",4,2013,12,01
105,Underwhelmed in Mayfair.,"We had read good reports about the Chesterfield and had high expectations for our stay.
Checkin was polite and efficient, our bags were taken to the room whilst we headed shopping.
On our return we were slightly dissapointed with our room. Smaller than imagined but it was nicely laid out and looked comfortable. Unfortunately there were noticeable stains on the curtains and loose furnishings which gave the impression of being dirty. The bathroom tiling was also very tired and in need of attention.
I was also dissapointed that the Kingsize bed was actually two singles together, not mentioned on the website. This would have been bearable with a topper matress but there wasn't one. And when we finally retired my side of the bed squeaked at every movement. 
I understand that the Chesterfield has that old charm and some things can be forgiven but these were basic faults.
There appears to be no dress code for the restuarant either, on our second day we were sat next to a young couple for breakfast. The lady was in her dressing gown and slippers and her partner in a onesy.
The service is very good and the staff both helpful and polite,I can see why people find this hotel charming but for me the basics come first, good service is not enough on its own.
Would not return.",2,2013,11,30
105,Not as good as expected!,"Hello,

I stayed here over a Saturday and Sunday night - had 3 rooms for friends on the Saturday.

I asked for an upgrade if available on the Saturday night for my Girlfriends 21st, and after paying the surcharge was moved to the 'African Suite' Very strange room ... not quite a suite I expected !

Also payments have been messed up so I've been charged double and have been told its gonna take 10 days to get it back.

Polite staff, 'ok decor', had much better experiences elsewhere",4,2013,11,28
105,“Romantic weekend at your place”,"We have been to your hotel for 3 days visit with my fiancee. The staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel is extremely warm and welcoming, especialy Mr. Eddine Abdellahi who was friendly and helpful to us. Everyone in the hotel was eager to help and had a wonderful attitude.The actual hotel was beautiful. Loved the location and the look of the hotel.  We loved having a nightcap in the bar. It was a great way to relax after a long day.",5,2013,11,27
105,"Comfortable, refined and all with a smile.","I love this part of London as it is so convenient for everywhere but this was the first time I have stayed in the Chesterfield and it certainly won't be my last.
Firstly all the staff we came into contact with were extremely friendly, helpful and always had a smile (it's a small thing but make such a difference to the feel of a place).
Everything about the place seems designed and furnished to make you feel comfortable and at home in your surroundings without going over the top. This is a beautiful and refined part of London, the Chesterfield reflects this.
The room was a good size with a lovely big bed. The bathroom, whilst not huge, was good. My partner was particularly happy with the powerful shower after a hard days shopping. 
We ordered room service one night, which was with us within 30 minutes. Everything was very tasty, perfectly cooked and good sized portions.
I know there are cheaper places to stay in London but if you want easy access to the mayhem of shopping in Oxford and Regent Street or or the calm of shopping in Bond Street and the surrounding area. If you want the heady nightlife of Soho or the cosy village atmosphere of the pubs and restaurants around Shepherd Market (just around the corner off Curzon St). If you want to take in a show (""Once"" at the Phoenix Theatre is fantastic. Never enjoyed a show as much as this before) or see the sights, this hotel gives you the perfect  base to do it all from. We never used the tube once as everything is within walking distance (or a very short cab ride).
So thank you to everyone at the Chesterfield Mayfair for making it one of the best trips to London my partner and I have had.
We look forward to staying with you again soon.",5,2013,11,26
105,An excellent hotel experience.,"I stayed 2 nights in the Mayfair Suite and would find it very hard to fault. The room has the all the fixture and fittings you would want including a bang up to date technology. Lots and lots of very nice little extras including a hand written personalised welcome note from the Hotel Manager. The staff put a lot of effort in going that extra mile to exceed even my high 
expectation. Attentive but not over bearing. I can really recommend a stay and will be returning there before anywhere else. Well Done The Chesterfield. ",5,2013,11,26
105,Fantastic Birthday Weekend,"This is a fabulous Hotel - perfect location, 2 mins walk from Piccadilly, 10 mins from Oxford and Regent Streets. Buckingham Palace and the Royal Parks are also just 5 mins away, so for both shopping and sightseeing it cant be beaten.

The staff are the best I've ever experienced, from Maddie and Letitia on reception through to Manos in the bar, you are made to feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble.

You feel as though you are in your own private club, which is so refreshing compared to the anonymous chains - it really is the staff that make such a difference to your stay.

Our bedroom was so quiet and comfortable, and I particularly enjoyed the ""Jacuzzi Bath"".!!

So if you want to stay in a Hotel that has fantastic staff, rooms and location the Chesterfield Mayfair simply can't be beaten.",5,2013,11,25
105,Great location!,"I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair.  The location is ideal for touring, theater, museums, dining, as well as shopping.  It is centrally located near the tubes and buses to control your expenses while in London.  The hotel is cheerful, clean, and an overall ""happy"" place to stay. The concierge desk manned by Chris is great. Chris was always making sure my dinner reservations and all my questions were answered with a smile. The rooms are not particularly large but definitely adequate. The bathroom is bright and perfect for makeup. The temperature control in the room was great and once my head hit the pillow I was sound asleep. Even the hotel is not rated 5 star, housekeeping came in late to turn down the bed, add a candy or surprise on the pillow, and straightened the bathroom.  In the drawers were hairdryer, electrical adapter, scissors, sticky pad for notes, etc.  I will certainly return on my next trip to London.",5,2013,11,20
105,"Good Value, Elegant Location","My wife and I brought our 11 year old granddaughter to London for her birthday. The hotel had a very nice gift bag for her upon arrival, We had inquired about a roll away bed for our granddaughter but we were notified that two adults and a child must book a junior suite at the minimum. So we booked a junior suite. When we arrived in our room there was only one bed and no sofa that could be made into a bed, only a very small sitting area with two wicker type chairs. I assumed that they would bring in a temporary child size bed for the evening. When we returned to our room there was no second bed. I called the front desk to ask about this and was told that they thought we could all sleep in the one bed and there was no room for another. I observed that if they intended for us to stay in one bed, that we could certainly could have booked a regular room with one bed and saved a substantial amount. So on our first night, after a long day of travel from Los Angeles, we all tried to sleep in the same bed. The next morning I expressed my displeasure to the manager and was told that they would move us to a different junior suite with a second bed. This room was acceptable. I surmised that our first room was like the ""Old Maid"" that they give to anyone they think might not complain and then switch if they do complain. If you are booking a room for 3 people who do not expect to be bed mates all, be sure to insist before you arrive that you want two beds. I was worried that Trip Advisor had let me down with this recommendation. 

The balance of the stay, however, was fine. The Chesterfield is located across the street from the Saudi Embassy and a block from Berkley Square. We could walk to the Changing of the Guard and some really great shopping. The restaurant is pleasant and serves a delicious breakfast. The lobby is traditional, warm and inviting. We felt like we were entering an exclusive private club every time we walked through the front door. We would stay here again but would pay much closer attention to the room they try to put us in.",4,2013,11,20
105,First class service in elegant surroundings,"I booked the Chesterfield Mayfair for four days over a weekend in November. I took up their special offer Mayfair Weekend which proves for some great extras including champagne, afternoon tea and a late check out. The holiday was for my wife and I and our two friends. This was the third year that we have stayed at the hotel.

We were greeted warmly by the staff and throughout our four days, nothing was too much trouble. It is difficult to pick out one member of staff above the others as everyone we met was extremely helpful. Even at our departure we were made to feel that we were leaving our second home and would be welcome back soon.

Quite honestly having experienced the excellent service this hotel provides, I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when we visit London.",5,2013,11,19
105,Great,"Great location, wonderful rooms, clean and efficient staff and a real London feel sums this hotel up. I stayed here last weekend with my other half and we had the most wonderful, relaxing stay courtesy of the Chesterfield Mayfair. On the pricey end of the spectrum, but this is London and you get what you pay for.",4,2013,11,19
105,Lovely Hotel... Amazing Stay!,"I treated my girlfriend to a London weekend for her birthday and chose this Hotel as it was in a great location and had the old feel about it, plus the rooms looked very individual. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was amazing and thoroughly appreciated, they also left a cupcake, chocolates and card for my partner. The bed was the most comofortable Ive slept in! Location is easy walking to Oxford St, Leics Sq, Theatres, Covent Garden etc. Bar was lovely and restuarant looked nice too. Has a real English Edwardian feel to the place and staff also compliment it wonderfully. Highly recommend.",5,2013,11,19
105,Old-style English understated excellence,"I like this hotel.  It has a sense of old-fashioned serenity and calm amidst the hustle and bustle of Mayfair, the staff are unobtrusive and it's small enough to feel quite intimate.  It doesn't have the business 'rush' of more modern hotels but then that's the point.  It's not cheap but it is elegant and if you're looking for something a little different, it's worth considering this hotel.",4,2013,11,18
105,Disappointed ,"We chose the Chesterfield on my fathers commendation as he has stayed there on previous occasions.
Having stayed in London many times I have to say I was really disappointed. Yes, the location is good but overall we were disappointed with the quality of the service and the hotel is looking tired.It gives you the impression of being on a very old fashioned ship.The rooms were very small and the bathrooms were tiny. At breakfast - the staff continually kept getting the order wrong and to make matters worse when it did arrive it was cold and had to be sent back to the kitchen. The small jam pots had been opened and put back which was very poor as there was no way of knowing how long they had been there. We rang room service to be told someone will ring you back and when the 3 x sandwiches arrived - the quality was extremely poor - not on the bread we had ordered. We took pictures of the sandwich fillings as we were so disgusted with the lack of filling - it looked like a child had made them and for £40 + it was pathetic. For £300+ per room per night staying here was not value for money at all. On a positive note the bar staff were attentive and the pianist was good.
We waited ages too for a taxi on the morning of our departure and overheard a member of staff saying to another - basically you're wasting your time - which once again doesn't give a good impression.
",2,2013,11,16
105,Great stay!,"Luxurious hotel in an upscale, quiet section of London...just a short walk away from Hyde park and Green park!  Room was bigger than expected and exceptionally clean.  Breakfast was great and cute patio off of dining room was just perfect.  Must visit Tamarind located across the street!! Best Indian food I've ever had!",5,2013,11,15
105,returned to this lovely charming hotel,"stayed once again at this hotel cannot fault it, booking again to go back in may next year, close to oxford street for shopping!! about 10 min or so walk, close to green park tube station to go further afield",5,2013,11,14
105,"Comfort, good service, but expensive","I didn’t dislike the Chesterfield Mayfair.  It is a lovely hotel situated in a nice location right in the middle of Mayfair.  It was a short walk to shopping on Piccadilly Street or New Bond Street.  The Green Park tube station was also close and Buckingham Palace was just a walk across Green Park.  There were many restaurants nearby.  The room was comfortable with good climate control, a nice King bed that led to good sleeping, and a moderately-sized bathroom with quality bath gel and shampoo.  The staff was unfailingly helpful and polite.  We slept well and encountered no problems whatsoever during our stay.  It was just soooo expensive for what we received.  At £240 per night (with VAT added), I expected more luxury or more space or both.  I know London is expensive and I know we could have paid a lot more.  I was just disappointed in the value.  It could just be my expectations.",4,2013,11,13
105,We´ll be back,"We recently stayed in this excellent hotel. Our room was very comfortable and had the best beds we have ever had. The staff was very professional, friendly and helpful. You felt at home. We´ll definitely choose this hotel again when we go back to London and will highly recommend it to others.",5,2013,11,12
105,One of the Best Boutiqe hotels in London,"Charming boutique hotel in the heart of prestigious Mayfair in central London.
Intimate cozy hotel, rooms a bit small, but excellent service and personal attention make up for it.
Breakfast is delicious and rich,  a romantic bar, so, an overall highly recommended hotel.
My wife and I were at the end of September, for three nights, and really enjoyed.
2 minutes walk you will find the ""Farmer Market"" with  a variety of good restaurants, bars and lively nightlife.  Green Park is in short distance.",5,2013,11,12
105,Hotel in Mayfair,"I recently returned from my first visit to London. I choose Mayfair to stay in as friends were staying there and the location is central. I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel is beautifully decorated- old school. The room was a good size, bathroom good and it was even better than the website.",5,2013,11,08
105,Lovely Hotel in Mayfair,"Stayed here in August with 3 teens. Booked directly with the hotel - called number as the online options with breakfast were confusing. Mr. Sparrow who answered was wonderful and  considerate - he helped me to find the best value for two rooms, added breakfasts at no charge for my husband and I  because our room rate did not come with breakfast.  He simply said, ""thought you would like to eat breakfast with your family"". I gave him to wrong check out date and called him a day later (at 5 pm London time) and he cheerfully made the switch with no penalties. From the beginning the service was excellent.
The rooms were traditional, elegant and quiet even though they faced the street. Comfortable beds, good shower with rain head and hand held, nice toiletries, good a/c. Our room was small but not uncomfortable, the kids had a large suite with 2 showers and large closet. Breakfast was good and filling with more options than the website shows. We had the Chocolate tea and everything was delicious, especially the house tea blend. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They offered to pack things up for us to take up to the room. 
Hotel is on a quiet residential street but close walking distance to shops, sites, tube. There is a gastro pub a block from the hotel but be warned it closes early on weekdays and Sundays. Also a couple restaurants nearby but we didn't eat at those. The hotel bar is cozy and a nice place to relax when you have to leave the pub. Bartender is friendly and helpful - overheard him talking to other guests and he readily accommodated their exacting requests. 
We would definitely stay here again. Can't wait to return.",5,2013,11,07
105,Great service in a great location,"I recently returned from a first visit to London.  I stayed in two different hotels, one in South Kensington and the other in Mayfair.  Both areas of town were fantastic pics in terms of being near the tube, restaurants, the sites and more.  We stayed our last two nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  We chose it based on the TA reviews.  We arrived about four-ish on a Wednesday afternoon.  This hotel is old school London, which is what I was expecting. The front desk staff were quite pleasant in greeting us.  We noticed the busy bar adjacent to the check in area, so we decided to have a drink before heading up to our room.  The place was pretty busy, but we found a nice seat and the waiter was quick and friendly.  The bar is done in the same theme as the rest of the hotel.  We found it comfy and inviting.  Our room was small, but I expected this in London.  The linens on the bed and the drapes were very impressive.  I liked the soaps and lotion in the very clean bathroom.  This hotel is walking distance to many restaurants and bars.  I believed we even walked through Hyde Park to get to one restaurant. It felt pretty safe as there were plenty of joggers and walkers.  We did not feel unsafe walking back to the hotel after dinner (have I mentioned what a great walking city London is??)  The only glitch was when we awoke on our final morning only to have no hot water. We soon realized part of the power was out in about half of the hotel.  They explained that something happened down the street (I did believe it was out of their control).  We had to get to the airport, so we were in a slight rush.  They went out of their way offering to help us down the stairs with our bags (elevator was out too).  Several staff members were waiting by the elevators to assist.  You could tell they were embarrassed even though it wasn't their fault.  For the inconvenience, the manager told me he would reduce our final bill by a certain percentage.  Actually, a few days later when I checked my Visa bill, he took off a bit more than even what he had said he would.  Pretty impressive.  I would definitely consider staying at this hotel when again in London.",4,2013,11,03
105,Another wonderful stay,"This was our second visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair, and at this price point I would not stay anywhere else in London. The rooms could be a bit larger but are cozy, nicely decorated, and immaculately clean. The location is perfect: in a quiet corner of posh Mayfair, yet only a few blocks from the tube, with a wide variety of dining choices and even a first-run movie theater within easy walking distance.  If you arrive rumpled, there is a good dry cleaner two blocks away. The hotel service is spectacular at every level: One night we returned hungry from the theater at around 11:30 pm; the restaurant was closed, but the friendly bartender produced excellent sandwiches and drinks for us. Fresh orange juice and crisp baguettes at breakfast, more consistent wifi, and extra towels and toiletries would be nice additions -- but really this is a wonderful hotel.",5,2013,11,01
105,A top hotel,"We recently stayed here for two nights as part of my wife's 40th birthday celebrations and absolutely loved it.

We had a superior king room on the third floor which, whilst not particularly spacious, was very well appointed with an extremely comfortable king size bed. The room was also very quiet with little or no road noise or noise from other rooms. It really felt that once you closed the door you were the only ones there.

My only minor grumble (and it really is minor) was that the shower screen was too small and I soaked the bathroom every time I had a shower.

The staff were excellent without exception - a really warm welcome and whoever we spoke to would do anything to ensure our stay was perfect.

I absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something a little bit different from the regular chains. The location is great and it wasn't even that bad price wise.",5,2013,11,01
105,A superlative establishment!,"Our recent stay at The Chesterfield definitely met & indeed surpassed our expectations, to the extent that we are unable to single out any individual staff member as each one of them whose paths we crossed was singularly courteous & provided valuable assistance.  Outstanding perhaps the front desk staff who offered us an available junior suite, which we found ultimately comfortable, light & cheery. Location of the hotel could not be more elegant, although the hotel is very reasonably priced.
We had a thoroughly excellent time re-exploring old haunts! 
Hoping to visit again, we would definitely choose choose The Chesterfield Mayfair as our base.",5,2013,11,01
105,Very classy hotel,"Loved this hotel which feels intimate and cosy but yet had a bit of liveliness about it too. Locals obviously enjoy the Afternoon Teas and the evening piano. 
Attention to detail was second to none - imagine finding a tray of office supplies in your room - the stapler even worked!
There are not many hotels you would linger for a night cap after dinner but this was one. Bar lunch on arrival ticked all the boxes as well.
Decor and furnishing very traditionally English - just what you would want as a tourist to London.
Overall I think you can tell this hotel is part of a family run group.",5,2013,10,31
105,"""Absolutely perfect""","My husband, our 10 month old baby girl Isabella and my self had the pleasure to stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff were wonderful, they had gone out of their way to make us feel happy and relaxed. They provided everything we could possibly need for our little one and made our stayed exceptional from the anniversary card signed by all the staff through the receptive breakfast team; it was a step above and beyond.  We would make the dormer suite a home away from home in London when ever we pass through. 
Graham, Veronica and Isabella",5,2013,10,30
105,Delightful Weekend,"From start to finish it was absolutely fabulous. All staff, whether on the phone when booking, to our arrival , breakfast time, housekeeping and finally to our departure were first class in every respect. Breakfast was outstanding, wonderful service and choice.",5,2013,10,29
105,Pleasant Surprise,"The hotel was recommended to us by a classy friend who had lived in London for many years.  We were not sure what to expect because on-line reviews complained about the size of some of the rooms.  We found our room to be impeccably decorated and fastidiously clean.  Every employee we encountered in our three day stay was cheerful, friendly, bright and helpful.  Special requests, such as an ice pack, were fulfilled promptly, sometimes by the time we had made it up the elevator to our room.  The location is marvelous, within walking distance of numerous tourist sites, a tube station and excellent restaurants.  We had so many wonderful experiences there that I could not begin to list them in detail.  The quality and service more than made up for the somewhat diminutive room.",5,2013,10,29
105,A Gem in London.,"Spent 3 nights here on a recent trip to England. It's an elegant (quintessentially British) old building with lots of history located 15 mins by walk from the Buckingham Palace, an excellent location from which to explore London. Our room was cosy and noisefree, though not as large as we are used to in the US. The service couldn't have been better! You could do much worse than this beautiful hotel for your honeymoon :).",5,2013,10,29
105,High quality hotel,"Great hotel, excellent location. fabulous breakfast, nice clean rooms and friendly staff. Afternoon tea was a delightful experience. Chef was kind enough to accommodate my daughter's allergies and even made her a special dessert.",5,2013,10,28
105,perfect,"We have just returned from an over night stay on London to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday, I chose the Chesterfield from the reviews and so pleased I did. The hotel has an old world charm and seems to pride itself on good manners which was a delight, from the doorman to the reception staff all were so very welcoming, we arrranged a cake before hand to be in my daughters room, this was waiting for us and utterly delicious ( made in the hotel kitchens).
There were also cards from the Chesterfield staff and on the afternoon as we returned to our room a knock on the door presented a cupcake with happy birthday on,these little touches are really are welcome and make a memorable time. Also fantastic area to walk round and we strolled to New Bond street for shopping heaven. We had connecting rooms and these were lovely, we all relaxed in our white robes and slippers before we headed out for supper. I will return and for longer next time, thanks again Chesterfield.",5,2013,10,28
105,would return,"Check in to check out was excellent.  Our room was small, but other than that, no complaints.
Comfortable bed. Very clean. We were facing the back and extremely quiet. Partook of afternoon
tea which was well done.  Breakfasts selection, food quality, service, all superior.",5,2013,10,28
105,First time in London!,"The hotel is situated in a tony district, a quick ten minute walk from Buckingham Palace.  While the room was small, it was stylishly decorated and included a built-in settee.  Breakfast was first rate, and I would highly recommend!  Staff was warm and attentive, which made for an easy stay.",5,2013,10,27
105,A wonderful stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"My husband and I spent several nights here in October 2013.  Everything was wonderful, from the moment we checked in, our room, the daily breakfast, the afternoon tea, but most importantly the staff.  We did not encounter one staff member that didn't greet us with a smile or an offer to assist.  Unfortunately, we can't recall everyone by name but those we do are: Engelbert, Tony, Fateau (sp?).  All the staff made our stay so enjoyable.  To the hostess in the dining room, my husband said to tell you, Hello and Goodbye...:-).  We are already planning our return!",5,2013,10,27
105,Amazing hotel in the center of the city,"I was staying in this hotel in September 2013 for a couple of days.It was great!The room was clean and cute,very comfortable bed.The bathroom was also clean and had a lot of space.It was well heated even outside it was raining and cold(only+10).The breakfast was well served with a good choice of fruits and yogurt.
I enjoyed my staying in this hotel and will come back there for sure!",5,2013,10,26
105,"Great service, great location, small room, expensive","The main attraction with this hotel is the great location, but even more so, the great service. I booked this for my wedding anniversary, mentioned this when booking, and we received a card signed by all members of staff, as well as a pair of cupcakes. Little touches like this can make all the difference. The room itself was on the small side, although it was nicely decorated with everything that one would need. The rate was high, but then this is Mayfair and to be expected. ",4,2013,10,23
105,Lovely Accomdations,"This is as excellently located hotel in London's Mayfair district with wonderful service and a full excellent English breakfast is included....I recommend this hotel.
They, also, have a really delicious tea.
      ",4,2013,10,22
105,New Favorite,"Stayed here for 8 nights in September with my daughter and our stay exceeded my expectations.
The location is perfect.The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. Our room was lovely and spotless. The restaurant was good and room service was fast.  And best of all the price was more than reasonable. 
 I wasn't really sure what to expect when I booked and thought we had been spoiled after a week at the Ritz last March but I was wrong, we have been spoiled by the Chesterfield and it has become my first choice in London. In fact we just booked for our next visit this week.",5,2013,10,21
105,I often stay here on business for the paper,Clean rooms nice people serving. Polite 100% on customer service. Not expensive. The food is simple but well prepared and the people serving are sweet and helpful. The turndown service is prompt and they were great at changing towels etc.,5,2013,10,20
105,A lovely hotel in a very nice location .....,"Stayed here in 2012 and had a wonderful time.  The location was perfect - a short walk to the train station, a short cab ride from Harrods :).  There were restaurants in a short walking distance as well.

The rooms are cozy and the bathroom is very decent size.

We had a nightcap each night at the hotel bar ... Katie was so sweet.

While there, take the city bus tour - it is a great way to see the city and you can hop on/off.",5,2013,10,17
105,Great West-end Hotel,"We stayed four nights at the hotel in September and enjoyed the room, service, and breakfast.  The air conditioning worked well and the room was quiet, facing the courtyard.  The location is near a tube station and Shepherd's Market, which has several good restaurants.  We would certainly stay again when visiting London.",5,2013,10,16
105,A lovely break,A friend and I stayed in London following a visit to the Lowry exhibition.  We started with a delicious cream tea; impeccably served and yummy.  In the evening we enjoyed light bites and cocktails which were professionally and cheerfully presented.   All this was enjoyed in the piano bar where the live music just rounded off our entertainment.  A really fun experience.,5,2013,10,16
105,The Chesterfield Experience,"During out recent stay in London we spent two nights at the Chesterfield in Mayfair. Our stay there was a truly unique and very English experience. The staff are made up of an array of personalities from all over the globe. From the doorman with his top hat and tails, to Chris with his array of voices and accents, the friendly and helpful Leticia on the front desk, to the very knowlegeable concierge Darren, they were all very engaging and professional. It is clear that personal touches and professional service are very highly regarded. The room included all of the added extras and luxuries of a hotel of this class. The high tea and the breakfast were both of a very high standard also. Everywhere you look in this hotel you see an incredible eye for detail and perfection. The Chesterfield is not just a hotel stay, it is an experience to be enjoyed and remembered.",5,2013,10,15
105,Wonderful hotel in Mayfair,"I stayed in the hotel from 9/17 until 9/24/13. The staff was wonderful , helpful and  polite. The breakfast each day was first rate.  I had tea on a sunday afternoon and it was beautiful. The room was  one  with 2 twin beds in the corner of the hotel. It was well appointed and the housekeeping staff was helpful when I needed more towels. The location in Mayfair was a short  walk to the Green park tube station and near new Bond street. It  was a wonderful hotel experience and I would stay there again.",5,2013,10,15
105,Quientessential British hotel!,"Wonderful hotel...very welcoming staff, beautiful rooms, great restaurant!  You will feel very well taken care of.  The concierge provides helpful information and reliable recommendations.  The 24 hour bar provides guests a place to gather to share stories of their day.  You will feel right at home as the staff works hard to make everything comfortable.",5,2013,10,15
105,How do you define perfection?  The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"This was our second trip to London and our second stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  I can only say that the word ""perfection"" comes to mind every time I think of the days we have spent there.  From check in to check out, everything is A+ and above and beyond anything we've ever experienced at other hotels.  After having had the most wonderful stay last year for our 20th Anniversary, when we decided to go back to London for our 21st and there was no contest when it came to which hotel to choose.  The Chesterfield Mayfair was the only one we had in mind. We were happily greeted by Leticia at the front desk, who we had met last year as well.  To be remembered is amazing in itself but the warmth in which we were greeted was just so very telling of how wonderful this hotel is.  We had a card from the staff waiting for us for our Anniversary personally signed as well as cards from the General Manager and the Revenue Manager.  Upon arrival to our room, we had cupcakes waiting for us with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate.  We requested the same room we had last year and it was given to us.  From that point on, being treated like a VIP was the order of each and every day.  From the front door staff who were always accommodating and helpful in getting us a cab or directions, to the restaurant staff (special mention to Loris, Antonio and a new man that they have as a wine steward whose name escapes me....I'm sorry!) to Lourdes who works in room service to the fabulous bar staff of Paul, James, Blaine, & Manos along with a fellow who was only there one day as he was going off on holiday to Spain, The Chesterfield Mayfair is THE place to stay in London. John at the piano was wonderful as well.  The recognition on the faces of the staff we had met last year was so special. They remembered us!  After one year and countless guests, they remembered us.  You can't put a price on that!  Of course a special mention to the housekeeping staff who kept our room in tip-top shape.  Our room couldn't have been more clean.  Everything we asked for was sent to us or given to  us.  There was no hesitation!  As I stated earlier, PERFECTION is the word for the Chesterfield Mayfair.  If you've stayed in London before and missed this perfect hotel,  then you only stayed in London.  You didn't have the most wonderful, enjoyable experience ever.  We will return, there is no doubt!  Leaving on Saturday after 9 nights was bittersweet.  It's always good to be home, but we feel we are home at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  We thank each and every one of the staff for the marvelous vacation and the PERFECT stay!  See you next year!",5,2013,10,14
105,3rd Anniversary Trip,"We stayed here for our 3rd anniversary and could not have been happier!  The staff members were great, the breakfast was fantastic, and the location was ideal.  They have the best doorman we have ever met, Cozmin.  He went above and beyond his duties to help us out in time of need including letting us use his phone for 30 minutes in the rain.  

This hotel was definitely on the more expensive end of our budget but it was worth every penny.  We will definitely stay here again if we ever make it back to London.",5,2013,10,13
105,Great Stay!,"My husband and I spent three nights at the Chesterfield, and we were very pleased with all aspects of this fine hotel.  On arrival, the room wasn't quite ready, and we were treated to drinks in the bar while we waited. They had a pianist playing standards, and they served cashews, popcorn and olives with drinks. The room was attractive, clean, quiet and comfortable.  The modern bathroom was clean with polished marble walls and floor. After walking around London, we appreciated the comfy chair in the room.  The in-room coffee and tea were nice, too. When our room safe kept gave an error code, the service technician was up within 5 minutes, and a new safe was installed within 20-25 minutes! We got the package price with breakfast included, and the food was good with many options in the dining room.  The dining room staff was attentive, bringing newspapers over to the table. The front desk guys were friendly and helpful.  The location is great for walking over to Hyde Park.  We had no trouble getting to the tube station (Green Park) and we didn't have to wait for cabs, even in the rain. When we were leaving for the airport, the doorman negotiated a flat rate with a cabbie so we didnt have to take the train, saving us money and time.",5,2013,10,13
105,Spoiled for honeymoon - amazing service,"This is the kind of hotel that makes you feel like a VIP and not a number. 

We were in London for our honeymoon. When I booked, I commented on this and asked that we could hopefully get one bed for the two of us. They went above and beyond. When we booked in, not only did they give us a MAJOR upgrade but we were greeted in the room by congratulations champagne, cupcakes and a lovely card signed by several individual staff of the hotel.

Our room was stunning, the whole hotel seemed to be so unique and tradition, just beautiful. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with everything. 

We ate in the hotel restaurant on our last night and I was feeling very sick to my stomach and they sent everything up for us. There wasn't anything they weren't willing to do.

All in all, I highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for outstanding service and a hotel with some character.",5,2013,10,13
105,"Perfect location, excellent service.","This stay was booked directly through the hotel website. Breakfast was included at no extra cost (as a promotion) and had the option of room delivery, which was a nice touch. The hotel is all about old-world charm and excellent service. For it's cost and location, I don't think you can do any better in Mayfair. As a base to explore the local area from, it's perfect.",5,2013,10,13
105,Service to Knock Your Socks Off,"After a most enjoyable visit in June 2013, this hotel was our automatic choice for another trip in September. When I advised that I would be travelling with a bike (and it's large travel-case) the hotel management was only too accommodating. We were greeted like old friends on arrival, and treated the same way for the duration of our stay. It's perhaps unfair too single out specific staff members, as there are so many staff who guests don't get to meet. That said, my review would be incomplete without commending Cosmin doorman (is that the correct position title?), Fatou in Reception, and concierge the irrepressible Chris. No request is any trouble for these people, and it's all done with a smile. It's also a compliment to General Manager Oliver Raggett to be able to elevate hotel service to this level. We don't profess to be the most travelled couple in the land, but across the various hotels, 2-star to 5-star, we've stayed in we have never encountered service as outstanding as that provided by the Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair.
I recently decided my Tripadvisor reviews should not give 5 stars, as there's always something that can be done better. But this place deserves 5 stars, and I'd give them 6 stars for service quality and consistency.",5,2013,10,11
105,Nice London hotel,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. This is a fine hotel in a very nice area and we enjoyed well-needed rest and sleep at this location. I thought the breakfast was also very good at this hotel. We did not eat there except for a snack in the bar - which was also fine. It is not far from the Green Park tube, and it is also well-located for walking out.",5,2013,10,10
105,Perfect ... Perfect ... Perfect ...,"From the moment I walked through the door every member of the staff, almost intuitively, met every need I had for my entire four day stay. 

In advance of my arrival I spoke to a member of the staff regarding an early check in since my flight landed at 8am from the US. They apologized that they were ""fairly booked"" but would make their best effort. I was quite surprised to enter the hotel at 9:45 to find a room already waiting for me.

Since I've never been to London, I had no idea where anything was ... Tony, a member of the Concierge staff, could not have been more helpful.  For guidance about town to restaurant selections Tony was immensely helpful.  And, he seemed to remember my preferences from one day to the next ... I was wondering if he kept notes!

I was in room 316 ... Nothing splendid about the view ... But that was understood at check in (along with an offer to wait two hours for a similar room with a view), but the furnishings and decor were so nice ... And with the oddities to the physical shape of the room, the layout was quite nice ... Comfortable in every respect. 

The location turned out to be central to all of my business needs ... as well as very well located for many of the most important sites, monuments, and a wide variety of shopping districts. Being an explorer I walked to many of my activities ... With ease thanks to Tony ... I really didn't need the map. 

When I return to London ... Either for business or pleasure, this property will be at the top of my list. My thanks to the entire staff for a very pleasant stay. ",5,2013,10,08
105,A GEM in Mayfair,"This hotel is terrific! Beautifully appointed, impeccable service, and a great location. Sabine at the front desk is so kind and considerate. The concierge goes above and beyond to help the guests. Great breakfast and terrific bar at night. The appointments in the hotel are lovely. The rooms are beautiful. I absolutely would stay at this hotel on any future trips to London. ",5,2013,10,03
105,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful location","We were in town for a wedding celebration party at a venue next to the hotel, so the location couldn't have been any better, but even for a general visitor it's place in the heart of Mayfair means it's easy to get anywhere around the center of London.
The staff were very welcoming on arrival. Although our room wasn't available until the 2pm normal check-in time, the reception staff got everything organized and luggage stored so that we were ready to go once we got back from lunch. They even found out that the wedding party was for us and sent a complementary bottle of champagne to our room, which was very welcome.
The room itself, while a little on the small side, was very well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable (we slept well despite the jet lag!) Breakfast was included in our rate and was fairly substantial, with plenty of choice between cooked or cold buffet.
It's definitely not the cheapest hotel in London, but certainly value for money considering the location and service on offer.",5,2013,10,03
105,Masterclass in service,"My new wife and I recently chose The Chesterfield to host our wedding dinner in The Conservatory and The Jungle Suite to spend our first night as a married couple. 

We spent months scouting various locations before settling on The Chesterfield as it ticked every box on what we were looking for. The service we received from the moment we requested to see the venue until the box of chocolates we received upon our return from our honeymoon as a courtesy was nothing short of first-class throughout. 

We chose The Chesterfield because of its cosy boutique feel paired with its sense of style, tradition and luxury. We hosted a small and intimate but tasteful wedding and wanted a venue that reflected this. The entire staff, especially our events manager Bryony, were absolutely brilliant from start to finish. 

Unlike some of the bigger names we visited, The Chesterfield were very flexible and willing to work around a budget that suited us which was a huge help and really made us feel as though we were wanted guests rather than just customers paying for a service. Bryony was very personable throughout, happy to iron out any small preferences promptly and courteously. 

We used the Library for our pre-dinner drinks, a room that I personally love to bits, full of character and colour. We then had our dinner in the winter garden style Conservatory with one long table decorated with black candelabra’s and flower cubes. It looked amazing. 

We found an ice bucket with champagne and some welcome cakes in our room which was another of the nice touches that makes you feel really appreciated. Our breakfast was plentiful and delicious, the dinner itself was wonderful and so was the service. I really cannot praise The Chesterfield highly enough for making a stressful event run so efficiently, smoothly and professionally. 

We’re already looking forward twelve months to our first anniversary so we can relive a wonderful experience by returning to The Chesterfield for dinner.",5,2013,10,03
105,Perfection in Service,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel on the 7th-11th of September, this was my second time here. As usual, the service was impeccable from the second you step in through the front door. The staff in this hotel are exceptional, so friendly and courteous. All the Red Carnation hotels in London are fantastic, they hold all the top spots on the Trip advisor reviews. 
I was offered a double room on the 7th floor, it had a great view overlooking wonderful Mayfair. The breakfast each morning was amazing, a lot was offered. Room service was very good and the food was quite yummy. I love this place so much, I intend to stay here on my future trips to London. Highly recommended.",5,2013,09,30
105,"Wonderful location, wonderful service","The amenities were first rate. The location allowed us to walk to many of the locations we wanted to see. The staff was friendly and professional. Chris, one of the Concierges was particularly outstanding.",5,2013,09,29
105,"Amazing Service, beautifully appointed rooms, best in London","I just spent one night 27th September 2013,  with my husband for his birthday at Chesterfield.  It was perfect.  This is the first time in many years of 4 and 5 star travel worldwide that I have felt compelled to write on tripadvisor and express how amazing the service and friendliness of the staff were, whom made politeness, individuality, humour and friendliness all seem effortless from the doorman to reception to room service and breakfast staff. Everyone was lovely. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was very elegant and then given a burst of character with 2 quirky and cute cushions on the bed. Simple touch, but so effective.  Our evening commenced with a surprise delivery of delicious complimentary canapés with refreshing iced water as we were getting ready for the theatre. They were so yummy upon our return we had to have a late night snack of more.   The room whilst not the most spacious,but beautiful and had every amenity you could wish for including a stationery tray with post-it notes, stapler, rubber bands etc which to me shows the thoughtfulness in all areas and for leisure as well as business travellers. In my book this was 6 star hotel.  the service from a phone booking with a lovely lady through to the characterful doorman upon leaving, was truly a delight.",5,2013,09,28
105,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here for a couple of nights whilst visiting London. As this was #4 on trip advisor we knew we were in for a treat.
We only booked a double, and knew it was going to be small. The decor was to a high standard, and the fittings were all in good order. Our only criticism would be the shower, the screen was too small, and you tended to cover the complete bathroom in water when having a shower.
Our first morning the hotel experienced a power cut, so only continental breakfasts were available. This was fine, and the hotel was very apologetic, they offered us free coctails.Staying in Mayfair was ideal for us for the trips we had booked, walking distance to 'Buck House', Knightsbridge, Piccadilly etc.
Hotel was quiet, no traffic or late night reveller noise. 
Clean, polite and value for money!",4,2013,09,28
105,Excellent service,"The Chesterfield is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  Rooms are not huge, but a decent size given the location and age of the building.  The biggest plus here are the staff, who are excellent without exception.  Their attention to detail and desire to go the extra mile to help guests really set them apart from so many hotels in the city.
Snacks in the bar were delicious.  Breakfast in the morning was good but not great, probably the only aspect of our stay which I would say could have been improved.  We'll definitely be back.",5,2013,09,20
105,Touch of class,"This was my first time at the Chesterfield but it certainly will not be my last.
The hotel is small and friendly and exuded a degree of old world English charm.
I was only there for one night and although my room was extremely small it had everything I needed and was well appointed. Breakfast was super and I look forward to being back soon.",4,2013,09,20
105,"Our New ""Favorite Hotel"" in London!","We have found a new “favorite hotel” in London! The Chesterfield Mayfair was absolutely lovely. The location is wonderful, the staff is fabulous, and the hotel is beautiful. Although the rooms may be a bit on the small side (to be expected in London), the beds are like sleeping on a cloud, the bathrooms are quite generous in size, and the shower will invigorate even the most travel-weary. We loved all the little extra touches in the room, like the French-press for coffee drinkers, and the biscuits with the tea service. Be sure to make time for a drink (or two, or three) in The Terrace Bar!! Paul, Blain, Edgar, Manos and the rest of the bar staff can mix up a mean cocktail…all served up with a smile and friendly conversation. I’m sure you will love your stay also, beginning with the warm welcome you get from Madeline and the rest of the Front Desk staff. And make sure to stop by the Concierge Desk….Chris and the rest of the Concierge staff can pass along some great insider tips for your London visit. Make sure you book a room with breakfast included…it’s worth it. And although there are lots of nice parks for running nearby, if you like to go to the gym, make sure to ask….they have an agreement with a local gym for their guests.  A bit hard to find the first time, but quite a decent set-up. We can’t wait for our next visit!",5,2013,09,18
105,"Location, Location, lovely- but a bit disappointed","You can walk to almost everything you want to see and the hotel is on a beautiful quiet street with lovely Georgian homes.  There are good restaurants just two blocks away.  The dining room and breakfast were wonderful -- great setting, good food and good service.  The staff members were mostly friendly and helpful.  Wi-Fi in our room was pretty bad - you had to wander around the room to get a signal.  In addition, we were very disappointed with our check-in.  It took approximately 30 minutes.  The gentleman ahead of us had a problem and then our own check-in took way too long.  The reception clerk tried to get me to ""bid"" on how much I was willing to pay to get an upgrade to a junior suite.  I was surprised at this approach in a well regarded hotel. When I reported this to management they apologize and sent us a bottle of champagne - but that doesn't take away from the initial reaction.   Our room was a ""superior king"" -- it had many nice features but was very small.  I can't imagine the size of the basic room.",3,2013,09,17
105,Nice hotel in Mayfair,"I had the chance to stay 3 times in the last three weeks. Staff is always helpful, room are nice and cosy ( i.e. small but manageable ). Breakfast tasty and efficient !

During one of my stay my bathroom flooded the room below. Although i had to change room, i was offered a suite ( which are really really nice by the way) and a bottle of champagne. It seems that the hotel staff always go the extra mile to ensure satisfaction. A pleasure :-)

Fitness center is available to use but 5 min away from the hotel and rather difficult to find. It is an actual fitness center so it is quite nice compare to the usual hotel gym ....",4,2013,09,17
105,"Excellent location,quality accommodation, chaotic breakfast experience","This review follows my second experience of a stay here - as my first (under the mayfair weekend package) was underwhelming and very disappointing. Encouraged to return by a management team who genuinely seemed concerned with the one to one feedback given, we did return.

We are glad we did because the experience 2nd time around was very good - everything our first should have been.

Friendly efficient check-in, beautifully appointed suite, with a well stocked mini bar. Evening turn down service discreet and well executed.

BREAKFAST
Sadly breakfast service has deteriorated even more than our first visit, and continues to be a laughable, chaotic calamity. 

We were politely shown to a table in the conservatory, refreshments and toast order taken were taken.

Table was set with only table cloth, basic cutlery i.e knife and fork and a cup and saucer each.

So the tea and toast arrived and the server rushed away - but we had no milk, sugar, butter, marmalade etc. We waited a few minutes incase he was off to fetch them but in the end I had to leave the table and ask for teaspoons, napkins, milk, sugar, butter and marmalade etc.

A head server handed me a selection of marmalade and jams to take back to the table, when I asked about the butter - he said to take some off the breakfast buffet area ! - I duly tried and there was only flora available. I went back to the same server and explained there was none and I noticed butter pats under their serving area. I asked if I could take one as my toast was now getting stone cold and he offered to bring it over.

When he did I had to ask again for full cutlery and our napkins !!

Finally we were approached by yet another server for our hot breakfast choice and I said I didnt know the choices available as hadnt seen a menu - he duly left and returned with one.

Some time later....... he returned to take our hot breakfast order.

Breakfast arrived - served by yet another server (female this time) and I had to ask for salt and pepper (as it still hadnt not arrived). Whilst the lady was off finding them - I noticed that the bacon was completing missing from my plate.

I pointed this out and she duly apologised and asked what kind I had ordered (back bacon or streaky) and offered to fetch it straight away.

Sadly when she returned, she brought 1 slice of insipid, pale pink, undercooked back bacon and 2 slices of streaky of the same standard. I pointed out to her that I had order back bacon (twice now!!) and still managed to receive streaky bacon. The server said 'I think it is back bacon' - forgive me but if a restaurant server cant identify that difference Im worried.

The server duly took the streaky bacon away and returned with several slices of well cooked back bacon. Apologies were offered again.

To be honest, what should be a restful calm experience is fraught with chaos, error and inefficiency.

The rest of our stay went well - but I refused to take part in the 'fawlty towers eccentric experience of breakfast served in the restaurant so on the 2nd morning we ordered it as room service instead.

Room service breakfast experience was PERFECT !!! - delivered piping hot, and as ordered (with back bacon) - by a smiling professional young lady.

I would highly recommend anyone staying here do the same - unless you like to punish yourself by starting your day setting your own table and becoming irritated before you even start your day.

AFTERNOON TEA
Greeting, polite and professional but the experience was underwhelming. (Only 3 tables occupied in the conservatory and maybe 2 in the main restaurant) when we arrived but the service was still painfully slow. We waited an age to order our tea choice, and waited another age just to receive it.

The selection of sweet and savoury was good and could be replenished if needed.

We had an hour to 'take' afternoon tea, before setting off for our train home and couldnt enjoy alot of food as the service at the start took so long. (They serving staff saw how much was left untouched - and did offer to package up the items we didnt eat) - but we had expected to eat it at a table not on the go like a fast food takeout. So we politely declined.

Maybe other people have a whole afternoon to 'take' afternoon tea but that should be a personal choice NOT a reflection of the slow service, which the Chesterfield Mayfair may well deem as 'unhurried'.

CHECKOUT
polite and professional.

For the room rates, I think they need to seriously look at the restaurant service at breakfast and afternoon tea.
It lets down an otherwise great stay.",3,2013,09,15
105,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"This is a fantastic boutique hotel with wonderful staff.  The staff make you feel like family in a home away from home. We stayed here before & after our Baltic cruise.  Our suite was very well appointed with extra amenities like tea service in the room.  The hotel is quiet & the staff always willing to help you out.  Butlers Restaurant had great meals & the staff paid attention to the little details.  We also ate in  the Terrace Bar & the staff was fabulous there too.  I just can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel, we will definitely stay here again!",5,2013,09,15
105,Better and Better,"This is a repeat stay for me; I enjoy it more and more with each stay.  The beds are comfortable, the rooms well appointed.  Afternoon tea is traditional but not stodgy.  A large selection of black, green and white teas.  I choose Dancing Dragon, how can you ignore such a name??!!  The bonus is a menu offering gluten free and vegan afternoon tea.  The bar is a comfortable spot for a glass of champagne before dinner and to enjoy the piano player.  There is bar food for a quick bite.  The Mayfair location is perfect walking distance to Shepherd's Market restaurants and shops, Bond Street, and Oxford Street. The staff is attentive and at the ready for advice and questions.  I'll be back on my next visit.",5,2013,09,14
105,Lovely Hotel,"This is an ideal hotel to stay at in London. The staff help as much as they can, and they pay attention to the small details that make such a difference. Very enjoyable stay - will almost certainly use it again.",5,2013,09,12
105,It gets better with every stay!,"This is my third stay at the Chesterfield and when in London we always try to stay here if we can, the rooms are always spotlessly clean.

What really impresses me about this hotel is the staff who always go that extra mile to make your stay comfortable and memorable, they are always so welcoming and polite none of that stuffiness you can get with other hotels in London.

The location is fantastic, minutes from Green Park and a short walk to Bond street for shopping.

Also the afternoon tea and the breakfast were also fabulous! Even accommodating my fussy husband who has allergies.

Thanks again Chesterfield and hopefully see you soon.",5,2013,09,10
105,Very Enjoyable,"Had a meal here only. The food was delicious and very well priced. Service was excellent, if a little over the top. Our waiter was fantastic, but I did feel a little uncomfortable at times throughout the meal.
I would recommend.",5,2013,09,09
105,Best Stay in London - Mayfair,"I keep coming back to this authentic London boutique hotel. Superior hospitality be a well-trained staff that ""gets it"". Every room is different and unique, and lavishly appointed. Wonderful breakfast every morning, great bar scene, dinner experience is good. Personal service by the staff makes it a top choice for me, staff is gracious, friendly, and ever-so-helpful. Perfect location - so close to everything!",5,2013,09,08
105,Perfect Small Mayfair Hotel,"We have stayed at the Chesterfield several times over the years and this hotel just keeps getting better. The rooms are well-appointed, very thoughtfully designed and immaculate. The staff, headed by the terrific Oliver Ragget, is very warm and accommodating and sincerely tries to make one's stay memorable.  For us, location is of top priority as we attend the theater every night  and avail ourselves of public transportation to get to diverse areas of the city. The Chesterfield is 5 minutes from the underground and many bus routes, allowing us to get to our destination with ease and as cost efficiently as possible in this expensive city.  Being in Mayfair, it is right by St. James and Green Parks, the Royal Academy, great restaurants and all the fabulous Bond Street shops.  The room rates are very reasonable for what the Chesterfield ultimately delivers. We have had wonderful memories here.",5,2013,09,08
105,OK Hotel if your on a budget,"before I tell you about this hotel I must say that I am comparing it to the Dorchester Hotel which is where I normally stay when in London but they were fully booked. I arrived at the hotel on a Saturday lunchtime with my wife and 2 children, I asked if we could book for afternoon tea and was told they were fully booked, I then went into the empty bar and (located right next to the area they serve afternoon tea and asked if we could be served afternoon tea in this area which they refused to do as well. the breakfast was OK but to  few staff for a busy morning, Now the good bits about the hotel, the rooms were clean and the majority of the staff were nice and polite, as for the bad bits, the rooms were small, the bathroom either smaller, there was a wedding reception going on late into the night which I could hear from my room. To finish off I would say if you can stay at the Dorchester hotel or the like then do if you are on a budget and want an OK hotel in a good location you could do a lot worse",3,2013,09,08
105,Over the top service,"We recently stayed at this hotel while we visited London for the first time.  It is a lovely hotel, with all first class amenities and the prices reflect that.  But we were splurging and we enjoyed it.  

What really sealed the deal however, was the extraordinary service provided by one of the porters.  I believe his name was Peter.  The extendable handle on my husband's suitcase had broken and we took it down to the desk to see if there was any way they could temporarily fix it so that we could get home with it.  They had it for over an hour and returned it with the handle completely up, telling us they'd gotten it to work but it was bent and could not be put down.  When we explained that we'd not be able to fly that way, Peter took it back and said he'd work on it further.  After another 40 minutes, he returned it with some metal bent through the handle allowing it to be pulled up to use, and close almost completely.  That allowed us to get home the next day without trouble.  We were terribly impressed with his efforts. He certainly went out of his way to help us out.",5,2013,09,07
105,A Happy Stay in London,"Our room was called the Music Room  The bed was comfortable and the room clean.  Honestly, I was expecting a tiny room with tiny bathroom, therefore I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room and the bathroom.  The bathtub was awesome with a rain showerhead.  We had tea and dinner, on the day we arrived and both were great experiences with excellent service and great food.  The daily breakfast (I had cooked breakfast from the menu) was yummy and it was a great start to my day, everyday! The location was convenient, too. Compared to our hotels in Paris and Rome on this trip, I would say that this one stands out and the other 2 paled in comparison.  I hope to be able to visit the city again soon and look forward to another great stay at the Chesterfield.",5,2013,09,07
105,Top quality hotel in a perfect location,"Had an over night stay in London for a wedding. On arrival the staff were fantastic and helped my wife and I with our luggage getting us checked very quickly as we were in a rush. Our room was lovely and immaculately presented. Would like to have spent more time in there as it was so comfortable but we were pressed for time. On returning that evening the staff had even turned the bed down for us which was a really nice touch. The breakfast the next morning was excellent, with a huge choice of fresh food. Overall the service and facilities were excellent, friendly and attentive staff and I would recommend this to anyone. In fact I'm hoping to stay there again very soon. Top marks Chesterfield.",5,2013,09,06
105,Stop reviewing this place - needs to be kept a secret!,"My boyfriend booked us in here at the last minute, and has to be the best value for money hotel in London. 
Its a classy and classic hotel with amazing service, after checking in and going to our room they called to check everything was ok, and when we had returned later after going out they had prepared the room with much needed bottles of water : )
Will be staying here every time I now visit London",5,2013,09,05
105,Unhelpful staff,"I had been in this hotel 4 or 5 years ago and I had a good memory of it, so when I planned a trip to London with my mother I choose the Chesterfield Mayfair telling her she was going to have a wonderful time. Unfortunately it wasn’t like that.

At out arrival it was raining a lot, we had four suitcases, but no one came to offer us any kind of help, so we got completely wet because we couldn’t maneuver the suitcases and the umbrellas at the same time. Again no one offered to take our suitcases up to the room or to show us were the lift was. At list we saved the tips.

The room was so small it was hard to move with the suitcases in, but that I expected, I remembered the rooms as little but cozy, now they are little and dusty, and when we opened the closet two moths flied out. When we came back after dinner another moth was happily flying in our room. 

I then noticed that internet wasn’t working in our room, I asked the concierge for three days  to solve the problem, and for three times he smiled at me, like he would have done with a bothering child, saying “no problem”. Obviously nothing happened. 

We had reserved the room for six nights, but after the third one, fed up with the staff attitude and with a room not exactly clean, we left moving to another hotel.",2,2013,09,05
105,A true gem,"From its location in a quiet neighborhood off Berkeley Square, to the lovely spacious room with every conceivable convenience, to the impeccable and gracious service of every single staff member, this hotel will always be at the top of my list of London hotels.  The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Green Park underground station and also within easy walking distance of the shops on Oxford Street. The restaurant provided a lovely breakfast each morning to get us started and the hotel bar was the perfect place to recover from a long day of sightseeing.  The staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly, from suggesting restaurants and making reservations for us to figuring out train stations and schedules.  This hotel is simply splendid in every way.",5,2013,09,04
105,One of London's best kept secrets!!,"Stayed here recently as it was recommended to us by a friend and we were delighted with their suggestion. We were greeted warmly by attentive staff who remained readily available throughout our visit. Our room was clean and spacious - despite accommodating a king size bed which ensured a sound sleep! While we did not eat in the restaurant due to other commitments, we overheard excellent feedback from other guests while enjoying a night cap in the welcoming bar - and the breakfast we enjoyed the following morning confirmed this. Would not hesitate to recommend to others and fully intend to visit again soon.",5,2013,09,03
105,Our favourite in London,"We have stayed at The Chesterfield a number of times over the past few years and, to us, it just gets better and better.   The location is fantastic as all the highlights of Mayfair are on the doorstep, the shopping areas of Bond Street and Oxford Street are a short walk away and there are great restaurants right around the corner or in nearby Shepherd's Market.  The hotel is clean and very comfortable, breakfast is excellent but mostly it is the staff that makes this hotel special.  They are amazing and nothing is too much trouble for them.  We will always use this hotel when we come to London.  On our last visit, our grandchildren enjoyed the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea as they were seeing the show the next day, and that was a big hit with them.",5,2013,09,03
105,Great Hotel,"The room was clean and comfy.
The staff was great and happy to please, we liked the free drinks at the bar every eve. after running all day in London :) and the fresh milk to the room every morning.
Free WiFi, and other small but SO important details made it perfect.
We had a room with no view but to the hotel air condition units and yet we enjoyed.
Thanks.",5,2013,09,03
105,Would not recommend,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in August. We had arranged for the hotel driver to pick us up at Heathrow after our long overnight flight. The driver was not there when we got out of customs and we had to wait for almost 20-30 minutes before he came. When you are paying a premium for this ride, he should have been there!

When we got to the hotel about noon, we were told the room was not ready but that the maids were in there now cleaning it. Since the hotel knew we were arriving early since we used their driver, I think they could have had our room ready then. And then an hour and a half later, the room was finally ready! they were not truthful when at noon they said the room was being cleaned right then- it does not take over an hour to clean a room!

once we were finally in the room, the drain in one of the sinks did not work. We notified the front desk and they said that since it was a Sunday, they could not do anything about it. i feel they should have given us another room since this was early afternoon and other rooms were still available.

last, the shower in the bathroom did not work. at this point we gave up and just used the hand held-awkward but doable.

the location of the hotel is good and breakfast the next morning was good but I would look for another 4 star (?) hotel before staying here again.",3,2013,09,02
105,My personal Favourite,"Travel to London a couple of times a year to stay specifically in Mayfair as I love the area.For many years I walked past The Chesterfield ,it never entered my head to try it,then one particular trip the hotel was doing a special offer on rooms so reluctantly I booked it.......best decision ever made,my all time favourite for service,location,cleanliness and value.Would I return? Without a doubt.Love it!",5,2013,09,02
105,This is a lovely place!,"This an exceptionally charming venue. A large group of us had dinner in their very attractive and comfortable restaurant, with a few more joining us for drinks in the equally pleasant bar afterwards. You feel that every member of the staff wants you to enjoy the experience, and it is one of the few London hotels (our group has graced 43 of them so far!) where you feel immediately at home. Typically, they put their model cat on the end seat as a 14th diner, to save us worrying that we had an 'unlucky' 13 at dinner - it certainly did the trick!
There were a couple of small problems at the start of the meal and a few items from the menu were not available, but I was pleasantly surprised when the bill arrived, to find we had been given, unasked, a generous discount to compensate. 
Two of us had enjoyed a meal here 3 months earlier, with just the same impression. The 'Pre-theatre' dinner is very good value, especially at such a good quality establishment.",5,2013,09,01
105,They should be #1 in London,While this hotel is lovely well decorated comfortable and charming we give it five stars for the staff They are the best we have come across  they will get you tickets to sold out events make reservations make suggestions on things to do. Arrange tours they will do their best to make sure you enjoy your stay The Chesterfield is is the only hotel we will stay at in London ,5,2013,08,30
105,Excellent,Everyone was helpful and really good to us.This hotel is really classy and clean.Rooms were clean.This hotel lies in a nice location.The food was awesome and tea was out of the world.Spending the money was worth it.I will surely go again.,5,2013,08,29
105,Excellent hotel,"My nearly ten-year old daughter and I had an excellent stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The staff were particularly well tuned to the needs of a traveling mother and daughter, and everyone was most helpful.  The rooms were well appointed and always clean, and the hotel was centrally located and in a nice area of town.  The food was quite good and the afternoon tea was extraordinary.  Each of the concierges was very helpful, and entertaining to boot.  I would definitely stay here again.  While expensive, it was worth it.",5,2013,08,27
105,A First Class Hotel pricing it`s self out of the market !,"On entering the Chesterfield Hotel you have an immediately and wonderful feeling of a first class hotel, elegant surroundings and friendly staff. The problem starts when having  pre dinner drinks  sat in a comfortable and relaxing lounge bar area. I was to have my first experience of just how classy this hotel was when I ordered drinks for my wife and two friends. After ordering and drinking our second round of drinks before dinner I ask for the bill, now I don`t mind paying a reasonable price for any drinks but this beat the record--£11 for a blended whisky, £3.75 coke and £4.75 for coffee. Next came Dinner  at the Hotel in their elegant and beautiful restaurant with attentive staff. Now although I am a visiting northerner I expect value for money and not a rip off. Food was cooked and presented as ordered but again the final bill spoilt the occasion with Soup at £9, Roast of the day £19.50, Calves Liver at £22.50 and Ice Cream £8.50.
Now I realize this is London and the Mayfair area and I expect to pay slightly over the odds but I feel this is a excellent hotel with first class staff that has lost it`s way. Will I stay here again, only if they adjust these exorbitant prices.",3,2013,08,25

105,Warm welcome and wonderful stay!,"I've just returned home from a stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was my second time to stay in this hotel and after a thoroughly enjoyable first experience, I was very much looking forward to returning. I wasn't disappointed.

The Charlie afternoon tea was undoubtedly the highlight of my stay. The themed treats were delicious from a blueberry macaroon to sumptuous golden egg! They were beautifully presented and the staff couldn't have been more friendly or attentive. 

It's the staff that will bring me back to this hotel again. From first point of contact to check out, there's an attention to detail , personal touches that put the Chesterfield above the rest.",5,2013,08,22
105,Absolutely wonderful place to stay,"We came to stay here for a friends wedding, a charming hotel that had character. We couldn't fault anything, the staff were very professional and welcoming, the rooms were very well decorated and spacious, the food was of great standard and lots of little quirks that made our stay here special. Would recommended it if you are in the area. ",5,2013,08,22
105,We enjoyed our stay,"The hotel was charming, very English and very comfortable. Excellent and very helpful staff. Easy walk to major attractions, lovely quiet neighborhood. Would stay there again without hesitation. English breakfast was typical and quite good. We spent a long weekend pausing on the way from USA to Athens. Great way to break up the trip.",5,2013,08,20
105,Charming!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield earlier this year and it was very pleasant.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  The service was phenomenal, the bar was very quaint and relaxing. The afternoon tea was delightful and the food in the restaurant was delicious.  
We will definitely stay again... We stayed in a suite, it was very comfortable and spacious.",5,2013,08,19
105,A wonderful English Experience!,"Most personable staff I have ever encountered in a hotel. They all seem to love their jobs and it shows! The location is perfect; just off the busy streets, but still very central.  Their restaurant is also excellent... We had a lovely afternoon tea and wonderful breakfasts during our stay. The bar is very inviting and the bar staff is also outstanding... They treated me like a regular from the neighborhood. Cheers!",5,2013,08,19
105,Another fantastic stay,Myself and three other family members have stayed at the Chesterfield every August for the last 5  years.  We travel up to London for sightseeing and the Theatre.  We always stay at the Chesterfield for its amazing service.  The rooms are always spotless and the amenities in the room always plentiful.  If you need anything one phone call always puts any problem right.  We have the pre theatre dinner and always find the variety and service in the restaurant top notch.  Breakfast is always varied and plentiful.  The staff are friendly and never pass you by without a smile and a word.  We would always recommend this hotel and would never stay anywhere else.,5,2013,08,18
105,Little things make a huge difference,"We've just come back from another stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London now. Our first stop was last year for a joint wedding anniversary and birthday. This year we were up for a couple of Proms concerts at about the same time as last year. We had been out for the evening and when we got back to our room there were cakes and cards in commemoration of our birthday and anniversary, even though we hadn't said anything, The Chesterfield Family had remembered and loads of them had sign both cards. It was a very special treat and meant a great deal,. These trips in August are going to be a firm family tradition from now on. 
On the more mundane side of reviews, the Classic Double room we had was very comfortable, huge bed, lovely linen, smashing bathroom and clean clean clean. Couldn't ask for more. Food, as ever, was lovely there. The smoked salmon eggs Benedict for breakfast sets you up for a day wandering around London.
So, if you're wondering whether to go or not, it's simple, go! They're lovely friendly people, great location, good food. comfy rooms. What's not to like.
See you next year guys!",5,2013,08,18
105,Easily the first choice for London!,"Our recent adventure to London could not have been more perfect - and the Chesterfield was the icing on the cake. Centrally located just off Berkeley Square within easy walking of all the tourist spots around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. The fashionable areas in and around Mayfair are right on the doorstep. 
The hotel has the ambience of a traditional London gentlemans club with plenty of areas to read and rest. Not surprisingly there are an abundance of Chesterfield sofas to collapse into! 
We found the rooms to be of an excellent standard, clean and well furnished.
The staff are exemplary, very attentive and genuinely friendly.
To relax in the bar, listening to (well played) piano music in the evenings was a rare treat, after long days 'doing' the sights and sounds of London town!
We hope to return just as soon as we have regained the energy needed to 'see' London, and obviously where else would anyone consider staying but at the Chesterfield Hotel!",5,2013,08,17
105,English tradition at its best,"My wife and I spent our tenth wedding anniversary with the Chesterfield. 
I had viewed the venue beforehand and was shown round by a very helpfull lady named Fatou. 
Upon arriving a few weeks later I was recognised and my wife and I were given a very warm welcome. 
I made arrangements for some special things to be done to the room for the occasion which were
 carried out to the letter, plus some personal touches that the staff did without asking. 
In summary, outstanding service by friendly, professional staff from Reception to Housekeeping. 
Beautiful venue. Excellent location. 
Will go again. 😊 Thank you. 
",5,2013,08,17
105,We would go back to London just so we could stay at Chesterfield again!,"The title says it all!

My niece and I stayed for four nights and the service, the atmosphere, and the location could not have been better. We try to avoid chains, including very upscale ones when we travel for pleasure and try for places which reflect ""local"". 

The Chesterfield is ""english"" and its staff is delightful. My husband, unknown to me had called and shared with them that I had a severe allergy attack before I left for Europe. The manager spoke to me right after arrival, told me he was aware, and that I could rest assured they would be ready to help anytime, night or weekend. The location is about as central as you could want and being next to Green Park makes strolls really enjoyable. But, far enough from the frenzy that is Oxford street, Picadilly, and Trafalgar. Do NOT miss High Tea!",5,2013,08,16
105,Perfect!!!,This hotel is outstanding in every way.  The location is great.  The room was comfortable and well-appointed.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The breakfasts were delicious and the service was excellent.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,2013,08,14
105,Look no Further-This is It,"This Mayfair Neighborhood Hotel is just several blocks off Piccadilly but seems miles away from the hustle of Piccadilly Street and Hyde Park . Set among Multi Million dollar homes ,Embassies ,Rolls Royces ,Bentlys Etc. it is the ideal spot to stay in London.. A quick left out the front ,another left on Queen Street and you are facing one of the most interesting areas of London , Sheppards Market. The market has several entertwining streets . Great for people watching while sipping a beverage . You would never have to go anywhere else to eat and the prices are right . Try Breakfast at the Caffe IN ,the Stuffed Croissant and Full English Breakfast less the Beans are very good along with Fresh Fruit,Croissant with Jam ,Granola Etc. Dinners at the Caffe IN ,Sofras ,The Little Square ,the Italian Restaurant and the two Fish and Chips pubs were excellent.
           The Green Park Tube (Piccadilly Line) and Piccadilly Street can be accesed down the road beside the Caffe IN or several other streets . At night we found the Tube to be safe . We found the walk down Berkley Street to left past Berkley Square toward Charles to be the most populated at night after leaving the Tube.
            Take a walk down Charles Street to Audley Street and you may pass a couple of folks on your way to a  very nice retail area . Walk down Piccadilly for a block in August and you may pass 100 people.
           The price of a cab ride from Paddington Station after the ride on the Heathrow Express was 13 pounds .
           Would not stay anywhere else in London ,found this Hotel to be everything we wanted in a unique area unlike anywhere else we saw in London  during our 9 Days. The staff are very people friendly . Look no Further this is it.",5,2013,08,13
105,6 days is not enough at the Chesterfield Mayfair!,"I stayed at the Chesterfield July 15th -21st. I was on vacation with my mother. It being her first time out of the U.S. I was a little worried about the hotel accommodations. Everything we hear over here in the States about accommodations in Europe is not always great. That does not apply here. The Chesterfield is absolutely the best. The location is great. Green Park Underground station is right around the corner. Green Park is also very close. There are a lot of different stores and places to eat in the neighborhood. Paddington train station is about 10-15 minutes away. Fortnum and Mason is very close! I had no trouble getting around London from the hotel. It was perfect!  The service was incredible. The entire staff was just so helpful and nice. The men that worked the doors and helped with the bags were great and very helpful. The concierge was incredible. I had a ticket to Highclere Castle but I did not know how to get there. He gave me the best directions and I had no trouble at all getting there and back. The front desk personnel were absolutely great. Very nice. Butlers Restaurant was just great. The entire staff was very nice and wonderful. The breakfast was incredible. The rooms were very nice. We stayed in a twin room. Even though the rooms are a little smaller than over here in the States there was still plenty of room. Robes  and slippers were nice. The television and internet/ Wi-Fi worked great. The beds were nice. No complaints. I slept very good. The turndown service is just beautiful. It is a must. The bathroom was incredible. I will never forget the first time I turned on the shower. The water came out of the shower ceiling like it was raining! I took three showers a day! A very good sized bathroom, I`m a big man and I had good room. What I liked best was everything. The staff was great and the hotel exactly what I wanted. The Tea Room is the best. We had afternoon tea and it was first class great! It is a must!  It`s been three weeks since I`ve stayed there. I still cannot find anything negative to say about this hotel. If this hotel is on your list or your considering it. This is the hotel you want. Absolutely!",5,2013,08,11
105,4 days in london,the chesterfield is an amazing property. the staff is first rate. we had many air problems getting to london but once we arrived all was forgotten. Hani was waiting for us outside and welcomed us to the hotel. the rooms were great with a very comfortable bed. breakfast was outstanding and the concierge very helpful. restaurant suggestions were spot on. the location is perfect. in walking distance to most areas and very close to the tube. only place to stay in london.,5,2013,08,10
105,excellent personnel,"Spent 3 nights mid-week in late July at hotel.  Very much an old British feel.   Sorry we missed the library hidden on the ground floor, but we spotted the large traditional room the last day.  It pays to mosey around a hotel the first day and  check things out.  The breakfast/dining areas are lovely. There  is a great buffet available in the morning besides the usual full English breakfast. There is an elevator, but we used the staircase alone.  The hotel is quiet and in a perfect location, just off Berkeley Square, and close to Curzon Street...names right out of an early 19th century romantic novel.   Hyde Park (Rotten Row, Serpentine), Green Park, and St James Park are very close walking distance as is the Green Park Underground station.  We were able to walk the perimeter of the parks to access most anything we desired to see this visit--Kensington Palace, Harrod's,  Buckingham, Westminister.  Or for the brave, you can rent bicycles at Barclay's new bicycle 'docking' stations  and stay out of the streets nearly entirely.   The hotel is about 10 minutes by cab from Paddington Underground/train station if you are coming by Express from Heathrow.
The neighborhood contains several lebanese restaurants which are mostly excellent,  as well as a few good italian restaurants.  It feels safe and upper end.   The staff is very friendly and cooperative.  The rooms are small, although you can upgrade,  but adequate if you don't plan to spend your vacation inside. Robes, wi-fi, hair dryer, all the usual at this level. The beds are perfect (for me that means not too soft).  Blankets are  offered to  those of us who can't stand 50 lb duvets.  Someday, someone must explain this hotel 'phenomenon' to me!)
Hotel rates vary with occupancy, just like airlines.  We got a good deal with Expedia earlier in the year, nearly half the going rate.   We would go here again.",5,2013,08,09
105,Excellent hotel!,"We spent four nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair while vacationing(me and my college age granddaughter). It is a lovely place to stay! The location is a quick walk to Piccadilly Circus, Covent Garden, theaters, and all of the shops and attractions. There were also many restaurants, pubs, and small shops nearby.  The hotel staff was extremely friendly,helpful and welcoming especially the concierge, Maddie. They really made our stay memorable. We enjoyed afternoon tea and dinner during our stay, both far exceeded our expectations. I would definitely recommend staying here while in London.",5,2013,08,08
105,"Great Location, Great Hotel","This is my favorite hotel any time we travel to London.  Its Mayfair location makes getting around London a snap since it is so close to several Tube stations, parks and other attractions.  Many can be visited with just a pleasant walk.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the staff is the friendliest in London.  Be sure to check out the car show rooms around Berkeley Square!",5,2013,08,08
105,Great Hotel!,"My family of four (two teenagers) spent five nights at The Chesterfield while vacationing in London and it was a terrific stay.  The hotel is perfectly located if you want get a true feeling for London, away from all the tourists, while still being centrally located to the sights.  The hotel is just a few blocks from the Green Park tube station where you can catch the piccadilly and jubilee lines.  The Hotel itself was fantastic.  The staff could not do enough for you -- helpful, always had smiles on their faces, and very responsive.  The decor is ""old school"" English, which adds to the fun, and the rooms were great -- not huge, but not too small either.  We requested two rooms next to each other, and everything was perfectly in order when we arrived.  Just a great experience.   A few other notes -- the hotel is just a couple blocks to the east of Hyde Park (went for great jogs every morning), as well as a neat little courtyard area (Sheppard's Way i think) where you can find several english pubs and a variety of small ethnic restaurants (italian, lebanese, mexican/polish).  We highly recommend it.",5,2013,08,07
105,Out of Africa,"Based on three things we booked a three night stay in a suite: 1. Tripadvisor rating. 2., Red Carnation brand 3. Location. As we hoped the hotel lives up expectation and justifies its rating position near top dog position of hotels in London.

We stayed in the Africa Suite which like most rooms in older buildings in London isn't large by any means. Its quite small for a suite really. Plenty big as a room. The suite has space for a two seater couch, a table and two chairs plus a separate walk-in closet for clothes and the safe. There is a Large wall mounted plasma and a six foot wide comfortable bed. Furnishings and extras all what you would expect at this level - Including a couple of branded umbrellas for the one time it rained. Air con excellent. But for some reason there is an overhead fan that only works when the lights are on. 

The bathroom has a separate shower which has good water pressure, but if you are a large person it is a very tight fit! The jacuzzi bath also has a shower, so that might suit some larger people.

Breakfast and lunch/dinner are available in Butler's, the hotel restaurant which is beautifully decorated. Food and service absolutely first class as it was everywhere in the hotel.

A further terrace (indoor) bar and a reading room completed the places we visited during our stay.

the hotel position a 100 yards off Berkely Square in a fairly quiet street and just 5 mins comfortable walk to Green Park underground station and the park opposite. Then it will take you another 5 mins walk through the park to Buckingham Palace in case the Queen has invited you for tea. The hotel is also within a comfortable 10 mins walk of many quality restaurants.

If you want a bit of old English class and lovely surroundings this hotel is perfect.",5,2013,08,07
105,A Real Gem with Elegant Charm,"This boutique hotel in Mayfair is the best of what London can offer.  It is an elegant, friendly and well positioned hotel with all. Comforts a traveller could want.  From the front desk staff who are genuinely welcoming to the breakfast team, everyone seems centered on the guests positive experience.  Excellent, strong wifi and a terrific breakfast.
Ideal for business travelers and couples or mature families.  Having spent many a night in high prices, gritty London hotels where everything is extra (wifi, breakfast etc) this was a real find.",5,2013,08,07
105,Great location & nice rooms,"Ideally located in central London, just a short stroll to green park. 
Traditional hotel with really comfy beds. 
Reasonably priced drinks in bar (atmosphere is quite gentleman's club). 
Strangely had 2 bathrooms to the one bedroom!? One shower/ loo & one bath / loo, nice though!
Helpful staff",5,2013,08,04
105,"One of the best in Europe, not just London!","I can highly recommend the Chesterfield based on my five night stay in July 2013.  I would recommend a double room, as my travel agent accidentally booked a single and it was rather small, especially for a five night stay.  
The hotel is impeccably clean, the toiletries are replenished each day, the bathroom shower head is the best I've seen in a European hotel (large rain shower with excellent water pressure), the concierge was very helpful and always willing to aid with directions, and all procedures such as check in and check out ran smoothly with quick attention.  The hotel's location is also excellent--it's tucked away on a side street in Mayfair, so it's not noisy at all but just less than a ten minute walk from the Green Park tube station.  I always felt safe walking to and from the hotel at any time day or night as well. Tamarind, a top-notch Indian restaurant, is right around the corner, which is another bonus.  As far as the room, the bed was very comfortable (ask for synthetic bedding if you require--it's not a problem at all), there was plenty of closet space and hangers, and the hotel even provides complimentary office supplies in the desk (highlighter, scissors, tape--things you would never pack but do find handy).  Breakfast was also tasty and they don't charge a tray or service fee if you dine in your room.  All in all, you can tell the management truly cares about maintaining a strong business by putting costomers and their comfort first.  A little side note: I had to ship some things home because I bought too many books and the concierge took everything without question and boxed and mailed my things, which arrived before I returned home a week later.  It's service like this that keeps people coming back; a hotel plays a vital role for me in my first experiences in a new place, and I'm happy to report that the Chesterfield and it's staff made a wonderful first and last impression.

105,The Chesterfield Mayfair London,We were treated with so much respect. All the staff most helpful. We felt like we re very important people. The food was delicious. I loved the doorbell for our room.Also received a daily paper The staff was also most helpful in suggesting places to go and how to get there. The location of this hotel was excellent We were within walking distance for many places.,5,2013,08,01
105,"Great food, location and hotel","Upon pulling up to the Chesterfield, you are greeted by a very friendly doorman in a top hat. You walk in and the lobby almost overtakes you immediately, it's stunning to say the least. Staff is very helpful and friendly.  The food is outstanding. You must go for afternoon tea. The rooms are a tad small, but that is expected in most European hotels. The whole place is super clean. I would recommend this place to anyone. ",5,2013,07,31
105,Fantastic Stay,"Great hotel in a very convenient location. Staff was very helpful in confirming tours. Breakfast included in lovely restaurant. Room was typical European size but with very nice decor, great AC and marble bathroom with heated floor. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and even Harrods and Westminster Abbey if you like walking. A great choice for our stay in London.",5,2013,07,30
105,Central and great service,"The hotel is based just off the Green Park tube station and a short walk from Buckingham Palace. So wonderrfully central. In general the service in the hotel was excellent. The rooms was a little small but probable fairly normal for London. We were offered a King size bed which I now think probably means a bigger suite, for an additional 60 pounds a evening. My only disappointment was that you can have breakfast in the conservancy (which was the room that was the deciding factor when we booked). We managed to have the high tea in this room which is well worth trying. Although the breakfast room has a lovely few of the English Union 'gardens' we didn't really rate the buffet so ate breakfast out - there are plenty of options just up the road. We didn't try their dinners but enjoyed the Footrunner pub just up the road. The doormen and conceirge services are excellent and the hotel gave us vouchers for a gym up the road. An excellent choice would go there again.",4,2013,07,30
105,The BEST Hotel,"I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. From the minute my daughter and I walked in through the door to the moment we walked out (wish we hadn't had to leave to be honest) we were treated like royalty. On our arrival we were greeted at reception and asked if we would like to leave our suitcase until we returned from our shopping trip and when we got back it had been taken up to our room. We've stayed in some lovely hotels and some not so lovely but this was by far the BEST hotel we've been to. The walls were suede and the bed had a faux fur throw on and dainty cushions. The bathroom was small but perfectly formed with all the pampering creams and shampoos you could wish for and two fat cosy bathrobes hanging on the door. We made ourselves a lovely pot of tea and sat and took it all in. We had booked into the Butler restaurant and had the pre-theatre menu and it was amazing. We were made to feel very special and the service was spot on, no one was constantly coming to ask if your food was ok because they already knew it would be. In the evening we had drinks in the Terrace Bar and had a pianist playing in the background. We slept soundly as there was no noise what so ever from anywhere which meant a great deal to me as we always seem to get a noisy neighbour. In the morning we went down for a delicious breakfast and then sadly we had to pack and leave, even as we stood to check out we were asked if we'd like to leave our case there and collect it later but it would have meant backing up on ourselves or we would have done so.
I would tell everyone to visit this hotel and expect to be wowed as we were and we loved it and will defiantly be back again and again, thank you to every one there for making our stay special 😊",5,2013,07,28
105,Excellent hotel in great location.,"The hotel itself is in a great location in a quiet location in Mayfair, but within a short walking distance of shops, pubs and restaurants.
Our room was perfect with everything needed for a 3 night stay including comfy bed, nice shower, aircon, TV etc.
However the thing which was really good about the hotel is the staff who were all excellent. From a cheery ""good morning"" from the cleaning staff, the bar staff, to the front desk staff, everything felt just right, very professional but with a real friendly feel about it. Special mention to the concierge people who were always more than helpful in offering advice and even made the effort to speak Italian with my girlfriend when they found out she couldn't speak English!
",5,2013,07,28
105,Depends on your priorities,"Let's start with the positives because they are important.  The location is fantastic.  There is a reason why Mayfair sits where it does on the English monopoly board.  The hotel precinct is quiet (for inner London) and elegant.  Berkley Square (no nightingales unfortunately) is just around the corner.  So is the Shepherd Market, which has a great range of eateries and other stuff a visitor might need.  Green Park, St James Park the West End theatres and Soho are all handy.  The tube station and buses are within comfortable range by foot.  There may be better locations for a stay in London but I have have not found one in my half dozen or so visits.  The second positive is that it is not unreasonably expensive.  However, the frustrating thing is that it could be so much better.  The rooms are variable with respect to layout and wifi.  We had to move rooms because the wifi kept dropping out.  Very frustrating and not helped when the person they sent to look into it insisted they never have wifi problems.  This was plainly wrong as the person who moved us assured us that the wifi was much better on this floor (which it was).  The first room also had a layout problem that meant that if a person was working at the desk it was impossible for another person to get from one side of the room to the other because the bed was so close to the desk.  There is also lack of attention to detail.  When we arrived they asked if we wanted a morning newspaper.  We said yes and it duly arrived the next morning.  However, there was no newspaper after we changed rooms - presumably the request had not been noted against the new room.  No big deal - especially when the newspaper they provide is The Independent which has sunk to unimaginable depths.  However, not what you would expect of a first rate boutique hotel.  There is also a certain anonymity about the place.  Staff are friendly and helpful enough but we were there 6 nights and never got the sense of being recognised in a personal way.  The decor is period and in keeping with the locale but rather dull.   The bar is dark and downright depressing.  So, if you want a very convenient and comfortable enough hotel that does not cost an arm and a leg and are not too fussed about detail or ambience, this one will do the job.  However, if wifi is important to you, when booking make this very clear so you get a room where the wifi is strong.  If on the other hand you want a special hotel experience and plan to spend a fair amount of time in your room and in the hotel, you can probably do much better - especially if you are willing to spend more.",4,2013,07,26
105,great place.like a country inn in the city,"everything was wonderful.the staff was really helpful;sent an email and then called my wife who was arriving separately.room(we had the chesterfield suite)was very large and beautifully decorated.very quiet.no outside or through the wall noise.the shower was a little small.had to stand outside to set the water temp.excellent breakfast.
the concierge was very helpful with advise on dining,confirming resevations and making suggestions on where and how to do things.
took underground from heathrow to green park station and then short walk.not a great idea if you arrive early on a weekday,because train loaded with work commuters.also,at green park there are no escalators so you have to carry bags up and down stairs.
shepards market around corner had many nice pubs and shops'
greigs restaurant is very good for english food,but service slow.
took city tours dinner cruise.best event of the trip.very good meal and we saw everything you.d want to see along the river.
did city bus tour starting at green park station.can get on and off.got off to do the eye.when you buy your ticket,they tell you when you can get in line to board.ignore this and get in line right away.nobody even checked our tickets except to check us in.",5,2013,07,24
105,A wonderful Experience!,"In celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary and our first visit to London, I chose this hotel because of the high rating on Tripadvisor , We were not disappointed! I found the location to be absolutely perfect amongst beautiful residential townhomes and small restaurants.  It was walking distance to shops, parks, restaurants, bars and many of the attractions.  The staff were very friendly, their concierge service assisted me in making restaurant reservation in advance. The bar makes a superb Mojito!! The Tea Service at the hotel was special treat.  The Chesterfield Jr. Suite was beautifully appointed and spacious.  We found the whole experience in London absolutely perfect!",5,2013,07,23
105,Little pearl,"You can not do better in terms of location if you want to be near the shopping, the parks or the business district of Hedge Funds (Mayfair)
Staff is very friendly, bar is well staffed, bar tenders are knowledgable and make you feel special. Breakfast is all you would expect and restaurant was also good enough. You get free wifi and can probably negotiate an upgrade if you are not there at the peak holiday season. My room was (after upgrading) big enough, but i have not seen their regular single room, so no comment here. Basically, all you need without any hassle. You get what you pay for. Clearly, as always, you can get a cheaper place but I doubt there are a lot of better hotels for what you pay here.",5,2013,07,23
105,Fabulous experience at chesterfield Mayfair!,"Absolutely wonderful property.  Central location, near Green Park tube (a big plus) made it easy and quick to get around London.  the neighborhood is very very nice and we were able to walk to Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Hyde Park, and Horse Guards Parade. I can't say enough of the staff. They were welcoming, helpful, and to a person focused on fully satisfying their customers needs.  To that point, my daughter felt ill on  the day after we arrived and when the staff found out they sent up a get well card and a small plate of fruit.  Where do you see that kind of service?  Just the Chesterfield Mayfair, that's where.  The lobby and common areas are immaculate and while typically sized for London, the two rooms we had were exceedingly nice...great attention to detail throughout.  If you're going to London, this is the place to stay.",5,2013,07,21
105,A very nice hotel,"We arrived early around 10.30 but how helpful were the reception/check in staff, absolutely the hotel was busy but they found a room for us straight away and with a smile. The room 404 was excellent a good king, very quiet and cool (with London unusually basking in 30C).
Breakfast was included and the dining room was very pleasant as was the breakfast choice, no
rush and bustle, a real character hotel. Very pleasant and helpful staff.  The excellent Italian restaurant 'Murano' is just around the corner and nearby Shepherds Market with many pubs and
good restaurants including Lebanese. The hotel is really well situated for shopping and all the sites. All in all we liked this traditional and friendly well run hotel.",5,2013,07,20
105,Great hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for 3 nights with another couple.  While the rooms vary in quality they appear to be undergoing a refurbishment since the pictures on the website don't match up to what our rooms looked like.  In any event, our rooms were fine although somewhat small.  One was located on the 4th floor and another on the 5th.  Both were reasonably quiet with little road noise or noise from other guests.  Given the prices for London accommodation, the prices at The Chesterfield Mayfair are quite reasonable for the quality of the rooms and the service.
The beds are very comfortable with luxurious linens.  The bathrooms are quite nice with excellent toiletries.  We liked the special touches of a red carnation in the bathrooms.  The free Wifi service is a tremendous treat!
While the husbands went out to a nearby pub, my sister and I enjoyed afternoon tea.  The waiter was wonderful and he kept bringing more sandwiches and more scones until we eventually had to say ""stop"".  The quality of the food at tea and breakfast was excellent.
Finally, the location is superb.  The hotel is just steps away from a number of restaurants in Shepherds Market and is walking distance to just about anything in central London. The Green Park tube station is about 1 minute walk away.  You really cannot do better for the price!",5,2013,07,19
105,Do your research please,"We had booked for a week after a long haul flight hoping for a quiet hotel to catch our breath (after reading the reviews)
So disappointing as this was one of the most uncomfortable week's sleeping.... While the staff and breakfast are faultless, the old rooms are creaky and not well maintained.  We booked a luxury room,and then  even upgraded to an executive but the noise from others walking round above you or and the one way strret traffic  outside just doesn't stop.  On the Saturday night we were right next to an Indian wedding venue, felt like we were in the dance floor the music was that loud. And that was out of the hotels control.....   We did appreciate the Manager discounting our upgrade on check out and their concern was genuine but the damage was done.  We couldn't wait to leave and would not recommend this hotel to travellers  wanting a quiet relaxing stay.  ( and the place was full of loud Americans) ",3,2013,07,18
105,London,"Once again we stayed at the Chesterfield and I would stay again and recommend to friends. Just a couple of comments - we found the room to be a in need of a refit with exhaust stains around the air conditioning vent and the some of the furniture being in need of reupholstering. In the restaurant I had reserved a lunch for 5 which went off very well and my guests commented very favourably. Personally, I ordered the duo of salmon as a starter and found both the Irish and the Scottish to be 'rubbery' and possibly past their due dates. One or the other, I cannot remember which, was extremely salty.
Other than this a great stay.",4,2013,07,18
105,We were treated like the royal family on our visit,"We loved our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair!  The location is superb and the accommodations were outstanding.  The traditional full breakfast was a great start to our day and afternoon tea was a highlight for this group from the US.  The service, from bellman to wait staff, was beyond attentive and friendly.",5,2013,07,17
105,They really know the meaning of customer care,A fabulous 'old world' hotel with staff who pay attention to every aspect of your stay to make sure that you feel special.  Nothing is too much trouble for them and everything is done in a way that makes you feel that this conversation/this request is the most important one in their day.  Wow!  Wonderful stay!  Very expensive but worth it.,5,2013,07,17
105,American Family/London Boutique Hotel,"We just returned from a 2 week trip to the UK (our 4th) and wrapped up our visit with a 3 night stay at The Chesterfield.  Wow.  Lovely hotel with extreme attention to detail.  I had booked a junior suite and called the day we were to check in to inquire about a second room for our teenage son (love him dearly, but after 2 weeks on the road we all needed a little space!).  They come through with a room and upgraded me and my husband to the Phillippe Suite/room 229.  It was spacious and just perfect....bed was so comfortable, separate sitting room, lots of closet space and Elemis spa products.  The air conditioning was in great working order (not always the case in London hotels).  The location in Mayfair was very good, walked to several restaurants (loved the Automat on Dover Street) and great shopping on Bond street.  Breakfast in the restaurant was really good as well.  Plus...free WiFi in public spaces and your room...no password required!  We love going to London and this is now my hotel of choice.",5,2013,07,14
105,A magical place,"I have never felt a sincere concern or caring for a guest at any hotel as I have experienced in the Chesterfield. Due to unforeseen circumstances I had to find a hotel and though fully booked, they made room for me and did not take advantage of my situation by increasing the daily rate.

The daily cookie refills, fresh milk for tea or coffee, bottled water refills, and internet are all complimentary which makes it much easier to know the total cost of your stay - NO hidden extras. If you get the breakfast rate, the choice of hot breakfast is extensive, and delicious. The juices exceptional, they even serve fresh squeezed beetroot juice !

The hotel is sincerely pet friendly. My cat had to join me for my stay and waiting for her was a litter box, litter, food bowl AND a scratching post ! The housekeeping team was so gracious that they came to introduce themselves to her to make sure she would not be frightened during her stay.

I have never been in a hotel where ANY request is addressed immediately no matter what the request is.  There is no waiting or having to call back. The concierge team provides great information and is full of ideas of places to go and things to do.

Overall the service at the hotel was exceptional, much more so than any other five star hotel in Europe, let alone London. 

I will recommend this hotel to all of my friends and colleagues and will make sure my corporate travel agency is aware of the exceptional service as this secret is worth spreading.",5,2013,07,14
105,My Best Hotel Experience Ever,"This hotel will always be the most special place I have ever stayed. I feel like all of the staff in the hotel are my friends as they ensure that every tiny detail is taken care of with the sole goal of making you happy.

I am fortunate to travel for work around the world and have stayed at many 5 star properties in Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe, and the middle east, but NONE have the attention to detail and the quality of service that the Chesterfield exudes.

A stay at the Chesterfield will ensure that you start or end your day in a good mood, the interaction with any member of staff, their sincere desire to address any request immediately and exceeding your expectations is a very refreshing experience when you are staying away from home.

The hotel is in a perfect location to enjoy London with everything nearby, great restaurants, the best shopping (Knightsbridge and Oxford Street are each minutes away), the parks (green park and Hyde park) Buckingham Palace.  

The restaurant is beautiful and the menu broad and tempting, starting with a fantastic choice for hot breakfast in the morning.

Honestly, the BEST hotel experience ever.",5,2013,07,14
105,A fine hotel for the location and price,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for two nights - excellent value, lovely spot in Mayfair, you really can't get much better, since it's far enough away from the CBD to be quiet in the evenings, but close enough to attack the shops (New Bond Street etc.). The rooms a small-ish (typical of London, so not a criticism really), but clean, bed is comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. Service very friendly (unusual for many London hotels). Recommended.",5,2013,07,14
105,Lovely tea in a delightful setting,"My daughter-in-law, two grown grandchildren and I enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea at the Chesterfield.  The food was plentiful and delicious.  There were a variety of tasty sandwiches, scones that melted in your mouth with cream and strawberry jam and other sweets.  We opted for the champagne which was excellent.  Everyone enjoyed their tea.  The setting was like an English garden even though it was indoors.  We had found the service in other tea places to be somewhat snooty.  Not so here!  From the moment we walked in the door until we left we were greeted cordially and made to feel very welcome.  The service was outstanding.  Afternoon tea at the Chesterfield does not seem to be well known but it is worth seeking it out for a charming afternoon.",5,2013,07,11
105,Excellent start to finish!,"I cannot commend the staff enough for the 5star service we received.

We got married next door in Dartmouth House and we had alot of guests staying at the hotel. Everyone commented how brilliant the staff were at the hotel from the doormen to the reception staff all the way to the bar staff. We had a brilliant wedding day and the Chesterfield could not have been more helpful....even repairing the middle button on my waistcoat during the wedding breakfast......nothing was too much to ask.

Also such a lovely touch to have all the staff sign a congratulations card

Thanks again to everyone.",5,2013,07,11

105,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"We really liked - the helpful and friendly staff; the location (easy walk to the tube and or Oxford Street and Piccadilly); the quality of the room and it's fittings; sleep quality; the mandatory(for us anyhow) G&T in the lounge before dinner.
Can't think of any dislikes. 
Tip - take a walk down into Shepherd Market. Entry through an archway (unmarked as I recall) takes you into a warren of narrow streets with cafes and restaurants, couple of pubs.",5,2013,07,11
105,great place!,"It's a  nice little place and if you are used to staying in a huge hotel it's a nice change. The people working there are very nice
and helpful and the food is very good, also they have tea time from 1:30pm to 5:30pm. I had a very nice stay!

105,This boutique hotel is a five star Jewel,"I recently stayed at the Chesterfield for five nights. It was incredible.  The service and hotel staff was fantastic.  Everyone was so very nice and humorous.  The physical property was of five star  character. All employees were  very helpful and performed their duties with excellence.  I have travelled to, many many  different places and feel that I can state this fact truthfully, Again, if you are ever in London you must experience the pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield Hotel.Sincerely, colette",5,2013,07,09
105,birthday tea at The Chesterfield,"My family visited the restaurant of this hotel to celebrate my mother's 90th birthday. Everything about this experience was fantastic, starting with the very attentive and friendly staff and not least regarding the excellent quality of the food served for tea.
We were all highly impressed and believe that although this is an expensive place it is well worth the money for a special occasion.
The Chesterfield is a model of a hotel that is smart and luxurious but avoids being snooty. 
I will most definitely being going back",5,2013,07,08
105,Great Hotel,"My husband and I just returned from our trip to London & Paris. We spent there nights at this charming hotel with our 13 year old granddaughter. The service is beyond excellent, the staff is attentive without being intrusive. The location is excellent walking distant to buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, St.James Park and the green park underground.  We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,07,08
105,Exceptionally welcoming,"Stayed 2 nights. Very friendly welcome on arrival and throughout our stay. Wonderful location for Green Park tube station which we wanted as we were going to watch the tennis at Wimbledon. All the comforts as previous reviewers have stated. Loved the addition of fresh red carnation in bathroom. Continental breakfast at £9.50 disappointed us as we were allowed a piece  of fruit, but not the prepared fruit salad! We ate breakfast out on the second morning because of that. Loads of breakfast cafes quite close by of better value. We would stay again though as we enjoyed the quaintness of the hotel, the friendly welcome and the location.",4,2013,07,06
105,Charming hotel in a great location,"We spent five wonderful nights in The Chesterfield Mayfair and enjoyed every minute.  Located on a lovely quiet street, it is in a brilliant location:  an easy walk to shops, Hyde Park, St James Park and Buckingham Palace, and 5 minutes walk to Green Park Station, a junction for 3 underground lines.  The neighbourhood was very pleasant and we felt quite safe walking back to the hotel late at night.

The hotel is charming and just as you'd imagine a small luxury hotel on Mayfair should be.  The staff at the front desk couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful.  We would particularly like to compliment the young Australian lady who was just delightful.  Our room on the top (7th) floor was beautifully appointed and very quiet, with a wonderfully comfortable bed and pillows.  I had read in some reviews that the rooms are on the small side.  Ours was absolutely fine and I'd much prefer to stay in a hotel with character and warmth than in a modern chain hotel with larger rooms.  If I had to be critical of something, the shower demonstrated the vagaries of old London plumbing, making it difficult to adjust the temperature, but at least it was hot.  The dining room was elegant and inviting, with chesterfield furniture, dozens of beautiful white orchids and its walls decorated with many old paintings, all featuring dogs.  Breakfasts were fabulous and set us up for the day.

For excellent staff, ambience and comfort, and for such easy access to all we wished to see and experience in London, it was perfect.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay and it fulfilled a childhood dream...a hotel on Mayfair.",5,2013,07,05
105,Champagne and Service!,Tonight I had an amazing experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair. I came to the bar for a drink and stayed for what was the best champagne I have ever had with food to match. To top it all off I was provided with fantastic service from all the staff especially Antoine and Paul. A great venue which I highly recommend to all.,5,2013,07,04
105,Awesome Hotel,"Perfect hotel if you want to be in a quiet area of London. Close to Green station, Green Park and St. James Park.  Excellent service all around from all the staff.  Even had sandwiches available in the lounge if you couldn't find a suitable place after a show.  We misjudged the time pubs/restaurants close (10:30-11:00pm Monday thru to Sunday)",5,2013,07,04
105,Excellent Hotel,"We just returned from our tip to London, staying at the Chesterfield for six nights. The service was excellent and the staff very welcoming as well as helpful. They made our stay very special and left no detail unattended.The hotel is very close to Shepard's Market, a great place to eat. It's also close to the tube and shopping. When we return to London, we will return to this hotel.",5,2013,07,03
105,Hit the spot,"Well-located, quiet street, close to services, restaurants, fancy shopping areas, green park tube station. Clean. Updated bath. Fast wireless. Attentive service. Nice big breakfast room. Good continental breakfast or hot breakfast if desired.",5,2013,07,01
105,Sheer Delight,"We stayed for 5 nights and this Hotel ticked all the boxes. 
We had an issue when we booked in January as the web page was misleading and I had thought that I had booked a room that included breakfast, when I received my confirmation, I contacted the hotel to advise that the web page was misleading and I received an immediate reply from the Reservations Manager that she agreed that the web page was misleading and that they would give me breakfast included (£22 per person)as part of my booked rate.
 Now that is what I call very good customer relations, problem solved quickly and without any fuss.
Hotel staff are very friendly and very helpful.
Breakfasts are superb with a great choice.
Be aware though that the Restaurant can get very busy at weekends so better either going early or very late, the management did advise us of this in advance so we were well prepared.
Rooms are well appointed and the pillows are probably the most comfortable I have ever encountered.

We will definitely return to this hotel, well worth the money for the great central location.",5,2013,07,01
105,They had thought of everything,"We stayed two nights on a weekend break and from the minute we entered the hotel, the friendly staff did everything to make our stay special.  Nothing was too much trouble .  We had been upgraded to a beautiful room, with every thought going into what we would need.  We would certainly choose this hotel if we go to London again plus delicious food what more could you want.",5,2013,06,30
105,London at its best!,"I booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and the 4 nights we stayed were perfect. I had booked 2 rooms for my family of 4; on arrival, Sabine, front desk, rearranged the room allocation to ensure our children were next door...very thoughtful.  Rooms were beautiful, comfortable and spotless. Breakfast had a huge selection with good quality food.  Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and respectful. Chris at front desk organized theatre tickets with no fuss and he was a joy to see each morning.  
The location is central and within walking distance to London's attractions.
Thank you Chesterfield for making our London stay complete.  Would recommend without a doubt and hope to return.",5,2013,06,29
105,A Wonderful Friendly Hotel - Peter Australia,"I think our taxi driver said it all. "" Everyone I pick up or deliver to the Chesterfield tell me it is a wonderful place to stay "". Throughout the hotel staff were so helpful and friendly with all our queries. Our room was small but very well appointed. The little extra touches made our few days  in London memorable. We chose the Hotel from their internet page and we were not disappointed. i cannot say that for other internet bookings we have made in he past. If you are very tall, like me, I would advise you to inform them when booking to ensure a suitable size room.",5,2013,06,28
105,Charming Hotel in Ideal Location,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a lovely hotel in the heart of Mayfair, on a quiet street but close to upscale shopping and art galleries.  The hotel is well managed, and all of the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful.  The overall atmosphere is traditional, but not at all snobby.  The lobby and common areas are nicely decorated and comfortable.
The room sizes vary, but are often small.  The junior suite I was allocated was about the size one would expect for a standard room, but with two small bathrooms (one with shower only, one with tub only), and two closets.  The room was decorated so as to make the best use of the limited space, such as by mounting the flat-screened TV on the wall.  The king size bed was actually two twin beds pushed together (an odd arrangement that I have seen at a number of first class British hotels). Seating, desk space and storage space were adequate, and the lighting was fine.  The decor was traditional and soothing.  The curtains effectively kept out the light.  Housekeeping was impeccable.  Bottled water was provided free of charge, as were coffee-making facilities.  Room service was prompt and the food was excellent.
Overall, I had an enjoyable stay at this charming hotel.",4,2013,06,27
105,Afternoon Tea,"A friend & I went for the ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" themed afternon tea a few weeks ago. All I can say is that it was absolutely delicious! Our waiter Antonio was more than helpful & knew the menu inside out; I described the type of tea I wanted & he was able to recommend an exact tea for my taste. Can't say enough - Delicious!",5,2013,06,26
105,Rare Experience with Housekeeping,"To make a long story short, housekeeping staff tampered with and destroyed some of my personal belongings (makeup).  I reported this and took the damaged items to management.  One item was replaced and General Manager, Mr. Raggett, corresponded with me to advise that this matter was fully looked into and he offered a complementary upgrade on our next stay. 

We stayed in the Mayfair Junior Suite #521 which was quite small and cramped with too much furniture.  For what we paid and it's size, it is not a suite at all.  We asked that 2 large chairs and one large table be removed.  This was done immediately and afterwards, we were very comfortable as it was so much easier to navigate around the bed and other areas of the room.  There was another large piece of furniture that housed the minibar, but the rest of the table had no function.  The hotel should consider removing this to make room for the chairs that comprise the ""sitting area"".  The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors.  In the evening, the hallway and room, despite being on the 5th floor, smell like delicious grilled steak - obviously a vent issue.

I concur with several other TA positive comments.  The hotel is wonderfully located in a beautiful part of London - Mayfair.  There is excellent shopping and dining all around (there are two excellent restaurants a block away right around the corner that I have reviewed separately).  We very much enjoyed the breakfast as it was included in our stay and we were able to order to our hearts content.  We also enjoyed the bar which is small and cozy.  The staff are friendly.",4,2013,06,25
105,London Experience,"spent a week at the chesterfield with my wife.  had stayed previously at sister hotel and someone recommended this one.  great location with good service from staff were primary positives.  room was nice, but typical to london was small.  only negative was noise from plumbing, which unfortunately was fairly constant.  obviously, the very good rating overall meant the positives outweighed the negative, but would have been nice to not have the negative.",4,2013,06,23
105,A comfortable oasis of calm!,We've just returned from our first stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  We were only there for one night but the experience was good and we would definitely return.  Staff are all very friendly.  Rooms clean and bed was really comfortable.  Breakfast was great too.  We had a drink in the bar on Saturday afternoon while we were waiting to depart and afternoon tea looked very popular.  The hotel is in an interesting area and very accessible for tourist areas and Green Park tube station is only a short walk away.  Even though our stay was short we felt really at home there and settled in quickly.,5,2013,06,23
105,Fabulous hotel tucked on a quiet street in London,"I picked the Chesterfield based on reviews on Trip Advisor and Travel+Leisure and I was not disappointed. Service from everyone, from front desk to room service to housekeeping to the bar and restaurant was top notch. My husband's birthday was during our stay and he received a card signed by the staff, a cupcake and a bottle of champagne, a wonderful touch. Our room was beautiful, with a king bed, writing desk, lots of storage and large bath. Staff was always helpful and patient when we needed directions. We had afternoon tea served by Antonio, a delight! It was so good we went back again. Food from the bar and room service was delicious. I can't think of a negative about the Chesterfield. If you want a chain hotel experience, go to a Hilton. If you want to feel like you're staying at a private club, try The Chesterfield.",5,2013,06,22
105,Still THE best choice,"I have reviewed this hotel before, it hasn't changed.  Every time we go to London, we contemplate where to stay - should we stay in a different hotel in another area of the city for a change?  Then we say...why? Mayfair and the Chesterfield are the tops, you can't beat that.  So back we went last week at the end of our cruise for several nights.  As always, the hotel and especially the staff, were wonderful   Our favorite room was ready and waiting, friends who arrived to meet with us just before we got there had been made comfortable while waiting.  It was busy, but everyone felt well taken care of.  Looking forward to going back next year at the end of another cruise.  By the way, the traffic in London isn't any better.",5,2013,06,20
105,First class!,"My wife and I chose to enjoy our anniversary at The Chesterfield and we could not have made a better decision! The staff were fantastic, such personal touches as an anniversary card signed by themselves were delightful and touching, their polite and friendly manner, even if the face of our blundering incompetence at various junctures, was present throughout and they were always eager to help with anything that might be taxing or vexing us. In short, the hotel was beautiful and its staff brilliant! We will most certainly be returning and I would recommend it to anyone in search of relaxing luxury and a quintessentially British experience. Oh and the Afternoon Tea served is the best we've every had anywhere in the world; certainly a must!",5,2013,06,19
105,Relaxing finish to a great holiday,"The Chesterfield was our last night stay in London, after 5 weeks touring of France, Italy, Spain, and the South of England. It was easy to find from the Tube - Green Park Station a 5 min walk.  The cleanliness of our room was second to none - I have never had drinking glasses that sparkled like the ones in our room.  We have stayed in a lot of hotels and this is by far the best we have come across. It was the little extras that just appeared like:  The Bed being turned back.
the Hydrating Facial Mist on the Pillow and message from Management welcoming us.  From the time we walked in we were made to feel special.  The staff were helpful very friendly and very knowledgeable. Dinner at Butlers was a great experience, the food excellent and the wine superb.  All in all an excellent choice to stay and we will return.",5,2013,06,17
105,Chesterfield Hotel - Mayfair,"This is the second time we have stayed in the Chesterfield Hotel.  It's a most comfortable Hotel & the staff can't do enough for you, they make you feel at home and always very helpful. 
We had afternoon tea and was most enjoyable.
Ideal area to stay in as everything is within walking distant.
We would recommend this hotel & hope to return to the hotel.",5,2013,06,17
105,Intimate and Charming Hotel in Mayfair,"We booked a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair around a British Isles cruise, staying 4 nights prior to the cruise and 1 night after the cruise based on reviews here on Tripadvisor.  This is a marvelous hotel, rich in decor and with service one can only dream about here in the USA.  Every aspect of our stay was perfect.  From the delicious breakfast to the comfortable decor in our room, to the extraordinary tea service and the club-like atmosphere of the bar for an evening nightcap, it was everything one could expect in a luxury property.   The location provides easy access to the Green Park tube, easy walking to Picadilly, Buckingham Palace, The Mall and Hyde Park.  This is now our absolute preferred hotel for a London visit.",5,2013,06,16
105,Good Stay,Located in central Mayfair 5-10 mins walk from Green Park tube.  Welcome and check in was very good.  Room was decorated in a rather “chintz” style but was well equipped.  Breakfast was fine; afternoon tea was great but would be expensive if not part of your package.  Check out their offers – we went on the Mayfair Weekend deal which allows a very late checkout on your last day.,4,2013,06,16
105,Central and comfortable accomodation in London,"Central and comfortable accomodation in London Mayfair. It is not busy, friendly, authentic english 4stars hotel. Very good breakfast. Nice hotel resaurant Butlers - the Dover Sole realy best in the city! There is no fitness and swimming pool.",5,2013,06,13
105,Afternoon Tea at The Chesterfield Hotel,"Last week, I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea in the Chesterfield Hotel. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my favourite children’s movies, so it was great to take a trip down memory lane with the themed treats. I particularly loved the golden chocolate eggs, yum! The staff discovered that I was celebrating a special occasion and treated me like royalty. A memorable afternoon!",5,2013,06,12
105,A Wonderful Stay in a Wonderful Place,"While every single employee here is marvelous, a few stood out to me that I absolutely adored. Silra was our waitress and was so sweet, in fact we talked with her for at least 30 minutes. Also. Chris, and everyone at the concierge desk was superb!  High Tea here is scrumptious and they are now having a delicious twist with the Charley and the Chocolate Factory show playing nearby! My daughter and I have stayed for four nights and enjoyed every minute.  Also, everything is so thought out and you can tell their main goal is to only please you. I would highly recommend this hotel, and I am known too be very picky about my accommodations.",5,2013,06,11
105,Haven of peace and good manners,"This is my favorite hotel in London and we have stayed there twice and will stay again. It is extremely comfortable, laid back but also very classy and utterly without pretensions. The staff have always been extremely kind and helpful. It rather like having a second family although I know that sounds cheesy. I look upon it with great affection.",5,2013,06,08
105,Perfect location and the best service in the world!,"My daughter and I planned a second trip to London and knew we wanted to stay at the Chesterfield again.  The hotel is perfectly located in Mayfair -- just a couple of blocks from the Green Park tube station.  It is within easy walking distance of Green Park and Buckingham Palace.  The hotel is charming and the rooms are well appointed.  Comfortable.  The staff is top-notch -- always, always, always helpful and accommodating.  They will do anything and everything to make sure your stay is perfect.  This trip was to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday.  I let the staff know this when I made the reservation and they presented her with a lovely cupcake and birthday wish.  I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2013,06,06
105,Comfortable and charming,"My husband and I stay here from time to time and it is good to see that the hotel is as comfortable and charming as ever.  This time we had the Jungle Suite, which has a leopard print carpet and pictures of leopards and elephants on the walls.  All very comfortable and quiet, and a good size for a hotel room in this part of London.  

We had a club sandwich in the bar when we arrived at lunchtime, which was very good, and the Scottish chap who runs the bar is a delight.  The service is always very good and they all seem very cheerful.  There always seem to be lots of Americans and they cope with them very well too (sit in the lobby for 10 minutes and you'll hear some delightful questions asked of the reception team).  

The breakfast is lovely too and the daily smoothie is a great start to the day if you're feeling at all fragile after a night on the town.  If you don't like the feeling of being 'processed' at the big luxury hotels and would rather stay somewhere with more character in a great location, this is a wonderful hotel.",5,2013,06,06
105,Impressive,"This was the first time to visit in London, so everything was new to us. We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in total in this travel. This hotel was recommended by our friend, who is from there. Her recommendation was correct. The hotel is located in the area called Mayfair, that has many stores and restaurant and pubs. We stayed in exective junior suite, because we were 3 people. The room has king bed also they prepare extra single bed, that was good quality. The room decor was beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast that was included in our plan was nice, because we could have in our room. All the staffs in the hotel was very helpful and kind. There is the lounge bar which also provide tea, and afternoon tea. Unfortunatly we missed afternoon tea during our stay, but tea with their cookies was delicious. If we have oppotunity to go to London, we definitely back to this hotel again.",5,2013,06,05
105,Unsurpassed,"Have stayed on a number of occasions at this ""home from home"" and at other carnation hotels in London and Dorset and find the quality of service and welcome from the minute you arrive, consistently high every time. 
The attention to detail especially when planning a private birthday celebration to an afternoon tea is superb. The quality and the quantity of the afternoon tea with excellent service from the wonderful staff has been hard to find a runner up so far from other establishments in the capital. 
The rooms and suites are  beautifully furnished with comfortable beds and linen. Bathrooms are roomy with lovely toiletries, the housekeeping is tops. 
Dining  in Butlers restaurant is not to be missed and breakfasts are exceptional with the quality of choice and quantity. Alternatively, ordering food from the bar menu is excellent with brilliant service from the friendly and efficient bar staff who never fail to keep you well supplied with nibbles. 
Looking forward to return visit soon.",5,2013,06,02
105,First time to London,"Considering the price of the hotel and the locale, felt like we were in a good location and the accommodations were good.  I like to try new places, but if I had to stay in the area again and the price beat the other hotels, I would book a room.",4,2013,06,01
105,Charlie and the Chesterfield Afternoon Tea,"We attended this hotel for the Charlie and the Chesterfield afternoon tea. What a delight! Our waiter was amazing and really made a difference to the tea. The warm scones were to die for, as was my gorgeous flowering tea, I will definitely return as this is the best afternoon tea I have had as of yet!",5,2013,05,31
105,"Great hotel, great loaction","I have been going to this hotel for many years. You cannot get a better location - it is a five minute walk from Green Park tube and fifteen minutes from Regent St and Oxford St. The various pubs and restaurants in Shepherd Market are around the corner! The rooms are a good size for London and well appointed. Small details in the rooms, such as scissors stapler etc add a nice touch.The service throughout the hotel is excellent. The bar has a pianist every evening and is a great place to set a as a meeting spot. It is open late and so is good for a nightcap. I tend not to eat in hotels so I cannot comment on the restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel and will come back to it time and again.",5,2013,05,31
105,Chesterfield Mayfair - A Heaven In The Eye!,"I visited the Chesterfield Mayfair for several days in May and I have never had a lovelier stay anywhere in London! The staff was genuinely  friendly, gracious and made me feel special. I wish all hotels would choose such caring staff. The rooms were absolutely beautiful and the attention to detail was impeccable; the four poster bed was blissful for sleep as well (I stayed in the gorgeous Music Room). In addition, don't miss breakfast in the Butler's Restaurant for a sublime full English breakfast. 

 The Afternoon Tea was scrumptious and served in the sunny and well-appointed conservatory; true elegance. and, when I need a bit of quiet time, I retreated to the library with its rich, floor to ceiling wood paneling and warm British decor. I sank into the leather sofa and lost myself in a Sherlock Holmes story; I couldn't have picked a better setting.

If you wish a truly classic and enchanting British hotel with graceful decor and perfectly located  in central London, stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel!",5,2013,05,29
105,"Excellent hotel, great location in Mayfair","My wife (Devi) stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel for an entire week during the Easter Holidays.

She was in room #225, a cozy little Victorian, thankfully the bathrooms were upgraded to the 21st century...and it was absolutely lovely!

The hotel is situated in an awesome location in Mayfair & very close to the tube. The staff provided unbelievable service & was such a great experience.

Kudos to Alice & Lourdes (such lovely ladies in room service), Chris at Concierge & Fatou at Reception for making my stay so stress-free & memorable.

Highly recommend....and we'll stay here the next time we visit London!",5,2013,05,29
105,outstanding in every respect,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from 11 May to 18 May, 2013.  I am 68 and travel alone  for leisure about 50 days a year, cities mostly: London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Boston.  

The Chesterfield Mayfair exceeded my expectations in virtually every respect.  The staff cannot do enough for you, the attention to detail is exacting and yet unobtrusive.  The public areas for a hotel of modest size are large and welcoming.  I loved having a pianist every evening in the bar area from 6 until about 11.  And each pianist was very good.  Little things like the ""nibbles"" are as good as you'd serve in your own home for an important party. 
 My  room was large, the bed nice and firm.  And the little cupcake beautifully presented with a ""farewell"" written across the plate in syrup,  a great example of detail.  

The location cannot be beat.  Its two blocks from Green Park in Mayfair but on a quiet street.  And only a block away is a hidden area of wonderful pubs and ethnic restaurants....Indian, French, Iranian, Lebanese, Italian.  others....nice places, white table cloth, professional service.

I heartily recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Even if it's on the high end of your budget ( And it was for me) you will not regret staying there.",5,2013,05,28
105,More than afternoon tea,"The Chesterfield is famous for its splendid afternoon teas, but there is more to the hotel than that. The rooms are slightly bigger than average for London and are beautifully appointed, right down to having a few basic office items -- stapler, scissors, etc -- in a drawer. The breakfast is sumptuous and the bar lively. But be wary when the hotel is full -- staff at breakfast can leave you waiting a bit long. Generally, though, staff are very friendly and efficient. Our morning newspaper wasn't delivered one day, and I mentioned it casually to the front desk. As I turned away a staff member handed me a paper. He'd heard me and had instantly gone to get one. You pay for all this, of course, but it IS a luxury hotel.",5,2013,05,27
105,Nice Hotel; Excellent Service,"Had a two night stay at the Chesterfield in March. The hotel was nice. Good, central location in London. My room was a single, but, had plenty of space. The room was well decorated and pretty. Comfortable bed and decent sized bathroom, not cramped at all. The service is the standout feature of the hotel. The doorman knew who I was when I got out if the taxi before checking in. In addition to the doorman, the front desk personnel and concierge staff were great. All asked about plans and offered help with reservations and suggestions for activities and restaurants. They were especially helpful with an early checkout. They pointed out a service delay on the express train to the airport. Will definitely stay here again on my next London trip! ",5,2013,05,27
105,21st Birthday Afternoon Tea,"For my 21st Birthday, my Mum and I attended The Chesterfield Mayfair for afternoon tea. From the moment we arrived we felt well looked after and treated almost like royalty. We were shown to our seats and given the menu. Once we had chosen, we were served efficiently and although there were many other people in the restaurant; the service did not reflect this. The service was efficient and attentive. The sandwiches were delightful (and we did ask for more); however we were saving ourselves for the cakes. The cakes were beautifully presented and tasted divine (my favourite being the scones and the carrot cake). After we had completed our tea and waiting for the bill, I was surprised by 6 waiters singing Happy Birthday to me and presenting me with a birthday cake and a small bouquet of flowers; it was a thoughtful and lovely touch to the day. I would like to give thanks to everyone who helped to make it a wonderful birthday tea and would especially like to mention Tomas and Mantoa for their impeccable service.",5,2013,05,27
105,Afternoon Teas,"Excellent selection of goodies and teas. Very pleasant surroundings and fantastic and unhurried service. Everyone was so friendly and relaxed.
Definatly worth the money. We will be going back there again.",5,2013,05,27
105,Afternoon Tea,"I visited the hotel today for afternoon tea and it was utterly faultless from start to finish. 
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble and they took care of us brilliantly from start to finish. 
We had a good selection of sandwiches, cakes, and scones, which were replenished by our lovely waiter after he had found out which ones we liked the best. 
The atmosphere was brilliant, with a live pianist playing throughout, and the room we ate in was light and airy, whilst remaining traditional and in keeping with the tone of the hotel. 
A spectacularly enjoyable afternoon, i cannot stress enough how great the staff are, and how they add to what is already an unforgettable experience. 
Will definately be visiting again. 
",5,2013,05,25
105,Brilliant afternoon tea,"We celebrated my mother-in-law's Birthday here, today! and it was so fantastic I had to write the review immediately! I have enjoyed afternoon tea at over 15 top London venues, so was anxious to put the Chesterfield to the test. We had a warm welcome, superb service, fantastic food and a wonderful atmosphere. Our waiter Bogdan was very friendly and had the professional balance right between prompt service and allowing us to enjoy our experience. The Charlie & the Chocolate Factory theme was great and this was the first tea I was able to enjoy fully gluten-free! I am slightly intolerant and really appreciated the option - this alone puts the Chesterfield above any other London tea venue I've visited in the past few years. There was a selection of 5 types of sandwiches (even for gluten-free), and scones came complete with clotted cream and homemade jam. But the best were the cakes - very inventive and delicious (example: chocolate and popcorn macaroon). Bogan also ensured my mother-in-law had a truly memorable Birthday - they sang Happy Birthday while giving her a posey of red carnations, an individual lighted Birthday cupcake and a bag of sweets. There was even a choice of bubbly - brut, rose or blanc de blancs! And the options for tea were superb -  I usually choose jasmine and I actually had 2 to select from here. Overall, I highly recommend afternoon tea - it could not have been a better experience!!!",5,2013,05,25
105,Luxury in London,"My husband and I were given this hotel  for a night from our children to celebrate our golden anniversary and what a lovely experience we had. Our room "" The Music Room "" was beautiful the bathroom was amazing, breakfast was great and we would have loved to stay longer. I am sure wewill try and go back at a later date and stay longer. I would recommend this hotel to all as it is very central for everything in London.",5,2013,05,25
105,Awesome! ,Me and my friend went for afternoon tea. It was really amazing! The hotel is beautiful the staff really friendly and helpful! The food was really really good! They even asked what our favorites were and got those to take home with us! (As we were to stuffed from all the deliciousness) Well worth the £35. ,5,2013,05,24
105,Perfect City Base,"Having heard good things about the hotel both from friends and reviews on Trip Advisor I selected The Chesterfield as the perfect base for a weekend away in London with my father and brother. The staff are friendly and provide excellent customer service without over-doing it on the niceties. When we checked in Sylvain the Receptionist was extremely friendly and made us feel at ease after what had been a reasonably exciting day out at the football. Tony, one of the Concierge, welcomed us like we were old friends and was congratulative to us given our tes victory that day! 

After resting in the room for a while we decided on venturing out to Chinatown for a bit to eat, Letitia on reception was able to provide not only some excellent directions (we would have no doubt been lost otherwise) but also some tips on places to go. 

All in all it was an excellent weekend away and we will most certainly be staying there again should we get the opportunity to!",5,2013,05,24
105,Great Location,Superb location in Mayfair.  Great boutique hotel with excellent service.  The bar/restaurant was wonderful and the library was a hidden treasure.  Rooms are small but beautifully decorated.  you will not be disappointed.,4,2013,05,21
105,Perfect Location,"This was our sixth visit, and as always we enjoyed the quality of the staff – from the front desk to the restaurants; the wonderful live music in the bar at the end of an evening, and the comfort of the rooms which while small, have been up-dated.  

The only thing hampering our love of this perfectly located hotel is that its prices keep creeping up to the point where we will have to consider alternative locations which provide a bit more room and charge perhaps a bit less to rest our heads.",4,2013,05,21
105,"Wonderful, just wonderful","We experienced one rude waitress at the breakfast the first day, but other than that, the service here is inpecible! The room was absolutely wonderful too, and the breakfast was all you can ask for. The gym isn't very big, but it got what you need for a complete workout. And the location is perfect, short way to shopping, busses and the underground.",5,2013,05,21
105,Afternoon Tea,"We have been here many times for Afternoon Tea and I would not go any where else. The welcome you get before you are even inside the hotel is wonderful and then once you are in you feel part of the family.  The food and service is fabulous we would like to thank Ronaldo and Mantao for their service on Sunday and luved the ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory experience"".  Thank you once again and will be back soon.

Shelagh and Derek Bruce",5,2013,05,21
105,excellent all round stay,"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel that we were ""home"".  The room was comfortable, the staff were professional and the English Breakfast and Afternonn Tea were the best we have had anywhere in London.  Congratulations and thank you to the entire Chestterfield staff.",5,2013,05,18
105,Perfect Stay in Luxury,"This was our first trip to London. We booked our trip through Costco travel and they highly recommended this hotel. From when we walked in to the door we were greeted with a warm welcome, given room choices and the staff made sure we had everything we needed. Our room had just been redecorated and it was lovely. Very Clean, plush thick towels, heated bathroom floor, complimentary water and treats in our room and a very beautiful comfy bed. We managed to lock ourselves out of our safe. The staff quickly came up and fixed the issue with a smile. We had a Traditional Afternoon Tea at the Hotel which was very tasty but made even better by our server,Mantao, by her recommendations. The bar was lovely and had a pianist that played every night we stopped in. Our daily breakfast had some excellent choices from Scottish Eggs Benedict to Porridge with Whiskey. If you have a chance to make a reservation at the Chesterfield you will be very fortunate as we were. Tally Ho,",5,2013,05,16
105,Farewell Afternoon Tea,"So what do you do when your friend is moving to Singapore? Well of course you do something very English and what better than afternoon tea at The Chesterfield in Mayfair. Attentive service, fabulous pastries and a Singapore Sling thrown in as well as a very personal farewell cake and teddy - a very English send off. Highly recommend a visit and request the conservatory.",5,2013,05,15
105,Luxury without the pomposity,"Stayed here on Saturday night as a birthday treat for my husband.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Although a little on the small side the room was very comfy, the bed superbly comfortable, attention to detail excellent.  Ideal location, very quiet, easily walkable to the Dominion theatre and to the Embankment, fabulous walk through Green Park and Horseguards' Parade on Sunday morning.  Was a bit miffed that we were kept waiting for over an hour for our room to be ready although to compensate we were given complimentary drinks.  The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff made up for this.  Breakfast was good but could have been a little warmer, I am sure if we had mentioned this at the time it would have been addressed.  No hesitation to recommend and book again.",5,2013,05,14
105,Lovely lovely,"We went for afternoon tea. Really lovely place and really helpful and friendly staff. Montao particularly went out of her way to make sure we had a lovely time. We had as much tea, sandwiches and cake as we could possibly eat and then took away what we couldn't.  We had a baby with us which was no problem for them at all. When the baby needed changing thy gave us a hotel room so we'd be more comfortable. Nice bunch!",5,2013,05,14
105,Lovely afternoon tea!!,"Had afternoon tea here and it was the best i have had.  The staff were fantastic and in particular the lady that served us called MANTAO.  We choose this hotel because of the decor and thought it had a lvoely feel to it and it really didn't disppoint.  All of the staff were very attentive and having had a baby with us even gave us a room to change his nappy.  Food was great and we never ran out.  They also sweetly sung happy birthday and gave me a birthday treat which was amazing because they didn't know it was my birthday until a friend said in passing.
We will be going back there for another tea and also dinner...Highly recommend it!!",5,2013,05,13
105,They look after the little people.,"Afternoon tea. 
Our group had an excellent time. The lady waitress MONTANA was very helpful which was especially valuable when you have a young baby in the group, we had been given the use of a hotel room to change nappies! She also gave our baby a small present of the hotel cuddly bear which was very sweet.

It is quite expensive, but you don't mind paying when the food, service and atmosphere are excellent quality. 
Thank you.
Natalie",5,2013,05,12
105,Excellent afternoon Tea with superb service,"The weekend visit to London with the famliy should of course included a afternoon Tea visit. We booked the Chesterfield based on reviews and we had high expectations. We are so satisfied!! Great service from the staff, specially Mantao and Thomaz, and the menu was great. It suited both our kids and us. Thanks!",5,2013,05,11
105,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I went here for afternoon tea. I wasn't sure what to expect as we'd never heard of the hotel before, but the reviews were excellent. We were not disappointed! The sandwiches were amazing, with our favourites being ham and cheese with a thin layer of a delicious salsa. The cakes were beautiful. There was a wonderful orange macaroon with a chocolate filling and a chocolate eclair, fruit tart, raspberry moose cake and a small slice of fruit cake. The scones were also very good. We were in heaven! Very friendly, unpretentious service from Chris topped the afternoon perfectly. Will be back. ",5,2013,05,11
105,Lives up to its reputation,"I read several reviews before deciding on our hotel for London.  We spent 8 days at this hotel and were very impressed all the way around. The location was very important to me and this could not have been better for us. Access to green park and the tube was very convenient as we used this as our mode of transport all week. Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus.  The hotel is impeccably maintained. The rooms are all very different and each is charming. We chose a junior suite since we know rooms in London tend to be small. Great room, excellent bathroom.  The restaurant in the hotel is very good and I agree that the Dover Sole, for which they are known, is excellent. Breakfast was quick each morning with a good amount of variety. The staff were discreet but very helpful when you needed help or with questions. We are pretty self sufficient so we did not utilize them much but every interaction we witnessed was very friendly and obliging. We did not partake of high tea, but the room was very pretty.  You could hear people walking in the hallway or entering and exiting rooms nearby. Otherwise, it was quite. If you want a good selection of nearby restaurants either head to nearby Berkeley square or to Shepards Market which is just around the block down Queen's Street where there are several very good choices. I would definitely return if we come back to London.",5,2013,05,10
105,Afternoon tea,"My friend had always wanted to do Afternoon Tea in London and so for her hen-do we chose this hotel. The hotel location was great, only 5 minutes from Green Park tube station. the interior of the hotel was great, lending it a sophistcated atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the service was spot on. The afternoon tea with champagne was ~£40 per person and was value for money as sandwhiches were refreshed at no extra expense. The tea consisted of finger sandwhiches, cakes, scones, cheesecakes and macaroons, served alongside a variety of tea types. We stayed longer than the alotted 2 hours with no pressure from the staff to leave. I would definately go back and would recommend this venue to any one who fancies an afternoon of decadence.",5,2013,05,10
105,Mayfair & more.,We spent a glorious week in London at the fabulous Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in January.  We upgrade to a larger room with two bathrooms...great for the extended stay.  Service from the front door to the restaurant & bar to the maid service in the room was all top drawer.  The restaurant is wonderful...good selection and fair pricing.  This was our fifth visit to the hotel...and it was better than ever.,5,2013,05,09
105,A London Gem,"After the glass and concrete towers of Dubai, to arrive in this wonderfully British 5 star property was good for the soul. The staff are courteous, knowledgeable, and attentive, particularly Chris, the Concierge. The breakfasts were beautifully prepared and your order comes out with very prompt efficiency.
Our room was a bit on the cramped side. I would sit in the comfortable arm chair reading today's paper to give my wife the run of the room as she prepared to tackle London. Not really room for 2 to move about, but a comfortable bed with quality linens, and as our room overlooked the courtyard, very quiet.
A pleasant walk through Mayfair to Green Park tube, or on through the park to Buckingham Palace. A perfect location.",5,2013,05,09
105,Excellent hotel in the heart of Westminster,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is on a quiet street in a bustling part of town, near a wide selection of pubs and restaurants and a short taxi ride from Piccadilly station.    The hotel staff are very attentive, friendly and efficient.    Mine was a standard room, with a very comfy bed and suitable work area (not large by most standards, but ample room by London standards).   Both the bar and the business lounge good places to meet and work.",5,2013,05,08
105,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my twin sister, so quiet and peaceful, room was immaculate bed very comfortable, staff were polite and helpful, from the moment we stepped out from the taxi, to getting back into the taxi for our journey home. Not to far to walk to the main shopping streets, and green park tube station if you want to go further afield.
Would stay here again for sure.",5,2013,05,08
105,Exquisite in every way,"Right from the moment I walked in the door and was warmly greeted by the Bell Captain, Front Desk staff and concierge, then swept the room with my eyes, taking in the lush but unpretentious lobby, I knew I was in for something special.  And it only got better, with our room being one of the most spacious and elegant I had stayed in London, the bar (open 24 hours) having the best bar food and affordable wine selections (and a barman who not only remembers your name, but your tastes, and the complimentary breakfast with fresh squeezed juices, muesli, organic yogurts, smoked salmon and eggs any which way (that's just a starter!) - no less than a remarkable location!",5,2013,05,07
105,Amazing,"From the time of my arrival until my departure, I was thoroughly spoiled. My single room was beautiful with a comfy bed  and very private, very quiet. The room service meal that I ordered was delicious and welcome after a tiring day. I loved my stay and highly recommend",5,2013,05,05
105,"Nice hotel in a quiet neighborhood, just off Piccadilly","The Chesterfield Mayfair is a small, charming hotel. The location is very good - 5 min walk to the Green Park metro/Piccadilly and yet located on a street which was incredibly quiet. The neighborhood felt very safe (for walking back at night). The classic double room was very spacious, and well-equipped. I got a business ready room as it had all the amenities you'd need to work from the hotel (except printing, for which you need to go to the lobby). The breakfast spread was also great - tried a variety of things during my stay and was very pleased overall with the selection, quality of food, and service. The concierge is incredibly helpful and friendly - speaking to Tony each morning was wonderful :) Check-in and check-out were also very smooth. Overall, the hotel and the room was clean and well-maintained.",4,2013,05,03
105,Fantastic Hotel,"What a lovely, traditional hotel!  From the time of my arrival until my departure, I was thoroughly spoiled.  My single room was beautiful with a comfy bed and a view into Charles Street - and very private, very quiet.  The room service meal that I ordered was delicious and welcome after a tiring day.  I loved my stay and highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2013,05,03
105,Impeccable,"A true london treasure. This hotel was a delightful first stop on our honeymoon. The location was fantastic (just a short stroll to Green Park station), the staff charismatic and helpful, the breakfast delicious. The decor was very charming and gave the place a very welcoming, yet opulent feeling. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a hotel with a bit of character. Each room is decorated differently and to the highest level of detail. Loved it.",5,2013,05,03
105,Couldn't possibly be better!,"From the greeting as the front door is opened for you, to the friendliness of the reception desk and restaurant staff, to the comforts of the room, there is hardly any way there could be improvement to this hotel.  One really is treated as part of the family from the moment of arrival, not as a number, or as part of a conveyor belt of ""clients"" the way one is greeted at so many hotels these days.  The Chesterfield has THE best breakfasts of any hotel I have ever stayed with -- none of the greasy fried-from-frozen rubbish one finds at most -- these are individually prepared by a real chef, everything is fresh and wonderful -- the fruit, the pastries, the poached eggs with salmon, the porridge with cream and a measure of whisky -- everything is divine.  Restaurant staff are genuinely attentive -- not falsely so.  The rooms are so comfortable that one hardly wants to leave them in the morning.  Nowhere else compares.",5,2013,05,02
105,Best location in London,"A couple of weeks ago my wife and I along with another couple visited London.  We normally stay in another 5 star hotel but we were unhappy with our experience the last time and wanted to try another hotel in similar location.  We selected the Mayfair Chesterfield and were a little nervous as we had never stayed there before.  We were delighted with the accommodations, food, friendliness of the staff and the size of the room.  We have found our hotel we will always check first for reservations!  What a great place.",5,2013,04,26
105,The Heart of Mayfair!,"You really can't beat this location!  My wife and I arrived in London with not much of a plan besides to see the major tourist attractions.  Our room was not quite ready when we came in but they concierge recommended a nice little pub just up the road.  Perfect for fish & chips with a pint to wash it down of course.  Since the room was not ready we proceeded to walk up the road.  Pleasantly, we ended up strolling through, bond street, regent, soho, all the way to covent garden, really the best places to see in London in my opinion for shopping.  
The service was top notch.  Rooms were a bit busy and dark but clean and well appointed.  Bathroom was of good size and amenities were also nice.  Breakfast was also pretty good.
The place is charming, perfect location, and great service. What more can you ask for.
Highly recommended.",4,2013,04,25
105,Beatiful hotel with very friendly staff,"Stayed for 7 nights at this lovely hotel. The location was perfect, quiet, but very close to shoppingarea and pubs and restaurants. The staff were very serviceminded and helpful, and the room was nice and clean.",5,2013,04,25
105,What a Gem.,"Lovely hotel in an excellent location. Wonderful bed,window that opened,non slip base in shower over bath,lot of storage. Carolina was excellent in the breakfast restaurant. Antonio made dinner a memorable experience. We loved sitting in the bar with the piano player. ( sorry we don't know his name)",4,2013,04,25
105,Fabulous Hotel,We traveled to London for a family break and my husband found this hotel. From the moment we stepped out of the cab we were made to feel very special and welcome. The staff at this hotel were very friendly and professional. We had 2 rooms which were joined by a small private hall. The children could have space to themselves ( or rather we could).These rooms were beautiful. The decor was busy but tasteful.  There was everything you would ever need. There was even a stationary draw. We had some snacks and drinks in the bar which were lovely. The breakfast menu was very good offering continental or full English and everything in between. On my husbands birthday we had our breakfast served in our room at no extra cost and this was a lovely treat. The children were made very special by going to decorate cup cakes with a lovely chef called Sarah. These little touches make all the difference and we will defiantly return to this fantastic hotel. We have stayed in a few luxury London hotels but never have we had service like it! We will be back and I will be recommending this hotel to all my family & friends.,5,2013,04,25
105,An Excellent Response!,"The Chesterfield is a delightful hotel that has a lot of the old-world charm of bygone times and service that is second to none.  Outstanding staff will look after you and make you feel very comfortable throughout.

After a technical issue at the hotel left us in the lurch with an outtage in a fairly essential service, we were quickly and fairly recompensed and will return to this Mayfair gem.",5,2013,04,24
105,I would recommend to everyone!,"This was a lovely break away. The staff were all lovely, better than lovely, they were helpful, thoughtful, understanding etc. the hotel has a great feel and decour to match! I will visit her again as soon as I can and I would recommend anyone reads this, choses this hotel. ",5,2013,04,23
105,Very pleasant hotel,"I was in London on business and stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair. I had a double room as an upgrade but it was only small. It was very clean and elegant but small. The staff were first class and nothing was too much trouble. I got a last minute deal which was very welcome. I was out for the evening and returned very late but the night staff we great and good humoured. only three or four hours later I e devised my wake up call and got ready for off.
An excellent breakfast followed and away I went . I would definitely return to this charming hotel but would want a bigger room.",4,2013,04,22
105,Gorgeous English hotel,"My friend and I stayed at the Chesterfield for one night as part of a theatre break.  We had decided to stay somewhere extra special, and the Chesterfield definitely didn't disappoint. The staff could not have been more helpful, and we were made to feel like we were the only guests staying there.  The decor was gorgeous - quintessentially English and elegant.  I would recommend the Chesterfield without any hesitation, and if I decide to do another similar break, I would stay there again.  Lovely, lovely hotel.",5,2013,04,22
105,Fantastic experience!,"This was the first time my daughters and I had traveled to England. I wanted a truly ""English experience"" and the Chesterfield Mayfair certainly didn't disappoint. The decor was beautiful. The location couldn't be much better. Close to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, etc. But most of all the service was superb. Chesterfield's employees made us feel at home every day. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London. I would like to thank them for the best week ever!",5,2013,04,15
105,Lovely!,"Stayed here for just one night whilst attending my friends wedding, fabulous location, came in from Victoria and it was only a short stroll through green park. Had a lovely bright room, with a big bathroom, luxurious toiletries and an amazing shower! Staff were very friendly and the breakfast the next morning of a high quality. I cannot wait to",5,2013,04,15
105,Exactly what we wanted,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair at the end of a 2 week trip to Ireland and UK.  It was exactly what we wanted - comfortably elegant with dark wood paneling, welcoming lobbby, and quiet with an outstanding staff and service.  We stayed in the Mayfair Suite which had a very large and confortable bed and marvelous bathroom.  
Our only concerns were that the shower stall was too small and the shower head too low (I am over 6 feet tall).  The shower in the tub was high enough but the glass panel at the side was too small to prevent water from spraying into the bathroom.  So management may want to give some thought to providing a better shower arrangement. 
I would also like to single out several staff members who provided outstanding service:  Chris, the concierge; Mantao who served breakfast every day and Scelard who was our waiter in the dinign room for dinner on two occasions.",5,2013,04,15
105,An oasis in London,"Spent three nights at the Chesterfield and there's nothing negative to say about this lovely boutique hotel. The service from the front desk, porter/doormen, lounge/bar, restaurant, and even phone operator is very professional, friendly and attentive... a top notch team is at your disposal at times! The room was comfortable and handsomely decorated. The bathroom had heated floors and plush towels and robes. The climate control in the room made it very easy to adjust to our personal comfort levels. The food at breakfast was abundant and delicious. We had dinner one evening which was delicious and wonderfully served by our maitre'd/waiter, as was the one time we had lunch with friends. The location is excellent for exploring much of London on foot, and is close to some great (but pricey) restaurants, yet is off the beaten path enough so that it never feels like you're in a crowded, touristy area at all. The Chesterfield Mayfair will definitely be our place to stay when visiting this wonderful city in the future... it really is an oasis in London!",5,2013,04,15
105,"Great location, Amazing service!","The hotel is located close to the metro station, some shops and restaurants and plenty of taxis are always near.  The decor is exactly what you want it to be, it feels quintessentially English.  The woods are dark and the colors are warm and inviting.  The staff is just fabulous.  They really provide exceptional service round the clock.  They made reservations for us, got us taxis, even held the umbrella for me while I got into the taxi in the rain.  Very polite and helpful.  

The breakfast was included with our package and frankly it is one the best included hotel breakfasts we've ever had.  In addition to the standard bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns, they have fresh smoothies, fresh orange juice that tastes incredible!  Cereals and fruit and of course tea and coffee.  I definitely recommend adding the breakfast.

We also ate dinner at the hotel one night which was also very good and had afternoon tea.  You get a lot of food with the tea so I would suggest scheduling a later dinner after all those sandwiches and dessert treats!

The rooms are a little smaller than we are use to here in the states but it wasn't lacking amenities.  Besides, not everything can be like a giant Vegas suite!

I would love to stay here again and I hope that you will check it out, it's fantastic!",5,2013,04,12
105,Great location and beautiful hotel,"My partner and I stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel for a weekend away and had a fantastic stay.  The location is second to none - we did not get on public transport once!  We stayed in one of the suites which was beautiful and elegant and the bed was ridiculously comfy!  All the hotel staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help.  We had breakfast in bed both mornings and it was delicious on both occasions.  Will will definitely return to The Chesterfield hotel, hopefully sooner rather than later!",5,2013,04,12
105,A quiet & elegant hotel,"We were so pleased with our recent stay at The Chesterfield and will surely return again.  The location is great and the staff is terrific.  They gave our 18 year old son a single room for no extra charge because he found the rollaway bed that was provided in our suite to be uncomfortable.  Since the hotel was not fully booked, they were gracious enough to suggest this and our son spent the next 3 days in a cozy, single room with a very comfortable bed all to himself.  The breakfast which was included in the price of the room was served in their restaurant and there was always fresh fruit, warm croissants and anything else you could ever think of eating for breakfast, including fresh squeezed orange juice.  We also ate dinner there one evening and we were all happy with our service and meal.  It was over Easter and the lobby was filled with lots of little chocolate eggs to munch on, plus we were given a different ""treat"" each night with turndown service.  The last night there we were given a ""farewell"" cupcake.  The bedding was very comfortable and the bath toiletries and towels were plentiful and deluxe.  The Chesterfield is a hotel that really tries to please...and succeeds!",5,2013,04,09
105,Perfect Location -- Perfect Hotel,"I stayed at The Chesterfield for a week in April 2013 and was pleased with everything about the hotel. The room was very nicely decorated, immaculate and though compact, easily had enough space for both our luggage and the many souvenires we purchased. The Afternoon Tea is a must -- the service, sandwiches, scones and pastries all add up to a perfectly wonderful experience that shouldn't be missed. Our evening ritual ended up with us in the Tavern rehashing the day's sites while sipping some very wonderful South African wine. A very comfortable setting accompanied by attentive service -- the perfect nightcap.

If you take the Heathrow Express from the airport, a taxi ride from Paddington Station is about 10 pounds. The very convenient Green Park tube stop (Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee lines) is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Overall, the hotel is perfectly situated for getting around London, as many tourist destinations are only a stop or two away.",5,2013,04,09
105,Very nice Mayfair property!,"We and two other couples stayed here for our son's wedding.  The rooms were small, as are all London rooms, but they were beautifully decorated and clean.  The lobby is elegant with plush furnishings and fresh flowers daily. The breakfast each morning was fresh, plentiful and the wait staff delightful.

The front desk staff were professional and were happy to honor any request we had.

We had Afternoon Tea one day and, although not so fancy as the larger hotels, was fine.  

The bar area was very comfortable and nicely decorated.",4,2013,04,09
105,Afternoon tea - great experience,"We were on a family weekend trip to London and booked afternoon tea at the Chesterfield. Not only was the tea itself enjoyable and well presented, the staff were absolutely fantastic - so friendly and helpful. We had a lovely time! I'm afraid I can't remember the name of the woman who serviced us but it was something like Manao (???) and she was very attentive and pleasant.",5,2013,04,09
105,Great value; great hotel,"The Chesterfield is a real find.  It's a small, intimate hotel, immaculately maintained in the best location in London.  We had a deluxe double room which, while compact, was extremely well laid out with generous storage space.  Every detail was thought of from cookies and tea to late edition magazines in the room.   
The public spaces are beautifully appointed but still cozy.  The restaurant is warm and inviting.  The front desk staff greet you whenever you arrive.  We look forward to returning. ",5,2013,04,08
105,Afternoon tea heaven!,"From the minute we walked into the Chesterfield the service was outstanding. The staff are welcoming & professional. Our Afternoon tea was fabulous. Chris, the young man who served us, explained the different teas & was extremely attentive. This hotel obviously takes staff training seriously. The sandwiches, scones & cakes were delicious & beautifully presented. What we couldn't finish was put into boxes for us to take home. Overall a first class experience.",5,2013,04,08
105,A gem of a property,Excellent location. Beautifully maintained. Kudos to housekeeping staff. Rooms on the smallish side and bathrooms are tight but good storage and good layout. Staff were well trained and always eager to accommodate. Breakfast was included and the food quality and service were of high standard. A little something different for Easter Sunday breakfast might have been a nice touch. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2013,04,05
105,"I'm always skeptical of terrific ratings, but...","The Chesterfield deserves every accolade it has received.  The service is outstanding, and the assistance rendered by concierges Chris and Darren were incredibly helpful over a very busy Easter weekend stay.  The rooms are typical in size to most European hotels but ours was very charming and exceptionally clean.  Similarly, we were very happy with the service in the lovely lounge - the young bartender went to great lengths to prepare our cocktails exactly the way we enjoy them.  We await our return eagerly.",5,2013,04,05
105,Wonderful hotel in prime location,"We stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for nine days in mid-March.  We were very pleased with the service, the buffet breakfasts, the ambience, and our room at the hotel.   Our room was on the street side yet very quiet due to soundproof windows and heavy curtains. The hotel is very well situated to walk to Piccadilly, Trafalgar, Whitehall, the West End theatres, Covent Garden and the Knightsbridge, Oxford and Bond Street areas.  For sites further afield, the Green Park tube station is a five minute walk from the hotel.  We will stay there again on future trips to London....",5,2013,04,03
105,Great location for a very nice boutique hotel,"The only bad part of this boutique hotel is the variability of rooms. Our party if six had three different type of room. One bigger. One with better view, etc.

Other than that, the location is prime, the staff is wonderful and the amenities such as breakfast, robes, slippers, toiletries and such were great.

There is a small square nearby with various types of restaurants from ethic to pub to quick serve and even a cobbler...one of us broke a heel.

You are right near tube, bus, tour bus and taxis.

The staff gave exacting directions by even writing turn by turn with landmarks. Their restaurant recommendations were spot on but be ready for expensive dinners.

Our breakfast was prepaid so we enjoyed a myriad of chooses including eggs prepared any way you like.

The high tea was a highlight if the trip for one of my fellow travelers. Plus the bar is relaxing with a staff ready to please. We had a little time upon check in before everyone assembled and they diligently helped find important charging outlets for our various devices.

Luxurious robes, a steaming hot shower were a big hit and fine bath soaps were a hit  because our crew experienced much colder than average temperature and lots of wind, a few snow flakes but thankfully no rain. Keeping with the quirky boutique theme, we flooded our bathroom due to an odd half shower wall that allowed water to flow out. The hotel provided more towels quickly.

Overall a great place to stay in London for experienced and new travelers a like",5,2013,04,02
105,Lovely stay!,"It is 9 years since we last visited the Chesterfield Mayfair but we chose to stay here again on our recent trip. We enjoyed our first visit but enjoyed this stay even more. It was a different visit as our primary reason for visiting was to visit our daughter in hospital, and as the weather was really cold we spent much more time in the hotel.
We had a standard double which was clean, warm and very comfortable. We had a choice of pillow type when we booked (feather) and also received free full English breakfasts during our stay.
Bar staff were welcoming and friendly, as were all the staff were we encountered. Nothing was too much trouble.
The first night we ate in the hotel restaurant, however service was slow, 45 minutes from ordering to receiving our mains and around 35 minutes from ordering to receiving our desserts. As the restaurant was relatively quiet (only 4 or 5 tables in) and our order was steak, I think that this was a little excessive. The second night we ordered room service which was excellent, hot, nicely served and not too long to wait, as both nights we were very tired (in the restaurant my husband was falling asleep waiting for dessert) room service proved a much better choice for us.
We had a late check out for no extra charge, only slightly marred by a phone call a few minutes after our original checkout time asking if we needed help with our luggage, and the maid asking if she could service the room again only minutes after our original checkout time.
Breakfast was excellent, prompt, hot and well cooked with lots of choice. Would it be worth £22 each? Not sure but great if you can get it in your room price.
They seemed to be doing an excellent trade in afternoon tea which I would like to try at a future visit.
The bar was cosy, piano player a bonus, remember however that its Mayfair prices.
In conclusion, a lovely hotel which we enjoyed even more than our first visit.",5,2013,04,02
105,"Heavenly 5 star service and amenities, 4 star price","My daughters and I are just back from spending a heavenly week at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We were drawn to this property by the incredible suite deal of 3 nights for the price of 2, inclusive of English breakfast.  We expected a great value but what we did not expect was the best 5 star service and amenities on every level, from the friendly attentiveness of every member of the staff, to the stunning design, cleanliness and quality of the rooms, to a lovely breakfast each morning, to the perfect location for reaching all the tourist sites in London. Starting with the perfect staff: Front desk: incredibly responsive to every request-example: we arrived early, well before check in, and were given tea coffee and croissants a lovely offer to use the gorgeous library while we waited and then they rushed the prep of our suite so we could check in early. Concierges: we used the concierges quite a bit—they were all quick to provide friendly, detailed information on local restaurants, even obscure galleries, directions to all our destinations and they all went the extra mile—example: Tony was able to book us in to a very popular restaurant, Locando Locatelli, on less than an hours’ notice.  Room Service: breakfast always on time(actually early), perfectly hot and delicious , and staff member Lourdes enthusiastically greeted us each morning like a ray of sunshine through the London clouds, remembering our preferences and bringing us extras such fruit and chocolates for the Easter holiday. Managers and other staff: every wish granted—example: my daughter injured her ankle---a kind staff member not only rushed up an ice pack but two cupcakes to wish her well.  This ‘going the extra mile’ attitude was reflected in all the staff, doormen to bellmen included.  Rooms: we were given the Philipe suite---it was gorgeous:  rich, high quality fabrics for draperies and bed linens, stunning period furniture, high ceilings, sparkling mirrors and multiple chandeliers; the bathroom was all marble, beautiful high quality fixtures, a waterfall like shower with great water pressure you would not expect in an older hotel, and most importantly, impeccably clean—it was hard to leave this beautiful suite each morning. Location: the best of both worlds---the hotel is on a very quiet residential street with no night traffic or crowd noise but if you walk one block towards Piccadilly you are in the midst of Shepherds Market and surrounded by multiple great restaurants.  You can easily walk to Regent Street, New Bond Street, all of the Piccadilly Circus area attractions and even Trafalgar Square, with the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery.  It is  a very short taxi ride to the V&A museum and museum row and you could also tube it to many destinations with the Green Park Line being just a few blocks away.  We have stayed in other areas of London before but this location simply cannot be beat.  Food: we had a wonderful English breakfast each morning with many options from fresh fruit to perfectly prepared eggs to light, flaky croissants.  All in all,we felt blessed that we happened upon this hotel and we will be repeat customers in our future travels to London.",5,2013,03,31
105,"Very pleasant, but not everything I'd hoped","My husband and I recently spent a weekend at The Chesterfield taking advantage of the excellent Mayfair weekend package that included breakfast, tea, bottle of champagne and 6 pm checkout.  (That package really is terrific value.)  We also wanted some old-world ""ambience"" and we enjoyed the feeling of staying in a boutique hotel, with a lot of English flavor.  

The problem, in a nutshell, is that we simply found our room underwhelming.  It was quite small (despite selecting the superior level of room) and the decor (brown prints) was very uninspiring, and when coupled with very dark furniture and a small window, made it pretty dark and definitely not the elegant English look we'd hoped for (or see on the website pictures).  The bathrooms were very small as well, but in great condition and very well lit with some of the best towels I've ever had and lovely Fragonard toiletries.  We also enjoyed having 2 closets, an iron and ironing board in the room (although it's hard to find space to use it!), and free wifi (which worked perfectly).  

The other underwhelming issue was the noise -- not from outdoors - but from inside the hotel.  The hallways are fairly narrow so we heard every footstep, doors opening and slamming shut, and a lot of noise from housekeeping staff working and talking in the corridor (our room was close to their closets).  It did not interfere with our sleep, but if we lingered in the room in the morning or were watching a movie before going to sleep, there was a lot of noise just outside the door which made the experience feel less than private.

The staff is very nice - in advance of arriving, the concierge had been extremely responsive in setting up a car for my husband's pick up at Heathrow and for making sure we had a reservation for tea on Sunday.  Excellent proactive service on those counts!  Within the hotel, the front desk staff was professional (although when I asked about irons in the room, the front desk person said she ""wasn't sure that was available"" and would have to call me -- when in fact, each room has an iron!).  When I was first sent to a room that had two separate beds, they remedied it quickly (although they first offered only to move the beds together later that afternoon - which I rejected in favor of one full sized bed).  Perhaps the only real fault with staff is in the dining room where we always had to wait for someone to notice our arrival and seat us, and where the person taking the order for a cooked breakfast was quite brusque.  Our service at Sunday afternoon tea was excellent.

So, for my vote, the Chesterfield is a very nice option for a traditional decor/boutique hotel (and in a great location!!!), especially for the Mayfair weekend package.  But otherwise, I would opt for the room I previously had at the Intercontinental down the street -- bigger, more modern, more elegant, better condition, and a very lovely staff as well.",4,2013,03,27
105,Great stay and celebration,"We stayed here for my 40th with friends, as well as having a party in the chesterfield suite. Service was great, and the hotel has a great feeling, being not too large and lacking in soul like some hotels. Nice bedroom, whilst not large (408) was big enough.",5,2013,03,27
105,Highly Recommended,Everything about this hotel is a first class experience. The environment is elegant and beautiful. The rooms are comfortable and delightfully decorated and the staff are discreetly attentive. We stayed at the hotel during a recent weekend shopping trip. It was also a belated birthday celebration. On arrival I found a birthday card signed by the staff in my room and returning later in the evening I discovered a lovely little cake with Happy Birthday piped in chocolate on the plate. This was a lovely thought and very much appreciated. The Chesterfield will now be our regular choice for London stays. I cannot fault any aspect of this hotel or recommend it too highly !,5,2013,03,26
105,"Elegant, brilliant location, and practically perfect in every way..","I have stayed in many many hotels in London - which has no lack of fabulous hotels. This particular property however, is my favorite for a number of reasons. If you prefer smaller, more charming hotels with elegant character along with fabulous but discreet service - this is the place. In my view, this is old world hospitality with modern taste. If yo snapped your fingers and went back 100 years - but had an entirely up to date hotel, this would be the place. No hyperactivity, no loud thumping music, no glitz, just pure understated elegance in a truly calming environment.   Finally, you will not find a better location in Mayfair in my view.",5,2013,03,22
105,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"Three of us had Afternoon Tea here and enjoyed every minute. The food was excellent, the surroundings were beautiful and the staff could not have been better. They were so friendly and accommodating and made us feel so welcome. I was a bit worried that we weren't suitably dressed for such a beautiful hotel but we didn't feel out of place at all.
We didn't finish all the cakes and were about to leave when a waiter stopped us and said 'Haven't you forgotten something?'
He took the cakes away and came back with them in a lovely box with a red carnation on it. A lovely touch. 
I wouldn't hesitate to go back here for afternoon tea. I would also love to stay in the hotel one day. It looked lovely.",5,2013,03,20
105,First Class service and a fantastic hotel,"This is a fantastic place to stay.  Highly professional and courteous staff, excellent standards and a brilliant location for visiting central London and in our case, a theatre weekend break.  Our room was spotless as was the rest of the hotel.  The hotel is a joy to stay at - would highly recommend.",5,2013,03,20
105,Great place to enjoy St. Patrick's Day parade and very close to Hard Rock Cafe the original.,"Great!!! Hotel, rooms, staff, location, amenities,. See above.  Close to Berk Square,  Hard Rock, Green Park tube, Many embassies.  Shepherds Tavern,  Shepards Market. Close to supermarket (Berkeley Square to Green Park tube).",5,2013,03,19
105,Absolutely amazing!!!,"Wow, how could I possibly sum up everything about this amazing hotel in 200 characters, suffice to say if I could afford to I'd go every weekend! Amazing staff, fabulous ambience and an eye for detail that compares to nothing I've experienced in a London hotel!",5,2013,03,19
105,Lovely hotel,"I just stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for the second time, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is in a great location and is run beautifully. The rooms are on the small side, but are very nicely decorated and appointed. My daughter and I were on the 2nd floor, so I was a bit concerned about street noise, but it was very quiet. One reason I highly recommend this hotel is the quality of the service. Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful, and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome and taken care of. We arrived on the UK's Mother's Day, and the tea room was fully booked, but the maitre d' made sure to find us a table. The concierges are outstanding. They made reservations for us for tea and dinner, as well as offering good advice about plays and musicals. They work with a booking agent, so we were able to get ""best available"" tickets that they printed out on the spot! Very helpful. Highly recommend.",5,2013,03,18
105,Afternoon Tea - superb!!!,"What a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon! We had chosen this hotel to have afternoon tea to celebrate my special birthday and it was the perfect choice! The service from every member of staff was excellent, friendly and welcoming, and the room delightful. The food was of excellent quality and the table setting immaculate. We have taken afternoon tea at the Ritz and I have to say the Chesterfield outshines the Ritz tea on every level. We would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful experience to our friends and family, and will definitely return again in the future for another family celebration. A special thank you to Chris for my lovely souvenir!",5,2013,03,18
105,A weekend break for two ... in luxury!,"Once again we enjoyed a weekend break for two nights at the Chesterfield hotel, Mayfair, which was excellent. We stayed on the Friday night and were treated to champagne in our bedroom. Saturday morning started with a breakfast fit for a king in the quintessentially English restaurant. After a day of activities we returned for our afternoon cream tea and after dinner out, returned to the bar to delightful entertainment from the resident pianist in the bar, before turning in. The room (419) was lovely. Bathroom has underfloor heating and the shower knocks you over. Staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We have stayed on numerous occasions and will be staying again.",5,2013,03,17
105,"""WOW"" Amazing weekend stay","16.03.13
""WOW"" is my first thought, we chose to spend a weekend in town, and some one suggested a nice hotel group Red Carnation.

We chose the Chesterfield in Mayfair as it was close to the bar and restaurant we had booked.

The moment we arrived, we were greeted with happy staff, they had a big, smile and they all gave us a welcome, it was like going back in time to a traditional quintessential English feel and atmosphere,  you could tell nothing was too much trouble.

The room we were given #222, OMG its was amazing, light, airy, cozy, real touch of elegance, even had two bath rooms, 

We went in to the bar for a light bite, and a glass of wine,  (ended up with a bottle as we did not want to move) was so nice. I can recommend the club sandwich with truffle and parmigiana fries,

Latter on in the evening before going out we met friends and had various cocktails, the cocktails were great, and served with popcorn, yum yum.... James was our waiter he could not do enough for us. (Thank you James)

We had breakfast this morning in the conservatory, nice and bright, the buffet, was full of everything you could want for English breakfast, and the cooked breakfast was out of this world, unlimited toast and preserves, tea, coffee I was even cheeky and asked for  lattes's.

Cant remember all the staffs names, but they made us all feel so welcome, even a housekeeping porter i saw in a corridor said good morning and hoped we have a great day.

On departure, the staff were cheerful, and sad to see us go :-) 

Perfect location, for a weekend in town, with great local bars and so close to Shepherds market.......

We will be back, I promise,",5,2013,03,17
105,Superb!!!,"We absolutely loved this hotel. It is very well located in the heart of Mayfair. All was just perfect down to every detail. White gloved, top hat doorman received us and handled our luggage swiftly. 
The reception, concierge and housekeeping staff was excellent, as well as all working in the restaurant, which by the way was excellent. 
The room was lovely with a king size bed, lots of drawers and shelves and silk padded hangers for our clothes. The décor was elegant and sophisticated, with some beautiful antique pieces of furniture. They even had electric outlets for American, European and British appliances. In one of the drawers there was tray with everything one would find in a well-equipped desk and in a cupboard another tray with everything needed for coffee or tea, with several choices of flavors plus high quality cookies.
The bathroom, although small, had enough room to put our toiletries, and had fluffy embroidered bath towels and a good pressured shower. 
This hotel belongs to the South African hotel chain named Red Carnation so the bathroom had a fresh red carnation and the drawers were lined with red carnation printed paper. This was a very nice touch and amazing detail!!!
We will surely recommend this hotel and stay here again when we are back in London again.",5,2013,03,16
105,Outstanding break in London,"First impressions of the Chesterfield Mayfair were great with extremely welcoming staff, from the doormen to the lovely reception staff. The hotel was very well presented, spotlessly clean and decorated to a very high standard. 

I took my parents to this hotel as part of a theatre break in London for their diamond anniversary and my dad's 80th birthday. The hotel staff made the effort to present my parents with a cake, champange and a card signed by all hotel staff, a kind gesture from the hotel which was free of charge. 

The rooms were extremely comfortable and were decorated and maintained to a high standard. Underfloor heating was a godsend in the bathroom was a godsend along with bathrobes, toiletries, chocolates, complementary water, tea and coffee. 

The food at this hotel was excellent. The staff couldn't do enough for you. 

This hotel is ideally situated for theatres and is a 15 minute walk to Liecter Square. It is also a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube at Green Park. 

Would definately recommend this hotel and would stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2013,03,16
105,Great experience,"Great experience in the Chesterfield Mayfair. Very good situation near most of the best commercial areas in London, tube and bus stops, restaurants and trendy pubs. Very friendly, helpful staff, perfect English breakfast and afternoon tea. I'll come back, thank you so much.",5,2013,03,16
105,Couldn't be better!,"We booked a weekend offer. A gift from my husband on my birthday in November
When we booked the room we found out we'd been together for 45 yrs which we mentioned in our booking. The weekend package included champagne the first night, Full English breakfast , one Afternoon Tea and late checkout last day. 
Perfect for us. Leavin Stockholm early Saturday morning and leaving London at 7 pm Monday night
A week or so before my husband got a mail from the Hotel reminding us of  booking the Afternoon tea as its a popular place at the weekends. Asking us which day and time we want our afternoon tea. So kind! 
Arriving at the hotel On Sat morning just to leave our suitcases the receptionist told us we were upgraded to a suit with Jacuzzi ""The Garden Room ""was not ready yet as it takes a little longer to clean up a suit. But we could check in and our cases should be in our room when we came back! Fantastic service. 
A good start but it would rise up to higher  unexpected levels which made this weekend the best ever
So helpful and friendly staff everywhere ,treating us like royalties but in a natural and balanced way that made us feel comfortable and at home . A beautiful hotel with excellent interior design . Creating a special atmosphere of old times still fresh and modern and very clean
Perfect everything!!!!!
I'm amazed of the owner Mrs Bea Tollmans Vision for The Red Carnation Hotels and seeing it worked out perfect  in The Chesterfield Mayfair 
There is so much to say
Excellent kitchen, wonderful bar, restaurant, The Excellent Breakfast The Afternoon Tea in the Conservatory, details everywhere that makes you feel special and privileged
But particularly I want to mention the Surprice that came together with the Champagne Sat Night
A plate with two cupcakes ( carrot cake?) with clotted cream and raspberries on top 
On the plate was written with chocolate
Happy Anniversary and a card with greetings from the staff. 
Isn't that love? Thank you everybody working that weekend March 2-4 2013
This weekend became almost like a spa for my whole beeing after a heavy and a rather stressful winter",5,2013,03,15
105,"Details, details, details","This hotel attends to absolutely every little detail, even a hard-copy personal response to my evaluation at the end of my stay.  The room-service breakfast in-the-room as an ""included"" option for the cost of the room was really a GREAT perk.  Lovely, knowledgable, professional staff.  Definitely on my list when I return to London.  Easy walking distance to National Gallery, museums, etc.",5,2013,03,14
105,I've stayed here twice and will be back,"I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. The location and service can't be beat.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The rooms are not huge, but adequate with lots of closet space for storage.  Some little extras that I enjoyed: the nightly turn down service with a different treat on the pillows each night; the in-room french press coffee for getting started in the morning; the warm welcome my daughter and I received each time we entered the hotel.  

I love the bar and the piano, and the afternoon tea is a must-do. 

Best of all, you can walk to a lot of the major sights, AND it's just a few steps from the Underground that will take you virtually any where.  

In any case, the customer service and friendly attitude make this one of my favorite hotels.",5,2013,03,13
105,Afternoon Tea,"The Afternoon Tea Was Simply Delicious! Would Recommend It To Anyone. The Ham Cheese And Tomato Relish Was Our Favourite, And The Chocolate And Orange Macaroons Were Incredible. The Staff Are Very Attentive And Explained The Menu Fully For Us.",5,2013,03,13
105,Excellent hotel at a reasonable price,"We loved staying here!  We stayed for a week and it was great.  The location is ideal and the hotel is perfect.  Not incredibly fancy but very clean and incredible staff, an overall great deal in the best location.  The rooms are small yet there is tons of closet space so it did not feel tight.  The staff was amazing; very friendly, charming and helpful.  We would definitely return and definitely recommend it.",5,2013,03,11
105,Perfect central location,"Weekend wedding in London- all our venues were nearby so we booked at the Chesterfield.

Very pleasant staff at the reception and the door- always willing to help.

The decor is old school with lots of ornate decorations.
If you are looking for the minimalist feel of a W hotel, you'll probably have a heart attack here.

Room on the top floor was small-ish but in a cosy way.
Nice colors in the room and a view.
Bathroom amenities were very nice- Fragonnard if I recall
Bed and bedding very comfortable 
Good sized TV
QUIET...little noise from nearby rooms/doors....very nice and worth a special mention

To be improved- main issue was the bathroom
No shower- had to stand in tub and I couldnt stand directly under the shower head as I was too tall...and believe me, I am not THAT tall.
Hot vs. Cold water in the shower was a bit hit and miss to get the right balance and somewhat irritating.
The bathroom was in fine condition- it's more of the constraints due to the shape of the bathroom and what has to fit in there.

Great internet coverage.

Apparently really good breakfast and afternoon tea, but we just didnt have time for either.

Would return and warmly recommend.",4,2013,03,09
105,Wonderful Experience,"We spent three wonderful nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair in January and were extremely impressed.   We received a warm welcome on entering the hotel.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  We were shown around the bar and restuarant and then taken up to our room even though we had arrived early.  It was very well decorated with everything a person needs to feel totally comfortable and spoilt. We chose to have our breakfasts in our room and they were always delivered on time by the very friendly staff. The food was really good. The turn down service every evening was so nice as there was always a little treat on our pillow.   The hotel is in a great location, very close to Green Park tube station with so much to do within walking distance from the hotel. We totally enjoyed our experience at this hotel and look forward to returning again when in London.",5,2013,03,05
105,Go for the Mayfair Weekend package!,"We booked a Mayfair weekend package. Provided you stay for 2 nights, for an extra £12 each you get a package worth over £150 per couple: 2 breakfasts each @ £22, an afternoon tea at £32.50 each, a bottle of champagne and a late check out on your last day to allow you to have the afternoon tea then if you choose. While I felt that none of the components was particularly good value at its quoted price the package as a whole was exceptional value and added a note of decadence to a weekend to celebrate a significant milestone.
The hotel was excellent. Great location close to shopping, theatres and Buck Palace area. Also close to great restaurants with Tamarind and Murano (see separate review) literally around the corner. Staff were friendly and helpful. 
Bedroom (527) was a good size with plenty of storage space and usual facilities for a hotel of its class. The room overlooked a busy street but was very well soundproofed. Bed was large and comfortable with good pillows. Being an iron framed four poster style it did jiggle a bit when the other half changed position but this was minor. We loved the bathroom which was large (and took a large chunk out of the bedroom) and had the largest (free standing) bath I have ever been in – wonderful shower too. We didn’t use it but noted a well-equipped desk with key pad, mouse, scissors, stapler tape etc.
Breakfast was very good with plenty of juices, fresh fruit, cereals, cold cuts and a cooked option. However I would not have been happy paying £22 even with a full English but I thoroughly enjoyed it as part of the Mayfair package. Eggs Benedict on the second day was a treat.
Afternoon tea was a lovely treat as part of the package but I wouldn’t have been happy paying £32.50 each for a few sandwiches, pastries and scones.
Would I recommend the Chesterfield – yes unreservedly and would welcome an opportunity to return.",5,2013,03,04
105,Wonderful,"We visited on the weekend of 8th to 10th February , having been there several times before. The Hotel has been continuously providing excellence in every respect, whether the food, the rooms, and they have superb friendly staff. I'm sure this H otel would not disappoint anyone.",5,2013,03,03
105,Truly outstanding hotel,"I spent four days at the Chesterfield Mayfair recovering from major back surgery before returning home to France. From the moment I arrived, it was clear that I was in safe hands. I had mentioned to Reservations that I needed to delay my arrival by two days due to complications with the back surgery. All staff had been informed prior to my arrival. Housekeeping prepared my room (unasked) by putting a board under the mattress and making sure all tea/coffee equipment etc was out of cupboards and easily accessible on the tables. Everyone took an interest and only wanted to help. I had to rely on Room Service as they were my only regular contact with the outside. They were cheery, generous, caring and ready to help in any way possible. Housekeeping was thoughtful and discreet. I know the Chef went 'all out' to make dishes attractive and wrote, in chocolate, 'get well soon' on dessert plates. Service was oustanding. Accomodation was very comfortable and the room was well-equipped. The food was great. If you seek outstanding and personalised service in a comfortable hotel in a great location, this is the best in London. I have stayed in a number of top London hotels and speak from some experience. Also, the rooms are double-glazed and it is a quiet street in Mayfair. There is no noise to disturb sleeping, day or night.",5,2013,03,03
105,A Saturday night stay was too short,"We decided to spend a night in London on the way home between Turkey and the USA and we followed the recommendations on Tripadvisor for the Chesterfield House. We were not disappointed. The staff were excellent, the room, while cosy, was spotless and comfortable and I enjoyed a wonderful Irish coffee in the piano bar after dinner. We will definately visit again and take better advantage of all this hotel and its location has to offer. ",5,2013,03,03
105,Prefect Balance of Elegance and Hospitality,"I can’t say enough about the wonderful staff, absolutely everyone was willing to help and go above and beyond from the lovely concierge, and front desk attendants to housekeeping, room service restaurant staff, doormen, and the hotel operator.  We stayed the week of Feb14-22, 2013.  One of our party was sick and needing help in a foreign county is when a really good hotel counts and they were so gracious and accommodating, even insisting that this is our home while we are in London.  I have stayed in other top hotels and needed medical help in the past and the staff at the Chesterfield went above and beyond.  We had a breakfast and lunch in the restaurant that was delicious, but wanted to spend most of our time exploring London.  This hotel was in a prefect location with easy access to the Green Park tube stop where you can pick up 3 lines and the tour buses, also a short walk to Soho.  Had A Standard King that was split to a twin.  The room is small, but perfect.  There are 2 large closets so plenty of space for your things and suitcases, marble bathroom with shower with ""rain"" shower-head and tub and great bath products.  Nightly turn down service with chocolates, bath-salts or face spray and cookies and tea/coffee left in the room for a breakfast self service.  I would stay here again.",5,2013,02,28
105,Expectations exceeded!,"My wife and I stayed here, having previously only had afternoon tea there, which was excellent and led us to have high expectations for our visit.  Those expectations were not just met, but exceeded.

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel that we were the most important guests, as our every wish was catered for.  All the members of staff were courteous and attentive without being either obsequious or formal, and the food we had, both in our room and at breakfast, was of the highest standard.  Any requests for room service (for sandwiches etc) were dealt with so quickly that we felt that someone had been waiting just to attend to our wishes!  It was typical of the level of attention to care for guests that each time we called we did not need to say who we were - they knew already.

We had requested a quiet room, towards the rear of the hotel and away from public areas, and that is exactly what we were given.  In our experience, this is very unusual; most hotels will not guarantee that guests' wishes will be met, or fail to keep their word.

The room was very comfortable, and one of, if not the, quietest we have ever had the pleasure to stay in.  We had probably the best night's sleep we have ever had away from home.  As is usual, there was an extractor fan in the bathroom, but there were also nightlights in there which made the use of the main light, which cause the fan to activate, unneccessary.",5,2013,02,28
105,Old Fashioned Quality,Outstanding Hotel and a big surprise. Have passed this hotel many times and have stayed in many of the other well known Hotels in the vicinity. On a recommendation we stayed here and we will certainly return. Service is excellent and it is clear that many of the staff have been there for years. Concierge and Bar Staff stood out for going the extra mile. Nice traditional rooms and touches like afternoon tea. Give it a go...,5,2013,02,28
105,"Great service, shame about the bathroom","This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this hotel. We like the location and the service is good. This time we booked a king size room (305). The decor was nice and the facilities in the room were what you would expect (tea tray, bottled water, iron etc). The room was on the small side and the bathroom, although to a good standard, again was small. The shower wasn't really suitable because afterwards the bathroom was soaked and it took all the towels to mop it up. To the hotel's credit they did say they would send clean towels up and it would be sorted out when the maid turned down the room. We stayed room only so can't comment on breakfast on this trip but we did use the bar, and the staff were very friendly. We would stay again.",4,2013,02,28
105,"From the moment we arrived, everything was perfect","What a pleasant change to stay in a hotel and not have one single gripe; we could not fault a thing.  From the moment we arrived, everything was perfect.  We stayed in the Garden Junior Suite, a beautifully decorated room, with a comfortable bed, pillows and chairs.  It was spotlessly clean, with fluffy towels and nice smelling toiletries.  The lighting in the room was excellent, with plenty of power points to charge our devices and we were able to leave them on charge whilst out of the room, in stark contrast to so many hotels these days with poor lighting and where everything switches off when you go out.  Wi-Fi is also complimentary and was perfectly adequate for working, we did not experience any problems.  

We have stayed in several 5-star hotels in the past year and have been disappointed by their turn-down service not leaving a little chocolate on the pillow.  It is a little gesture but a lovely one and when 5-star hotels charge such high rates, it seems like petty penny-pinching to me to remove this little treat. How refreshing then to have a turn-down service at the 4-star Chesterfield Mayfair, with a little treat on the pillow each night.  It was lovely.  There were lots of extra little touches which were so thoughtful and made everything so wonderfully easy and enjoyable.  

Breakfast was very good, with plenty of choices, especially as all eggs are made to order, instead of sitting, greasy and congealed in bain-marie’s.  We had drinks at the bar and enjoyed live music and complimentary snacks.  We have heard that the afternoon tea’s and dinner are excellent and will have to return again for these.  

The hotel is in a greatt location, a 5 minute walk to Green Park Tube Station and a 10 - 15 minute walk to Oxford Street.  The lovely Shepherd’s Market, with its varied mix of restaurants and bars, is just minutes away.  

Service from all the staff throughout our stay was excellent, friendly and accommodating and we were especially grateful that a special request was handled so well.  We will definitely be back.",5,2013,02,27
105,Excellent Stay,"Stayed weekend of Feb 23'13 with wife and friends. Excellent facilities in a very convenient location.I have been staying there for years and never consider anywhere else. Breakfast is particularly good with proper waitress service and freshly cooked food. This is a relatively small hotel and has particularly friendly staff who are always pleased to help. Will definitely book again next time in London and have no hesitation in recommending it.
The afternnon tea is excellent - it is often well booked so worth reseving.",5,2013,02,27
105,An excellent weekend stay,"Booked this hotel as part of a theatre package and after checking with Trip Advisor.  We wanted something special for our anniversary weekend.  While checking out the hotel i noticed that they offered afternoon teas.  Now, I had been keen to try this out for some time and had looked at other hotels such as Claridges etc.  As this was in the hotel we were staying in I also booked htis afternoon tea separtely.  The tea was excellent with top ups of sandwiches , scones, cakes and tea on request.  This is very filling and suggest you do not overdo the ordering.  One thing though, do not sit by the conservatory glass doors in winter as the cold air creeps in around your legs.  We asked to move and this was no problem.  The room facilities were as expected for the money with an enormous 'King' size bed.  The pillows were also most comfortable and I can say we both were well satisfied with the bedding, pillows and the bed!  Tea & coffee choices in the room was very good and the air con/heating worked well and not noisy.  Shower leaked a bit onto the floor so reported this to maintainence as we left.  Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice from a buffet and a menu served by waiter.  Bread for toast was very good and croissant were big and light.  All the staff were polite and helpful.  Location is very good just off Berkley Square and an easy walk to Green Park underground and main bus routes.  Usually a taxi waiting if you prefer.",5,2013,02,26
105,A perfect weekend,"Together for 30 years and our first grandchild soon to be born what could be better than a weekend at The Chesterfield in Mayfair to celebrate, relax and unwind. This hotel never disappoints - unlike many other hotels at the Chesterfield you are as an individual and made to feel special by every member of staff you meet rather than just being treated as another paying customer.

We have stayed at the Chesterfield many times before so it was not a surprise for that fact to be recognised by the reception but it was lovely to be upgraded into a junior suite as recognition of our ""special celebration"".

We would thoroughly recommend, if you can, taking the Mayfair Weekends Package which comes with a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne, a voucher for afternoon tea and a late room departure.

However what makes a visit to this hotel so remarkable is the outstanding personal service offered by all the staff. In how many other hotels would an anniversary card be delivered to your room personally signed by a significant number of staff. It is the little touches that make this hotel another outstanding member of the Red Carnation group. 

Set in a quiet road but central area if you want to explore London and feel that you want a hotel which puts service to you as its' first priority visit the Chesterfield.

We will certainly be returning!",5,2013,02,24
105,Great hotel,"We stayed here recently for a weekend break .  We booked the hotel based on reviews on this site, and it didnt disappoint .The staff were warm and efficent from our arrival till our departure . The breakfast is really good and portions are big . The bed was without a doubt, the most comfortable hotel bed i have ever slept in, really out of this world . The location is very convenient to most of the London sights, and to the Tube, which makes getting around so easy .  Location in London comes at a price, but i would consider this hotel to be good value for money . The only short coming i would say, is that we booked a suite . Now, i gather most of the suites would be of a similar size, but by comparison with suites we have enjoyed in other, non London, hotels i would rate them as quite small . Nontheless, i would thoroughly recommend this hotel",5,2013,02,22
105,"A ""brilliant"" stay","We just spent a magical weekend in London and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. 3 adults and two 10 year old boys spent each day touring non stop and it was like returning home every evening to the Chesterfield. The location is perfect, centrally located, and in a beautiful area that is so quiet at night- something which is in total contrast with the Manhattan New York City life we all lead. The staff is welcoming, friendly, and truly ""at your service"". Every evening we enjoyed a snack or a night cap or both in the lovely bar area. The rooms are well appointed, very clean, and the beds are lusciously comfortable. We can't wait to return and would highly recommend the Chesterfield to anyone in search of a terrific boutique hotel in London.",5,2013,02,21
105,Great room!,"We loved the hotel. The room had a good size, the bed was just perfect! Very clean bedroom and bathroom. The shower was one of the best i've seen! The staff was always helpful and nice. We asked to change rooms to one with a street view and they did it right away. I have nothing to complaint at all.",5,2013,02,21
105,A thoroughly relaxing stay - a little bit of pampering,"Just returned from a weekend break with a friend in this great Hotel.  Had a great time - such a relaxing stay and a little oasis in the centre of London.

Staff all extremely friendly and helpful.

Rooms a very high standard although perhaps a little more storage space would be useful.

Food excellent and our Afternoon Tea was delicious.

Excellen location for New Bond Street and Oxford Street and very close to the Parks.

Will definitely be back.",5,2013,02,21
105,Highly recommended,"The Chesterfield is in an Excellent location.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The bar is excellent with, a great atmosphere. The room was very clean and quiet, always a plus in central London.  The bed very comfortable.",5,2013,02,20
105,Cosy in Mayfair.,"Our stay was over a couple of bitterly cold days in early February, so the warm welcome and comfort of our room made for something of a haven from the elements. Our room was very comfortable and quiet, exceptionally well appointed and as clean as a new pin. We liked the potted history of the hotel in the information pack, which lends a fabulous sense of sharing in the lives of some interesting people. Now retired, there are no longer generous expense accounts to meet our costs, so we had intially decided to skip breakfast, though on the basis that were pushing the boat out anyway by staying at The Chesterfield, we decided to forgo financial caution - and jolly glad that we did as this provided a great start to the day, setting us up splendidly for hours tramping around London.  We liked the location - Mayfair affords limitless opportunities for window shopping, and even more of the real sort with Mastercard or Amex unchained - and theatreland is only three stops away on the tube. We'd stay again, without doubt - the visit was something of a special occasion, and The Chesterfield exceeded our expectations in providing this for us. If you are looking to treat yourselves within the budget of ordinary mortals, you'd be hard pressed to find a better place.",5,2013,02,19
105,stay at chesterfield hotel,"we stayed here at the begining of Febuary for 2 nights , it was my birthday treat , the hotel is excellent they realized it was my birthday and the staff all signed a card for me , and gave me a lovely cake , it is these little things which make the stay complete , it is the second time we have stayed here , it is an excellent hotel , the staff are very caring , breakfasts great , the position is good for getting around , we will be staying again",5,2013,02,18
105,Oasis in Mayfair,"My wife and I decided to celebrate St Valentine's with a night out in London rather than the usual disappointing meal. As we had tickets for Rigoletto from the Met at the Curzon, the Chesterfield was a very convenient choice. Not cheap but we got a deal from Hotels.com. The hotel is very nice but, having come back from a trip to South Africa where we stayed in two fabulous hotels, this was not in the same class, so not five stars. For central London the room was beautifully quiet, though quite small. Very nice television and effective remote. Free WiFi worked very well. No mini bar but there was a coffee maker with tea and coffee.",4,2013,02,18
105,First class,"A fine hotel if you are in London for pleasure or business.  Situated in the centre of Mayfair and very well appointed.
Good bedrooms, a good bed and comfortable surroundings.
The bar is inviting and a good range of beers.  Food is available as bar snacks or in the well appointed restaurant.  Of course there is the usual range of room service items which was of high quality.
One of the best nights sleep I have had while travelling on business and an excellent breakfast,  well done and thank you to the staff for their high quality work.",5,2013,02,17
105,A wonderful hotel,"My friend and I took a week-long trip to London and some friends recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair. From the time we arrived, the staff was wonderful, friendly and couldn't have been more helpful. Both of us had been to London many years ago and were traveling without our husbands. Our rooms were quickly upgraded for a small fee and were lovely and clean. The head housekeeper, Christine, came to my room when I arrived and asked if I needed my pillows changed because they were down (I did and it was done immediately). The rooms were very quiet and the hotel's location is in a beautiful area within easy walking distance of the tube. The concierge, Chris Campbell, was extremely helpful in making reservations and helping us with any advice we needed. We had planned on eating breakfast out of the hotel to avoid the expense but it is such a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere that we wound up eating there every morning. The 2 dinners we ate in their restaurant were delicious and the service was excellent. When I arrived home, I realized I had left a pair of glasses there and e-mailed Christine to see if they had been found. A week later, they are home with me although I would have preferred the pleasure of returning and picking them up myself! London is a fantastic city and I will return to this hotel without hesitation.",5,2013,02,16
105,Perfect Celebration,"Celebrated Mrs Cs birthday with afternoon tea for six at the Chesterfield. We enjoyed drinks in the bar beforehand. The staff were friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Mother in law is a fussy whatsit but even she thought this was perfection, only member of the party disappointed was my daughter (15) who wanted to take Ronaldo home! ",5,2013,02,13
105,Simply incredible staff make this a five star experience,"I have just departed from the Chesterfield after an unintentionally long stay.  After arriving in London from Australia, I had the misfortune to fall seriously ill and spent over a week in hospital.  After calling the police to find me when I did not return to the hotel,  the manager arranged for some of my belongings to be brought to me in hospital, along with a very thoughtful gift bag with fresh fruit and candy and a card signed by many of the staff.  He also arranged for my room to be booked through for the ten days I had to stay in London after being discharged, before I was ruled fit to fly.  All of this was handled with no drama or fuss and it was such a relief, in my sadly weakened state, to know all of this was taken care of.  When I returned to the hotel, I was basically bedridden for the first week, and the lovely housekeeping staff just cleaned around me, often as I slept.  I would wake to find fresh water by my bedside, and clean towels.  The room service staff brought me meals and politely ignored my pajamas and shawls and the lovely Lourdes brightened my mornings with her good cheer.  When I was finally able to get up and about, the concierge and doormen, and the desk staff (especially Sabine and Sarah) were so sweet and helpful.  Really, if you are going to have a life and death experience far away from home, then this hotel is the perfect place to recuperate.

Bouquets of thanks and gratitude all around.",5,2013,02,13
105,Great Location,Stayed for one night on business. Lovely hotel. Great bed but room mostly taken up by bed. Nice bar and excellent room service breakfast. Expensive for room but great location and I would stay again if I could get room for reasonable price.,4,2013,02,13
105,Outstanding Afternoon Tea,"I had never had a high tea in London before and wasn't sure what to expect. The Chesterfield Hotel made my birthday very very special and i would highly reccommend! Nothing was too much of a problem for the staff. Even dietry requirements were catered for without question eg gluten free. We had a fantastic waiter who had good knowledge on the cakes and teas. It was a lovely touch to be given a cake with a candle and for all to sing happy birthday. Also to take cakes home in a lovely box with a flower. 
The whole experience was faultless, huge thanks to all staff x",5,2013,02,12
105,"""Excellent""","We have had lunch at this hotel before,and it was excellent. So we decided to stay, and it didnt dissapoint, the staff are all very friendly,and nothing was too much. The room was great, and had everything you would need for your stay. I would recomend the afternoon tea, but book before you go, as it gets busy. We had bar snacks in the evening, which is a relaxed  atmosphere, breakfast was 1st class, we couldnt fault this hotel, and we will be returning.",5,2013,02,12
105,Excellent,"We have just spent the weekend at this hotel and can only echo previous comments in that we found our stay excellent.  If you can get the weekend break deal it is even better value.  This included afternoon tea and a bottle of bubbly and breakfast (I must say I would not pay £22 for breakfast which is the normal rate!!).  As others have said, the staff are friendly without being overbearing and the bar is a lovely place to return to after a hard day sightseeing or for a nightcap after the theatre. Will definitely come back for another theatre break.  Location is good too - 5 mins walk from Green Park tube.",5,2013,02,11
105,Thoroughly pleasant experience,"A thoroughly pleasant experience. A friendly welcome on arrival from all staff members. Room was perfect - attention to detail not usually found in hotels (such as scissors, sellotape..!). Only negative was extractor noise outside the window - meaning not possible to open the window at night. Cosy bar - lovely reading room - good quality food. All in all a really good option for staying in a small quality hotel in London..",5,2013,02,11
105,Superb Hotel,"Best value for money I have ever experienced.  
Service genuinely warm, friendly and efficient. Staff not looking for tips.

Great location, great restaurants, great choices on the menus, atmospheric bar, clean comfortable rooms.

I had nothing to complain about at any time; but plenty to be thankful for.  Nothing was too much trouble for both management and staff.",5,2013,02,06
105,Delicious and elegant afternoon tea,"My husband, my daughter and I read enthusiastic reviews and had afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was worth it! The Conservatory is an elegant and cheerful room, decorated in cream and green. The Chesterfield in general has the looks and atmosphere of an elegant and aristocratic past, but it is not a bit rundown, quite the opposite. The tea was also perfectly traditional, but this is what we expected: fresh from the oven scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream, delicious and light cakes, very good sandwiches, and an excellent though unsurprising array of teas. A young Japanese couple was carefully photographing each and every little cake. They certainly chose the perfect place for their ultimately British high tea experience, and so did we! I hope to stay at the Chesterfield next time I travel to London.",5,2013,02,06
105,A very comortable stay in the heart of London,"Our stay at the Mayfair was sublime. Although it is only a smallish hotel, the facilities and quality of accommodation are on a par with all but the very best of London hotels. As one would expect of a good hotel in Mayfair, the service was superb and the staff exceptionally friendly and efficient; nothing was too much trouble. One of the hotel's real attractions is the bar. Not only is it very well stocked, but the bar staff are excellent at providing a variety of cocktails and the wines are exceedingly good. The food here is also interesting and really very good. We didn't use the restaurant but the bar food and room service kept us as happy one could want. The croque monsieur is sublime! London hotels can be a disappointment, with small rooms, tired decor and average food, but the Mayfair was not on any level. We really look forward staying again.",5,2013,02,05
105,Wonderful service.  A great treat!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for one night as a theatre break I gave my husband for Christmas.  Even before we arrived the hotel helped by booking our theatre tickets to 'Jersey Boys' (excellent seats) and had the tickets ready for us when we checked in.  We arrived around 10 am and were able to immediately check into our room which was comfortable and had many amenities that most other places don't provide (like office supplies in the desk and Sky Sports channels free in the room).  After theatre we returned to the hotel and dined in their restaurant..  When I booked (online) I mentioned that I am allergic to garlic.  As soon as we arrived at the restaurant the staff who greeted us assured me that they could prepare most dishes on the menu without garlic.  I was impressed by this attention to detail and to my safety.

Not only was my dinner garlic-free, it was delicious!  As was our English breakfast the following morning.

I can't imagine a better place to celebrate a special occasion.  I've already highly recommended the Chersterfield to our friends.",5,2013,02,05
105,"Outstanding service, no detail to small..","We stayed that The Chesterfield on the Mayfair Weekend rate which was excellent value. On arrival we were made most welcome and although we arrived early the room was ready and we were escorted to the room. We were allocated 416 superior king size room, it was smaller than we had anticipared and the view from the small window was of the backs of other buildings. The marble tiled bathroom with over head shower was also quite small. However the room was very well furnished, quiet and warm with a good a/c system, the bed was most comfortable with all the pre-ordered pillows in place, Frankly the room was more than adequate for our two night stay and although I am a little over 6 foot I had no problem with the shower great strength, felt like a power shower, bath is small but hey the towels and robes were soft and cosy.We would be pedants to say anything meaningfully negative. If pushed our only negative on the room would be the safe which although lap top size it is at floor level. I have new knees and it was not all that easy to get down to.The room was made up while we had breakfast and again in the evening each time with complimentary still and sparking waters, tea coffee and biscuits.
The most exceptional experiance of our stay was, without any excep[tions,  the level of warm and friendly service given with a smile by ALL the staff. They make you feel at ease, being proffessionally proficient yet capable of real warmth and clearly enjoying working for RCH. We enjoyed both breafasts when all our requests were delivered. The afternoon tea experiance, which was included in the rate,was delightful and substaincial, we eat at 4:30pm and needed no more for the rest of the day.The sellections of tea were the largest I have come accross. The bar staff are very welcoming will have a chat but not overbearing, the seem to know exactly how to handle themselves. Wine around £7.50-£9.50 + for 250ml is good value for a bar like this in London and the snacks are also worth trying.
To sum up we would recommend the Chesterfield for its location, comfort and staff, overall a lovely happy experiance which we have every intention of repeating. No request to large no detail to small.- OUTSTANDING (so pleased we did not return to The Savoy, or The Mayfair)",5,2013,02,04
105,15 year wedding anniversary,"My wife and me spent a weekend in London to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was outstanding. The staff was friendly and the service was very good. The concierge team helped us with restaturant tips and bookings (my wife is still talking about those restaurants..). The room was clean. The bed was very comfortable. I can go on, but the afternoon tea must be experienced as well as the atmosphere in the bar.",5,2013,02,03
105,Continues to deliver.,"Another very comfortable and enjoyable stay at this lovely hotel. We have stayed many times and it never fails to please. Very warm and welcoming once again. The bar staff have improved since our last visit, much more jolly and fun to talk to. The piano player gets it just right for atmosphere. The restaurant continues to be excellent at breakfast and we enjoyed both dinner in the restaurant and a bar snack in the bar. Once again the service was faultless. Although we always stay in the same room the reception took time to let us know about other lovely rooms if we ever want to try a change.Thanks for another lovely stay until the next time.",5,2013,02,03
105,husbands 60th,"Stayed there for one night for my husbands 60th birthday, everything was perfect room lovely, bed comfortable,  breakfast so much choice,  all staff exceptionally kind, and curtious and nothing was any trouble.  Next day all our family came up for afternoon tea, which we had in the wonderful liberary.  The food sandwiches,  (cakes to die for) was fab.  Kept filling up our plates until we could eat not more and then put cakes and more , into special boxes for us to take home.  I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone comming up to london and we cant wait to go back,  would not of changed a thing about our whole weekend at the chesterfield.  Except maybe the snow!!!!!",5,2013,01,31
105,Wonderful Hotel,"This was our fourth visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair and as per usual, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a very convenient location for both sightseeing and shopping. The room was beautifully decorated with added touches and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in. I think what sets this hotel apart from others is the staff, who are the most friendliest and most helpful we have ever encountered before in hotels in London. After a night at the theatre it was very relaxing to return to the hotel, sit in the bar where we thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful piano playing and being looked after by the attentive barstaff. Would highly recommend this hotel (and have done to many people)",5,2013,01,29
105,It's about the little things,"I took my mother to the Chesterfield for her birthday as the reviews had been very positive, it certainly didn't disappoint. There were so many lovely little touches that just made the stay so memorable. On the first night my mother was brought a lovely birthday cupcake and signed card to our room. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and polite. Sam and Wasim were very helpful when booking afternoon tea. The scones we had were out of this world, really delicious! Would definitely recommend a stay here!",5,2013,01,27
105,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Location","My wife and I and our 13yr old son stayed here for four nights a couple of weeks before Christmas. The hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance of either Green Park tube station or Oxford St which is a 15-20 min walk. 

We stayed in a suite which was very well maintained and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and we both slept well. The staff made up a separate bed for our son and he was very comfortable. Overall the suite was big enough for the three of us and our son was quite please to see that they supplied the use of a Nintendo Wii.

The hotel is of a high standard and we had great service. Breakfast was fine although we had a couple of language issues with some of the staff as English was not their first language, as well as a couple of quality issues. However the Food and Beverages manager was very happy to listen to any complaints and suggestions and overall gave the impression that they would strive to fix any problems.

The bar area was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful, it was nice to have the piano being played and we had a nice bar lunch here on our final day. We did not eat an evening meal in the hotel restaurant.

We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and although toward the upper end of the market it was not too stuffy and we felt very comfortable here. We will hopefully be back later in the year.",5,2013,01,26
105,Fabulous place to stay,"I stayed here for 3 nights for business in January 13 and really loved it. I would definitely come back again. 

My room was on the 7th floor, it had a really gorgeous feel to it - oldworldy and comfortable, but still new and convenient. The hotel is very well maintained. The bed was super comfortable and I had a choice of 4 pillows of different heights. I slept incredibly well. The rooms were also very quiet. I could not hear any noise at all which is fantastic, combined with the heavy block out blinds and you were in your own world. 

The bathroom had a shower over bath, and one night I did use the complimentary bath salts and had a relaxing soak in a good sized bath. The towels were lovely and fluffy and the provided amenities really good. 

I had 2 breakfasts at the Butler's restaurant. Both were really nice, but I would have to recommend the porridge as an excellent start on a cold winters day. The coffee was very good. 

All of the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is well appointed, quite, convenient and the staff were lovely.",5,2013,01,26
105,One of the best hotels in London,"As I have just said in my title, in terms of hotels in London which I have stayed in, this is definitely the best! Excellent rates accessed by exclusivelymayfair.co.uk The service was always friendly and helpful, particularly one lady, Pauline, at breakfast who was always attentive and helpful and extremely friendly! The beds are extremely comfortable, the rooms look gorgeous and the location is perfect, close enough to walk to Regent Street and Oxford Street, and right next to a tube station for travel further away. I will definitely try to go back!",5,2013,01,25
105,Just feel at home ... and get surprised on your birthday !,"In a cold weekend in january we really felt at home in this wonderfull hotel.  The hotel is situated  in the city centre, near Green Park Subway station, in a calm street near Berkeley Square.  The room was perfect, the staff very helpfull, the roommaid very friendly.  The soft bed and luxurious armchairs made us feel like in heaven, the staff made us feel like home.
We went to London for the 10th birthday of our son.  He was thrilled when he got a birthdaycake and some fruit, a birthdaycard from the staff.  Breakfast next morning also was a treat and the perfect ending for a nice stay in this wonderfull hotel!",5,2013,01,24
105,This the best small hotel in London,"It used to be a gentleman,s club and has still character off it but the rooms are fabulous have stayed 6times and in different room each time but all as good the weekend special are good you get free afternoon tea and Champagne in your room when you arrive it is close to green park and to new bond street not cheap to stay but for a special occasion they will pull out all the stops I celebrated my 65th birthday and my pearl wedding there last nov and they made us feel like stars",5,2013,01,23
105,extremely comfortable; superb staff,"my wife and I stayed for a long weekend at this brilliantly positioned hotel, just off Piccadilly and virtually on Berkeley Square. the weather was foul, but there's always so much to do in London that this didn't take the edge off it. Returning to the hotel after battling the snow was a treat. A very comfortable welcoming place with genuinely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff. For that part of London, the set lunch is a bargain at £19. for two courses or £21 for three courses. In comparison, the full English breakfast at £22 might be thought by some to be expensive.",5,2013,01,23
105,A most wonderful Christmas.,"My partner and I spent five nights at the Chesterfield over Christmas and had a wonderful time. We always go away for Christmas and usually stay in Country House Hotels but decided on having a break in London this time round.  We could find no fault with any aspect of the Chesterfield because of the attention given to even the smallest detail by the wonderful staff.
All the food was superb but we were very impressed to see the Christmas day turkeys actually being carved in the restaurant - perfect. We will definitely go back and would highly recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone - you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,01,23
105,Great hotel and a great price.,"You Can't find a better hotel in this area of London without paying a small fortune. I highly recommend this hotel. It was Clean, safe, quiet, in a great location, with a friendly and attentive staff - all you can ask for in a hotel. I will definitely stay here again. Loved the old world interior design and decorations. It gave the hotel a lot of charm. I did not get a chance to try the restaurant or bar but it looked nice and did have a lot of people in it. The red carnation was a nice touch. ",5,2013,01,20
105,A little gem in the right place.,"My Husband and I have stayed here twice,and on each occasion we found from the time you get out of the taxi the service is impeccible,nothing to too much trouble for the staff,and they are all so nice,The hotel is beatifully decorated and very scupmtuous,The breakfast cooked to order is delicious,and there is so much to choose from.We highly recommend the aftenoon tea in the Conservatory,it is very special.Cannot wait to visit this wonderful hotel again,it a real pleasure to be there.",5,2013,01,20
105,'Five star experience again',Another wonderful stay at this lovely hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  The service and attention to detail are second to none.  Enjoyed every aspect of the hotel from the tastefully decorated bedroom with partial view of Green Park to the great breakfast and afternoon tea.  Looking forward to return visit next month.,5,2013,01,20
105,Thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"The lobby with it's beautiful holiday decorations and wonderful hot chocolate was the beginning of a lovely week at the Chesterfield.  We enjoyed afternoon tea in the atrium, very pleasant service in the dining room and excellent room service.  The rooms are small but well appointed and very clean.  The location was perfect for walks to Piccadilly, Bond Street, Hyde Park and Harrods.  We hope to return one day.",5,2013,01,17
105,Amazing room Service,"On the way out of the hotel to attend a dinner I bumped into Sylvie? Room service, and asked her, if at all possible, if she could put some honey, lemon and a shot of brandy in my room as I had a head cold....on my return, late that night, the ingredients of a perfect hot toddy was there waiting for me with a note saying ""I hope this makes you feel better!"" WOW just the fact Sylvie had put it in the room made me feel better!! Service like this deserves recognition!! Well done Sylvie carry on like that and you will exceed all your goals in your career!!

105,Wonderful experience again,"This is my third stay at the Chesterfield Inn.  Overall my stay was excellent.  Good Service.  Restaurant nice selection.  The only issue I had was that I requested non allergic bedding when I booked the room on-line.  When I arrived I reminded the front desk.  After the first sleepless night of wheezing, I asked them to change out the bedding.  They responded right away.  I then slept fine.  The location in Mayfair is just perfect. Very safe and great restaurants. No more than a 5-10 minute walk to the tube depending how fast you walk.  I will return to this hotel.",5,2013,01,12
105,Lovely classic Mayfair hotel,"Wonderful stay over new year holiday.  Staff had a special Xmas treat/candy waiting for my son.  Hotel was beautifully decorated for Xmas.   Location is superb; few minutes to Green Park Underground station (Piccadilly Line), regent/Oxford streets, and a block from restaurants of Shepherds Market.  Also about 10 minutes from Hyde Park and about 15 minute walk to Buckingham Palace.    Each room is lovely and uniquely decorated.  Maid staff wonderful and turn down service twice a day.  Front desk staff very helpful.   Restaurant on site good but quite expensive.  ",5,2013,01,10
105,"Very nice and friendly, fantastic location","The location of this hotel is perfect: very near everything, including Regent Street or Berkeley Square to the East, and Hyde Park and Harrods to the West; it's maybe 50 yards away from Shepherd Market where there are nice pubs and restaurants. And yet it's on a quiet street, with very few cars and little noise.

The people are very nice and welcoming.

Downsides include
- Very slow breakfast. Not enough people serving it
- Relatively small rooms
- High prices (but this is Central London; what can we expect...?)",4,2013,01,10
105,Home Away from Home in London,"I had spent twenty-seven years living in Mount Street, London - and commuting frequently to Oxford - and it has been very difficult to move away, when I retired from teaching in Oxford and attending patients in several London's hospitals. My wife and I have been living in South of France for the past ten years, but, quite naturally, we have been taking every opportunity to returne to London under every possible pretext.

We had tried several good hotels in London after our move out of UK, until we found the Chesterfield Mayfair - and we have never looked back. The Chesterfield is a real ""home away from home"", to use a cliche - a place where every guest is taken care of in an exemplary manner, a place uniquely capable of inducing the ""atmosphere of family"", so often lacking in even the best hotels elsewhere. The staff of the Chesterfield succeeded in creating a well-coordinated team, all of its members seamlessly surrounding every guest with service with a capital S, day and night. 

I could rave about individual points, such as the marvellous afternoon teas in Chesterfield, the unbelievably well informed and willing concierges team - but I wish to stress just one point which is most important  to us - and to many of the co-guests of Chesterfield with whom we have spoken over the years. We have a little, very well-behaved White West Highland Terrier dog, who travels with us everywhere - and in Chesterfield, unlike in some short-sighted hotels around, he is not only accepted, but he is made genuinely welcome by everybody.

I can warmly recommend Chesterfield Mayfair to everybody who comes to London - and who wishes to spend his time in this beautiful city surrounded by excellence in every sense of the term. I can guarantee you that you will be returned forever after.

105,Birthday afternoon tea,"We had a lovely afternoon tea today for a special birthday. We had a party of 8, including two children. The food was delicious and refilled whenever we wanted it. The children had the Princess menu which was just right for them and changing the sandwich filling option was no trouble. In fact, nothing was any trouble, including asking the pianist to play Happy Birthday for us. When the staff heard it was a birthday they produced a cupcake with a candle and sang happy birthday again! Our waitress, Nelly, was a star and even brought over a little teddy for each child when they we getting grumpy. A really special way to celebrate and we would recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair for London afternoon tea.",5,2013,01,05
105,Truly excellent,"My wife and I stayed here 28th to 31st December.
Both being JUST the wrong side of 60 , we are well travelled and appreciate the good things in life but do not like to feel we are being taken advantage of.
Our stay at this hotel was truly excellent.
Situation ; the middle of Mayfair , brilliant.
Cleanliness ; 5 star.
Decor ; 5 star.
Evening meals ; 5 star ( Loris , you were 7 star , thank you )
Afternoon tea ; 5 star
Breakfast ; 7 STAR - outstanding, best ever.
Waiting staff ; 5 star
Bar staff ; 5 star ( Paul and Adam you were 7 star , cheers )

If I had a minor gripe , it is expensive to use the the bar , but it is London and it is Mayfair,
 so it was never going to be cheap.

Overall then , a very special short break , made extra special by the way we were treated by the staff.

Hopefully back again in March for my wife's birthday.",5,2013,01,04
105,Would definitely return,"We stayed here on New Years Eve night. At check in we were surprised to hear that we had been upgraded to one of their executive suites.  The Philippe Suite was amazing - large and immaculately furnished.  The staff were all very friendly during our one night stay.  The hotel is in a great location in easy walking distance to alot of the sights of London.  The breakfast on new years day was very nice, although we had to wait a while for the tables to be laid.  All in all a very good stay and would recommend to others.",5,2013,01,04
105,Excellent!,"Spent Christmas and New Years in London, staying at the Chesterfield, and it felt just like home! Attention to detail was superb: we also received a Christmas present from 'Father Christmas' which my daughter absolutely loved. The festive atmosphere was fantastic with a great bar where my husband and I stayed in the evening when the kids were finally asleep! Out of all the hotels I've stayed in this has by far been the most convincing!",5,2013,01,02
105,Chesterfield delivered a great experience again...plus location is spot on,"As is a tradition,  we entertain a group from a Company we are in a Business partnership with, to a meal in the run up to Xmas in central London. We are from Manchester & look to stay over for the night.
 This year we picked to eat at Langans just off Piccadily,  & I wanted to stay close by to avoid rushing around in cabs too much. I received a central e mail from the Hotel ref availability etc for up to Xmas. I e mail back via this & received details from the General Manager ref my requirement for 3 rooms for 1 night. £160 plus vat for 3 double rooms ( dont like single rooms) to include breakfast. Compared to Manchester expensive but for this part of London in a good hotel---NO its not.
   Stayed here 2 years ago & loved the small hotel feel & the location is spot on, quiet street but 5 mins walk & you are opposite the Ritz on Piccadily.
 We all checked in via 3 staff on the desk with no fuss, up to our rooms which were all along the same corridor on the same floor . We only spent about 45 mins in our rooms to shower  change before meeting in the bar. Room was a good size with a huge bed full of pillows & cushions, work area if required  for Business as well as some chairs to relax in. Bright bathroom with large bath & rain shower. 2 large wardrobe spaces with iron & board if you unpack anything creased!
 The public areas had a quality fell with all the decor & furnishings & the Xmas decorations added to a wonderfull seasonal buzz to the place. Really loved the cottage made out of sweets in the main hall area.
 Pleasant bar area with resident pianist as we had our first drink of the night before heading off out............remembering the bar, we returned post midnight to the bar in the hotel with our Business colleagues & had a couple of rounds of hot & cold drinks before they headed off & we retired to our rooms. I found a note in the room along with a mince pie left as part of the turn down service ( the note said I had missed the complimentary canapes--- but by calling room service they would deliver them) I didn't but thought it a very nice touch.

 Breakfast the following morning was taken in a very pleasant room , I would imagine in summer is an even greater experience as I noted the patio area through some large French doors. Lots of choices of juice/ fruit/ cereals etc & a wonderfull full English was enjoyed by the 3 of us, again with very efficient & pleasant staff.

 To sum up despite our fairly brief visit ( & time spent in the hotel) we came away feeling that it had been a pleasure staying & not just a convenient place to put our heads down for the night. 
To stay for Business or for pleasure would be an enjoyable experience at the Chesterfield.

 Would we stay here again ...... looking forward to our third stay for sure.

105,Second time just as good,"My daughter and I stayed here last year while visiting London for a theatre trip. It was so good that we went back with all the family, including our three year old Grandson, to see the Lion King and the Snowman just before Christmas this year.
We weren't disappointed, from the excellent Concierge service on arrival and departure to the lovely friendly Reception and Restaurant staff, even my old fella couldn't fault it!
The rooms are spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated, the Restaurant has Leopard print curtain backing and carpet (an instant attraction for me!) and all food experienced was excellent. At the time of our stay breakfast was included in the price, my only sorrow was that I didn't have time to have one of the hotel's superb afternoon teas. 
Our Grandson received a wrapped present mysteriously left in the room from Father Christmas, with his name on it. What a lovely touch! 
This is without doubt an excellent hotel in an extremely convenient location - a short walk to the tube, bus and Hyde Park, where we were able to walk to the Winter Wonderland and Markets. 
It is also very easy to get to theatre land from here, or in the other direction Harrods etc.
We will be back - can't wait!",5,2012,12,30
105,Afternoon Tea at Butlers,"We spent the afternoon having a traditional tea,which was a treat for my wife's birthday.We were not disappointed .First of all a nice glass of chilled Champagne followed a good selection of finger sandwiches,pastries and scones,A good selection of teas available,with top ups and tea and sandwiches replenished if required.Loris and his team were polite,courteous and always on hand if required.Finally the whole tea was rounded off with Loris and his team presenting my wife with a small pastry with a lighted candle,a small posy of flowers and singing Happy birthday,A truly memorable occasion,made all the better by attentive staff,We are pleased that we chose the Chesterfield and will definitely return.",5,2012,12,30
105,A lovely Christmas,"We stayed for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and returned on Boxing Day, we were looked after and made to feel very welcome, the food was amazing and High Tea was lovely. We had a lovely time and a beautiful London location, really glad we stayed and loved every minute of it, thanks for making it a lovely Christmas!",5,2012,12,27
105,Lovely traditional style hotel with contemporary feel in ideal central location,"We chose this for location - easy walking distance to shopping streets (Regent St/Bond St/Piccadilly) and good choice of restaurants etc. On arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff and shown to our room which, although not huge, was beautifully decorated and comfortable. In fact, it soon became clear that the hotel mantra is to make guests as comfortable as possible and coffee/tea making facilities, bathrobes/slippers etc all provided plus various internet facilities in-room and (hurrah) free Wi Fi. Even an ironing board and iron were placed in the wardrobe. A lot of thought had gone into every detail which all made for a relaxing stay. My only gripe with the room was a hum from extractor fans outside and from the aircon - both were 'just enough' white noise to be OK.

There is a comfortable bar with a club like feel to it and a pianist in the early evening. We didn't try the restaurant as we had a function to attend but breakfast the next day provided everything from Eggs Benedict, pancakes and other dishes to suit all tastes - more importantly the service was attentive and quick, a rarity in major UK city hotels I've found.

All in all, what had been booked as a quick stopover turned out to be a very relaxing and enjoyable trip. Credit is due to the staff, all of whom were efficient, friendly and helpful.

I will definitely be returning and give full marks to this hotel in its class.",5,2012,12,26
105,Classic London hotel,"Keeping in mind that one should never expect large rooms in an old London hotel, the Chesterfield is excellently located, comfortable, characterful, and has helpful, efficient staff. Very handy for the art galleries around Green Park, the boutiques of Bond Street, and within walking distance of several London tourist draws and theatreland.",4,2012,12,19
105,lovely mayfair hotel,"Wonderfully located old hotel in charles street.
Excellent service with staff going out of their way to help you.
Rooms are very small however, and poorly soundproofed towards the corridor.
So you can hear what people are doind or talking about in their rooms walking down or when trying to sleep you can also hear what people say in the corridor - not ideal.
Bathrooms are also really small with one fixed showerhead which is not suited for anyone over 6 feet of height.
Otherwise the rooms are nice, the beds comfortable, and the restaurant and common areas just charming.",4,2012,12,18
105,Very nice Hotel,It´s a very nice Hotel will lovely service! I only stayed for one night because it was a business trip. The Hotel is located near shopingcenters and it feels like it is close to everything. The breakfast was also excellent.,5,2012,12,11
105,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for 1 night with my husband.  We walked in to the luxurious lobby and were immediately wowed.  It was beautifully decorated with one of the biggest Christmas trees we have ever seen and the live piano playing which was filtering through from the relaxing bar made us immediately feel that we were staying somewhere very special.  We had a fast, efficient check in which was necessary as we had a half hour turn around time before going to a show.  We stayed in 'The Study'.  The room was as luxurious as everything we had seen so far, fabulously decorated with a huge window with a view out on to a lovely London street and the walls were adorned with carved books which gave it character and interest and made it so different from staying in a basic 'modern' hotel room.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and my husband who is 6'4"", fit comfortably into the huge sleigh bed.   We opted to have breakfast in bed which was a wonderful treat.  The variety and choice was amazing and it tasted fantastic too.  All staff were friendly and helpful - we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the Chesterfield.",5,2012,12,09
105,Quiet luxury,"I ended up checking into the hotel very late and was upgraded to the Dormer Suite which was fantastic; big bedroom, huge comfy bed, full wardrobe, two showers in bathroom and one deep bath, hallway connecting the bedroom to a large lounge with leather couch, table, writing desk and well stocked minibar. I had a great time staying here and my breakfast was delivered bang on time and was delicious (eggs Benedict). Very classy hotel, attentive and friendly staff, and a bargain for the area and quality of the rooms.",5,2012,12,08
105,Superb,"I frequently have to stay in London and have tried most of the 4/5* hotels and the Chesterfield is, in my opinion, the best. The staff are extremely helpful, the rooms nicely decorated, beds and (very important) the pillows are very comfortable.On the last visit I had dinner in Butlers Restaurant and the food was delicious, the chicken with pistachio crust and foie gras was absolutely superb. It is now my regular place to stay.",5,2012,12,08
105,Bed was fabulous.....will be returning!,"First stay at this hotel. My main objective when looking for a good hotel is a really good bed....and that is what I got. It was heavenly. Deep mattress, proper pillows.....slept like a log! Bathroom has everything you need. Staff are very helpful. No minibar but they have prompt room service so it doesn't matter at all.",5,2012,12,07
105,perfection!,"this hotel was 100% everything i was looking for in a hotel in london. every member of the staff was exceptional.  we worked the concierges hard and they never disappointed. check in was quick, a room was ready even though we were early, the bed was super comfy, and the room was beautiful.  our view stunk, but who cares? hotel is located less than 5 minutes from the green park tube station, a great central line that we could go everywhere from. we walked to hyde park(where there was a winter carnival going on at the time), buckingham palace(but it is a long walk), and even to piccadilli. the hotel accommodated out gluten free requests without fail.  the high tea was fantastic! i can not think of one thing they could have done to improve. i highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,12,07
105,Consistently Excels!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Chesterfield last year but I decided to check-out alternative hotels and offers before booking what seems to have become an annual “Mayfair Ladies” event.  “Us” four ladies are of a certain mature age which we completely refuse to disclose and are all current, or ex-businesswomen – including two restaurateurs. Our expectations are high but not unrealistic. The Chesterfield offers were too good to resist, so, we booked their Mayfair weekend package.  This included afternoon tea for two, a bottle of premium champagne per room and a 6pm checkout. Often a return visit to a hotel doesn’t match expectations and there are certainly areas in the hotel that would benefit from a little decorative “touch-up”.  However, I am delighted to say that the standard of guest service cannot be faulted.  We had a very embarrassing mix-up with room allocations on the first night for our two guests from Mallorca.  Lorna, the very lovely Irish Duty Manager sorted everything out to our complete satisfaction - not an easy task! She completely won us over and we have already given her our “Mayfair Ladies” booking for next year.  Also, there are huge improvements in the bar area.  Paul, the bar manager just excels at what he does.  We were very, very impressed by the standard of service and attention he gave us and everyone else and look forward to meeting with him again next year.  In summary, the Chesterfield appeal to a wide range of clientele - there was a wedding, a baby shower, a hen party and us…!  Certainly, us ladies feel it is a very safe and comfortable place for independent female travellers – irrespective of age.  Without doubt, there are “posher” hotels in the area but no matter what you pay you will really be hard pressed to find one that offers the amazing guest service and individual attention that you will find at the Chesterfield.",5,2012,12,03
105,Excellent  London Hotel,"The Chesterfield is tucked away in a quiet Mayfair street, but still within easy reach of the West End.
It  offers a  excellent friendly service with a touch of luxury. It has everything you could want for a business or leisure break in London.  We will certainly be back.",5,2012,12,01
105,Exceptional attention to detail,"My husband has stayed at the Chesterfield on several occasions mainly for business reasons and I was delighted to join him on one of these. The rooms are comfortable, beautifully appointed but the reason we shall return time and time again is that the attention to detail is unsurpassed. The food and especially the wine (Galpin Peak Pinot Noir - do try it) is superb. Location is excellent and the service we have had from all the staff has been exceptional, in particular one gentleman at the Front Desk (Chris Campbell) went out of his way to ensure that our stay was enjoyable.  I have no hesitation in recommending the Chesterfield.",5,2012,12,01
105,Great Lunch,"Went to Butlers restaurant for lunch had an fantastic meal, Scollop the biggest i've ever seen, juicy crab cakes really tastey very good pairing of wines out standing service. a very well kept secret in the middle o Mayfair",5,2012,11,30
105,Great choice for London!,"My sister and I stayed at the Chesterfield for 5 nights in August 2012 and our stay was spectacular!  It was my sister's first time to Europe, so I wanted our stay in London to be special.  I spent many hours looking for a perfect hotel, on TA and in guidebooks.  And we found it!
     I've been to London a few times before and really enjoyed my stays at some lovely hotels:  the Dorchester in 2008, the JW Marriott Grosvenor House this past spring 2012.  But the Chesterfield Mayfair has them all beat!  The hotel has a great location: in elegant Mayfair on a charming and quiet block.  The hotel is fairly close to the Green Park tube station and a few bus stops.  (a bit far if you are elderly or disabled though)  A few minutes walk away takes you to Hyde Park or Green Park for a lovely walk.  Shepherd's Market (lots of restaurants) is two blocks away.
     We arrived at 10 AM after an overnight flight from the US and our room wasn't ready.  Checkin and the welcome was lovely.  They stored our luggage and gave us some brochures and a map.  Service during our stay was very friendly.  When we arrived back later in the day our room was ready and the luggage was already dropped off.  We had a Mayfair Weekend Package and received complimentary champagne upon arrival, breakfast during our stay, and an afternoon tea for the two of us.
     We decided to have our tea on our day of arrival.  It was great!  Four years ago I had tea with my family at the Dorchester and found it to be lovely surroundings, but too snobby.  This was just right.  Service was wonderful.  We both opted for hot cocoa since we don't drink tea (embarrassing!) and received a 3-tier tray with 4/5 choices of sandwiches, scones and clotted cream/preserves and 6 pastries.  We were offered seconds and told we could take the rest home if we wanted.  The setting was beautiful too.
     The breakfast was also great.  There was a lovely continental breakfast spread - pastries, breads, rolls, fruit, yogurts, etc.  And then you were offered a choice of a freshly-made-to-order hot item.  My omelettes were delicious!
     Our room was lovely.  We requested two twin beds and received our request.  It was a little small, compared to hotels in the US, but we were aware of that ahead of time.  Room was clean, beautifully decorated, and quiet.  The room had plenty of dresser/drawer space and two closets.  There was a turn-down service at night, and a little treat was given each day - a candy, cookie, biscuit, etc.  The bathroom was black and white carrera marble, hotel gave lovely toiletries too.  Bathtub was a little difficult to get out of though.  The lobby, restaurant, library and bar were all beautifully decorated.  But the service was the best.  They were all friendly and personable, not snotty like at some of the other hotels.
     I've now stayed at some great places in London - the ones I listed above plus The Lime Tree Inn (Belgravia) and The Hilton Paddington and enjoyed all of them.  However, my favorite is definitely The Chesterfield Mayfair.  This is the one I would return to on my next trip!  Bravo to the staff!  I hope to be back again soon!",5,2012,11,30
105,Great !,"Great value, location, and staff. Just stayed at the Chesterfield for the third time. It is now my only hotel in London. The rooms are quiet and spacious for London, with a feeling of luxury. The pub and restaurant  super. Breakfast is worth getting up for.The staff is very welcoming and very helpful. The location is excellent as the tube, the bus and the sights are an easy walk. Shepherds market,with a great choice of restaurants and a pub is just a block away.I look forward to my next stay.",5,2012,11,29
105,Awful. Don't stay there.,"The hotel was disappointing to say the least. The one great benefit of it is that it is located close to Green Park and is in the City Centre. 
Upon arriving at the hotel, I noticed a very strange smell of chemicals in the room which could not be lessened by opening the window. I reported it twice to the reception and even though the hotel manager did come down and promise to fix it, it was never done. Upon asking the maid if it was due to chemicals we got the cheerful reply that it was none of her business before she walked out the door.
Breakfast was absolutely repulsive, although afternoon tea was quite nice. 
In general, I was very disappointed with the hotel and the unhelpful staff; I will never advise it to anyone and would rather get beaten by a stick than go there again -  a true waste of money.",1,2012,11,28
105,"A quiet, old-fashioned-elegance hotel gem with 21st- century standards that we will return to and recommend to friends.","www.chesterfieldmayfair.com/
          We [family of four with two children 13 and 16] spent an extended Thanksgiving weekend there past 22nd-25th November 2012, which was great! They have very good service and courtesy meets you at the front stairs. We will choose this hotel again for our next visit to London – hopefully very soon since there is so much more to explore!

          It doesn’t matter if you are here in business or pleasure; you have the whole city within a short 5 minute walk to the “Green Park” subway/underground/tube-station on the Piccadilly line, which is the same line going to and from Heathrow Airport. We took The Tube, which is cheaper than the Heathrow Express or Heathrow Connect even if it takes longer and is less comfortable but the closeness to the hotel made it worthwhile. Tube services leave Heathrow every few minutes from approximately 5am (5.50am Sundays) to 11.45pm (10.50pm Sundays). Journey time to “Piccadilly Circus” is about 50 minutes [which is one stop after “Green Park”]. There are three Tube stations at Heathrow Airport, serving Terminals 1-3,[ US Airways=Terminal 1 ] Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. A single paper ticket from Heathrow (Zone 6) into Central London (Zone 1) costs £5.00 (£4.50 on Oyster). We bought a Day-Ticket [£8.50] so we could start exploring London directly after checking in at the hotel. If you're going to be using London's public transport system, it's worth buying an Oyster card. You can also buy Travel Paper tickets, one per day, like we did. We live outside Philadelphia and flew with a direct flight by US Airways [a Staralliance company] to London. A very convenient flight, i.e direct, even though we are not the biggest fans of the carrier.

           It’s a cozy atmosphere in the hotel bar, were we had our night drinks accompanied by soft live piano playing, and they serve their fine dining and breakfast in their stylish restaurant.
           The hotel does not give a grand impression from the outside, like a separate driveway up to a pompous entrance, but that I don’t miss since the inside is the gem, so the saying is true about not judging the book by its cover…… Located in the exclusive Mayfair district on Charles Street with its fashion houses, numerous art galleries, great restaurants and local bars, with its backstreet character, makes it quiet and yet close to all the action. With its superb access to the whole of the city, it is the perfect location for all visitors. We used the Tube a lot!

          For Families they offer a 'home from home', with so many family-friendly attractions nearby, keeping everyone entertained.
          For Pets . We had to leave our little white and fluffy Havanese “Marshmallow” at home because the regulation to bring pets into UK is so rigorous, with mandatory quarantine coming from USA, that we didn’t want her to suffer that procedure, so she had to stay at home with our sitter. Otherwise she has travelled with us to Aruba twice, Florida once and Sweden once, so we know the paperwork. But because you’re staying in London’s most sought-after location doesn’t mean your four legged friends should miss out, if you can bring them. The hotel is pet friendly which we naturally love!
          For Female Travelers’. The hotel have specially allocated rooms and amenities to provide enhanced security and comfort for female visitors. These include: Secure interior door locking, female service staff, extra hangers in the wardrobes and foot spa, creams and lotions.
          Thoughtful Touches. When you choose the Chesterfield Mayfair as your preferred hotel you can expect to find a selection of thoughtful extras that will help you make your stay as special and comfortable as possible. Examples are: A pillow and duvet preference for a good night's sleep [ we slept very comfortably], 24 hour room service, Deluxe Fragonard toiletries, a children’s menu, welcome pack and turndown gifts, Complimentary wireless (Wi-Fi) high-speed Internet connection in all areas of the hotel [we used it a lot in our rooms (2) and it worked fast], evening turndown service, with bathrobes, luxury tea/coffee making facilities and bottled mineral water and fully integrated TV entertainment system, international TV channels/movies, music on demand and Internet.

          HOTEL HISTORY. This is a hotel that boasts a rich heritage. Charles Street, Berkeley Square, occupies part of the lawns of old Berkeley House, the London mansion of that fierce old cavalier Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who during the civil war between Charles I and Parliament, distinguished himself as 'the hero of Stratton fight'. Soon after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Lord Berkeley was rewarded by Charles II for his loyalty to the Crown with an extensive parcel of land to the north of Piccadilly on which he constructed for himself a great house. The land was afterwards developed by his widow. This street, which first appears in the rate-books in the 1740s, was named after Charles, Lord Falmouth, Lord Berkeley's brother. For two hundred years until the outbreak of the Second World War these houses in Charles Street were 'the abode of rank and fashion'.",5,2012,11,28
105,Champagne afternoon tea,"I visited the Chesterfield Mayfair for one of their famous champagne afternoon teas with a close friend. The staff were very professional and attentive, checking our coats and seating us promptly. We had a large selection of teas to choose from and decided to select 2 different ones so that we could try each others. It would have been nice to maybe have tried a few more as there were so many interesting flavours but this didnt dissapoint. Our tea was served with rose champagne which was delicious. Lovely selection of sandwiches and cakes with a great atmosphere. We dined at 5.30pm so had some lovely entertainment from the pianist in the main bar. Great hotel tucked away in Mayfair, just a 5 min walk from Green Park tube.",5,2012,11,26
105,Afternoon Tea...,"After a rehearsal my friend (an oboist) and I went to the Chesterfield in Mayfair for an afternoon tea. Great that no formal clothing policy - went in as casual as you like (I was also carrying a few recording items but hotel staffs were very very helpful). If you can, then try sitting in the green colour area full of plants etc. Food n tea was very good and the service was excellent. Reasonable price. Though may not be by the main shopping area (yards from Berkeley Square) - I would recommend this place.",4,2012,11,26
105,An Anniversary delight at The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Even the taxi driver at Euston Station was impressed when we told him where we were heading, The Chesterfield is in the Heart of Mayfair we had a short walk out in the evening to the bustle of Piccadilly and and a short walk in the morning to Oxford Streets shops.
First off we were up graded to a junior suite which was a lovely surprise.
The Berkley Suite was beautifully decorated in blue and gold and the flowers that our daughters had ordered for us were waiting in a vase.  We also had Champagne from them sent to our room accompanied by a complimentary Anniversary plate of cup cakes.  
The hotel facilities are exceptional and the staff were very attentive, right down to the porter making sure that we were heading in the right direction when we took our walk out in the evening.
A pre dinner drink in the bar was enhanced by the pianist in the corner making a really nice atmosphere.
The food is excellent and the restaurant beautifully turned out.
Every one was kind pleasant and helpful.",5,2012,11,26
105,Welcoming atmosphere,I only visit London once or twice a year and stay at an hotel for one or two nights at the most.  I have stayed at the Chesterfield for some years now and find it conveniently central to the West End.  Each time I arrive I am welcomed efficiently and with a genuine warmth that is relaxing and creates a warm glow even in wet or cold weather conditions.  The rooms are equipped with everything I need to make the stay enjoyable and the check-out arrangements are fast and they do everything possible to facilitate your onwards journey.  I do not think of booking anywhere else.,5,2012,11,24
105,Another Great Stay.,This was our second stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Once again customer service was superb. We had a beautiful room and breakfast was top notch. If you want to stay in a classy hotel in a quiet but convenient area then this is the place to go.,5,2012,11,24
105,my stay at the chesterfield mayfair,"Thank you for our wonderful stay at the chesterfield Mayfair,

Mychildren paid  for our stay as a birthday gift to me
i would say the gift was perfect thanks to all at the Hotel
 would love to stay again, & highly recomend it to all

105,wonderful experience!,"I spent two nights at this wonderful hotel. Great location. The service was top notch from all the employees and the food was fabulous. The bar manger, Paul Hogg, was very gracious and entertaining, and made us feel very much at home in a land far away from our own! Give that boy a raise!",5,2012,11,18
105,Such a relaxing stay,"stayed at this charming old world hotel this week while on business in London  and felt truly at home. I wish I could have stayed longer than 1 night.
My room was really very  comfortable  and inviting and I enjoyed an amazing nights sleep  which is most unusual for me while away from home. The towels were especially fluffy and noteably softer than in any hotel I have ever stayed in. Breakfast hit the spot, lots of fresh fruit and my eggs were cooked to perfection.  The staff were  all exceptionally warm and helpful but i have to single out  Jack Conroy at the front desk who couldn't have been more charming or helpful.
I am looking forward to my next stay at the Chesterfield  when I hope to sample the Afternoon Tea which has a wonderful reputation.
You won't be disappointed by this gem.",5,2012,11,17
105,my favourite London hotel,"When one talks about good hotels in London there has to be a mention of value-for-money. There are certainly better hotels with larger rooms and bathrooms than the Chesterfield but in London this comes at an exhorbitant price.  The Chesterfield has achieved the ideal balance of price/value.
The rooms are not large but they are adequite and very nicely appointed. the staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly and I always get recognised as a repeat guest. If you arrive early on an overnight flight they will do all they can to get you into a room. The breakfast is outstanding and the restuarant very good for lunch or dinner.
Location in Mayfair could not be better - Hyde Park nearby for walks/runs, Sheperds Market restuarants just around the corner, Oxford/Regent st shopping in walking distance. The immediate neighbourhood is quiet and you do not hear traffic or sirens.",5,2012,11,15
105,Afternoon Tea..,"I've not felt compelled to write a review of any hotel or restaurant before however i had such a lovely experience at The Chesterfield i wanted to share a positive review of this.

For my first Afternoon Tea i was very impressed, with 3 other friends (two birthdays..) we were treated to a tasty and very filling array of cakes, sandwiches and tea. We were offered refills and staff made sure we had full plates at all times.. The staff were fantastic, not too attentive where we couldn't relax but there when needed which was perfect. I asked our waitress if there was anything she could do for the birthday girls and without hesitation said she would sort something out no problem, 4 staff then bought over a plate for each with Happy Birthday swirled in choc sauce, cupcake and candle and sang happy birthday..lovely added extra :-) Needless to say i am booking up again to take my mum and sisters.",5,2012,11,12
105,Old world charm,"Stayed here last night on a business trip and was delighted to find myself in such a charming, traditional, comfortable hotel. The staff were all extremely friendly and courteous. The location in central London is particularly good and although I work in London everyday I was struck by the beauty of the surrounding area and royal parks  - this is quintessential London.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,11,10
105,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here for 6 nights and we would definitely return. This was the first time at Chesterfield Mayfair and certainly will be our future "" London Hotel"" as the staff, the service and overall quality is excellent.
The location is wonderful, plenty of restaurants are close by the hotel, some very famous ones ( Hakkasan Mayfair, Cecconi's Mayfair, Sketch,The Guinea). Only a short walk through Green Park to Buckinghan Palace and five minutes from Green Park tube station.
The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Peter who sent our books to Brazil ( the box arrived in last then a week!!)The brazilian housekeeper ( Cristiana ) was very cheerful and eager to help us and the rooms were very clean.
The room ( a junior suite) was exactly the one that I told my agent to try to book!! ( I saw pictures of the rooms on the website - www.redcarnation.com) It was a good size , bright and clear, very comfortable with a lovely ""decor"" and the bathroom has a jacuzzi and a shower, that was very perfect. 
The breakfast was part of the package rate and we can have it in our room without any tax until 11:00 am. We had an afternoon tea and it was very nice too, served with english grace and charm.
We had the most lovely stay, thank you for all, and we will be back next year!!",5,2012,11,09
105,Lovely weekend break!,"Booked this hotel and tickets to Stomp for my partners birthday in september. Staf  were excellent, very attentive, nice rooms which didn't conform to the normal boring chain hotels. The buffet breakfast was good, although we've had better cooked fare! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to others.",4,2012,11,09
105,"Lovely hotel, perfect location, fab staff!","I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair, for business purposes, for 4 nights. I must say I never came across staff with such professional and personal approach at the same time. When staying there, you do not feel like being in a good hotel, but in one where everything is done to make you feel at home and to make your life easier :-)",5,2012,11,06
105,"Excellent location, nice hotel","The room was really small for 2 adults. The location is great, the Green Park is very close as well as the Buckingham Palace. The restaurant is very expensive. Room service was good but slow. We stayed for 2 nights over weekend and found it ok considering the UK standards.",4,2012,11,04
105,amazing customer service,"Stayed at this hotel this weekend for my girlfriends birthday.. The staff here went out of their way to make it special for her, the room upgrade, the birthday card, the cake, the great friendly service...a must must stay here! Thanks ",5,2012,11,04
105,"Great staff, lovely building, great location 10/10-13/2012","Having never been to England before, I had certain expectations about how things would look and feel.  The Chesterfield Mayfair honestly met all of imaginings about all things British!  The old world look of the decor, the tea selection in the room, the bellman & doorman's attire and the lovely sunroom.  Everything was perfectly clean (I'd heard humorous stories about the English plumbing but no problems here!!) and well maintained.  As it was included in our package we enjoyed the Afternoon tea and again, so lovely and what I imagined it would be like.  We also ate all our breakfasts there and one dinner.  Antonio (hope I remembered his name correctly) was our waiter twice and he was so kind explaining, for instance, how tea is done. He always made us feel welcomed and I hope this praise is passed on to him.  I could go on and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Close to the underground & a pub across the street (The Last Running Footman, fun place too).  Also forgot to mention Starbucks coffee available in the lobby for us Americans addicted to our caffine!  Thanks Chesterfield Mayfair!!!",5,2012,11,03
105,Excellent secret and intimate bar in Mayfair,"This is a fantastically discreet and intimate bar tucked behind Picadilly. It feels quintessentially English, with a dark and cosy colour scheme, and extremely good, but personable service from the attentive waiters. Their themed Bond cocktails for the launch of Skyfall were both entertaining with a special section at the start of the drinks menu, and also really very good. I particularly enjoyed my Vesper. 
The wine selection is also excellent, with the very reasonably priced South African Bouchard Finlayson wines offering a really good variety. 
Food was also lovely - even if you don't fancy anything substantial, there is cheese on toast doing the rounds - a perfect amount just to keep the lid on your appetite, and help soak up some of the cocktails... 
It's a lovely, timeless place, where I will happily come back, either to show London visitors a real London experience, or just on my own to relax! Highly recommended.",5,2012,11,02
105,Lovely Stay,"My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair for four nights.
We had a deluxe twin room which was very cozy and perfect for the two of us.
The hotel's location is ideal for getting around either by foot or tube. I love the Mayfair area!
Our first night we were delighted to have champagne and cake brought to our room for my birthday celebration.
Our morning started out with a hearty breakfast in Butlers where we had a choice of either buffet or cooked to order. The Eggs Benedict were exceptional, so much so that I twice indulged! 
Afternoon tea was very enjoyable and certainly very filling. The staff happily brought extras of our favorites.
We dined once at the hotel's Terrace bar and thoroughly enjoyed sharing their ""sharing plates"".
Our only disappointed was our last night's dinner at Butlers. We were anticipating having the dover sole, only to find out that they had run out. They did make up for this by making us table side crepes suzettes, which were fantastic.
I would not hesitate booking this hotel again when traveling to London.",4,2012,11,01
105,Wonderful London experience,My husband I and stayed at the Chesterfield for our first visit to London. It was perfect. The location seemed ideal....we walked to the Green Park underground station as well as fun restaurants and Piccadilly Circus. We were treated well by everyone...even got an anniversary card signed by the whole staff! Ate a wonderful meal in the restaurant and had a drink most evenings in the bar. Our room was good size as was the bathroom. Service was outstanding.....I ordered coffee to our room every morning and it was delivered in record time. Just a lovely experience.,5,2012,10,31
105,"Great location, great staff, great stay","After staying at The Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, I thought no hotel would compare, but I was wrong:  My daughter and I next traveled to the Chesterfield Mayfair in London.  What a great spot!  Four quick blocks from the underground (Green Park), the Chesterfield Mayfair has an impeccable British feel.  Though there was a small mixup on the room type (twin vs double), the hotel upgraded us to a suite so we could have separate twin beds.  It was wonderful!  We adored the feeling of the rooms, the wonderful amenities, and the whole hotel.  The bar at the Chesterfield was particularly welcoming and fixed us hot toddies when we came in freezing from the cold.  Breakfast was DELICIOUS with hot food cooked to order and and bread and fruit buffet.  I had their special porridge one morning that included WHISKEY as well as double cream and brown sugar.  I didn't have much of the whiskey but I did try it--very swish!  Just half a block away was an outstanding pub (The Only Running Footman) and we ate there and at a nearby Indian restaurant (Tamarind) at the recommendation of the fine concierge.  The whole stay was welcoming and special even though the hotel was full at the time!  Warmly recommended.",5,2012,10,31
105,Top Notch Everything!,"It was the perfect setting for our London vacation.  We stayed there 4 nights and everything was perfect.  The staff was probably the best part.  Chris, the concierge, couldn't have been more helpful with planning our daily itineraries.  We stayed in a room called The Study which made it all the more memorable.  Amazing finishes and decor.  If there was only one incredibly minor drawback it was the lack of drawers but the closet space was adequate.  They went above and beyond with turn down service, complimentary bottled water, coffee, tea and cookies, a very comfortable bar area with great food and jars of sweet treats for our enjoyment at any time of day or night.  Incredibly cost effective for all the great service you get when compared to the other hotels in the area.  Don’t miss the High Tea offered at the hotel either.  We won't stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2012,10,31
105,Good Value for central London but small room,"We had a weekend in London at the end of September 2012 and went to Ronnie Scott's night club in Soho. We needed a central London hotel as we wouldn't be leaving the Club until 1am or later. Having searched the net for some time I found that the Chesterfield in Mayfair provided the best option (we don't like to slum it!). We paid about £216 for a night (exc breakfast) but it's pretty hard to beat that price in the West End.

Location was great and the service and staff absolutely fine. The room was small however and the view from the window was of air conditioning units and fire escapes. I guess we had one of he cheap rooms!

We chose to pop out for breakfast and found a great cafe in the nearby Shepherd Market area which was great.",3,2012,10,31
105,"Top hotel for service, location and staff but room very small and disappointing.","Stayed for 4 nights in October. An expensive hotel in a prime spot so initially we were very disappointed in the room. The smallest we have stayed in with the bathroom only big enough for one person at a time with the door opening onto the sink area - not ideal. This was a shame as the attention to detail and the staff/service was excellent. We stayed in a superior king room. It was at the back of the hotel so the view was non existent (scaffolding and what looked like derelict buildings). 
The rooms are traditionally decorated but inkeeping with the hotel. The soundproofing from the corridor not great.The bed was very comfy, complimentary water restocked as required as were towels throughout the day, housekeeping very attentive, concierge very helpful - always on hand to help with umbrellas, taxis etc. Room service menu very good with a good choice until 10.30pm. Not very flexible later than that with a limited menu. Probably would not stay again because of the room but could not fault anything else - it felt like a classy hotel.",3,2012,10,30
105,Very grown up hotel in an excellent location.,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield on our first weekend away without our baby and it was the perfect choice. 

The hotel is in a lovely location on a quiet Mayfair street, it is a 2 minute walk from Berkeley Square, 5 minutes from Green Park underground station, 15 minutes from Piccadilly Circus / Regent / Oxford Street and 20 minutes from Covent Garden. This was the first time we have stayed in London and not had to use public transport at all - makes for a much more pleasant experience.

The hotel itself has a lovely feeling of old-fashioned elegance, the reception area and foyer are understated and very welcoming. It seems more like a private members club than a hotel, I wouldn't be bringing my child here, it's really not particularly suitable for young families - which was ideal for what we were looking for! We booked a superior room, which was tastefully decorated, but certainly not large - definitely not as large as the superior rooms look on the hotel website. It did have a very comfortable king bed and lots of wardrobe space, but there wasn't space for much else in the room, which wasn't an issue for our 2 night stay, but might not be great for a longer stay. The bathroom was also quite small, but had a brilliant shower and a great selection of toiletries. 

We didn't eat in the hotel because we had various reservations in place before arriving, but with hindsight that was probably a mistake, the menus and afternoon tea options looked amazing and we will definitely try the food next time.

The next time we are in London child-free, we'll definitely choose The Chesterfield.",4,2012,10,29
105,Best service we have experienced,"We have travelled widely in Europe and North America, and feel confident in saying that we have never seen such dedication to superb service. The hotel is perfectly located for seeing the great sights, and the decor is classic ""Victorian-style"" English. But the real 5 star point was the attention to service detail. Every staff person was polite, interactive, helpful and took responsibility for completing the task or request. When we required special attention (a dinner guest coming in a wheelchair), the staff rallied with a team approach to parking, ramp access (to a very old building), seating in the dining room, attention to the special cutlery and so on.  The next day several staff members checked to see if everything went well. Reasonable prices, for Mayfair.  A+. 5 stars.",5,2012,10,28
105,Uber-british hotel in topstyle,"This was a huge experience. This hotel is located in the middle of beautiful Mayfair and has everything that comes to one's mind when you think about an English top hotel. From the carpet to the pastries, from the breakfast to the doorman, everything is sooooo English. 
Rooms are a bit dark, but that's typical with that carpet and all those thick curtains. It sleeps fantastically. Can recommend the hotel. Folks are friendly and again locationwise it can't be better",5,2012,10,24
105,Pleasant but small room,"Service is fantastic and the meeting facilities too. I found my room small but well presented.  Bed very comfortable but too many gadgets with lighting the room up all night with Illuminated Displays, LEDs etc. 
Wifi wasn't terribly reliable and iPad and phone needed Ro continually re-enter the access creds.",4,2012,10,18
105,Excellent accommodation and food in Mayfair - Can't go wrong!,"I stayed at this hotel In November of 2011, whilst on business. My room was tastefully decorated, clean and very comfortable. The room overall was of a high standard. The food was excellent, including a very good breakfast in the mornings. Hotel staff were very helpful and courteous at all times. I will most definitely choose one of the Red Carnation Hotels again when I'm back in London, whether it is for business or pleasure. Excellent overall hotel experience. Met my expectations in full.",5,2012,10,18
105,Splendid tea!,"If you can take the time to have a proper tea (more like a late lunch and tea - or tea and early supper), I recommend The Chesterfield. Very pretty dining room, really friendly staff and lovely things to eat to your heart's content. What more could you ask?",5,2012,10,15
105,Absolutely B****y Fantastic,"OK, I've never experienced the Dorchesters and the Ritz's here in the UK but I can say that this is definately the best hotel that I have stayed in here in England. From the moment we arrived on the Friday night to our departure on the Sunday afternoon the level of service was superb, food magnificent, staff attentive and uber-polite and best nights sleep I've ever had.
Back again on Tuesday and can't wait!
Well worth every penny.",5,2012,10,14
105,London,"One of London´s hotel gems. The location is perfect, the staff incredibly helpful, the bar and restaurant beyond one best dreams. All in all home from home.
The rooms are a little on the small side but everything else surpasses any comment",5,2012,10,14
105,"Near perfect hotel, excellent! Susan","Our stay was 4 nights, September 1-4. We enjoyed the friendly staff, from our breakfast host Caroline to the bartender James. Love the lemon drop & James Bond martini's. The high tea was a highlight. Would highly recommend this hotel for its outstanding service, location, and value.",5,2012,10,12
105,Still Love The Chesterfield!,"My husband and I stayed for our 3rd time in the Chesterfield Mayfair in September.  And we still love every aspect of it!  All the staff is so friendly, the beds are really comfy, breakfast is grand.  We love the halls and bedroom walls with their padding, which dampens sounds and makes for a warm, inviting environment.  We research other London hotels from time to time to keep ourselves honest, but the thought of going somewhere else and being disappointed is more than enough to keep us from leaving the Chesterfield.  We will return again in December!  Also, we love the quiet neighborhood and the charm and convenience of Shepherds Market a block away - great choice of restaurants.  I don't really want the whole world to know about this gem of a hotel, and I highly recommend it.",5,2012,10,12
105,Good place,"Really next to the Green Park underground station and near the Soho area, this Hotel is a nice place to stay for work or for pleasure.
You can reach every place with the undergrounds, and it's 10 minutes walking from Piccadilly Circus.
Rooms are very nice and people that work inside, too.
Very Good!",4,2012,10,11
105,"""Treated Like Royalty""","I stayed with my girlfriend for a weekend in October at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. From the Friday evening when we checked in to the Sunday evening when we checked out we were treated like royalty by all the staff, the service was of the highest order. Our room was very comfortable and it was a joy to come back to in the evening after our busy days sightseeing. We ate in Butlers Restaurant on the Saturday night and the food was delicious. Before we flew home on the Sunday we treated ourselves to afternoon tea, we can now see why it is so famous!! I can't wait for our next trip to London and our stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to a friend.    ",5,2012,10,08
105,Wonderful Experience!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield in August and found it it an excellent choice. It's in a great location in a beautiful part of the city, just enough off the busy roads to give you a sense of being in a neighborhood, while still being close to any exploring you would want to do. But what really sets this place off is its friendly and helpful staff, from the efficient front desk who greet you personally, to the wait staff in wonderful Butler's restaurant. We were fortunate to have our daughter, her boyfriend and two of their friends join us at the last minute for dinner, and Butler's sat us right away at a large table in a nice area that made it feel special. We had a great waiter with the perfect personality who took a personal interest in our group, brought meals quickly to two who had to catch a train, and even accommodated my order for something that wasn't on the dinner menu! That meant a lot to us. Often in a big city you don't get such personal attention. Our room was not large, but that is very typical of London, and it was impeccably decorated and nicely appointed. The Chesterfield is not a large property, so each room is decorated individually, as opposed to a large chain hotel. This gives the hotel a unique personality, and true English charm. My only regrets are that we could not stay longer, and that we missed their famous afternoon tea! I hope to stay at The Chesterfield again soon, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great location and exceptional service in London.",5,2012,10,05
105,Great week in London,"We stayed a week at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel while in London in mid-September.  The hotel is delightful, as are all of the staff that we had occasion to interact with.  We would recommend this hotel without reservation.",5,2012,10,03
105,Exceeded Expectations!,"This hotel was nothing but pleasant surprises. We arrived at 7:30am weary from traveling and long flights. The staff was very pleasant, provided warm towels and water, a very efficient check-in, and our room was available at this early hour.  The rooms are not large, but are very comfortable including the beds, which we used to take a quick nap. The staff goes out of their way to make sure that your needs are met.  The location is very convenient. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friend and book it for myself in the future!",5,2012,10,03
105,A star of the Red Carnation Hotel group,"Just returned from another superb weekend at the Chesterfield Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Every aspect of the hotel is fabulous. Every member of staff was welcoming. How many hotels do you visit where staff call you by your name every time then encounter you? Well at the Chesterfield it is the norm and just shows the commitment to personal service. We were fortunate to be ugraded to a suite which was the height of luxury.

If you want to stay in luxury, be treated as an individual and want your needs to always be the first priority then visit the Chesterfield.

I promise you will not be disappointed.",5,2012,09,30
105,Heaven in Mayfair,"Our weeks stay in September was wonderful. The entire staff was friendly, attentive and accommodating to all of our needs. We felt pampered and loved all the amenities in our room. We have always loved London and the Mayfair district. Now we love the Chesterfield.",5,2012,09,29
105,Traditional English,I stayed for a weekend .The hotel simulates traditional English luxury in the middle of London which is difficult to find these days. The place has a lot of character into it . The linen and towels are superb .The bed is very comfortable .The rooms are small but the fact that there is a lot of attention to details compensate for this.,4,2012,09,29
105,Champagne afternoon tea - lovely!,"After reading the reviews I chose to take my BF here for his 21st bday for our first afternoon tea experience. Very happy with my decision! The staff were very lovely, the hotel was beautifully presented and there was a lovely selection of cakes and sandwiches. They offer to fill the food up for you too! - not that you'll need it though cos it's very filling. Really nice selection of teas and the glass of champagne gave it an extra bit of 'special'. Definitely recommend asking to be seated in the conservatory as it's more laid back and very pretty. Perfect for any special occasion and the staff are very accommodating. It's only a 5min walk from Green Park Tube station and very easy to find. Also - dress code is smart casual.. we went in jeans and smart shirts/tops and shoes which was appropriate.",5,2012,09,28
105,Beautiful Hotel,"Only stayed 1 night - wish it was longer.  The Hotel was beautifully decorated and all the staff were really pleasant, happy and polite.  The room we stayed in (Room 425) was lovely, beautifully presented and immaculately clean.    Loved all the little extras - dressing gowns, slippers, bottled water by the bed, lovely toiletries and the chocolate nibbles left on the pillows with the Turndown service.  Best bed I have ever slept in, AND you can request different pillows to suit yourself.     This was a 'surprise' trip for us for our Silver Wedding Anniversary and on mentioning this to the breakfast staff,  we were presented with a decorated 'Congratulations' cupcake and a glass of Bucks Fizz.  Couldn't fault this Hotel - Highly recommended.",5,2012,09,26
105,"Great hotel, great location","My stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was excellent.  The rooms are average sized for London, but adequate.  Room service was prompt, the food was great.  Both the bar and the restaurant were very good.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  There is not an on site fitness centre, but guest passes to a nearby gym are available.",5,2012,09,26
105,"Location, value, service","We researched SO many hotels for our 4 night stay in London.  We really like the Mayfair area so we narrowed it down to only hotels in Mayfair.  We read all the reviews and ultimately chose The Chesterfield based on location.  We booked the best available rate for the King room with breakfast promotion code.  It worked out to be 180GBP plus 20 percent VAT....
Our room was exactly as it was represented to be (room 401) king size bed, great linens, coffee tray, marble bathroom.  We had a big window so it was nice to have the natural light.  It overlooked a courtyard with views of some very old buidings and the mews. The only thing that I can say as a negative was that room 401 is near a stairwell where the staff start working early.....That didn't matter to us because we were up before them anyway!  
The are deservedly famous for their staff and their service.  The staff is very friendly and helpful but not overly so.  The breakfast was a huge bonus: big selection and the highest quality.  I would recommend it even if it weren't included.
The public areas are beautiful and comfortable.  The bar was great. The location is very quiet, super close to Green Park Tube which is just one stop to Victoria Station.  Just across the street is the pub ""Only The Running Footman"" .  We ate there twice but went there every night for drinks.  Food was great...",5,2012,09,24
105,A Charming English Boutique Hotel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a wonderful hotel located in the posh Mayfair section of london. The hotel in itself is everything you would want from an english hotel. The doormen are dressed in red suits, the lounge is dark wooden, and the breakfast room is decorated in an english fashion from head to toe. There are many tube stations nearby, and it is easy to get anywhere in london from here. There are also some amazing (and trendy) restaurants nearby. Mayfair is a VERY expensive area in London, and it is also very safe. If you have a tight budget, it may not be the most frugal place to stay. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair is absolutely stunning. Definitely stay here next time you are in London, you won't regret it.",5,2012,09,22
105,A beautiful and well-managed hotel well worth staying at.,"The hotel is beautifully done, with immaculate interiors, well thought out  areas and impeccable staff. 

Our room was beautiful, down to the suede on the walls.  All the amenities one  required were available and of good quality. Our night's sleep was wonderful in a fantastic bed with high quality linen. 

Butlers Restaurant in the hotel for breakfast in the morning, and a good selection is available, fresh and of good quality. Staff are helpful, polite and friendly. 

Our stay was welcome after a long week and we enjoyed every minute.",4,2012,09,22
105,Best place to stay in London!,"My husband and I just returned from a fantastic 5 night stay in London.  A highlight of the trip was our hotel.  The Chesterfield is in a perfect location in Mayfair--Shepard's Market right behind it--and walking distance to most of the major attractions.  It has the British ambiance without a hint of stuffiness.  The staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful.  The library and the bar are lovely places to spend time if you can ever get yourself up and out of their heavenly beds.  They remembered our anniversary with a bottle of champagne and sweets, and continually went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.  I practically cried at check-out.",5,2012,09,20
105,London at it's best!!,"My partner and I have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for the seventh time from September 4, to September 9, 2012.  We choose the Chesterfield because it gives us the ""English"" experience we travel for.  We had a deluxe double room with a large marble bath.  The room was large and  beautifully appointed.  The bed and the linens were excellent.  The quality of service and the staff excels all others.  The staff is an absolute pleasure to interact with.  Totally pleasant, warm and accommodating, always a cheerful smile and hello.  They all make you feel like a special guest.  If    you are looking for London at it's ""best"", look no further.",5,2012,09,17
105,English Elegance,This hotel was a home away from home in the hustle and bustle of London.  It was a pleasure to stay here.  The staff was outstanding.  Friendliness abounded at all levels.  We spent two nights which included breakfast.  The food was excellent.  We also enjoyed High Tea one afternoon.  It was a wonderful experience.  The hotel rooms were luxurious and comfortable.  The bar area was relaxing and open 24 hours!  This hotel is in a very nice area of London.  It was quiet and felt like you were coming home each day but to luxury.  The tube is a close walk.  Close to a lot of restaurants in walking distance.  I would stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend it.,5,2012,09,17
105,Service and Value - families welcome - Excellent Staff,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for one night and it more than met our expectations. I travel for business and for pleasure quite frequently and have stayed in many luxury hotels.  The service at the Chesterfield was absolutely impressive. Every member of the staff, from housekeeping, to the doorman, to the Concierge, to the bell hop to the front desk to the restaurant staff was cheerful and accommodating in every encounter.  In addition, I felt that this was a great value for the money.  We are a family of 4 and in Europe, it is always difficult (impossible) to find rooms for 4. This means we almost always need 2 rooms, which can get quite expensive in a city like London. The Chesterfield Mayfair has a kids/family package that allowed a discount on the second room plus included breakfast and welcome packages for the kids.  The rooms are excellent - great water pressure in the showers, the beds are divine and a ""pillow menu"" for those who like that.  Complementary bottled water and coffee in the rooms and turndown service and very clean rooms. The location was also within walking distance of Buckingham Palace and other attractions and restaurants.  I can't say enough about this hotel and the staff!!! Next time we go to London, we will stay at the Chesterfield.",5,2012,09,16
105,Dinner at The Chesterfied Mayfair,"We came for dinner before a theatre show at The Chesterfield and were not disappointed.  Such a beautiful hotel in a lovely part of London.  Inside we were taken to the bar for a drink and while we sipped away a pianist played in the corner, very relaxing.  We sat down in the restaurant and looked through the menu, we were spoilt for choice. The food was very good and atmosphere perfect.  The waiters/waitresses were very attentive and helped with what wine to go for and nothing was too much trouble.  It was my birthday and after dinner a birthday cake was brought out and the staff sang me Happy Birthday!!  The cake was yum!  Compliments to the Chef and all the staff - Can't wait to come back again :)",5,2012,09,14
105,don't think twice. . . book this hotel.,"Just as everyone else states. . this a great hotel.  Located 3 min walk from Berkley Square and 5 mins walk from The Ritz/ Fortnum&Mason/Green Park (+tube stn). Buckingham Palace is just a 10 min walk.  Whilst being close to the action the hotel is located on a quiet road and noise was not a problem at any time of the day/night.  we stayed on the top floor, room 703.  
 
From the doorman to reception and breakfast staff everyone is welcoming and has a smile.   We stayed for 2 nights and as you can tell were thorougly impressed.  Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of choice (almost too much!), plenty of choice for us veggies too.  One lady overseeing breakfast was detirmined to see my table supplied with more toast tea/coffee!!  plenty of fresh fruit available too, take an apple/banana too eat later in the day.

Yes the hotel is a little more expensive that others in the capital but how many are so well located, welcoming and are all round FANTASTIC. I do not have one complaint.  

 5 STAR in ALL aspects. . . . dont hesitate, book this hotel and enjoy London in style.",5,2012,09,13
105,Lovely Hotel,Our stay was absolutely lovely.  We arrived early and they held our bags until the room was available.  Our room was tastefully themed with music decor and the bed was very comfortable.  The service was outstanding as was the tea and breakfast.  Would stay again.,4,2012,09,13
105,My strongest recommendation!!,"While I have visited wonderful hotels throughout the world, I have never before had such an extraordinary stay that I feel compelled to share my experience.  The Chesterfield Mayfair, is, in short, fabulous.  It completely lives up to its lofty billing on Trip Advisor.  The staff is, in particular, remarkable.  They are all warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and exceedingly professional.  I had the pleasure of working closely with one concierge, Chris Campbell, to plan my dinners, theater tickets, and a trip to Oxford.  I really felt as if I were his personal client -- a remarkable feat for a busy hotel!  The location is superb, right in the heart of Mayfair, and about a 5 minute walk from Buckingham Palace or 15 minutes to Trafalgar Square.  I look forward to many future visits to this really special property.",5,2012,09,09
105,Wonderful hotel,"Our stay at the chesterfield was a wonderful experience. The rooms are spacious by European standards and very clean. We found the front desk, concierge and the doorman to be very helpful and always greeted us with a warm hello. 

Each night we came into our room and had a pleasant surprise of chocolates, candy, cupcakes and a pair of cuff links. 

At breakfast we were lucky enough to be seated at Carolina's table. She would welcome us with a warm good morning and understood our special food requests. She also called our diet cokes ""dark champagne"". Truly a good sense of humor. Caroline provided each guest with excellent service. 

A nice, clean hotel.",4,2012,09,07
105,Fabulous!,"My husband and I took our two teenage children to London during the Olympics.  As always, we stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel - and as always, we were given excellent service and a warm welcome.  The personal service cannot be beat (such as the breakfast that the Night Manager and other employees (thank you Hani and the rest of the night staff!!) gave us in the middle of the night when our children had jet lag).  Our many thanks to everyone at the Chesterfield!!",5,2012,09,07
105,The Guest Comes First At The Chesterfield,"What a marvelous place to stay!  Great build in a great location and all the services you need are on hand or available close by. Internet access is included in the price and a complimentary newspaper is supplied if desired.

However, the ace up the sleeve is the staff, they are superb. Extremely helpful and always smiling. They just make the stay so much more enjoyable. The restaurant and bar are excellent, again the service is great.

I have stayed a number of times and will continue going back, highly recommended!",5,2012,09,05
105,"Excellent stay, as usual","Just finished my semi-annual trip to the Chesterfield. Although this hotel is in a major city, it is as relaxing as spending a week at a remote spa (I guess -- I have never done that). I sleep better at the Chesterfield than at any other place, including home. The bedding and bathrobes are sumptuous and if, by chance, you happen to wake up in the night, you can think about how good breakfast will be in the morning.

But ... they changed the soaps! They have switched from Gilchrist & Soames to some Italian company. I guess it is OK, but nobody likes change.",5,2012,09,04
105,Cherished,"Fabulous location, but what gets the 4 stars is the service. At the risk of sounding maudlin, one actually feels cherished at this hotel. Staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable.  
The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because the ceiling of my room needed to be painted and some of the crosgrain ribbon trim on one wall was missing.  Room was very clean and had beautiful sheets.  Loved that the windows opened too. I will definitely be back.",4,2012,09,04
105,Excellent Recommendation for a top class establishment,We stayed here on the 30th September for 1 night for our 10 year wedding anniversary and also booked the afternoon tea. The Tea was delightful and very pleasant and the chinese and sri lankan teas were very tasty. The Hotel staff were very accomodating and welcoming and as a surprise we were upgraded to a larger room and also had a nice card signed by the hotel staff with some cupcakes. I'd like to thank the management and staff for a pleasant stay. Would use again in the future I hope.,5,2012,09,04
105,Afternoon Tea,"We have all just had a mouthwatering afternoon tea at the Chesterfield. It was a special treat for my wifes 60th......and made her day !!
I cannot thank the staff enough for making this such a wonderful occassion for us all, and especially the way they looked after our grandson (3yrs) nothing was too much trouble and the service was faultless and unobtrusive. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody.

The cakes and scones were absolutely delicious....and what you don't eat is boxed for you to take home.

So go on try this hotel you will not be disappointed.............we will definately return soon.",5,2012,09,03
105,London trip,"Great location. Good area for restaurants. Slight problem with cleaning the room, however, management quickly resolved our issue. Friendly bar location. Overall a good experience and would stay again.",4,2012,09,02
105,Luxury in London,"Cheap it is not; but worth it for the experience. It's rather like an old fashioned Gentlemen's Club with its faded charm and aura of sophistication. Go for the Kingsize bedroom if you're travelling as a couple (it's £20 extra a night but worth it for that bit of extra space) and enjoy a well appointed room with an effective shower (not something you always get in places of a certain age). It was also marvellously quiet and yet right next to exciting places like Shepherd's Market and close to Oxford St. Generally the staff were wonderfully friendly although the breakfast staff were rather more military! Do have the haddock with bubble and squeak and poached egg, simply delicious! The food in the restaurant and room service were also top quality. We went to a wedding at Dartmouth House (also lovely) and The Chesterfield is only two doors away. The bar staff stayed up until gone 3.00 serving those who chose to stagger on until the bitter end! Service with a smile (probably held up by cocktail sticks!)",5,2012,09,02
105,Fabulous afternoon tea,"We went to the Chesterfield for afternoon tea and it was fabulous. We were made to feel very welcome by the friendly and professional staff. The tea and cake itself was wonderful with more sandwiches and scones than we could possibly eat. 

We were not rushed and ended up being there for 2 hours it was so lovely.

Would recommend.",5,2012,09,01
105,Great afternoon tea,"I went for afternoon tea for my mother in laws birthday and can say we had a fantastic afternoon, we were made to feel special and given lots of attention by the attentive and entertaining waiting staff. We were supplied with a choice of menus to have from a standard afternoon tea, chocolate afternoon tea to a champagne option. The range of tea was delightful and some of the flowering teas very beautiful to watch. The quality of the sandwiches and cakes was very good, with these be replenished if we required, what was left unfinished was packaged up so we could take it home, this was also offered, we didn't have to ask. Would book this again for a special family occasion or just during a mother/daughter shopping trip as a treat!",4,2012,09,01
105,"Outstanding, world class hotel and impeccable service","I am staying here for a total of 3 weeks. I typically don't stop to write a review until after I've completed my trip, however, my experience at The Chesterfield has been so outstanding that I did not want to run the risk of not have enough time to write a review when I got home. 

I am a frequent business traveller with very discerning taste. I always stay in Mayfair when I am in London on business and have gotten to know the area, it's hotels, the people and have very realistic expectations of service. 

By and large, the Chesterfield has exceeded my expectations of not only this hotel, but Mayfair hotels in general. From delivery of daily surprises (canapés, cookies, candies, dog treats, spa goodies), to daily dog walking, to an exquisite English tea, fanastic breakfast options, to arranging for spa services to be delivered to my room, to delivering cold medication to me while I sneezed at the conceirge, my experience at the Chesterfield has been world class and exquisite. 

The location is fantastic. Steps away from Sheffield market, Berkley Square, Oxford Street, Green Park Tube station, posh restaurants and historically (in)famous bars, the location is simply fantastic. There is a Tesco and ATMs around the corner, wonderful spas and galleries. It really is at the epicenter of Mayfair, yet tucked away where you can get privacy. 

The Butlers restaurant is a great one with simply fantastic food options. Multiple dignitaries and business professionals can be seen at the bar. 

All rooms are well appointed with high end furnishings and the bathrooms are very well designed. I was very pleased to see how much closet space was available, especially a separate place to house my shoes!

Small and thoughtful touches are really where the hotel excels: a small fridge is available upon request, daily maid service and nightly turn down service, daily delivery of treats (cookies, tea, canapés, chocolates etc), newspapers, complimentary wifi, and many more toiletries than one would normally be accustomed to. The concierge is really beyond compare and was able to arrange many excursions for me very quickly, including spa services in my suite. 

The Chesterfield is now the only hotel I will stay at in Mayfair. Do not hesitate to stay here. It will be the best decision you'll make and will ensure a very relaxing and wonderful trip. Enjoy!

105,A special place...,"We were drawn to the Chesterfield again. We’ve stayed in other London hotels, of course, but a visit to the capital is lacking unless it’s based in the sophisticated charm and elegant comfort offered by this hotel. It never disappoints.

Facilities and public rooms are of the highest order but the priceless asset of the Chesterfield is its staff. Unfailingly friendly, polite and professional, they add a quality to the place that is rarely encountered. The total package is warm and welcoming.

We found an entry in the hotel’s visitors’ book which read, “This is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in.” Who would argue with that!",5,2012,08,31
105,"lovely hotel,great location","Very nice hotel, just a short walk to most things and close to a lovely and reasonably priced eating area called Shepards market. Nice beds, helpful and nice staff. We didnt eat at the hotel as we wanted to get out and about but seemed a little expensive.",4,2012,08,30
105,OUTSTANDING! You are made to feel so special!,"I booked the Chesterfield Mayfair after my usual hotel was fully booked and Wow that's the best decision I could have made, the location is excellent with lots to do and see within walking distance.
From the second we arrived we were given a wonderful welcome, I was travelling with my 8 year old daughter and on arrival she was presented with treats for a princess and invited to meet the chef for cookie decorating which she was thrilled about.
We had a booking for afternoon tea and were escorted to the conservatory for the most wonderful Afternoon tea we have ever had (it beats the Ritz hands down!) the service was impeccable and food delicious and is replenished if you want more. Lovely choice of teas too. My daughter had the children's afternoon tea which she loved.
When we finished we were shown to our room, which was stunning. So individual and interesting unlike anywhere else I have stayed. The beds were utterly gorgeous with luxurious bedding. The  room and bathroom was spotlessly clean and beautifully presented. There were bathrobes and slippers supplied and when we returned to our room in the evening, the beds had been turned down with a chocolate biscuit on the pillow and bottled water and glasses next to our beds, such a lovely touch.
Breakfast the next morning was great, there is a good choice from the menu such as pancakes, French toast with cinnamon and strawberries, or the full English, all beautifully presented. There is also a buffet to choose from including fresh fruit and cereals, juice and smoothies. Excellent.
After breakfast my daughter met the chef to decorate cookies, she loved it and was presented with them in a gift box and a certificate when we checked out.
I cannot recommend the Chesterfield highly enough, every member of staff are totally outstanding, we were made to feel as if we were the only guests. I wish the stay could have been longer, but I will definitely be back to stay and have another fab afternoon tea.
Thank you to everyone at the hotel you are in a league of your own!",5,2012,08,27
105,"Beautiful afternoon tea, impeccable service","We went to the Chesterfield Mayfair for afternoon tea on Sunday 25th August and felt I must write a review. The hotel is immaculate and full of old world charm, glamour and style. The conservatory, where we took our tea, was a beautiful setting to spend a tranquil, relaxing couple of hours working our way through the delectable treats laid before us. Myself and my mother opted for the traditional afternoon tea at £28.50 and was thoroughly happy with it. A lovely assortment of sandwiches, in particular the chicken mayonnaise on almond crusted bread and the ham, cheese and tomato chutney were delicious. Then the cakes/pastries were tasty mouthfuls followed by the lightest delicious fruit and plain scones with homemade jam to die for. My 7 year old daughter had the princess tea and boy was she made to feel like a princess. She had a huge vanilla milkshake(choice of milkshake, hot chocolate or tea), the menu offered peanut and jam sandwiches but asking for just jam was no problem at all followed by a butter cream cupcake and scones. The absolute star of the show was the outstanding service. From entering the hotel to leaving the staff were A+ in their service. Happy, welcoming, interested, engaged, enthusiastic and attentive while perfectly balancing the need for space and time. They 100% delivered a 'nothing is a problem service' and we will definitely be looking at this hotel for our accommodation on our next visit to London.",5,2012,08,27
105,"Elegant, beautiful boutique hotel in a perfect location","We spent 8 nights a the Chesterfield Mayfair in August 2012, an elegant and loverly boutique hotel on a quiet street in posh Mayfair, just a block from the Sheperd's Market shop and restaurant area, and a few blocks from Green Park/Picadilly, Hyde Park and New Bond Street/Oxford Street shopping.  The location could not be more perfect to visit all of the attractions on the West side of London, everything from theatres to restaurants to shopping to royal palaces and parks and tony neighborhood.

We booked a junior suite and learned upon checking in that we had been upgraded to the elegantly appointed Duchess Suite, offering a large bedroom with a very comfortable bed, two wonderful sofa chairs with ottomans, big screen TV and desk, a bathroom with a tub, a small shower stall and sink-toilet area, and a separate study with a sofa, TV, desk and chair.  The suite was absolutely lovely, with all the amenities you could expect, quality fixtures, air conditioning and a ceiling fan.  This was a very comfortable and pleasant room for our extended, 8-night stay.  WiFi worked spectacularly, and I used it a lot, doing business online 7 hours every evening and night.  The TV is a bit odd, wiht a lot of pre-programmed features and pay-per-view movies, as well as a small collection of standard channels, but perfectly suitable.

The breakfast, offered in the hotel's elegant restaurant, is a combination a-la-carte menu and buffet.  The buffet offers various cold cereals, fresh fruit, pastries and juices.  You order your coffee, tea and hot dishes from the menu, which offers a nice variety of options for all tastes, with very good quality food.

All of the personnel at the hotel are very professional, friendly and helpful.  They offer top notch service.

My only warnings are that the hotel is a high-end and therefore expensive option, and that the more standard rooms are quite small.  Just view the hotel's own photos online, and you will get the idea (we stayed in a stanard King on a previous visit, and it was lovely but quite small).  For an extended stay like ours, try to afford a junior suite or better.

I cannot imagine anyone not feeling quite happy with the hotel, or with its prime location in this fanstastic city.",5,2012,08,25
105,I would highly recommend the afternoon tea which is sutible for any age.,"I have spent the day in London where myself, mum, aunt and son had afternoon tea at The Chesterfield Hotel Mayfair. We had such a great time, the service was quick the staff were very friendly and welcoming.. I would definitely recommend the afternoon tea and will definitely be back.",5,2012,08,24
105,Highly Recommend This Hotel!,"My sister and I traveled to London for 5 nights and we were so happy to have chosen The Chesterfield Mayfair to be our 'home away from home' for our time away.  The staff was always so pleasant and helpful - always smiling and ready to help in any possible way.  Our room was always clean and we loved coming back after a long day exploring, to find a special treat with the turndown service.  We had afternoon tea the first day we arrived and it was just perfect.  They give you plenty of sandwiches, pastries, scones...too much to eat!  Breakfast, which was included in our rate, was very good.  Plenty of choices, beautifully set up.  The hotel is located in a very pretty, upscale area in London.  It was about a 5 minute walk to the tube.  There were plenty of restaurants nearby, also.  I would definitely stay here again, without a doubt!  So relaxing!",5,2012,08,24
105,Best hotel in London by far....,"Just home from a fantastic weekend in London, made so much better by staying at the Chesterfield.
From the moment you arrive the staff are extremely warm and friendly, and you are made to feel welcome straight away.the staff are so friendly while remaing totally proffessional at all times.During check in my friends young son was offered the opportunity to book a cookie or cupcake decorating lesson with a hotel chef(how wonderfully unique, he was delighted). The rooms are beautifully decorated and feel very oppulent. The linen is crisp white Egyptian cotton, and the toileteries are wonderfully smelling Elemis.
The breakfast choice is more than enough  for even the fussiest eater, with plenty that children would love.
We also had the hotels wonderful afternoon tea, of which there is also a variety of choices, including one for chocolate lovers, and one specialy for children.
On  leaving the hotel( a particularly sad occasion) the decorated cookies were presented to us in a box along with a certificate for completing a decorating class.and a l""chester"" bear with a letter.
Its the touches like this that puts the Chesterfield head and shoulders above other hotels, we would love to thank, Tony,Darren,Cosmo,Charles,hanni,Lenka,Sarah and all the other staff to numerous to mention for making our stay so memorable.
We cant wait to see you all again x

105,Memorable Stay ...,"Been to London a few times with family members but this trip is the BEST because of this Hotel. Our first few ones were not included in our package deal tour, ended up not too happy with our experience. 

Chesterfield Mayfair is EXCEPTIONAL Hotel ... I can say that again and again. Beautiful decorations, polite staff, great service, free internet, buffet breakfast included. Free afternoon tea was awesome with sconce. We had a complimentary dinner for four included in our package. Foods are great, most especially the SERVERS. Our beds are comfortable, all set up inside room well appointed. From door staff to breakfast cafeteria staff to reception and all that ... every moment of our stay is UNFORGETTABLE. We'll highly recommend this Hotel to every family and friends. Keep up the good work. Can't wait to go back !!!",5,2012,08,14
105,Marvelous stay!,"My son and I (from Seattle) stayed for 2 nights prior to another stay at a very upscale Knightsbridge hotel.  By far, we preferred the Chesterfield Mayfair! We were booked two rooms directly across the hall - the rooms were very well appointed, comfortable and spotless.  Most notable was the amazing staff - always curteous, helpful and welcoming.  We were sad to leave (and would have cancelled our reservation the Knightsbridge hotel if we could); we will certainly stay here again.  The hotel lounge is great for drinks and a snack; the tea was so lovely we went two afternoons consecutively.  Conveniently close to an underground station on a lovely, quiet street.  Look no further - great place to stay!",5,2012,08,12
105,Beautiful afternoon tea gluten free,"I had my first afternoon tea at the Chesterfield and it was an amazing experience. I am on gluten free diet and was very pleased to see that nothing was too much of a trouble when I mentioned it to the staff. They actually have a special gluten free afternoon tea that was delicious with the same selection than the the normal one. The sandwiches were generously filled and moist, the pastries yummy and the scones fabulous. I have developped this allergy 3 years ago and it was the first time I had a proper sandwich because the selection in the supermarket is usually very poor. I would definetely recommend the Chesterfield for the friendliness of the staff, especially the manager Bodan and the lovely waitress Ayka, the beautiful tea room and the great food and tea selection.",5,2012,08,06
105,Olympic trip,"This hotel as always has a very friendly feel to it.  It is most welcoming and there is great attention to detail.  
Our room was brilliant and we wished we’d been staying longer.  
The head bar man was very good and we’d recommend the Japanese beef burger! 
Also lovely breakfast and very nice staff serving.",5,2012,08,06
105,Great Location,"Chesterfield is within walking distance of Oxford and Bond Street shopping, Green Park, and  to many top notch restaurants.   Rooms are a little small but well furnished and comfortable.  Concierge is quite helpful.  Staff wants to anticipate your needs.  I've stayed here on two occasions and will definitely return.  I used their car service from Heathrow.  It was prompt, a good value and a stress free way to arrive after a trans Atlantic flight.",5,2012,08,04
105,A Gem in the Heart of Mayfair,"We have stayed at the famous hotels in London and we have dropped all of them for The Chesterfield. For more than 5 years we call this place ""home."" The hotel is a comfortable size on a small street and just a few blocks away from Bond Street and other attractions. Not far by cab to most of the areas one would want to go.The staff are the best in each and every department -- knowledgeable, friendly, efficient -- and most have been there for years. There is nothing they will not do for you to make your stay perfect. The restaurant is excellent for all meals and is often the choice for locals when they want a special meal out but not something too pricey. Afternoon tea is a must in the lovely courtyard, and a drink and some snacks in the bar has that club feel. The rooms are well stocked for pleasure, but also  for business travelers with all the little things one would not think of like stapler, scissors , etc. and 
this is especially thoughtful. Nice space even in the smaller rooms and the bathrooms are typical for these hotels -- great assortment of quality products, but little place to put any of ones things.
And another important note...  for half the price you are getting everything and more than you get at the ""name"" places in town.",5,2012,07,31
105,Fantastic central London hotel,We've stayed at the Chesterfield twice between Xmas and NY and we absolutely love it. It is a perfect little hotel in a great location. The rooms are beautiful and the staff are brilliant. Can't fault it at all.,5,2012,07,29
105,"Comfortable, quiet, central and top quality","We have stayed in several 4 and 5 star hotels in London over the years. This is the only one that we have repeated the experience at. It is located centrally but not on a main thoroughfare, and is therefore quiet.The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished, they are well maintained, clean and comfortable. The breakfast menu is superb and the afternoon tea is excellent. The staff are friendly, efficient and are clearly well trained and organised. An absolute joy.",5,2012,07,27
105,What a fabulous surprise,"We had trouble getting a room at our regular hotel and booked this one for location and availability.  We were pleasantly surprised from the moment the doorman opened the door and we entered this beautiful establishment.  Warm inviting lobby, cozy bar (with fabulous bar food), and a quiet library to curl up in.  The decor is great and I even want to buy their throw pillows (the dog in uniform but they do not have a website to try and purchase one on).  The tea there was the best we ever had in London and they even have a chocolate tea option!  The room was well appointed and fully stocked,right down to paperclips and a scissor.  We took home all the bathroom products we did not use, they were fabulous.  The staff could not do enough.  It is our new number one spot when we are in London.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2012,07,26
105,A perfect home away from home,"Lovely hotel; cosy, clean, homely, friendly! When we arrived, the porter showed us around the facilities, everyone were so very friendly and nice, though professional. We have found a new home in London.",5,2012,07,26
105,Afternoon Tea - Simply Exquisite,"A friend and I had afternoon tea today, and I was so impressed that I am writing my review now, moments after arriving home.

The venue was stunning and very easy to get to. It was well maintained, very clean, and beautifully decorated. We chose to sit in the conservatory, rather than the restaurant. It was airy, fresh, and bright; perfectly suited to the occasion.

The food was exquisite. Everything was fresh and wonderfully presented. The portions were very generous and with free top ups (both of tea and food) there was NO chance of leaving hungry.

Finally, the staff. Being so friendly, the treatment of staff makes you feel welcome regardless of your background. It truly is a place for any person who wishes to visit. The service was rapid but not intrusive. Having spent many years in the service industry, I have very strong beliefs about customer service. Here, every staff member provided incredible service and I honestly could not find a flaw in our entire experience. I cannot wait to visit again.",5,2012,07,25
105,Chic London Address just off Berkeley Square,"I have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for both business and leisure, both times I was equally impressed! A very central location ideal for the shopping and tourist attractions.  Mayfair is the epitome of London's smart set, close to Park Lane and this hotel situated in a very elegant street.

The suites are delightfully cozy and very elegant. Comfortable beds with luxurious bedding and complimentary internet.

Breakfast in Butlers restaurant is an elegant experience with superb food! The Conservatory is ideal for afternoon tea, a must when in England!

Listen to the resident pianist in the evenings while relaxing with a glass of chilled champagne 

This is the hotel to stay in to experience the authentic London vacation, away from the hustle of the larger hotels in the busier parts of the city. Love it!!!",5,2012,07,19

105,Superb Hotel,"Visited the Chesterfield for a single night with my wife as a base to see a concert in the park.  The room was fantastic with lovely decor and probably the most comfortable bed that I have slept in for a hotel. The staff were friendly, helpful and thier attention to detail was first class, I would have no hesitation in recommending the overall experience to all. I did have an offer of an upgrade from a much more expensive hotel in the viscinity of the Chesterfield following a terrible stay earlier this year, I am pleased to have not been lured. There are very few hotels in London that I would make a point of a return visit the Chesterfield is one, the staff and management team are a credit to the hotel. Brilliant, thanks very much!",5,2012,07,16
105,Royal Treatment at Chesterfield's,"We've now visited Chesterfield's three times and feel it's time to praise all aspects of our visits there.  From the Doormen to the Breakfast Servers, everyone is so helpful. The decor in each of our rooms was exquisite and prestine.  Best of all is, of course, Johnny, the Hotel's favorite Taxi Driver and our's as well.  He is thoughtful and unfolds London's perplexing maze of streets in short order making us  feel that we can accomplish everything we plan to do. He is splendid.  Second best is Chesterfield's proximity to Heywood Hill Bookshop.  It has an amazing selection of new and vintage books and each of the salespeople offers the very finest advice, because they're actually readers themselves.  So refreshing.  We shall return to Chesterfield's as it is a great base for London.  Oh, don't forget a visit or two to the River Cafe.  The Conceirge  will help with last minute reservations.",5,2012,07,13
105,High Tea,"My family and I came to Chesterfield Mayfair for high tea. We chose this option for their Princess Tea choice from the menu (with small ones coming along) and were not disappointed. The service was exceptional, the treats delicious, and the overall experience worth every penny. If you have the time, this experience is recommended.",5,2012,07,12
105,Red Carnation Hotels- the best place to stay in London,"Once again we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair in London. We have stayed in many good hotels in the capital but return time and again to Red Carnation hotels. The service is always superb.

This visit we drove to London and as our car was taken away to be valet parked we checked in even though it was only 11am. Our room was ready and we were delighted to be upgraded to a Junior Suite. What a treat. Two bathrooms a wonderful bed and all the amenities that you could wish for. We were only there for one night but we were treated as old friends and we wanted for nothing. 

There are hotels with grander rooms but none that I have found with better service and indeed I believe that Red Carnation represent good value for money.

this time we did not sample any food as we had a restaurant booking and could not face breakfast the next day! If you want a comfortable place to relax, with service at the highest standards without feeling ""ripped off"" then I commend Red Carnation Hotels to you - personified by The Chesterfield.",5,2012,07,09
105,This is my favourite London hotel.,"Best service in town. Gorgeous surroundings and everything you could wish for. 
Prices are high but it is worth looking out for their (rare) special offers.  
I would certainly go back for a special treat. ",5,2012,07,05
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Given the importance of our holiday (brother and sister/spouses trip to England), I spent a considerable time trying to select the perfect hotel for our stay in London. Needless to say, the Chesterfield Hotel definitely proved to be our ""home away from home"" in London. From the e-mail correspondence and check in to the room, dining facilities and lounge bar, everything was more than expected, in fact superb. I would particularly like to highlight the hotel staff who displayed an enthusiasm and pride in their work and their hotel that clearly indicated that they were happy in what they were doing. I especially liked coming back at night and being greeted with ""welcome back"". That really stated everything. We will always use the Chesterfield as our home away from home for our next stay.",5,2012,07,04
105,Unbeatable,"The best possible hotel experience...my wife and I booked their weekend break for 2 nights as a celebration for our retirement and to see the trooping of the colour (15th to 17th June 2012). It was a fabulous experience and great value - it included breakfast, afternoon tea and a bottle of Champagne (we also got a number of special extras which we didn't expect ie canapes and strawberries and congrats cards in our room). Perfect in every way - such a pleasure to be treated like someone special (even though we are not!!) This is our 2nd stay and will certainly not be our last (Thank you Oliver for your very nice letter sent on our return home!!)",5,2012,07,04
105,"Lovely hotel, great location","We had a lovely long weekend break, hotel was lovely, staff very welcoming, excellent service.  A very nice breakfast, very relaxing atmosphere.  Would highly recommend this hotel. The room was beautiful, lots of little personal touches a very relaxing stay.",5,2012,07,01
105,Wonderful Hotel in the Heart of Mayfair,"We arrived very early in the morning on the day of our stay and although our room wasn't ready at that point, we were allowed to freshen up and leave our luggage.  We were given directions of how to reach our destination for the morning and we went on our way,  Upon our return, which was still before check-in time we found that our room was then ready and our luggage had already been delivered to the room.  For London, the size of the bedrooms were quite generous and provided you with anything you needed from tea and coffee to an iron and ironing board.  Anything else we asked for was brought to us immediately and as we had stayed with Red Carnation Hotels before we were also greeted with a lovely welcome letter and a fruit plate from the General Manager.  
Breakfast was served in a lovely restaurant and the staff couldn't be more helpful.  Anything we asked for, again was provided immediately and we were not rushed at all.
From the hotel you were within walking distance of almost anywhere - we hardly used local transport at all even though we had planned to.  
When we wanted a taxi to take us to the theatre, the concierge managed to find us one at a very busy time of day within a few minutes.
As our time in London came to an end, the staff all wished us and safe journey home, found us a taxi to take us to the train station and when we arrived home we received a lovely letter from the hotel thanking us for visiting and saying they would love to welcome us back, which I though was a lovely touch.
We will definitely be returning to this wonderful hotel in the future.",5,2012,07,01
105,"Fair hotel in a good location, but not great.","I don't agree with the 5 star reviews of this hotel - the finish in the rooms is bad in places - scabby sealant around the bath, areas of brown discolouring under the sink - hardly worthy of the price of the room. The tv didn't work, and could not be fixed by the man who came to assist, whose English was poor. I wasn't offered any compensation on departure nor was I even asked about my stay - not even a smile.

Didn't try the food so cannot comment. Good points are very comfortable bed and premium quality sheets and pillows. Cleanliness outside of the bathroom is much better.

Wouldn't revisit, would prefer to stay in one of the larger hotels on Park Lane.",3,2012,06,30
105,Restful and unhurried,"We also had the champagne tea last Saturday. We were a party of 7 one of whom was wheat intolerant, not only was a gluten free tea available but a salad menu was also offered. I have been to other London hotels for tea and felt slightly pressurised to hurry and make room for the next reservation. Not here, we were constantly offered extra food and also a box to take any uneaten food home. Service was friendly and efficient. I will certainly recommend to my friends.",5,2012,06,27
105,"Afternoon tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair,","We came here for afternoon tea - the champagne one - on Saturday afternoon. Even before entering the hotel the staff were very helpful and friendly. Thank you. 

The room where the tea was held was very nice, comfortable and relaxing. Special sandwiches were provided for me, as I do not eat meat. All very tasty. The cakes were very nice and the scones were delicious.  

A really nice (though not cheap) afternoon. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a ""proper"" afternoon tea in this quiet corner of Mayfair.",5,2012,06,25
105,Exceptional Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield for a week in May. We have stayed at other Red Carnation Hotels before, and the Chesterfield sure keeps the high standards of this small luxury chain intact.
Location wise it is very well positioned, in walking distance to many of the historical sites that London has to offer. What truly sets the Chesterfield apart from other hotels is the exceptional all around service. The staff at the concierge are just brilliant and make you feel at home! The room was very comfortable (albeit a little small) and sparkling clean.
We are due to stay at the Chesterfield again this week, and needless to say that we are very much looking forward to it!",5,2012,06,18
105,Will come again,"We recently stayed three nights in this hotel. While it's not technically in the dead center of London, we truly enjoyed its location in an upscale area of London. And really, once you learn the tube, I don't find that it really matters all that much where your hotel is. The service at this hotel was outstanding! I really cannot say enough about it. The concierge went above and beyond. We enjoyed their breakfast. We also thoroughly enjoyed their bar/lounge with their piano player before we headed to dinner. We went to dinner twice based on the concierge's recommendation. We had dinner in the hotel one evening which was good though service was mildly off. I think they may have been a bit overwhelmed due to a wedding party that evening as well. The rooms were nice (though a bit small) and I very much enjoyed the heated floors in the bathroom. I am nuts about cleanliness and I give this place a 5/5. The turn down service was a lovely touch. If I were too complain at all it would be in regards to the light that creeps in above the curtains (though we like it quite dark) and when we ordered room service for breakfast, we called and asked about a la carte options and were told to fill out the card and write a la carte on the side. We did this but were still charged for the full price breakfast. I was told by our cab driver on the way to our hotel that there was a lot of construction due to a new tube length being put in around the hotel so he had to take a longer route in. Since we used the tube for most everything else, this did not affect us greatly.
All in all, the service was outstanding, the hotel impeccable, and when we return to London, I will be checking this hotel first for availability.",5,2012,06,17
105,"Great hotel, prefer The Milestone","We stayed here for several nights in June and had a mixed experience though this is a lovely hotel with a perfect location.  The very first night, the noise from the building next door was out of control and there was nothing the hotel could do.  Granted, it was the Jubilee, but still...  Each night after that we could hear the television from the neighboring room.  The ""suite"" we stayed in was quite small.  We booked five nights as part of a ""stay two nights in a suite and get the third.""  I wonder if we would have been in this same room if we had opted out of this package?  If you book, and I'm not saying you should not, be sure to request the size of your assigned room (and know that you will not really be in what you expect to be a suite).  After the third night, the turn down amenities stopped altogether, almost as if they were ramping down that particular service toward our eventual departure.  One night there was no bedside water and candy left in an odd spot, so perhaps this is all an evening housekeeping issue.  We did thoroughly enjoy the bar and the bartender Antonio (?) in particular.  Had we realized the size of the room, noise and subsequent service glitches, we probably would have just stayed at The Milestone for full price.",4,2012,06,16
105,Excellent,"A real gem in London. First class staff, best concierge and walking distance from all the major historical sites. Highly recommended!! A welcoming bottle of wine and daily hors d'oeuvres delivered to our room.",5,2012,06,15
105,Fantabulous Weekend!,"What can I say other than what a gem of an hotel! Booked for our 20th anniversary and treated ourselves to the Mayfair Weeekend package which included 3 nights bed and breakfast, afternoon tea, bottle of champagne, complimentary newspapers and Internet. Excellent value for money when you compare it to many of the ""room only"" deals in central London. We took our afternoon tea on arrival and cannot fault the attentiveness of the staff, their knowledge of what they are serving in terms of us trying new teas and the quality and presentation of the food. All in all a great start to our break. We chose to have dinner in The Butlers Restaurant on our first evening and again, the staff were very attentive and the food again was excellent and reasonably priced. We booked a superior king room which was not huge but perfectly adequate. Beautifully decorated and bed linen and pillows to die for! Must admit to not usually sleeping well in hotels but not this one - I was out like a light! Breakfast - well all I can say is fill your boots! Plenty of fruit, yoghurt, croissants and cereals to choose from plus the excellent selection of cooked breakfast. Set us up for a full day of sightseeing. I can honestly say that you would be hard pressed to find an hotel which is such good value in the perfect spot than this. Literally 10 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and likewise Regent/Oxford Street. Green Park tube is five minutes walk away if needed but with everything in close proximity we tended to walk everywhere. I cannot praise the Chesterfield enough. We will definitely be back as we loved it so much.",5,2012,06,14
105,Wonderful!,"Stayed for 3 nights in June 2012, chose this hotel due to the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. The staff in the hotel have made our stay extremely pleasant through their helpfulness and friendliness. They're always willing to go the extra mile, even when it's merely giving directions to the nearest convenience shop. My family booked two standard queen rooms. We stayed on the seventh floor in the rooms right at the end. The space was adequate, if not very big. The bathroom was stocked with amenities (although I would have preferred it if slippers were provided in the room instead of having to call housekeeping for them). I loved the little treats left on the pillows during turn-down service. The beds were EXTREMELY comfortable! The hotel is a 7 minute walk to Green Park station, which was bearable. We also had afternoon tea on our last day there, which was not bad and quite filling. Of course, I think I would have enjoyed the hotel even more if I hadn't been out exploring London the whole day!",5,2012,06,12
105,Amazing experience,"I got in touch with Chesterfield as i was looking for someone special to hold afternoon tea for my mothers 50th birthday and from the moment I got in touch they were extremely helpful.  Our main contact Antoine most certainly went the extra mile in order to make sure the day was very special.  We book the library exclusively as there were 13 of us and it is a truly beautiful room and made the experience all the more special.  The food was beautiful and the plates were replenished constantly so that you didnt go hungry.  I have had afternoon tea as many places that are considered more luxorious and which were most certainly more expensive and I can honestly say that none came even close the Chesterfield.  I would highly recommend that you go here for afternoon tea as it is a beautiful hotel and the staff are terrific! I could go on forever with how good my experience was but just think you should try it for yourself, you wont be dissapointed!",5,2012,06,12
105,The most service friendly hotel,"We recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London in April as part of our Paris/London vacation.  Everyone and I mean everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  We never once opened a door or carried our own bags.  There staff made us feel like it was a personal pleasure for them to aid and assist us any way they could.  The concierge was incredibly  knowledgeable about everywhere we wanted to go from the Underground, Oxford shopping district, The theatre district, and tours.  Even the kitchen and maid staff were extremely efficient and courteous.  And we got room service every morning.  The room was clean, neat and very comfortable.  The wifi was efficient and copiers and printers all available.  We will definitely stay there again when we come back.  Restaurant was delicious also.",5,2012,06,11
105,Excellant Hotel with Charm,Stayed for long weekend in May. Fantasic experience and couldn't fault any aspect of the stay including the Afternoon Tea. Wonderful meal and very attentive and helpful staff. Would certianly stay again. If you like big glitzy then this would not be the place for old. An old world charm with all the mod cons.,5,2012,06,11
105,Genuine service in a perfect environment,"My first visit to this hotel provided me with a different perspective on what makes a fine hotel. Sparkling new facilities, piles of pillows and similar amenities do not hold a torch to proper demeanor, courteous service, and attention to details as was evidenced in this hotel. Not that anything physical was lacking; it wasn't. The class in this hotel was far above what is considered normal nowadays.",5,2012,06,10
105,"The Chesterfield Mayfair, London","Being in London on business trip this hotel was my choice on several occasions. Great location, walking distance to Piccadilly Circus, Soho, parks etc. Hotel is located in Mayfair, classy, 'old money' neighborhood in central London with great restaurants and bars nearby.  Hotel itself is very nice old Victorian style building (at least i thing it's Victorian), rooms very classy but small with all the usual necessities available.   Great breakfast - try eggs benedick - never tried supper, with all these great restaurants in London to chose from, felt kind of silly to eat in my hotel. Anyway, have stayed in The Chesterfield 3-4 times and always has been a great experience and hopefully will be back. Recommended.",4,2012,06,10
105,Fantastic service,"We stayed in this hotel the first week in June for our honeymoon.  Everyone at this hotel went out of their  way to make our visit special.  The staff at the front desk, bartenders, housekeepers, all greeted us with a cheery hello.  The hotel is in a lovely neighborhood away from the hectic center.  A small ""village,"" Shepard's Market, is right down the street and has wonderful small restaurants with a variety of food choices.  There is no Metro stop or bus stop close by but within walking distance.  The room was very tiny but clean and pleasant.  We would stay here again when we return to London.",5,2012,06,09
105,Very enjoyable,"I stayed here with work for a couple of evenings, very comfortable, very relaxing, very enjoyable - service was very good, I'm looking forward to going back.",4,2012,06,06
105,A squashy sofa retreat in the heart of London’s Mayfair,"If it’s classy and upmarket Mayfair you wish to base yourself whilst in London then The Chesterfield will undoubtably tick all your boxes. A nicely proportioned property, it falls neatly in between the more obvious larger properties either on, or just off, Park Lane. A discreet buzz pervades but service and attention to detail are superb. The bar area serves stylish cocktails and is perfect for a light lunch. A relatively undiscovered gem.",5,2012,06,03
105,A very friendly and comfortable hotel where the food is excellent and the service even better.,"We stayed for one night to meet some American friends that had come over for the Jubilee. The greeting was friendly and efficient, the room was comfortable and well appointed. Complimentary tea, coffee and mineral water in the room, fresh milk available on request. Free wifi and Internet on the TV. The bed was large and very comfortable and the air conditioning was easy to operate and unobtrusive. The bathroom was not large but had everything including robes. A shower over the bath gave a deluge of water.
We met our friends for dinner in the dining room which had a relaxed atmosphere. There was a large choice on the menu but we chose the ""Roast"" of the day which was salmon en croute with fresh vegetables and a hollandaise sauce. The food was excellent and service efficient but unobtrusive. A very relaxing meal. A nightcap in the bar listening to live piano music completed the evening.
Returning to our room it had been refreshed (including tea and milk) with packets of bath crystals on the pillows.
Breakfast was in the same dining room. Again, attentive staff and excellent food. A buffet held fresh juices, smoothies, fresh fruit, cheeses and cold meats, and a selection of warm pastries. A smoked salmon version of eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked. I had a cappucino. As soon as I finished it a waitress appeared to enquire if I would like another. ",5,2012,06,02
105,What a find!,"Nestled in a quiet but elegant street in Mayfair, The Chesterfield is a welcome haven for the London visitor. It is close to the action and all the good shopping but the rooms are quiet and well appointed. The staff, particularly the management, go out of their way to make sure your stay is pleasant and comfortable. Comfortable beds and pillows , great shower and bathroom, nice bar and restaurant. Will definitely return and recommend it to friends.",5,2012,05,31
105,A special place to stay.,Great location but the real pleasure comes from a top quality hotel that knows how to treat its guests. The staff are genuinely friendly and seem to enjoy being there. A place to go for a special treat. Enjoy the lovely rooms and don't miss out on the restaurant - they have a great undiscovered gem of a chef.,5,2012,05,29
105,"Cosy, friendly and professional","A hidden gem, I'd say! VERY nice hotel in a quite setting. We can really recommend this place for those to like good service.
The restaurans serves av variety of different cooked breakfasts, great! We had tea one day, this was n't as good a the rest of the hotel - the staff didn't listen to what we told them about allergies etc. 
Overall great, though! We will stay here when we go to London in the future!",5,2012,05,28
105,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield on 12th/13th May.  This was our second visit.  It was every bit as good as the first.  Our room was comfortable, and amazingly quiet for such a central location.  It was luxurious to take a bath in the well-appointed bathroom.  All that we needed was supplied, and more.  In the evening, we found in our room a card and two beautiful little cakes, for our wedding anniversary, and a third little cake for my husband's birthday.  This was a very thoughtful gesture.  The breakfast was delicious, and the surroundings lovely.  Above all, we like the staff.  Everyone we met was welcoming, friendly and helpful in a most genuine way.  We'd definitely recommend this hotel for its attention to detail, and the atmosphere of calm relaxation, as well as for its high standards in every respect.  It is, of course, also in an excellent spot for exploring central London, and it's an added bonus to have the beautiful Green Park on the doorstep.",5,2012,05,28
105,Wonderful stay,"We have just stayed for three nights in a standard queen room, while the room is compact in size it was all we needed.  I enjoyed the full bath at the end of our busy days and the lovely linen on the bed. 
 The location of the Chesterfield is perfect for walking to many of the main tourist sites.
We enjoyed champagne in the lounge and a lovely high tea one afternoon.
The staff were extremely friendly.
We used the complimentary gym just down the road, finding the back entrance is a bit tricky but worth it in the end.
We would recommend this hotel for location, ambience, service, and cleanliness.",5,2012,05,22
105,One night stay,"Stayed in a twin (302) on Saturday night.  Welcome at reception was good, as was information provided.  Room comfortable enough, except that it was a little too small for two chairs to go round the table.  Decor-wise most of the room was fine, but there was a red plastic surround to the bed which jarred somewhat with the quality of the other furnishings and finishings.

Shower was lovely and we didn't drown the bathroom, as some others have mentioned.  

Room 302 is right by the room service door, so I was awakened at about 6.30am by breakfasts being brought through to other guests.  

However, breakfast could be improved.  The coffee was rather weak and no one explained at first about using the breakfast buffet for the express choice.  The freshly squeezed orange juice was excellent, as were the croissants, but these were let down by the roll which had been left in the chafer for far too long and was rock hard.  

Would I stay again, sure if someone else was paying!",4,2012,05,22
105,Home away from home in London,"My wife and I stayed 4 nights early May. Fantastic hotel. Great staff, great small boutique hotel and very well located. I booked this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. Close to everything. Metro, cafes, West End. Our room was spacious with great bathroom. Decor spotless.",5,2012,05,21
105,Our favourite hotel,"My husband and I recently enjoyed a weekend break at the Chesterfield to celebrate a special occasion. We have stayed there on several occasions and always love coming back. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The staff are lovely and the food is excellent. It is situated in a perfect location. 

We have stayed at various hotels in London, but the Chesterfield is our favourite and look forward to going back in the future.",5,2012,05,21
105,At Home in London,"I must echo the fine words of others who have praised the Chesterfield Hotel. My partner discovered this hotel and made the booking for a weekend stay. From the moment we arrived until our departure we found the hotel and its staff to be superb. The rates are excellent and we felt like invited guests to the Earl of Chesterfield's private London home rather than a hotel.

The staff were genuinely kind and helpful from the doorman who assisted in valeting out motorcar, to the kind staff at check in, to the concierge who booked a hotel and the bar staff who not only looked after us but our four legged companion Amira, who in keeping with her name was treated like a princess. As one of the few pet friendly hotels in London, they have a complete menu for dogs and cats and nobody every treated her as less than a welcomed guest. 

The restaurant and conservatory were very well kept, the meals excellent and service there also first rate. Everyone was helpful and smiling. It made the entire experience that much more stress free. 

Our room was a superior double and we were very pleased to have so much space. Even with a king sized bed. The bathroom was well appointed and quite new and very clean. Housekeeping was excellent and courteous when we needed an extra towel and they were so very patient with regard coming round to make up our room when we were out with our beloved pet.

I cannot rate this hotel and its terrific staff highly enough. I would close with we will, of course, be back. But I would like to also mention we met another couple who have been coming to the Chesterfield for several years, sometimes bi-weekly and they refuse to stay anywhere else. 

Combine the excellent hotel with catering kind staff, very good rates and an absolutely fantastic location for shopping on New Bond Street or walking to Hyde Park and you have you dream hotel in London.",5,2012,05,20
105,Big Breakfast,Nice hotel in nice area. Breakfasts were more than ample. Clean and tidy rooms. Only no mini bar fridge in our room so that was inconvenient. (Were not told that when booking). Would recommend.,4,2012,05,17
105,Stylish but not perfect,"I stayed here a few years ago and loved it.  I was anxious to return when my husband and I planned an overnight trip for my Birthday.  The room was super - spacious for a London hotel, stylish and with a lovely bathroom.  All the public places are very stylish too.  However, the mini bar was empty apart from someone's half eaten salad.  Also the service in the restaurant was slow although dinner was very good.  The breakfast buffet was average for a hotel of this standard.",4,2012,05,14
105,Excellent Stay,"My wife and I had an excellent stay at the hotel and as a result thoroughly enjoyed our few days break in London.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly Laura and her colleagues at the front desk.  We will certainly go back to the hotel when we have the opportunity - and indeed are planning our next trip at this very moment.",5,2012,05,13
105,Absolutely  fantastic stay!!,"This was my first trip to London, besides solo.  According to tripadvisor, this hotel has a  high reputation among many guests. So I stayed there  for 6nights.
The hotel is located near Green park station. It's  the best location to go around everywhere, a lot of  sightseeing spots, galleries, and museums. All staff is full of hospitality and kind to help a traveler overseas who is not a good English speaker.
The room was gorgeous and very British.I love it!! 
The room charge is a little expensive but worth paying it. English breakfast was so delicious,but I needed some fresh vegetables.
Next time I visit London, I 'm sure that I will stay at this hotel again!!",5,2012,05,13
105,Nice hotel in very good location,"Nice, large rooms with pretty furnishings; great location in the heart of Mayfair (close the Berkeley Square; Bond Street; Green Park tube station; and Picaddilly); good service at the hotel; decent value by London standards.

Tamarind (Indian restaurant) is a block away.",5,2012,05,12
105,A Gem of a Hotel.,"A previous job involved me inspecting safety requirements in many west end (London) hotels - including and especially the back room areas that guests most definitely do not see!. Obviously, I also check out the comfort & facilities at each hotel - nothing to do with the job - but just because I enjoyed comparing the scores of different hotels that I visited. During 6 years of inspections, The Chesterfield impressed me most in terms of customer service, comfort and scale (it's smaller scale makes it warmer and less corporate). I always promised myself I would stay there - although I live only 20 miles away, I couldn't find an 'excuse'. 

So when it came to celebrating my wife's (more significant) birthday, I took here to a trip to London. She knew nothing of the lunch & evening restaurants & theatre trip I had planned or even what hotel we would stay at. I was determined she would have a good time, so it had to be The Chesterfield - they didn't let me down!

The whole experience was magnificent and she (we) had a great time. The staff were superb and the room was quiet and very very cozy and luxurious. I can't comment on the food as we ate out in the evening (next to the theatre) and ate breakfast in a little place I discovered near Shepherds market just around the corner.

This place is a gem. In the middle of everywhere, but simultaneously in the middle of nowhere as it's tucked into a quiet street (handy for a good night's sleep) of millionaires mansions off of Park Lane

We will be back to experience the service again - and this time the food. Congratulations to the management and staff of this lovely little hotel",5,2012,05,12
105,Great Location,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair last August.   We had a wonderful stay.  The staff was very helpful and welcoming and the location can't be beat.  We walked everywhere!  The Green Park tube station is a few blocks away and Shepard's Market has good restaurants and pubs.  Our room was a standard double.  While it was small, it had all the conveniences we needed, and a great shower with lots of hot water!  We booked their weekend package which included tea for 2, daily breakfast and late check out.  We booked directly with the hotel and paid @300 dollars a night.  For the extras and location we felt it was a good deal.  I tried to book with them for a trip in early July but rooms are now going for upwards of 500 dollars a night without breakfast or tea!",4,2012,05,11
105,Lovely London Experience,"I love staying in Mayfair and have thought about the Chesterfield Mayfair many times.  This time I satisified my curiosity and could not have had a more delightful experience.  The traditional decor is warm and welcoming and the helpful staff was full of good cheer.  The bed was oh so comfortable and the bathroom floor was heated.  What more could you want!  I've stayed at several of the ""grand"" London hotels and a number of boutique properties but never have had such a thoroughly pleasant stay.  I can't wait for my next visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2012,05,11
105,Favourite London hotel,"We stayed for a nice three night break at this lovely hotel on our way to explore a liitle of the UK. This is our third visit to the UK and also our third to the Chesterfield. We simply fell in love with it on our first trip in 2004 and wish that it was not thousands of kms away! We stopped off this trip basically because we wanted to have the Chesterfield experience one more time. It is truly an experience! The ambience generally and the staff especially make it special. 
We loved our stay again even though there were a couple of little issues which we were not so happy about. Firstly there was no special welcome as a returning customer - somehow the computer slipped up here and we did miss it. Secondly we were not as happy with our room as we had previously been. The room was a classic double and was quite compact but nicely decorated but the size and awkwardness of the bathhroom was a disappointment. The shower over the bath was very hard to operate as one could not move the swinging glass petition(it was meant to)and so could't reach the taps etc. Also with the bathrobes hanging on the back of the door you couldn't open the door fully as it hit the basin  - one of the smallest bathrooms we had come across. 
We did change rooms after the first night to a room that had a slightly better arranged bathroom. It was an upgrade ( a king room) but basically that means that the bed is bigger but not necessarilly the bathroom. We did have to pay an extra 20 pounds for the upgrade which we agreed to the first time we asked but did get a little annoyed when it was mentioned again three more times - not the service we had come to expect from our favourite hotel. Despite this we do still love this hotel and hope one day to return - the staff, the bar area, the spectacular afternoon tea and wonderful food in the restaurant  - all make it so special.",5,2012,05,10
105,"""Bags of charm, and the staff a cut above""","My wife and I stayed here over the recent bank holiday weekend, to celebrate both our birthdays. We try and visit London at least three times a year, over the last five or so, to experience the fine dining that the capital has to offer, but of course this means that we also get to experience a lot of hotels in the Knightsbridge, Kensington, westminster and of course Mayfair areas. We had booked this hotel earlier in the year, but what they do is send you an email, to which they look forward to your arrival, and it then goes on to list any specific requirements that may make your stay more comfortable, for example feather or synthetic pillows and likewise for the duvet, and so and so on, so they can have them ready for your arrival, and i thought this was a really nice and clever touch. We arrived late Friday afternoon, to a cheerful reception, and we were checked in very smoothly by the young lady on reception. On arrival to the room, although a little compact, it was exceptionally clean and bright with lots of windows and a real home from home feel, with everything you would expect, from tea and coffee facilities, slippers and robes to complimentry internet access, which by the way was very easy to log on to, no hassle and fast, with our bubbly on ice with compliments of the hotel, and a very comfortable bed (In fact, as my wife suffers from a bad back, this important feature is often overlooked by some hotels and can make or break our weekend) Dare I say it but the decor is a little dated, in the mock style of a cross between and olde world gentlemens club and a Englishmans raj villa, but this takes nothing away from good old fashioned customer service and attention to our every need. The breakfast was probably one of the best i have had, and I can highly recommend the traditional english and the eggs benedict, but the choice is vast and caters for all tastes and there is also a self serve breakfast buffet offering cold meats, yogurts, fresh fruit and a wide selection of juices, including beetroot for the joggers amongst us! We also took up on the afternoon tea at the chesterfield, and again the theme of excellent customer service was there for all to enjoy, and nothing was too much trouble, and they even provided us with there own elegant take on the doggy bag, by putting what we couldnt finish into a box to enjoy later on with the signature red carnation neatly  attached to the top. 
Most evenings after we had eaten in various establishments across London, we would return to the hotel for a night cap before bed, in the hotel bar, and at the risk of repeating myself over and over again, the service was excellent, we would choose from a good list of beers, cocktails and spirits etc, but if your favourite tipple did not appear on there menu, then they were more than happy to arrange it for you, and at this point i would like to single out Antonio, who was an abolute star and very charming, russelling up a small selection of chocolates one evening, when he found to his horror that we had passed on desserts on our evening meal, he is a real credit to the chesterfield and personifies the whole attitude displayed by all the staff and management at this truly, warm, friendly and proffesional hotel in mayfair. This hotel provided us with all we needed during our stay, from a practical sense and, to a proffesional sense. thankyou to all and we look forward to returning in the near future.",5,2012,05,08
105,A lovely small hotel,"We stayed at The Chesterfield in late April, 2012.  It was lovely.  Our room was ready when we arrived in the early morning after an overnight flight, so we could catch a short nap before venturing out.  The rainforest shower heads were great and the bed very comfortable.  The prominent motif is wonderful wood.  The staff could not be more helpful.  Kudos especially to concierges Chris and Tony.  The location is perfect, off Berkeley Square and a five minute walk to the Green Park tube stop.  Just a walk across Green Park to Buckingham Palace.  We would definitely stay there again, with perhaps an upgrade to our room which was small.",5,2012,05,07
105,Amazing hospitality,"My first trip abroad occurred 3 weeks ago. The chesterfield Mayfair exceeded any expectations I had about a London hotel experience. 

The staff is what sets this hotel apart. Every staff person we met was friendly, helpful, and professional. I loved Carolina, our server every morning at breakfast. What a sweetie. And Adrian who showed us our room and gave dining recommendations. 

The dining was superb. We had one dinner here, 4 breakfasts, bar food & the afternoon tea. Everything was delicious. The tea is exceptional.

The beds are so comfortable. The linens are the coziest I've ever slept under. Rooms are tight by American standards, but very nicely appointed. Very good bathroom. Loved the teas, cookies, waters left daily. And the turn down service was such a nice touch...facial mist or bath crystals were left on the pillow each evening to enjoy. 

I hope I return to London again and without a doubt in will stay at this hotel. It truly felt like a home away from home. I loved it!",5,2012,05,06
105,Traditional Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I had a wonderful time experiencing traditional English afternoon tea. The setting was appropriate and the staff were exceptionally nice. I had to write a report on my experience for school and the manager was very helpful. He really took the time out of his busy schedule to talk to me and answer any questions I had. I think he noticed that I absolutely LOVED the scones, so he even gave me the recipe for them! I've tried other places for afternoon tea but I would love to come back here again and bring my family or other friends. The tea was had the perfect amount of water in it and the food was all delicious ( the scones though are my favorite! ). We were even given a bag to take home some traditional English candy! 

Easily 5 green tripadvisor circles rating.",5,2012,05,04
105,Great Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights last weekend when the rain never stopped. The staff were friendly and efficient and check in was smooth and easy. Our rooms were spotless and cosy. Our bed was so so comfy and the bed linen was so smooth. Breakfast was delicious, something for everyone. We had afternoon tea which again was delicious and plentiful. The bar staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. The doorman always had an umbrella available when we went out in the rain and always managed to get us a taxi. On returning to our room one evening there was a lovely anniversary card and 2 cupcakes on a plate waiting for us , just another example of the quality of the hotel. The weekend was a celebration and it more than fulfilled our expectations. It is not the cheapest hotel but is a definate must for anyone wanting a little luxury and brillaint staff.",5,2012,05,04
105,Simply Wonderful,"Superb stay at this establishment. Staff are fantastic! Service was excellent. Room had everything one could need. Big thank you to Sandine on Front desk and Jo (not sure) the Front Office manager and the doorman who was always on the ready for my many cab rides with my giant suitcase.

Well done!",5,2012,05,04
105,Great Location,"We stayed at the Chesterfield on a Saturday night in March 2012. The hotel is in a great location, right in the heart of things but on an especially quiet street so none of the usual London traffic noise. We have stayed at the Chesterfield many times before and have always found it to be run to an exceptionally high standard. The staff are exceptionally helpful, the rooms well decorated and cleanliness is obviously high on the agenda. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family alike.",4,2012,05,03
105,The Real British Experience,"My husband has stayed at this hotel many times and raved about it.  I decided to try it on my last trip to the UK.  It was wonderful.  If you are looking for the traditional British hotel this is it.  It is very relaxing and beautifully decorated.  The restaurant looks out on a stunning patio, and the room was very comfortable.  I would highly recommend it.",5,2012,05,02
105,"""Great Staff""","We stayed at the Chesterfield for 4 nights in April, 2012.  Great location!  Very cozy room.  Great English breakfast!  But it's the staff that sets it apart.  From the welcome they gave us when we first entered the lobby, to the farewell when we left, the entire staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.  One of our travelling companions lost his wallet to a pickpocket and the staff helped him contact his credit card companies and the police.  They even provided him with a complimentary drink to help him deal with the stress.  Even the maintenance man who came to our room to deal with a rattling window not only solved the problem quickly, but was cordial and friendly.  I can't imagine a hotel with better service.",5,2012,04,30
105,A rewarding experience,"I have stayed at 5 star hotels around the world and have never experienced the quality and service of the Chesterfield Hotel staff.

They work as a team to ensure that every need that you may have is seen to in a very professional and speedy way.

Bravo to the Chesterfield Hotel, Mayfair, London, England",5,2012,04,30
105,Fantastic Staff,"We recently stayed at the Chesterfield for 5 nights. We couldn't be happier with our stay. The rooms are not very large, but this is easily overlooked by the attractive decorations, cleaniness and wonderfully large bath tub and shower. The staff are exceptionally friendly, professional and they sincerely wanted to accomodate and make our stay as pleasant as possible. The breakfast was very good. Rather pricey, but no more so than the rest of London. I would and will highly recommend this hotel to my friends, family and those of you who want a centrally located, excellent hotel.   Jean   California",5,2012,04,28
105,"A nice, very ""English"" hotel in a great location","We stayed in this hotel for a few nights in October 2011 during my annual business conference. The location speaks for itself: Mayfair! What else could you desire for a good access to your destinations, whether it is business or leisure.

 I found the hotel extremely cozy and comfy. The rooms are decorated with taste and have everything at your convenience. Excellent bedding hence great sleep quality. Bathroom is medium-sized but also very nice and well-equipped, with 1st class toiletries provided. We didn't hear any noise of the city during our stay.

I have to mention that the hotel cuisine was mediocre, so I would recommend to experience some other places for dining. This doesn't refer to  the Afternoon Tea which was perfect.

The staff is quite friendly but a bit lacking for attention. We had an issue upon arrival when the mashine blocked the funds for the whole stay+extras from our card . Somehow the transaction repeated, so the a  considerable amount of money on my debet card got blocked (as you know, staying in Mayfair is not a cheap thing). We were only left with about 2 grands available for our trip and shopping, while we had to travel further in the UK after leaving London. Thank God, a colleague did me a favor and topped up my card from  Moscow, otherwise we would have had problems  there. I understand that mashines can fail everywhere and this cannot be 100% avoided, but I was surprised with the reaction of the staff for this incident.  They acted as if nothing happened. No apologize or compliments were offered which would have been natural for such inconvenience. Not that I am greedy but just mentioning this for accuracy.

But to be honest, in all the other moments the staff  was fine.

All in all, I would recommend this hotel for everyone.",5,2012,04,27
105,Without doubt the best hotel in the world,"WOW, is the only way to describe the experience of staying at The Chesterfield. The service is unbelievable, the meals are outstanding and the location is second to none. 

If you get the opportunity to go to London, you must stay at The Chesterfield as it will be an experience you will never get anywhere else

Cheers

Todd",5,2012,04,25
105,A great home from home in Mayfair London,"What a find! I have been going for short breaks to London and use this hotel regularly. It is charming and well run, the rooms are very comfortable and luxurious and the food is excellent. When we arrive the staff are quick to welcome us and to take our bags and nothing is ever any trouble. I am fussy about service and accommodation but cannot fault this hotel.",5,2012,04,25
105,A home from home haven in busy London,"This quaint and very comfortable hotel has been a real win, as a person who travels a great deal and has to spend numerous nights away from home in strange hotels. The friendy efficient staff will always go out of theri way to assist you in any way they can and will try to make your stay a memorable one. The food is excellent and caters for different tastes. The hotel has a wonderful bar where one can sip an excellent galss of wine and listen to John create magic on the piano. As a single female I feel quite comfortable going to this cosy bar on my own. What a win to discover on my last trip that the owners are also South African. I have stayed at The Chesterfield many times and the standard is always excellent. I will not stay anywhere else in London.",5,2012,04,24
105,Great location and quality service,"This is our second stay with this chain and very pleased.  A repeat of the excellent service and the location is superb, walkling distance to most places and the tube stops nearby are fantastic.

Cannot fault it at all.  Of course there will be the odd grumble of room size but remember our standards have changed since this building was created. Enjoy the experience and if you can negotiate a deal even better.

The nearby Shepherds Market area is a realy find, pub food not great but a small restaurant on the street level is superb opposite the pubs.

Great location and great hotel, will be back again.",5,2012,04,23
105,A great hotel in a great location,"My wife and I recently spent 4 nights at the hotel.  We were warmly welcomed and everyone tried their best to make us feel at home and appreciated.  We had a twin room that was very well done and quite spacious.  The morning breakfast was outstanding....many, many menu items to chose from.   The hotel is located near Green Park and there is a small area called Shepards Park were we frequently had dinner...many great small restaurants.  I would stay there again the next time we visit london.  The hotel is in a great location.  You can visit many areas by walking from there, e.g. Big Ben, Parliment, the Westminister Abbey, etc.   A wonderful hotel with a wonderful staff.  Stay there; you will love it.",5,2012,04,21
105,Outstanding London Hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a great location.  The room was lovey and the service was amazing.   We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight and the hotel was nice enough to allow us to check in early.  We were impressed throughout our stay by the cheerful attitude of the staff. 
The room was clean, comfortable and well equipped.  Have to say the Chesterfield was one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in and we look forward to staying there on our next trip to London.",5,2012,04,20
105,Fantastic service in the middle of Mayfair,"I booked three rooms for two nights over the weekend. Any problems that we encountered were very swiftly dealt with and as a guest of a hotel you could not ask for anything more than that. I have already booked to go again as I can always book with confidence that the hotel meets my expectation. 
",5,2012,04,18
105,London,"What a great welcoming place to come to after the flight from the US! We were greeted by name every time we went to the front desk. The room was tiny but very comfortable and the bathroom was complete with toiletries. We booked tours through the concierge, had afternoon tea, and enjoyed drinks in the evening in the bar. We took full advantage of the hotel. You couldn't find a better, central location in London and a more welcoming hotel.",5,2012,04,14
105,Always good to return to,"The Chesterfield continues to provide excellent service and we enjoyed another three days at our favourite hotel in London. The service continues to be a highlight with everyone welcoming you back after a tiring day  so you feel you happy to return. Thank you for treating us on this visit with such a good deal, we appreciated it. Breakfasts were once again lovely and the porridge continues to be a personal favourite, please dont take it off the menu even in summer.",5,2012,04,12
105,A Very Pleasant Weekend,"The hotel is very comfortable and has a convenient and quiet location.  It has a good blend of high standards, friendliness and informality.

The Mayfair Weekend that includes full English breakfasts, an afternoon tea and bottle of champagne is good value for money.",5,2012,04,12
105,Unpleasant booking experience,"After reading the TA reviews, I booked a superior king room at this hotel, despite the fact that room sizes were not provided on their website.  I then submitted an inquiry through the website requesting the room size and the price of breakfast.
I immediately received an auto reply from the managing director advising me that I would be contacted from someone from the hotel or by someone from Avoya travel, their ""travel partner"".
Within an hour I received a) a form email and b) a phone call from Avoya saying that they had been given my email by the hotel and that they would be happy to assist me if I emailed or phoned them.  Neither communication provided an answer to my questions.  The bulk of the email was to tell me that they had many promotions that they were sure would interest me.

I then phoned the American contact number only to discover that they knew nothing about the hotel.  I was transferred to an agent who, they assured me, would be able to help, and she knew nothing about the hotel.  She said she could get the information and call me back in about half an hour.  I told her not to bother and called the hotel myself.
I was informed that their superior King room, the largest non-suite room, was 156 sq. ft.  Now, I've been to London many times and know that hotel rooms can be small, but I've never encountered quite this small a room - perhaps the reason the hotel website doesn't provide room sizes!
The most disappointing part of the whole experience was the difficulty obtaining information from the hotel and their ""agents"".  A fact which I felt didn't bode well for the service which would be provided in the hotel itself.",1,2012,04,11
105,Super hotel,"Great facility, terrific room and nice intimate bar setting.

Also, great location near Green Park underground station.",5,2012,04,10
105,Mayfair's Best Kept Secret,"This has to be one of the finest hotels I have stayed in (and preferred it to my stay in a riverview suite at The Savoy) staff are amazing, impeccable mannered ,respectful and with useful information on travel,local restaurants , We stayed in a King room on the 4th floor it was calm,quiet and immaculate!just what we needed on a break without the children ,in short we cannot wait to for another excuse to have a weekend away and we know where we are going to stay!,oh nearly forgot Full English breakfast is a must :)",5,2012,04,10
105,A Lovely Stay,"We stayed here to celebrate a variety of events kicking off our 2012 year. The staff went out of their way to recognize both our 30th Anniversary as well as my wife's completion of her Masters degree. Personal touches like that are what make a good hotel great. 

The staff and service was excellent and certainly warrant no complaints from us. The location of the hotel is truly central; it is easy to walk to most anywhere you want to go. It would be nicer if London would relocate the Green Park tube line a little closer, but I don't think that's too likely! :)",5,2012,04,09
105,Best home away from home in London!,Absolutely love everything about this lovely boutique hotel including the great location...but their passion for service is what really shines from the moment the cab pulls up; the doorman greets you warmly; the reception desk is equally welcoming and efficient; the bellman and concierge are eager to get you settled; the rooms are all warmly and thoughtfully appointed (right down to the heated bathroom mirror to eliminate fogging from a hot shower). This was our second stay and we can't wait to return!  A special thanks to everyone-especially Adam- when delivering morning room service to our daughter who awoke with a terrible sore throat. The hot tea and fresh/warm croissants with jam brought her back to life for our last full day in London!,5,2012,04,09
105,A Jewel,"I have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair several times and I must admit that this is my favourite Red Carnation hotel in London due to its location.  The standard of service is impeccable and this applies to both the bar and restaurant staff as well as front of house.  The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable and the bathrooms excellent - or certainly the suites that we have stayed in have been.  If you need a taxi on Sunday morning make sure that you warn the desk in advance rather than just expecting one to turn up on demand.  Although a short walk to Oxford Street and Regent Street, the hotel is not on a main thoroughfare.",5,2012,04,06
105,Perfect Honeymoon stay..,"My wife and I recently stayed at the chesterfield on our honeymoon and couldn't have been happier with the beautiful hotel, excellent location and fantastic staff.

After a long flight from Australia via the USA we were greeted by cheery friendly staff and shown to our room on the 4th floor ( the ""Chesterfield suite"").
We found the room to be of a good size, nicely decorated with a beautifully fitted bathroom with spa bath and fluffy robes.  
During our stay we made use of the hotels unbeatable location, walking everywhere in the city to visit the many tourist attractions, museums and galleries, as well as the great restaurants and shopping districts nearby. Its central location also made it a breeze to get the underground, buses or cabs if you wanted to go further afield.

We also enjoyed the meals from room service, the great spread for breakfast and we had an incredible meal at the in house 'Butlers"" restaurant. The food was very modern british with an extensive (mostly french) wine list. The desserts were also excellent.

What really makes the chesterfield exceptional is the incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly staff. From the complimentary bottle of champagne, to the congratulations card signed by the GM and the entire staff, to the daily personal greetings. We were made to feel very special on this very memorable time of our lives.

I cannot recommend the chesterfield highly enough. It ticked all the boxes and scored me major points with the wife.",5,2012,04,03
105,"excellent room, not too expensive","Lovely old fashioned hotel, excellent location, beautiful rooms, not extortionately priced. Really happy with our stay.",5,2012,04,01
105,Outstanding,"We booked this hotel thru Costco London/Paris vacation package and couldn't have been happier (great price/wonderful hotel).  We normally just book any Hilton member hotel when traveling about so that we are never unpleasantly surprised, but we were so happy Costco had arrangements at the Chesterfield. Wonderful staff/facilities/restaurant & amenities and I really couldn't think of any complaints whatsoever, although we initially were slightly taken aback that the room was a little on the smallish side, but hey, that's the nature of older city hotels where space is at a premium i.e. it's what you do with the space, and here, the Chesterfield excels at making the most of the space with charming details.  As far as location goes, couldn't be better: Mayfair (need I say more), close to tube, attractions and uncrowded restaurants a couple blocks away.  Right down the street: is a coffee/pastry shop and the ""Smart Mart"" that stays open quite late is convenient for cheap treats & more importantly has an ATM (that I researched ahead of time) with 0 transaction fees for my particular international bank.",5,2012,03,31
105,The Chesterfield Made My Daughter's Birthday,"I recently stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for a birthday surprise for my 9 year old daughter.  I had called in the previous weekend to have a little look around as we had stumbled by accident in to the Mayfair area due to bus traffic diversions.  From the moment I walked in to reception we were greeted by such wonderful staff.

The front desk Manager, Jack, took time out to show me around the hotel and its rooms.  I explained this was for a birthday treat to which he said he would try to get his very best room. He did not let me down!

I returned the following week with my daughter and once again was met by the most thoughtful of people.  The Bellman, Englebert, immediately approached my daughter to greet her and offered her some sweets from the restaurant whilst I signed in.  Jack once again came to greet us and introduced himself to Morgan, acknowledging her birthday which really made her feel special.    

The room itself was so classic and beautifully decorated.  My daughter absolutely loved it.  The thought that this hotel has put into it guests is incredible.  They even supplied robe and slippers that were the right size just for my daughter!!  Every member of staff we met was friendly and helpful beyond words.  Nothing was too much trouble.

That night we returned to our room after seeing a show.  In the room the staff had arranged a cup cake with Happy Birthday written around the plate, along with a bag of sweets and a beautiful birthday card signed by what looked like everyone from the Chesterfield!!

When it came to our last day the hotel stored our bags away for the day whilst we made the most of our last few hours in London.   When we returned to collect our belongings the staff including Jack, Englebert and Tony (first class concierge!) came to say goodbye and presented my daughter with a tiny Chesterfield Teddy for her to keep.

This was my daughter first trip to London and what a memorable experience this beautiful hotel and its members of staff made for her.  She took along the Teddy for show and tell on the Monday morning at school and told everyone about her birthday trip.  She is now on my case to book a return visit to the Chesterfield (before her next birthday!). This hotel has won the loyalty of a 9 year old!

Whatever your reason for visiting London this is definitely the hotel I would highly recommend.  The staff are absolutely incredible and the hotel is in a class of its own.  The customer service you will receive will be second to none.  I recently stayed at well known 5 star hotel just around the corner where I just felt like ‘another guest’.  

The Chesterfield is a home from home where you feel around friends.",5,2012,03,29
105,A Wonderful Experience,"My Husband & I stayed here in March 2012 , When we checked in we were made very welcome ,
The bedroom was a good size and very comfortable quiet and relaxing.  the staff are very friendly and the service is excellent.Breakfast was a real treat  and served by a very efficient girl. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and I would highly recommend the Chesterfield as one of the best to date .

105,Just booked another stay here!,"I continue to be impressed by the graciousness of the staff!  Our flight is getting in early and we would be happy to just leave our bags at the desk, but I was told that they would have our rooms ready for us.  Not only that, we need to make a side trip while in London and they will keep our luggage for us while we're gone.  The Butler restaurant is first rate, and we are San Francisco food snobs!  They also serve a wonderful tea -our waitress wrapped up the extra sandwiches and tucked in a few truffles for our daughter , who is living in London this year. Very thoughtful (wouldn't happen at the Ritz!). This is just a charming, perfectly located find, and very reasonable for such excellent quality.  I am looking forward to this next trip",5,2012,03,28
105,really lovely,the location is completely ideal and the service is truly above average.  friendly and helpful staff.  fantastic breakfast buffet!  rooms are small but comfortably cozy.  would go back in a flash,4,2012,03,27
105,Lovely Hotel with excellent service in a good location,"I had stayed here before when visiting the Van Gogh exhibition at the RA ( a nice stroll around a couple of corners)So when I heard about the David Hockney one,I had to book again.From the minute you arrive you are looked after by friendly helpful staff and my rooms have been very comfortable ,quiet and relaxing.
Breakfast was a treat with freshly squeezed juice and freshly cooked eggs.I do not stay in Hotels as often as I would like but the Chesterfield is the best in my book.",5,2012,03,23
105,What a great hotel!,"My husband and I traveled to London for our 10th anniversary. I spent many hours scanning the internet for a nice place and made and cancelled two other reservations before landing on the Chesterfield Mayfair. It is well located to the tube, which we took everywhere and to Oxford Street, Wigmore Hall for music, and wonderful restaurants. Chris, the concierge was incredibly helpful in our finding locations, booking restaurants and generally being a smiling presence. Everyone at the desk was friendly and warm. 
The bar area was a nice place to sit down and have a drink at the end of the day. The bartender gave my husband his new favorite cocktail - the Vesper. Breakfasts were excellent. 
I heartily recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair as a great place to stay in London.",5,2012,03,21
105,Give yourselves a treat,"When we wanted to go to the Hockney exhibition tickets were so difficult to get that a package offered by the Chesterfield was most attractive- - two red rosettes for food and tickets!We had a marvelous weekend visiting the Hockney and Freud exhibitions as well as a concert at the Wigmore Hall.The hotel has beautiful furnishings and a great dining area.It is the essence of eighteenth century style.Do not miss the Champagne afternoon tea,an experience to cherish.Also the concierge is the most knowledgeable in London.",5,2012,03,17
105,"Small, expensive, well located","I like staying in Mayfair, to me it seems to be central to London's best. 

My first, only stay at the Chesterfield was also my first in a more ""traditional"" hotel in London. Had high expectations from the reviews. Check in was easy, and despite it being early in the morning, I was shown to my room. It was a very pleasant king - bed room and though a little small it was fine for me as a solo traveller. Well serviced daily!!! The bathroom was very small, and perhaps a little oldish but quite clean and functional. Didn't get the expected personal touch, from other TA reviews, like ""good morning Mr so and so"" but most staff pleasant and helpful when approached. 

The bedroom was very plush with a feel of luxury, despite it bing a bit worn in spots. the bed was great - easy sleeping, and hardly any noise from the corridor. Free wifi very, very welcome. Breakfast was a real treat: friendly, efficient service, fresh cooked food and squeezed orange juice, good coffee. Dinner was good too, as was room service - much abused by self after long days of sightseeing. 

Can't fault the service or food, and not really the smallish room as it was still luxury, just compact luxury. 

I like the idea of small and luxurious, not overly so; this hotel is well worth considering if you want a temporary Mayfair address without hundreds of guests.",4,2012,03,13
105,Excellent,Excellent!  Loved staying at the Chesterfield and will be returning soon.,5,2012,03,12
105,Outstanding service and gorgeous food,"We stayed at the chesterfield for one night in March to have a girlie trip to the theatre. Got a good price on late rooms and booked a king size room and had the pre-theatre menu. Room a little small, menu very good value. What really stood out (I've stayed in many hotels) was the absolutely outstanding service. Warm efficient friendly. I couldn't fault this hotel and I would thoroughly recommend it!",5,2012,03,11
105,The Real Deal in London,"Having stayed at the MIlestone on previous trips, I was familiar with the level of customer service that the Red Carnation group provides- and I had high expectations.  We wanted to stay in Mayfair because of the location- a different neighborhood and a different perspective on the city.  We loved being in Mayfair- very centrally located for everything- shopping, theatres, museums.  We took advantage of their ""suite"" deal- three nights for the price of two, and had a very large room with king-sized bed, and a sitting room where they provided a roll-away for our daughter, which was perfect. The breakfast is amazing.
Cannot say enough about the staff- they really bend over backwards to make your stay enjoyable- everyone was fabulous and so helpful. Can't wait for our next  Red Carnation experience- if every hotel chain knew how to train their staff this way, the world would be a better place to visit!",5,2012,03,11
105,RA package for the Hockney exhibition,"The hotel is round the corner from the Royal Academy and the fast track ticket helped bypass the huge queues! I appreciated the welcome and warmth of all the employees I met.My room was comfortable and well appointed the location is just great, next time I will take advantage of the jogging map for Green Park and bring my running shoes!",4,2012,03,09
105,Charming!,"Styed here for 3 nights with 2  daughters. Junior suite offer: 3 nights for 2, was a really good choise as we wanted to stay in the same room chatting, having tea and all that. Good space, charming decor (sooo english and we loved it. A little bit tired here and there, -but only small details, -nothing big) lots of mirrors everywhere (hooray magnifying make up mirror in the bathroom!)and enough storage and shelf space in bathroom. Huge amounts of toiletries and make up need to be stored and that is always a problem. Not so here, great!
Lovely beds, lovely bath products, lovely towels&bathrobes. The tea tray was a treat as we winded down after a long day. Only 2 cups though, and asking for a 3rd didn't result in any. Not a problem though. Had it been a problem I would persist or get the cup myself.  Complimentary water in the room is fabulous.  Good & fresh breakfast with a lot of options for warm dishes.  -we felt at home and relaxed throughout the stay.  Charming street and close to ""everything"" sums it up as the perfect week end stay for us.",5,2012,03,05
105,The chesterfield a truly english experience.,"we stayed at the chesterfield for 3 nights from the 24th of feb this year and i must say it was truely a  relaxing, enjoyable stay. The staff are friendly and genuiene giving the hotel that extra nugget of traditional english charm which was a nice touch in a hotel located right in the heart of london making us  feel very at home and comfortable throughout the 3 nights we stayed. As we were on a romantic break the staff had just the right level of friendly chit chat and manner without being too overbearing which one might find in other hotels but not the chesterfield!
Its location is right in the centre of mayfair which was amazing as  you are about 15 mins walk from all the major tourist locations as well as a 5 minute walk from greenpark tube station which has acess to all the major underground stations in the area. The neighbouhood is really clean and safe and if you just want a romantic walkabout its quite the spot. Its many cafes and restaurants allow you to really get a feel for the area also.

The room was beautiful and quite clean and really created a relaxing romantic atmosphere and with each room in the hotel having its own theme it truely gave a unique feeling to the trip. as it was my partners birthday the hotel staff had placed a card and cake in the room on out arrival which was quite a nice touch. one can tell the staff are quite dedicated to making your stay as relaxing and memorable as possible. The bed itself was so comfortable and as the hotel is quite and realxing if you want a good nights sleep you are guarenteed to wake up feeling a million dollars.
The food is also out of this world with a wide variety of choice on offer and although we are currently experiencing a recession i believe in paying for good qualtiy and if thats what you are after the chesterfield is for you. The chesterfield is quite reasonable in its room rate for the quality of care and attention the staff give and in my honest opinion i will most certainly be back  even just for the bed alone!",5,2012,02,28
105,Exceeded expectations.,"I spend three nights in the Chesterfield when in London on business recently and I can't speak more highly of the place. I got a beautiful corner room with pleasent views of the Mayfield streets below. The breakfast was delicious, in particular the freshly made smoothie. I look forward to returning to this hotel again in the future.",5,2012,02,27
105,A perfect weekend stay,"We stayed at the Chesterfield overnight on 25th February.  Everything was delightful.  Our beautiful room was themed around music:  I had visited for tea ten days before, and somebody had noticed that I had a viola with me.  Meals were most enjoyable, very nice food and excellent service. Above all we are so impressed by the staff.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming, and you immediately feel completely at home.Everything is done to perfection, with no fuss.  We do hope to stay again in the future, feeling we have had a real holiday in the  course of a weekend.",5,2012,02,27
105,Our Mayfair garret,"We chose the Chesterfield for a Saturday night as they had a decent rate for B&B at £230 which also included two tickets for the David Hockney exhibition at the Royal Academy.  The Chesterfield has a great reputation on the TA site and it’s not hard to see why - the staff are some of the most pleasant we have encountered anywhere and the location is simply superb, on a quiet residential street in Mayfair and within easy walking distance of many tourist hot-spots and great restaurants.  They also park your car for £40 for the night, not bad for London.

The style of the hotel is highly traditional, which means it’s old-fashioned, with heavy leather sofas (Chesterfields), floral flocks and patterned carpets all screaming at each other.  We specifically asked for a non-Chintzy room and got a rather cramped rooftop garret which had three svelte suede walls, one wall completely mirrored and a rococo chandelier. It was striving to be exotic, erotic even, and for one night it was perfectly acceptable. The view from one window was of a brick wall about six feet away and from the other it was the same wall with a little bit of another building.  Hemmed in like this meant total quietude, amazing for London, so we slept like babies.  The room was well-equipped with a wall-mounted flatscreen TV, free internet and complimentary mineral water.  The bathroom let the side down a bit, mainly because of a small shower cubicle and poor water pressure.

Downstairs it’s a bit dark and gloomy, oppressive even, though I think maybe some tourists  look at this florid Edwardian style as quintessentially English; after all, isn’t life for everyone in the UK just one long Downton Abbey?  The hotel’s restaurant, Butler’s, is slightly brighter and they did a decent cooked breakfast with excellent bread and strong coffee.  There is a nice outlook on to handsome courtyard belonging to the next-door building; a pity the hotel can’t take it over for al fresco meals.

The Chesterfield is a pleasant three-star hotel which doesn’t pretend to be anything more.",4,2012,02,26
105,Afternoon tea,"Excellent tea, friendly and attentive service, lovely surroundings.  Would certainly recommend",5,2012,02,26
105,Quietly Unassuming...,"in the nicest possible way.  We stayed for my birthday, this was the second time we have visited and this time we took our Scottie dog with us who was made very welcome, with a little bed and bowls at the ready in the room. The room was a good size, the bathroom squeeky clean and nothing was too much trouble.  The staff welcoming and helpful, the food was excellent and we shall certainly be back the location is fabulous but quiet - this is definately  our ""de-stress"" hotel - absolutely charming.",5,2012,02,26
105,"Classy, a real treat","Chesterfield Mayfair lived up to its reputation - and more! 

We (my wife and I) stayed 2 nights 18/19th February. Room was a good size, clean, with good fittings etc. Bathroom was more than adequate for the two of us. The room was tidied twice daily, with a little extra care, and treats, demonstrated at all times. The hotel service was excellent with very attentive and helpful staff without being obtrusive. 

Brreakfast was as good as anywhere we have stayed and we dined at the hotel one night - food, andaccompanying wine list, was spot on!! And very good value... The bar was a delight with a live jazz pianist, classy and good to listen too. 

The location of the hotel is as good as it gets. Within walking distance of the shops around Bond Street / and  Oxford Street. We visited Selfridges / Fortnums etc. We also visited the Hockney Exhibition at the RA, tickets obtained by the hotel. Wow - a must and makes you proud to be a Northerner! 

Another must is Scotts Restaurant, again within walking distance of the hotel. Probably some of the best fish courses I have had, though it is expensive! Also on Mount Street is the Audley - 5 minutes from Scotts - a great pub / we spent Sunday afternoon in the Audley with a bottle of Pinot Gris, the Observer, and a buzzing atmosphere - justy what you want on your weekend break.

We also dined at Moro the day we travelled home - another highlty recommended restaurant, an easy Underground ride from the hotel. Moro is as good as the reviews - but we booked 3 months before we arrived in London! If you like the flavours of Spain and north Africa - you must give it a go

All in all a great weekend....",5,2012,02,21
105,Hidden Gem,"Nothing seemed too much trouble for the friendly, hard working staff at this lovely, truly British Style London Hotel. Our room overlooking the courtyard was well furnished, very clean and comfortable and had quality teas and coffees as well as top class toiletries.We took afternoon tea in the conservatory which was a delightful experience with a great tea menu. The array of cakes, scones and sandwiches looked lovely and tasted great. The attentive staff were on hand to replenish if desired. Our evening meals surpassed our expectations, delightful food in delightful surroundings served by smiling waiters. The scallops and the Dover Sole were superb. We have visited London on many occasions so why has it taken us so long to find what we consider a perfect haven which is convenient to all public transport and so easy to walk around London from yet so peaceful.We will certainly return",5,2012,02,21
105,Ideal for Londoners and Visitors Seeking British Charm,"Living in London, I go very regularly to this extremely charming British style hotel. The bar is great and Antoine the manager is so friendly it really allows you to relax after a day of work. The location is perfect, right in the centre of Mayfair. I have also tried the afternoon tea recently, and loved it, good food, nice champagne and delightful room, exactly what you expect for such an experience.
Every time my parents visit London, they stay at this hotel; they travel a lot and have tried many hotels, but this one is definitely their favorite in London!
The Chesterfield is an ideal combination of central location, authentic style and friendly service, you should try it!",5,2012,02,19
105,"Good old fashioned service, brilliant!","Only spent one night at The Chesterfield to coincide with the David Hockney exhibition which was just around the corner at the Royal Academy. The tickets were part of the deal with the Chesterfield and were well worth the money. The staff were very attentive, the room was great, we had dinner which was superb and the breakfast was amazing. It would be difficult and unfair to find fault when I believe that the hotel had tried its best to impress which it did admirably. Highly recommended and will be staying again when the occasion arises.",5,2012,02,13
105,Outstanding service,"From being met at the door and having the car taken away/parked and valeted, to leaving the next morning we could not find a single fault with the Chesterfield Mayfair. For sure the best hotel we've visited in London and one of the best we stayed in anywhere in the World. Such welcoming staff, and attention to detail that is normally missing in todays hotels. We really look forward to staying again and whole heartedly recommend the hotel with an A+.",5,2012,02,13
105,Excellent stay...would definitely recommend.,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair last weekend and I had a great stay.  On arrival we were allocated a room on the third floor directly adjacent to the air conditioning units; when I questioned the reception staff as to whether these were turned off at night as they were quite noisy they told me they ran 24 hours a day but they offered a free upgrade to a junior suite instead. Fantastic.  This level of customer service pretty much sums up the attitude of the staff; nothing was too much for them and they went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant, enjoyable stay.  I would definitely stay here again.  Many thanks :-)",5,2012,02,12
105,An excellent hotel which is trying to lose its edge,"A beautiful boutique hotel , very centrally located ;however, I felt the treatment is more of the big business hotels.

This is not to say that it is a bad one.But since I have been staying at similar hotels I was expecting a more personal sort of service or treatment.There are 2 small issues or incidents I would like to mention.

1: My wife's birthday was taking place during our stay.I informed the hotel upon my reservation and they promised to send some sort of gift.But we left a day earlier.Checking out on my wife's birthday.And they didn't send nothing.I had to remind them, and then they sent some cup cakes and a birthday card.Now this is a very small issue but may be we can move to the second one.

2 Upon checkout I forgot to take out thge passports from the safe deposit.Luckily we were still in London for two more days.They could have just called to remind me.I could have been on my way to the airport.",4,2012,02,11
105,Comfort in the ideal location,"Always our choice hotel and especially when the home Rugby Internationals are being played.
It was recently the perfect base for a family reunion with all the key sights easily within walking distance but with the Green Park underground station nearby and  a taxi service at the door if preferred.
The staff are very friendly,polite and helpful. The rooms adequately meet all the needs as one would expect at a hotel of this standing. Perhaps one of the most important features of The Chesterfield Hotel is the breakfast which really is second to none.
Our next stay is fast approaching when England v Ireland in the Six Nations Championship.",5,2012,02,10
105,Mayfair Weekend,"We have visited on many occasions and never have we been disappointed. The afternoon tea is totally delicious, breakfasts exceptional  and the Butlers Restaurant for dinner offers  a very varied menu reasonably priced considering the location and excellent food. The staff are very welcoming and friendly.
We are looking forward to our next visit in April.

105,My 60th birthday experience,"From the moment my friends and I arrived by taxi we were totally looked after by the staff of this wonderful hotel.  They could have done no more for us .... and we were only there for Afternoon Tea !  We used their facilities to change from our sightseeing gear into outfits more appropriate for such a beautifully decorated hotel - and after all it was a celebration for my 60th birthday (although the Chesterfield didn't know that) and they made it special with what I assume is their normal service and attention to guests.  From the gentleman that opened the door of our taxi and took our cases, to the reception and restaurant staff, it was an experience that my friends and I will treasure.",5,2012,02,06
105,Everything as it should be,"We have stayed here in the past, but this was our first visit for some years. We chose this hotel for a 2 night stay because it was very close to the venue for the event we were attending; it's not where we normally stay in Mayfair because it has no on-site parking (something which we usually need). However on this occasion we didn't have a car so no parking was no problem. Like all the Red Carnation hotels in London this one has excellent service. Our room (£288 per night for an ""executive king"" room only basis) was on the small side and the bathroom was rather cramped (no separate shower), but the bed was king size as promised and it was very comfortable. We had a late room service supper one night which was delivered very promptly and was well cooked and tasty. The extra servicing at turn down was appreciated with towels being changed twice a day if necessary. All in all this was a pleasant stay in a hotel which whilst old, is in no way shabby. I might have expected a the room to be a bit bigger and I think a separate walk-in shower would be usual in an ""executive"" room, but these are very minor points and essentially this is a good hotel with great beds and lovely service. I would recommend it.",5,2012,02,06
105,Perfectly Posh,"We stayed at The Chesterfield in Mayfair and I'll never stay anywhere else in London again. We shared a twin room and though small by American standards we had plenty of room that suited our needs at a very reasonable price. Each room is different with all tastefully appointed.The location is ideal with plenty of pubs, restaurants and place to get either a fancy dinner or quick bite nearby. The Green Park tube stop was a 5 minute walk and cabs were plentiful. It was a very safe place for women traveling alone. The staff was incredibly helpful and professional. Though on the pricey side the breakfast was good and their afternoon tea was delicious.  It was the first stay there for my friends and I but it won't be our last!",5,2012,01,31
105,Old School British,"A very convenient location with Shepards Bush right around the corner providing great restaurants and pubs. Hotel is 5 star, great facilities and a true London experience. Service is great too and the piano bar is welcoming after a long day of work or shopping.",5,2012,01,31
105,Excellent and charming,"We had a superb weekend at the Chesterfield. They go all out on giving you a fast and very proper service, and our king room was extremely comfortable too - all top notch linens and towels, and a comfy bed. A brilliant location for restaurants, bars etc, and only a 10-15 minute walk to Oxford Street. First time we'd ever seen the inside of a lift upholstered in tapestry, but at the Chesterfield it kind of worked! Would highly recommend.",5,2012,01,30
105,a gem of a hotel,"A gem of a small hotel.  Great service and attention to detail. Tastefully decorated rooms with fabulous linen.  Marvellous location.  Very buzzy ;piano  bar.   Suzy, 
Melbourne, Australia.",5,2012,01,29
105,Everything and more,"This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in with a quintessentially British feel to the place. It is perfectly suited to London and in particular Mayfair. 

The main thing I would like to praise this hotel on is the quality of the staff. I have never felt more welcome. Greeted by everyone with a real sense of interest not just a passing comment. Communication with them was also excellent with all emails answered within an hour or so. 

I stayed in a smaller room (220) which was very well fitted out and beautifully looked after. There was no view but I don't expect that from a London hotel as my plan is to sleep there not just gaze out of my window onto a busy road overlooking one of the sights I've seen that day. I cannot comment of breakfast as we tend to opt for a cafe breakfast nearby when we go away, but there are plenty of excellent cafes within five minutes walk from the front door. 

Nice touches included a wide variety of pillows and bedding to suit allergies, and a morning paper with weather report for the day stuck on. 

All in all a great stay and somewhere I would recommend to everyone.",5,2012,01,24
105,An excellent choice for our anniversary weekend,"My husband & I stayed at The Chesterfield 20-22 Jan for our anniversary weekend.  The hotel is in a great location as it takes minutes to walk to some excellent shops, bars and restaurants.  We dined in the restaurant, Butlers, on Saturday night and although it was quiet in there the food and service were excellent.  We were also lucky enough to enjoy afternoon tea in the hotel.  The staff were all well trained in giving great customer service in a genuine way.  Traditional decor in the public areas may put some people off the hotel but never judge anything by its appearance alone.  Highly recommended",5,2012,01,23
105,The British excellence,A very nice hotel with all you could imagine in a very old but smart British style. Highly recommend it!,5,2012,01,22
105,Very nice hotel,"It was my second time at The Chesterfield. The first visit being in 2002. On this occasion my friend and I had booked two single rooms (for the single traveller...) direct with the hotel. The two night, two single room stay (Fri and Sat nights) was booked via telephone after I encountered some problems with the website. Dates were read out and 2 x 2 single rooms plus Vat were paid for. An email confirmation arrived.

We booked The Chesterfield for two reasons....at the time of booking it was reasonably priced compared to the other hotels we've stayed at. Plus my previous stay was a good one.

The location is perfect for us, we love that area and its perfectly placed.

On arrival I produced the email confirmation......the first time I'd bothered to read it...partially because I'm stupid. It had two rooms for ONE night. I pointed out that if that was correct why was I charged for TWO nights and TWO rooms?!!

Whilst I feel it was unlikely to have been my error, hence why did they take payment for 2nts x 2 rooms, there is always two sides to a story and I should have checked the email as soon as it arrived, so i wont be laying too much blame on anyone. Moral to this tale and note to self is to always request a written confirmation and always check it.

However....to the credit of The Chesterfield and especially to the young lady on the desk at that time, she did correct the situation and was professional throughout. You know when you're expecting a debate when things go wrong....there wasn't one, it was dealt with without fuss.

Our rooms were very clean and obviously well cared for. Housekeeping do a grand job at this hotel. The decor was a little fussy for me, although to be fair, my female travelling partner thought it was wonderful and her room was even more detailed than mine. So if you like patterns and detailed old fashioned traditional English decor then you'll love this place. 

The bathroom in my room was ""as expected"" for a top hotel, nothing exceptionally unusual but nothing omitted either. One interesting point was a notice requesting the guest to be careful not to spill water as in the ceiling below contained a rare painting...or words to that effect. Knowing how careless some people can be I began wondering how long that painting would remain in it's current well preserved state!!!

The rooms we were both allocated were, from what i am aware, classed as single rooms. They were more spacious than some doubles I've stayed in! 

We only used the bar on one evening for a late night drink. Two champagne cocktails came to around £30. Even at Mayfair prices I thought that for what we had it was a little steep. The bar / restaurant area is very nice though and looks to be a perfect venue for a special meal or occasion.

In summary....
The bad...Check your confirmation prior to travelling, not sure how good the telephone booking people are. Drinks are on the pricey side. Fancy decor if its not to your tastes!

Good points. Well ran, well kept and well appointed hotel in a great location. 

Interestingly, whilst The Athenaeum remains my hotel of choice, my friend very much loved The Chesterfield and it has become her number one London hotel choice!",4,2012,01,22
105,"For an accurate description, read the bad reviews","When booking our hotel for London, we unfortunately believed all of the positive reviews about this hotel; however, our experience fits exactly with the other negative reviews it has received.  We encountered staff that was not only unfriendly and incompetent, but also alarmingly dishonest.  Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by surly front desk staff who gave us a room with only one bed, although we had reserved a room with 2 beds.  When we asked for this problem to be corrected, the front desk staff member told us it would cost an extra 30 pounds a night.  Fortunately, we were able to receive a refund for this amount after emailing the hotel our original reservation after we got home, but not a great start to our stay.  The room itself was closet sized, and my overall impression during our stay was of being on a ship.  Our dining experience wasn’t any better.  The dinner we had was lackluster at best, certainly not of the quality advertised by the hotel website.  The food served at breakfast was good, but the staff had difficulty keeping orders straight and the service was slow.  I have to say that despite the overwhelmingly unpleasant experience we had at the Chesterfield Mayfair, Chris, the concierge was very helpful and did brighten our stay.",1,2012,01,21
105,A great weekend away,"My fiance and I have just returned from our second trip to this gem of an hotel. We have stayed in quite a few 4 and 5* hotels in London and I can say for comfort, location, value for money and service, The Chesterfield is our favourite. Nothing is too much trouble for the attentive staff who do not look at you as a nuisance which I have experienced in some establishments. The Mayfair weekend deal is a great treat and a good pick me up for January. I'm still working off the Tea though! We will definately be back - thankyou to all the staff.",5,2012,01,17
105,"Perfect location, great staff, everything you want in a major city break hotel.","I have stayed here several times and always enjoy it with family or on business. It is simply welcoming without being in your face and the service is very very good. It feels safe and is in the best location for all you would wish for in a London hotel. Everything is fairly easy to get to by foot,tube or cab. Breakfast is superb and not rushed and the availability of everything you would wish for especially accommodating for children tastes is superb. The bar is great for a drink with the wife, with a group of friends , alone reading the paper or watching the football or simply enjoying work colleagues company after a use day. A great range of superb restaurants is nearby while some are pricey you pay for what you get, mostly ! I will look forward to my next visit which hopefully will be soon.",5,2012,01,16
105,Very comfortable in a great part of London,"My wife and I stayed here as the guests of another. It was most comfortable in every way. The room was great and we both slept extremely well. The location, in Mayfair, was ideal for our weekend. Would certainly stay again.",4,2012,01,13
105,Tired and Stale,"I am amazed at some reviews - as i feel this hotel was tired and a little bit faded. Staff nice and friendly - but a little too effusive, rather than proffessional, not sure i would stay again, unless as this time someone else booked it for me - and paid!",3,2012,01,11
105,Charming hotel and lovely staff!,"I have actually not slept at the hotel yet (although some of my friends did and loved it) but went there numerous times for drinks at the bar or for dinner. 
Location at the heart of Mayfair is ideal, interiors really charming (classic english) and the real plus comes from the impecable and always smilling staff.

If you are in the neighbourhood, I really recommend to pop-in for an afternoon tea or a relaxing drink at the bar listening to the piano. The professional and friendly bar staff led by Antoine will show you through a well done drinks menu. (Do not forget to ask for the nibbles, they are quite addictive)

Far away from the overstated / overcrowded places you can usually find in the area the Chesterfield is a hidden gem!",5,2012,01,04
105,great location and good value,Never thought I would say that about a London hotel! Friendly staff too.,5,2011,12,31
105,Loved this place! (but someone else was paying the bill),"Well, I have to confess that I wasn't paying the bill here--don't even know how much it cost, so I can't vouch for ""value"" which is subjective anyhow since it depends upon how much money you've got... but I can say that the room was beautiful, comfortable, and quiet; the bathroom... well, those Brits really know how to do a bathroom, with a big, deep tub and abundant hot water to soothe your body after a day of walking around London.  A good desk area and a fast wireless connection in the room as well as a printer available 24/7 on the lower level were all appreciated.  There's an excellent restaurant right in the hotel, though I confess that the waiter's explanation of the three different types of salt crystals and the mortar and pestle provided so that I could grind my desired mixture struck me as a bit much, even for a New Yorker.  All in all, very comfortable and convenient, with a friendly, helpful staff.  I'd definitely stay here again if someone else was picking up the tab.",5,2011,12,29
105,Excellent Hotel with Character,"My husband and I stayed one night between Christmas day and Boxing day. We arrived at 7 am and were given our standard double bedroom straight away. The bed room was very nicely decorated and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was not over heated (a draw back in many English hotels). However I noticed that there was a button for floor heating (which I didn't try) should you feel cold. An extra plus for tea making facilities and tripple plusses for the breakfast which, in addition to a fantastic buffet table with cheeses, deli cuts, breads, pastries, smoothies, juices incl. beetroot juice which was yummy, had a nice selection of cooked breakfasts - I had the toasted bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon. As it was Christmas Day, at the turn down of the bed service a christmas stocking filled with presents, fruit and chocolate was left on each pillow.
The staff were welcoming and very helpful. Overall a delightful experience and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2011,12,29
105,Amazing service level and location!,"I spent 8 nights in this hotel just before Christmas. It was looking for a typical ""british style"" hotel and I was not disappointed! The service was at the highest level and the atmosphere so nice! The restaurant, even if a little bit expensive, is at the very best level. The only ""negative"" points was that is some rooms, it is a bit noisy and that the rooms are not very large (what is common in London).",5,2011,12,23
105,Amazing hotel,"Husband wife 3 year old and a 7 month old, arrived to a very friendly welcome, even a present from Santa for our 3 year old.

105,Memorable stay,"Stayed here for my husbands birthday & were delighted to have been upgraded to an executive suite.
All the staff were very courteous & polite & friendly.
A nice touch was the birthday card & cake delivered to the room - my husband was really surprised. 
The bar was busy with locals & visitors - always a good sign
One criticism - we had breakfast in room & would have appreciated it if it had been laid out on dining table rather than left on a tray on coffee table!
Will definitely be returning to this lovely establishment.",5,2011,12,22
105,Excellent Full Service Boutique Hotel,"I was very excited about staying at this property after having been a guest at a different Red Carnation property.  I was NOT disappointed!  The other hotel was a 5* and this is rated a 4*.  The biggest difference I found was that the other property was much more intimate and homey; this was a much larger hotel.  As such, they also offered more services.

We stayed in the beautiful Duchess suite--I highly recommend.  My pics are poor quality, but I'll post them anyway.

Room was very nice--the room without the sitting room would have been luxurious!  With the sitting room, it was a special treat.  The bathroom was very nice, though the shower stall was cramped, and I am slim!  The bath was lovely, and I LOVED the Elemis bath products, particularly that they were given in large portions.  I also love a hotel that doesn't skimp on the towels!!!

Special treats--the canapes in the afternoon and the full breakfast in the AM (we opted for in room as we had the sitting room) were very nice.  I arranged to have a bottle of champagne sent up one night while we were out--this was painless as well.

Location was great--easy walking distance to the Royal Academy, Fortnum & Masons, Piccadilly, etc.  Unfortunately, we were there to visit friends who lived far enough away to be inconvenient.  If I return to London solely to tour, this would be a great landing pad, but to visit friends, I will try to stay closer next time.",4,2011,12,20
105,Absolutely amazing!!!!,"I stayed at the Chesterfield and it was amazing from the moment the butler opened the door for us, reception were so helpful and checked us in quickly with no hassle. Our room was unreal, with everything you might need for a night away, the bed was the best bed was the most comfortable bed! Room service was great. Breakfast was lovely, pancakes and maple syrup.We checked out at 12. It really felt like a home away from home. So cosy and relaxed.",5,2011,12,20
105,Typical overpriced Berkeley square,"Nice cosy hotel in busy London, cosy small room, but 270 euro a night is a bit high even for this area. Very central close to Hyde park, Oxford street,.. Don't expect anything modern just classical old london. Friendly staff except the breakfast staff who had to explain that there was no cooked breakfast that day. There are better places around for this rate.",3,2011,12,18
105,"Luxury room, super service",I was lucky enought to be upgraded to a newly refurbished suite. The room was huge and absolute luxury. Service from the moment I stepped through the door was excellent. This hotel is a gem.,5,2011,12,17
105,Attention to detail,"My friend and I stayed in your hotel for 3 nights and were overwhelmed by the excellent service ,right across the hotel spectrum ,from our early greeting by Jack Conroy Front Office manager to helpful tips from Philip on Concierge duties.Our room was very pleasing to the eye with extremely comfortable beds and the wonderful personal room touches ,like homemade cookies and an endless supply of fresh milk for our many cups of tea.
The service and breakfasts in the dining room were exemplary as was the welcome of the staff.
The exuberant greeting from Chris and the professionalism of your staff were second to none .
The decorations which were in evidence for Christmas were beautiful and truly 'got us in the holiday mood'.
Many Thanks for a memmorable sojourn in London .",5,2011,12,17
105,Superlative Service!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from November 29th-December 9th,2011.  From the moment that we set foot in the hotel, we experienced a level of courtesy and service that we have not experienced in years-and we travel frequently. Many thanks to concierge Chris Campbell and all the staff for making our stay memorable-we will be back next June!",5,2011,12,14
105,Amazing Hotel,My Boss booked this as it was close to the venue for our Christmas party. Staff were very polite and helpful. check in and check out was swift. Room was amazing especially the bathroom. Although I only stayed for one night this place was perfect for putting my head down after a night out with my company. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.,5,2011,12,14
105,Outstanding hotel,"I spent three short nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and could not have been more pleased. From start to finish, the stay was perfect. The hotel is indeed a more traditional, smaller property, situated perfectly in Mayfair. 
My room was predictably small--very typical for London. The furnishings were very nice, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Not much room for a suitcase, but that's a minor point. 
The Chesterfield excelled with the seemingly minor touches. Calls to housekeeping and room service were answered promptly, and the requested services arrived within minutes.
Apart from a single room service breakfast, I cannot comment on the dining room. The bar is quite traditional, and the service was very good.
Prices may seem shockingly high to Americans, but given the fact that the exchange rate is poor and that the Mayfair area is incredibly expensive, the Mayfair is an excellent value.
To top it off, the lobby area featured an enormous live tree, decorated to the hilt, as well as an ornate gingerbread house.
Without a doubt, this will be my hotel of choice for business travel.",5,2011,12,12
105,"Excellent location, good service","We had the chance to stay in this hotel during a weekend break my husband gave me for our anniversary...we loved every minute of our stay...the location is great, the service is good, the rooms clean and well furbished, albeit too small for our shopping bags but that is really a minor detail...its worth recommanding to anyone who wants a spot of luxury in a busy city!",5,2011,12,12
105,Lovely but not the best.,"Came here early November with a friend from abroad just for the high afternoon tea. Location is great and the hotel itself looks fine and original. You get the feel of that old London atmosphere in a classic British style. Very cosy too with warm and helpful services and greetings/smiles from the lobby staffs - making you very comfortable.

The high afternoon tea itself was not bad. We had the traditional ones. The cakes and sandwiches were of good quality although not the best in taste and were not special in variety - just basic range. The beverages were plenty in choice though.

Downsides: They should ask if we'd like more drinks or new ones after the first ones as we've been there for quite a while and should assumed our drinks were empty or cold by then. Although no fault with their service at all, that kind of gesture would make it even better. And they didn't have cheese scones which I think should make the range even better too.

The price is not bad for what you get and it doesn't worth more unless they improve in the cakes/sandwiches variety. Can't remember exactly, I think it was £25 or £27.

It's a good place to bring guests along, especially from abroad to experience a British high afternoon tea. It's a lovely, classic and cosy place but not luxury.",4,2011,12,08
105,Brilliant!,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield for her 30th birthday and had a wonderful time. We stayed for two nights and we thoroughly impressed from start to finish. The hotel is has a lovely charm about it and this is amplified by the staff. On checking in they picked up straight away that it was the wife’s birthday from the notes I placed on the on line booking form. Once settled they sent up a little birthday cake which was a really nice touch. We were well looked after I can honestly say that none of the staff looked bored to be there and gave us both a great service.

I found the hotel by looking on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. I don’t normally bother writing reviews but felt compeled by our experience. I would really recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a special get away.",5,2011,12,07
105,Great hotel in excellent location,"We were a party of four ladies from various parts of the globe who stayed at the hotel for three nights.  We all had very comfortable, well decorated and equipped individual double rooms - if there were any minor problems with facilities they were attended to very promptly.  The hotel it very traditional in its decor and seems to have had a general upgrade since the last time I stayed there.  It has a very intimate and welcoming feel and the standard of service and friendliness of the staff is truly outstanding. We had dinner in the restaurant on the first evening - which was our only disappointment of our stay.  We all ordered the roast of the day - turkey with the usual trimmings.  We had a very long wait for it to be served and when it was delivered to us the food lukewarm as though the plates had been waiting around for someone to serve them.  However, we had breakfast each morning of our stay and the food selection was very good and hot food cooked to order and excellent quality.  Overall a great hotel in a great location with outstanding staff.",5,2011,12,07
105,Thanksgiving dinner,"I searched high and low for a place that would serve a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner in London.  By the time my family decided to come over for the holiday, many other places had been booked, but we were able to get in here, and were so glad we did.  You can eat turkey or you could choose from some other options on the special menu.  Everything was delicious and service and ambiance were lovely.  Would highly recommend if you are an American in London looking for a place to have Thanksgiving.",5,2011,12,02
105,Ruby Wedding Weekend,"We stayed at this hotel for our Ruby Wedding Anniversary. Everything was perfect, we had made a good choice out of the many hotels which are on offer in London. Old world charm brought up to the 21st century. From the doorman, the receptionists, the waiters etc; all the people we came across had a smile and passed the time of day. The room although not large was very managble, with a King size bed which must have been Queen.Two massive pillows each, with an extra one if needed. Underfloor heating in the bathroom. Decent quality toilet paper,proper bar of soap,extra large soft bath and hand towels. A well stocked tea tray including a tea pot and coffee perculator with a good selection of teas and coffees including hot chocolate. The afternoon tea  with a glass of Tatinger champagne to start was tremendous. Don't miss the porridge at breakfast, it includes cream,brown sugar and whisky. All the staff made us feel at home and the building has a very warm atmosphere. Will return in the future.",5,2011,12,01
105,"Quality, quality, quality!","Because of an late-running engagement that was causing me to miss the last train home, I decided to book a hotel in London for one night.  Upon checking in, I immediately wished I were staying longer. From check-in to check-out, this was a first-rate experience. The service is superb, with friendly and professional staff who take the trouble to personalise their service, no matter how short your stay. 

I loved my room, which had wonderful touches like fresh fruit, free wifi, bottled water, magazines, a waterfall shower, and Elemis toiletries. It felt luxurious yet incredibly comfortable at the same time. All this in a great location. Breakfast was very good, with terrific porridge (brown sugar, cream, and whisky are delivered on the side). It was included in my room price, but for those booking room only, I would advise spending the money on lunch or dinner and getting a cheaper breakfast elsewhere at one of the many coffee places nearby. 

I really cannot fault anything, and hope to stay again soon.",5,2011,11,30
105,One night stand...;-),"It was only one night but very good! Christmas lights cheered up the facing and guests were warmly welcomed inside.

I will certainly come again!

105,Hotel review,"A small-medium sized hotel with wonderful features. A true boutique property. Quiet and comfortable room. Silent a/c. Helpful staff. The small things, such as bottled sparkling water and cookies. Wonderful English breakfast. Easy walk to the underground. Several pubs in the immediate neighborhood. No problem with getting a taxi at the hotel. Can't wait  to go back",5,2011,11,25
105,Charming hotel in an ideal location,"We booked this hotel because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor and we are happy to say that our stay was just as nice as the reviews said it would be. We had read that hotel rooms in London can be very small. We found our Classic Double room to be laid out very well with plenty of room for our luggage and clothing and laptop computer and books, etc. There was a built-in desk and shelf set-up on one wall that made it very easy to use the room comfortably.  The turn-down service was lovely. The towels were great. There was a plug-in tea kettle in one of the cabinets, along with biscuits and other items for tea. We were given fresh fruit one day. The bathroom was not large but it was also laid out efficiently and comfortably. The breakfast was delicious and one could order cooked items in addition to the generous buffet for no extra charge. The front desk staff was helpful with directions. The concierge booked restaurant reservations for us in advance of our stay. The staff was always cheerful and helpful. This hotel is in a great location--near many things yet tucked away on a quiet street. We can't wait to go back and stay here.",5,2011,11,25
105,Charm with Style,"Have just returned from the Chesterfield where we went with two friends for a ""special occasion"" weekend.  A lovely venue made more special by a cast of wonderful characters and staff.  From an eloquent welcome from Chris to a goodnight from the incorrigible Hanni, from friendly banter with James on the merits of the Irish whiskey (clearly superior!) to Scottish Whisky to lots of practical advice and help from Tony.. all were superb.  
In these times it is great to see staff who clearly enjoy their work and believe in the old fashioned values of customer service.  My only regret was that I did not discovery the Library until the last morning.  
Thanks all for making a special weekend really special.",5,2011,11,23
105,Look nowhere else in Central London,"This is the best hotel of its type in central London. Last week I stayed her with my wife, the evening being a delayed wedding anniversary treat. We were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful and the staff even personally signed an anniversary card!

I have stayed here on a number of occasions on business trips and always find it very comfortable and in an excellent location just off Berkeley Square. The rooms may be a little sombre for some tastes, but that is a personal thing - they are traditional English Country House in style. 

The beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms spotlessly clean, the breakfast is superb, but the best thing about this hotel are the staff. They all seem to be happy in their work and offer genuine warmth.

I will happily stay here again.",5,2011,11,21
105,you just have to go here,"i have had the pleasure of staying at the Chesterfield many times over the years,  and its remarkable how, even if the staff change, the results are always the same.   Just about perfect. The owners, red carnation, just dont seem to put a foot wrong.  service, comfort,  food, decor,efficiency, friendliness, attention to detail, are all first class.  The whole feel is very much like a private members club where everyone knows who you are and what you need, even if you dont know yourself!!

Location is on a quiet street just off Berkeley Square, loads of great restaurants and bars close by.  Business or pleasure...you wont get better than this.",5,2011,11,21
105,A place to enjoy,"On our arrival we had a very friendly greeting from all the staff, our room was clean, comfortable and well supplied. Room service readily available at all times. The menu is extensive and catered for most tastes. I have special dietry needs,they dealt with these with ease, nothing was too much trouble for them. Overall, a fantastic place where the staff bent over backwards to be pleasant and helpfull!!  Would love to return.",5,2011,11,17
105,Very enjoyable stay.,"I recently had a chance to stay here on business.  I was surprised at the smallness of the room compared to US hotels, and that the ""single"" room indeed had a single person bed (vs a queen or king).  However, the bed was very comfortable, the bedding luxurious, and the room more than adequate for my purposes.  The on-site restaurant prices are a bit steep for my tastes, but I did enjoy the Full English Breakfast each morning.  The wait staff was very attentive, the coffee hot and strong (better than any I've had at hotels in the States), and the meals come out hot, delicious, and in relatively short time.  The staff were all friendly and helpful.  I've never stayed at a bed and breakfast, but compared to some of the large, impersonal hotel chains, this one FELT more like I'd imagine a bed and breakfast (done on a larger scale) might be like.  I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.",5,2011,11,17
105,Just what I hoped for,"My Japanese clients and I had a very comfortable stay. Nice attention to details. The staff were 
truly what one would hope for. They were perfect. 
The hotel is of course in a great location. Decor great. Very clean and organized.
This is an elite hotel which keeps alive the regality of Great Britain.",5,2011,11,16
105,"Terrific service, comfort and amenities","We spent 5 nights from 1 November 2011. My second time at Chesterfield Mayfair. I really like the location, in a quiet location in a great part of London for walking. Just 4 minute walk to Green Park Tube.

At check-in, I got a complementary upgrade to a Junior Suite. A very nice touch. But even a suite is small by US standards, and there is not much room for suitcases and other bags. The staff was friendly, very accommodating of special requests. I liked that the room could be made up at any time, like during turn down service. Very comfy bed. Good lighting. Did not use the TV, as UK TV leaves a lot to be desired. I really liked having French press coffee in the room. Also, hotel umbrellas in the closet are convenient.

Breakfasts are very good. Excellent selections of buffet and cooked to order items. Brewed coffee could be improved.

I would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2011,11,16
105,"Everything that you need, no excessive faff","This is without doubt a luxury hotel catering to the discerning and located in the well off Mayfair. What I like about it is that it's not totally over the top: it has large, comfortable rooms (for a UK hotel), very good linens and bedding, is quiet, has great service, and all the convenience items I could have wanted.  I've stayed at others with more cutting edge interior decorating or more expensive bits and bobs, but those hotels always felt like they were overcompensating.  This hotel is just very solid.  I'll be back.",5,2011,11,09
105,Mixed Feelings,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for 3 nights and as other reviewers have noted, the service at this hotel is attentive and friendly. Case in point: I called to request hair conditioner and even though they don't stock it, they sent a staff member out to buy some. I was very impressed. My reservations about this hotel are the following: 
1) Location-wise, the hotel is situated in the heart of Mayfair. It was on a quiet side street so was hard to find my back to, especially at night.
2) The washrooms were not very functional. Instead of a shower curtain or full door, it shower had a partial glass pane. This meant water sprayed everywhere during a shower, even flooding the ground.
3) The decor is very old English. If you prefer modern and sleek, don't stay here.
4) I asked the concierge for an afternoon tea booking. He seemed a bit reluctant to call, saying they fill up weeks in advance. I asked that he try and while he was calling, I told him I had to zip up to my room to get something but would be right back. When I got back down, he was no where to be found and never followed up again on the booking. That was disappointing.

Overall, I found the hotel pleasant, but wouldn't stay again.",3,2011,11,07
105,"Great location, excellent staff","The location is great and the staff made us feel welcome and were very helpful.  Tony, the concierge, helped us plan our days and he was great.  The hotel is right near a tube stop and it made it so easy getting around.",5,2011,11,06
105,Comfortable London Base,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for a 3 night short break in London and from the moment we were greeted out of the taxi by the Concierge every member of staff we met was both friendly and attentive.

The location is a 5 minute walk from Green Park tube station and 10 mins from Bond Street. Similarly, the hotel is 10 minutes walk from Oxford Street and 15 mins from Regent Street - both for shopping, 10 minutes from Hyde Park and also 10 minutes from  Picadilly for the Royal Academy, Fortnam and Mason and the Wolesley.

We had the breakfast each morning which was a wide choice of a cold buffet (the marinaded fruits are superb) and a well cooked hot selection. We also had afternoon tea which was very good although we felt that somehow the occasion lacked atmosphere.",5,2011,11,06
105,Great Place!,"I like this hotel, the location is very nice. 

Breakfast is very good!",5,2011,11,04
105,a quiet stay,"lovely hotel offering good service.  
good situation
old style decoration but with a good british taste
staff very present always smiling",4,2011,10,31
105,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"Delicious selection of sandwiches and pastries, great and unusual selection of teas, impeccable and friendly service.  Very highly recommended.",5,2011,10,31
105,Wonderful Hotel to stay in London,"The Chesterfield is my home when I'm in London. The staff is very attentive and helpful. It is very close to all the major hot spots in London, but it is located on a very quiet street so one is not bother by any screaming drunks in the middle of the night. You'll see Rolls Royce's and other high end cars parked on the street near the hotel. The Green Park Tube station is only a few minutes walk away, as is Savile Row, Regent St and other fun places to visit. I travel alone alot and unlike other places where the single travler is looked down upon or ignored like a stray dog, the staff goes out of their way to make sure I'm well taken care of. I had dinner in the hotel resturant, and I was not seated off in some dark corner and forgotten like other places I've been to but, in a great table with wonderus service. Those who say that British cooking is right above heating up some cardboard has necer enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the Chesterfield. I savored a delicious lamb dinner with mint and a delightful red wine which i felt was better than many other high end resturants that I've eaten in. The rooms are very comfy and quiet. The only thing I found strange was the ""shower partion"" that is hinged and can let a lot of water on the floor. 
     For the American travelers (and others), bring your USB connectors to charge your phones, cameras etc and don't worry about wall plugs since the TVs have USB ports on the back and you can charge your toys while watching the telly. Overall I rate the Chesterfield first Class with great staff and recommend it very much.
John",5,2011,10,31
105,A Terrific Stay,"If you want an absolutely lovely hotel, with attentive staff, wonderful decor and comfortable amenities, the the Chesterfield Mayfair is the place.  Terrific for a weekend ion the city, centrally located, a 4 star all the way around!  Only wish they had a fitness center, but i really didn't have time anyway!!!",5,2011,10,28
105,Watch out for the VAT,"This hotel is perfectly adequate.  I have stayed here twice in recent times.  A little tired and could do with an update,  but charming in some ways.  My biggest problem is that when you book this hotel through the trip advisor selection non of the prices tell you that VAT is to be added.  At 20% that is a big amount, and it makes the hotel seem lower priced than it is.  I am sure that when you are selling to the general public you are supposed to advertise the prices including VAT  it is misleading.  I guess it is in the small print,  but on other hotels I have booked through the trip advisor system the price listed is what you pay including vat.",3,2011,10,28
105,English charm but leave your American standards at home,"The Chesterfield's location in Mayfair is excellent, just a few pretty blocks from the tube station. Love the street and the facade of the hotel. The lobby and restaurant are very old-style English but clean and lovely. The front desk staff are very helpful especially with restaurant suggestions but the hotel restaurant staff were slow and a bit clueless. Our rooms, although attractively decorated and clean, were very small.  There is barely any room to walk around in the room and one of the bathrooms had a shower so small that we just laughed. We paid the extra money for a ""double"" for one of the rooms but don't be fooled by that terminology of a double, in English standards it means a larger double bed, not two beds like you would find in America. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel but understand American standards are different.",4,2011,10,27
105,Highly recommend!,"I spent two nights at the Chesterfield for business and was highly impressed with the experience.  The service level was exemplary, my room was lovely, clean, comfortable and quiet (beautiful bed linens and towels as well), and the location was convenient and within easy walking distance of some great shopping.  The staff truly went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction, and the result was a genuine feeling of home away from home with plenty of British charm. I travel quite a bit for both business and pleasure and was truly pleased with this hotel. Thank you for such a wonderful visit - I will be back!",5,2011,10,26
105,Wonderful Stay at the Chesterfield,"We have just returned after spending 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We always stay at this hotel when we visit London. All the staff are very friendly & helpful nothing is to much trouble for them. There is an excellent choice at breakfast & the food is freshly cooked.
The hotel is in an excellent location for the shops & theatres. The rooms are kept to a high standard.
I would reccommend this hotel, we are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2011,10,26
105,"Lovely people, ugly rooms","I'll admit a negative bias toward hotels without immediate access to outdoor green space.
Give the ugliness of the rooms at The Chesterfield, escaping them became all the more important. The decor is  ""badly done English"" and very tired looking. That said the location is excellent for those interested in shopping and being reasonably close to Hyde Park
The staff is lovely, friendly, efficient and very service minded.
Wouldn't stay at this hotel again, prefer St. James.",3,2011,10,24
105,Wonderful!,"My husband and I recently spent 4 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair, celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary.  It was my 2nd stay at the Chesterfield, but my husbands first visit to England.  The staff were so accommodating, helpful and friendly, we were made to feel very special.  They even sent up the most delicious cupcakes to our room as an anniversary treat and when we checked out on the last day they had a lovely card for us which had been signed by the staff.  The rooms are kept to a high standard, and the turn down service with a treat on the pillows in the evening is really nice to come ""home"" to.  These are the little extra touches that you just don't find anywhere else.  I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair to anyone thinking of visiting London.  It is a beautiful, traditional hotel in a fantastic location, with staff that are second to none.  I work as a travel agent and am very discerning about my choice of hotel wherever my travels take me - and this hotel is absolutely at the top of the list.",5,2011,10,18
105,Nice Hotel and Service,"My wife and I stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed it.

It is nice to stay at a place where they truly want to make your stay enjoyable. The staff were all very courteous and helpful. We were most happy they did the little things without charging extra (e.g. WiFi). 

Recommend it. We will go back.",5,2011,10,17
105,A Mayfair favourite,"This was our second stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and it is becoming all the more apparent that this hotel has something which the other hotels we've tried in the area lack. The staff have an incredible way of making you feel truly welcome, and needless to say, service is friendly and flawless. We once again made use of the Mayfair Weekends deal, which is good value given the excellent breakfast and afternoon tea included. This time, we were upgraded to a lovely (recently refurbished) king room, which was beautifullly decorated and quite spacious. We will definitely come back.",5,2011,10,16
105,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,"I came here with my husband. We stayed here for 3 nights. It is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, by far. We arrived with 2 bags a piece. The bellman insisted that he take the bags up. About 20 minutes after being in the room, the front desk called and made sure everything was nice. 
We are from America, and I love ice in my water. Every night when we got in, we would call down to the front desk and ask for some and they would have it up in less than 2 minutes. I very much liked that they would turn down the bed every night and leave a treat on the pillow!
We got breakfast sent up to us one day. The meat was very good and the orange juice was by far the best I have ever had. 
I can't speak for the restaurant, we didn't eat there. The one thing I was not thrilled with was the price of the drinks at the bar, I got flavored rum and coke and it was £10. We did not pay for the hotel, as he was there on business, so I don't know how much it cost.
By far, it was a positive experience. Everything was wonderful!!",5,2011,10,10
105,cosy well priced hotel in ideal location,We stayed for 4 days on the well priced weekend deal which included breakfast and a wonderful afternoon tea.. We arrived  early morning  after a long flight from Australia and the hotel were very helpful looking after luggage while our room was prepared. The service was exceptional. They secured theatre tickets for us and helped on a number of occassions with advice for travel and sightseeing. The room was most comfortable with excellent bed and the bathroom was very clean and well stocked. the location was ideal set on a quiet street but walking distance to so  much of interest.  We would aways make The Chesterfield our first choice when visiting London and have already recommended it to several friends.,4,2011,10,10
105,Loved it!,"If you wanne stay in a typical English hotel this is definetely the way to go! Great service at the reception, got to pick our own floor and color of the room! 

The rooms are beautifully decorated, very English! Nice sheets,,everything is super super clean! The bathroom is just lovely! It's how I would want it (heated floors, nice touch)
We had the full on Englisk breakfest which was superb! Again the service was spot-on! Not overly friendly,,,just the right amount!

I would pick this hotel again in a heartbeat! It's definetely one of the best I've ever been too,,,especially the service!

Nice location, Not for away from all the nice shops!",5,2011,10,10
105,"Pricey, cramped charm","We booked a junior suite for London before returning home to the states.  We were shocked at the size of the room and I even double checked my reservation.  A deluxe double at the Hotel Eden, Rome or Kaiserin Elisabeth, Vienna is considerably larger.  There was no chest of drawers or armoire, so the bellman brought two suitcase stands and placed them against the wall making it barely passable at the foot of the bed.  Since the closet was tiny, you had to live out of your suitcase as there was no place to unpack.  For $1000/night, we expected a more comfortable accommodation.  The hotel is charming and the staff is very helpful, but the room was very cramped.",3,2011,10,06
105,"Gracious, charming find in ideal location!","We were just delighted to find this spotlessly clean, lovely hotel right near Hyde Park and Green Park, the Green Park Tube and, of course, all the fascinating architecture around Mayfair.  The staff could not have been more welcoming or gracious.  Our room had free Wi-Fi (so many European hotels charge a lot for this) as well as all the amenities one expects at a nicer hotel.  Reasonably priced for London -we will definitely stay here again!",5,2011,10,06
105,Wonderful start to our honeymoon!,"Wy wife and I spent 5 nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair to kick off our European honeymoon. We stayed in 14 hotels across Europe throughout our trip and the service delivered to us from the staff at The Chesterfield was right at the top. The staff were lovely to deal with and nothing was ever too much trouble; we even arrived to our room on the first day to two congratulations cards from all of the staff and management at the hotel, with a hand written note from each staff member. The location is perfect for those wanting to investigate London with many of the sites and sounds of the city within walking distance, whilst also providing a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding areas. We cannot speak highly enough of The Chesterfield and will be recommending the hotel to any of our friends that are London bound in the future.",5,2011,10,05
105,Brilliant place!,"I went to this hotel following TripAdvisor reviews..! I am so happy I did!
What an amazing place to stay! The area is beatiful and the hotel is stunning! 
For this price, I really doubt you will find any other place like this in that area...! 
Just go and see it by yourself!",5,2011,10,05
105,Chesterfield is brilliant!,"Stayed for 2 days at The Chesterfield Mayfair.
Excellent - service, staff, rooms, food

Held a one-day small seminar there. Again excellent service from all concerned

Will definitely be staying there again whenever I go to London",5,2011,10,04
105,Best kept secret in London,We stayed for 9 nights this September. The staff were so good to us. They had tickets to a play and soccer match set up before we arrived. They got us tickets on tours and were so helpful in answering any requests or questions. We will definitely stay there on our next trip to London which cannot be soon enough for us!!!!,5,2011,09,28
105,Our London home away from home,"We have enjoyed the Chesterfield on many visits to London. This stay was even better than the prior visits. The Chesterfield will always be our first choice.  Clean well appointed rooms, excellent restaurant and kind staff is the hallmark of the Chrsterfield",5,2011,09,25
105,The Perfect London Hotel,"We've stayed here twice (used to stay at the Stafford, but it has gotten too big recently). The location is fantastic, right near Shepherd's Market--lots of good restaurants--especially Da Corradi and Market Brasserie. The Chesterfield's rooms are nice, the service is perfect and the bar is a wonderful to start and finish your evening--perfect London bar staff.",5,2011,09,24
105,"Great location, good service, small rooms","I am used to small rooms in European hotels and that does not bother me.  But when the prices double over a couple a years, that is not acceptable.  I love the location of this hotel, the staff is very attentive, the bar is great, but I just can't justify staying here again when the rates are so high.  If you don't mind spending the $, this is a lovely property.",4,2011,09,23
105,Small but beautifully formed.,"For almost 20 years I travelled on business in Asia and the US and have stayed in many excellent hotels all free to me. I am used to Japanese standards of service, the best in the world, and I am usually very critical of those in the UK. For obvious reasons I almost never stay in hotels in London and can't quite get my head around the price. The New Otani in Osaka is one of my three or four favourite hotels in the world and is about half the cost of the Chesterfield. I guess it is supply and demand?

I was pleasantly surprised by the immaculate room and friendliness of the service, in my experience both rare in England. Our home is in a very quiet area and my wife and I often have problems sleeping in hotels which, almost invariably, are noisy but there was no problem at all in the Chesterfield.

Next time I will ask not to be upgraded to a king size bed as a smaller one would give more space in the room. It was a new experience to ask for sausage at the otherwise excellent breakfast and to be given precisely that, one sausage. Next time I will ask for two!

After we checked out as we walked past Claridges I was bitten by a dog owned by a homeless man. This rather blighted an otherwise delightful weekend but we could hardly blame the Chesterfield for that.",4,2011,09,22
105,Good value in the center of London,"The reviews pretty much say it all, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a very good hotel that is tucked away on a quiet street near St. James Park.  It's easy walking distance to parks, the Palace and even Victoria Station.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  My room was small, but it was nicely decorated, well appointed and clean.  The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet, which is something that is very important to me.  The breakfast buffet was excellent.  Overall, I had a very good stay and would certainly return to the Chesterfield Mayfair in the future.",4,2011,09,21
105,Home away from home,"Cool, serene and close to almost all the shopping districts of central London. The staff were very nice and ready to assist throughout my ten days stay. Will definitely go back again.",5,2011,09,19
105,The feeling of being home,"Staying at the Chersterfield Mayfair for the first time is truly getting the ""welcome to London"" I used to experience in the '50s but returning is like coming home. From the reception desk to the restaurant nothing is left to give that unique welcome. Even the pianist didn't forget to play ""As time goes by"" ! What more can you expect ?",5,2011,09,19
105,A lovely week in London,"Just returned home from 2 weeks in England, one of which was spent at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We had requested an early check in and were very pleased when the room was ready at noon when we arrived. The room was as described, good sized, extremely clean with a very comfortable bed, roomy bath with nice products. As breakfast was included in our rate, we took it two mornings in the room and 5 in the dinning room, the breakfast buffet was excellent. So much more than coffee, juice and toast. 

The staff was excellent, assisting as needed. Chris the concierge was extremely helpful with car rentals, theatre tickets, etc. While many reviewers said it was  a five minutes walk to the tube, i was concerned as i don't walk quickly but i am happy to report that the walk of about 6 blocks was very doable. The Green Park station allows access to 3 different tube lines. The hotel is located in Mayfair which is very safe and rather centrally located. All in all, i would highly recommend this hotel and hope I can return again soon.",5,2011,09,17
105,Afternoon Tea - a pleasant experience,"My sister and I had afternoon tea in the Conservatory at the Chesterfield on 13th September. The staff were very friendly andhelpful, showing us to our nicely laid out table. The conservatory is furnished in green and cream and well set out although it was smaller than I expected. There was one other couple  having tea when we arrived. The selection on the menu was very good and the waiter soon put us our Afternoon blend port of Tea. However we had to wait 20 minutes before our sandwiches arrived, which was rather disappointing as there was no-one else to serve. When it did arrive it was very nicely presented and a good selection of finger sandwiches, mini tarts and pastries and scones with clotted cream and jam. The smoked salmon sandwiches and the scones with cream were our favourite - the sones were very light and tasty. I found the cucumber sandwiches rather bland in taste and didn't finish it. Our waiter brought more tea and more sandwiches for us and we stayed for over an hour. The room did gradually fill up and about half a dozen tables were occupied by the time we left but the atmosphere was rather quiet and at one point there seemed to be more staff than customers. It would have been nice to have some piano or classical music playing in the background. The basic afternoon tea was reasonably priced at £25.50 a head, although a service charge was added to our bill.
On the whole it was enjoyable but I would not be rushing to return or recommend as a ""must do"" experience. I did prefer the Ritz Afternoon tea which seemed much more of an occasion when we went about three years ago.",5,2011,09,14
105,Exceptionally friendly staff and good restaurant.,"Wonderful hotel in Mayfair, 5 minutes' walk from tube station. Our room was very nice, with a warm decor and very comfortable bed. Wi-fi, mineral water and coffee were provided free of charge.From the very warm welcome on our arrival until we left, they were, without exception, friendly, attentive, helpful and efficient and we were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble - they certainly enhanced our stay. We truly enjoyed our first English afternoon tea experience. We would definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends.",5,2011,09,13
105,Exceptionally friendly staff!,"Wonderful, luxurious hotel in a superb location in Mayfair, 5 minutes' walk from Green Park tube station, convenient for Piccadilly, Hyde Park etc.  Our room was immaculate, 
well-appointed, with a warm decor and very comfortable bed:  wi-fi, mineral water, newspaper, tea & coffee were provided free of charge. We stayed for 3 nights and must say that we have never experienced such excellent service from hotel staff (and we travel extensively!).  From the very warm welcome on our arrival until we left, they were, without exception, friendly, attentive, helpful and efficient and we were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble - they certainly enhanced our stay. Would definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends.",5,2011,09,10
105,Wonderful English Afternoon Tea,This was my first English Afternoon Tea experience and we were thrilled to have it in Chesterfield Mayfair. The tea was served in The Observatory. The pastry was delicious and the service was outstanding. We truly enjoyed our first English afternoon tea experience. We will having tea again at Chesterfield when we visit London in November.,5,2011,09,08
105,Perfect place to stay in London,"Quaint boutique hotel in the middle of Mayfair.  Close walking distance to many areas.  Staff is friendly and quite helpful.  They went out of their way to help us with booking tours, planning our days, providing lots of ice :), and quickly tending to any of our needs.  Ask for rooms in the teens, they seemed to be a bit larger, especially 211.  Afternoon tea was quite lovely!  Would love to go back and visit again!",5,2011,09,07
105,"Reasonable London Price, Great Value","You can't beat the location: Right in the heart of London's Mayfair. The staff is friendly and helpful. The library room is a quiet place to have meetings with 3 or 4 people. 

Unlike many hotels, The Chesterfield offers complimentary wi-fi.

The hotel has Victorian charm and modern amenities.",5,2011,09,04
105,Wonderful Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 nights in August, 2011.  The hotel was everything that I expected - very clean, elegant decor and in a safe neighborhood.  Just a short walk to the Green Park tube and Buck Palace!  I loved our stay here, and would definitely recommend!  If I can ever return to fabulous London, I wouldn't stay any where else!
The breakfast was very pricey (almost 20 GBP per person), however there are many nearby cafe's that you can eat at much cheaper - try Kate's nearby!",5,2011,09,04
105,home from home,"Our third stay at The Chesterfield and once again we felt we had returned home to great service and lovely atmosphere. Lovely to walk through the park to the proms on a summer evening and having everything on the doorstep during the day. Thanks once again to all the staff, we will be back soon.",5,2011,09,02
105,Call your friends before they book their hotel in London!,"My  husband and I, along with some friends, just returned from a wonderful vacation in the UK. We started out in London and were fortunate enough to spend one of the nights at the  Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

The rooms were on the smaller side, as this is an older hotel but there were wonderful amenities in the bathroom and heated floors. There was also a bottle of water on my bedside so that I was able to take my meds at bedtime and again in the morning. So few hotels ever bother with such a simple thought!

We had food and drinks brought to us in the bar the night we checked in as we didn't want to go to the dining room. It was such a treat to sit in such a comfortable room. The Nuts and Berrries cocktail was made ok, but not as good as the server seemed to think it was. That was the only thing not perfect about the Chesterfield! The food was excellent! The dining room was lovely and we had a  full English breakfast the next morning. 

I do want to mention the staff. They are, by far, the most professional group of employees I have seen in a very long time.

If we return to London again, we will be staying in this hotel again. It was amazing!!!",5,2011,08,30
105,Tripadvisor Does it Again!,"Once again I checked Tripadvisor for a good hotel in a prime location with great service. They did not let me down. The Chesterfield Mayfair is one of those hotels. The staff was courteous and attentive to our needs. The consierge couldn't have been more helpful every morning he would lay out our days itinerary on a map. When we planned to leave for the airport at a certain time, they had a taxi waiting for us. The full English breakfast couldn't have been better including the staff.",5,2011,08,30
105,Great Hotel in the middle of Mayfair,"We've stayed at the Chestefield a couple of times this year and it's been great both times. Our dog is always made very welcome (which is very important to us) & she almost always finds friends to be made in the bar. Usually Americans visiting London, missing their pets, so adopting ours for a while. 

There's nothing really to fault about the hotel. Reception is efficient, the doorman attentive, housekeeping 1st rate, breakfasts arrive on time & are delcious. Berkeley Square is a two minute walk away & is great for people watching and just sitting with a cup of Pret or Eat tea and keeping an eye on the dog as she sniffs around.

Shepherds Market is also a two minute walk away (in the other direction) - It has very good restaurants (with outdoor seating for people with pets) including a great cheap Italian & Sofra, a Turkish restaurant which is always good/reliable.

Great hotel. Very fairly priced for the location.",5,2011,08,29
105,perfect,"Highly recommended. Rooms are great and fully equiped, Breakfest is rich and excellent, Service is very good. Location is very comfortable.
We will surely come back.",5,2011,08,27
105,Even our dog loved it!,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate our Silver Wedding anniversary.  The staff made us feel very special, and even our little dog was warmly welcomed.  Attention to detail and little touches make this a truly wonderful hotel indeed, and one that we will return to on future occasions.  Our Executive King room was beautifully furnished and had everything we could want.  The breakfast menu was extensive, delicious and cooked to order.  Everyone from the Reception staff to the doorman, the concierge and the restaurant staff were not just courteous and helpful, but genuinely warm and friendly.

If I could have given the Chesterfield Mayfair six stars, I would have!",5,2011,08,22
105,Well Located and Charming,"We had a great stay at the Chesterfield.  We picked it because of its location and because we got a favorable rate for our stay including breakfast.   The hotel far exceeded our expectations.  The room we got was quite large by London standards.  Breakfast was very good.  The hotel is on a quiet street in Mayfair that is easily walkable from the Green Park Tube Station.   The staff was friendly and helpful.   All in all, we had a very positive experience and would certainly recommend the hotel to other travelers.",5,2011,08,21
105,"Great location, Good value, high end service","London family trip with three teenagers. The Chesterfield Mayfair is in the best location--right by the park, quiet beautiful streets, close to Green Park tube. The price of the rooms, while not inexpensive, is a great value for the location and quality of the hotel.  It is a small hotel which makes it feel like coming home after a long day of sight seeing. Little touches like biscuits and bath salts each night are a wonderful surprise. Bathrooms are marble and very clean. Staff could not be more helpful. Breakfast is cheerful and elegant. This is a gem of a find and highly recommended.",5,2011,08,21
105,Birthday celebration,"Bought my son and his girlfriend a break in London to celebrate her birthday. They had the time of their lives and treated like royalty by the entire friendly and welcoming staff. As they are only 18 and 19 they could have been intimidated by the ""Posh Mayfair Hotel"" but nothing could be further from the truth and the staff put them at ease. The room was absolute 5 star quality and the restaurant breakfast served a great breakfast.
If you are looking for a 5 star London experience you may find hotels as good as the Chesterfield, but you wont find Better. Need I say more.",5,2011,08,19
105,Hotel delivered as promised!,Just came back from a four night stay with my family.  We loved the location and were able to walk to all the tourist spots. Hotel is very pretty and staff courteous and helpful.The full breakfast offered was fantastic and served in a lovely dinning room.  The rooms we had were small but nicely decorated. We felt it a good value for London and would stay here again.,4,2011,08,16
105,Brilliant,"We had the pleasure of enjoying an afternoon tea here, over the years we have had tea at some of the best places in London, this ranks amongst the best. The tea, pastries and sandwiches were of a high quality, but what really makes this venue stand out is the relaxed ambiance. We had our tea in the conservatory area, which was bright and airy, the service was excellent. Antonio our waiter served us with a smile and was happy to replenish teas , sandwiches or pastries. We would highly recommend this venue and will definitely return.",5,2011,08,16
105,Fulfilling Traditional & Chocolate Afternoon Tea!!,"Decided to give the Chesterfield Mayfair a try after filtering through countless competitive shortlisted choices for the best value for money afternoon tea in London.

We were seated at a table in the conservatory, however the size of it is definitely much smaller and less dramatic than the photos depicted on their official website. This place gets fully booked during the weekends, therefore make sure to book at least 2 weeks ahead and ask for a table in the conservatory.

We shared two Traditional Afternoon Tea and a Chocolate Lovers Afternoon Tea sets which were all nicely arranged and consolidated into a 3 tier rounded stand. Although it seems really preposterous to consolidate what would be an Afternoon Tea set for 3 people into ONE stand. You can't help but feel that the more people you have at a seating, you lose out on some of the food as they do try to consolidate everything into one stand. However it really does fill you up! Most of the other tables can't even finish what they've ordered within their seating and opted to pack the remains instead. 

The Chocolate Lovers Afternoon Tea set was definitely very unique as it was purely chocolate heaven, with chocolate eclairs, cupcakes, scones that comes with either a cup of hot chocolate/chocolate milkshake! A must try for chocolate addicts.

The whole experience was wonderful and I have nothing to complain about. From the calming atmosphere right down to the food and tea, it was money well spent. Therefore I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair.",4,2011,08,14
105,"not bad, not great","Stayed here as I was at a party nearby.  Good location but the rooms for their price miss a certain something.  Bland and homogonous.  Service was totally impersonal which i suppose could be expected for  a London hotel, but I´ve definately had better.  Won´t be back in too much of  a hurry.",3,2011,08,14
105,Great local and great staff in Mayfair,"This is our first time staying here in the summer months and despite the hoards of tourists in London, it didn't seem full. We really like the quiet charm of the public rooms. Standard bedrooms are well furnished if a little small, with some nice touches - complimentary bottled water & free WIFI.Towels were replaced in the early evening - ideal if you've showered before going out. Staff were helpful and attentive. We booked via a travel agent so got a good reduction on the rack rate.
There's a very good tapas restaurant a short walk away (El Pirata) which I really like. They have their own website so check it out.",5,2011,08,14
105,"good location, nice room","The single room that I stayed in was a nice size. Very comfortable bed and pillows. A good sized bathroom, clean and nice amenities. I heard one couple complain about the water pressure but my shower was fine. Service was friendly and fast. I did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment. I was there for only 1 night. I walked to Covent Garden to go to a play - it was about a half hour walk (I like to take it slow and occasionally take a peek in a shop along the way). 3 blocks to the Ritz Hotel, Fortnum & Masons, Burlington Arcade, etc.
Green Park tube station is 3 blocks away (one of the busier tube stations). 10 pounds for a cab from Paddington Station (including tip). Used the Express train from Heathrow 18 pounds and 15 minutes to Paddington (simple and fast). navigating a suitcase through Green Park station is do'able - but there are some stairs and it is busy.",4,2011,08,13
105,"Just perfect, we'll be back.","Perfect welcome; nice room; always friendly.  You don't have to ask for anything here, as the nice staff are always ahead of you. For instance, ""do you need a wi-fi key; do you need a taxi; can we hold your luggage, etc.""  We like it so much that we will be back, and will regard it as our London home.",5,2011,08,10
105,The perfect London retreat!,"Another fantastic weekend in this great hotel!
Just wish a loyalty scheme was introduced for loyal customers!",5,2011,08,08
105,Faultless,"Stayed here for just one night as part of a theatre package on the 6 August and I can't fault this hotel.  The staff were extremely polite, friendly and helpful.  We stayed in a twin room in 218 and the room had everything we need and more.  We particularly enjoyed having the bed turned down, curtains drawn, cushions removed from the bed, biscuit on the pillow and bottle of water and glass left by the bed, whilst we were out at the theatre.

The location of the hotel is great, within walking distance of Green Park tube and Piccadilly with all its major attractions.  As the hotel is off Berkley Square, it's quiet at night.  There was traffic passing by the hotel but it didn't disturb our sleep.

Breakfast was very good and excellent quality with everything from meats, cheeses, yoghurts, cereals, full english plus eggs benedict, fish etc.  The only negative I can find to say was the service was a little slow at breakfast as they seemed low on staff but otherwise a fantastic stay which we really enjoyed.",5,2011,08,07
105,Like visiting a favourite relation,"I have been visiting every year for the past 12 years and never once have I found any cause for complaint. It's a truly wonderful place ,location,food and service are outstanding. It feels like visiting your favourite relation, you receive such a welcome.

105,"Quaait classy, and central","This Mayfair hotel exudes old style London.  The doorman wears the traditional top hat and tails.  The lobby is very highbrow, but inviting.  The rooms are small but all remodeled and very traditional.  The location is superb for walking, just off Piccadilly  but on a quiet back street, very safe at night.

I choose this hotel for every stay in London.  I can find no faults to even list.",5,2011,08,06
105,"Nice boutique hotel, but didn't see the value","I stayed here for business for 2 weeks and the best part was the breakfast I had in their ground floor restaurant, Butler's. It's really quite civilized!

The rooms are tiny, the bathroom fixtures are old (or quaint, I realize some people like that) but it loses it's charm when it takes 5 minutes to fiddle with the hot & cold to get a good shower/bath temperature. 

There is no gym in the building, and they have a relationship with Fitness First, but none of the staff has ever been, so the first time I went to find it, I was sent on a labryinth search around the block, looking for a service entrance in a back alley. Not ideal.

In sum, while it's a great location, for 265 pounds/night, you can find better hotels for better rates.",3,2011,08,05
105,Excellent,Great value for the price. The service was very good and the rooms were great,5,2011,08,04
105,Great hotel.Would recommend it.,"Hotel was great & location was very central.The staff were excellent.We had dinner in the restaurant on the Friday evening & the food & service was faultless.
After noon tea is delicious.
Will have no hesitation visiting this hotel again.Would highly recommend it.

105,Better than home away from home...,"From the moment you are greeted by name and welcomed through the front doors you feel like a special guest at a wealthy friend's manor house. Thoughtful touches warm every inch of this classic hotel. This is not a nameless, faceless, chain hotel experience, this is something special. From beautiful linens, fluffy towels and robes, quality toiletries and free wireless, to the very attentive customer service; charming and carefully considered ""hospitality"" is evidently a priority for the Red Carnation contingent. Chris the concierge is a legend, I would stay here just to talk to him!",5,2011,07,29
105,Perfectly located for a London business trip,"Wonderful little hotel in the center of Mayfair. Easy walk to everything you need: tube, Hyde/Green Park, Buckingham Palace, Parliament, etc. Room was small but not painfully so. Expensive, but this isn't exactly the neighborhood for modestly priced hotels. Staff were as attentive as I'd hoped and were able to help whenever I required it. The bar had a great selection of scotch (again - expensive) and a friendly bartender on the several nights I visited.",4,2011,07,29
105,Cosy,"The Chesterfield is a cosy hotel, if a little old fashioned.  I had a room quite high up 'in the eves' which was very cosy indeed - but perfectly spacious enough, I had a full breakfast via room service which was excellent.",4,2011,07,29
105,We loved it!,"My family of 2 adults and 2 children recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in a suite, perfect for families with children. There is a small entry/lobby to the suite, leading to a door for each bedroom. The parents have their own large bedroom, with marble tiled ensuite, underfloor heating, bath, shower and toilet. The children have their own bedroom with 2 single children's beds, large flat screen TV and Wii. Bottled still and sparkling water is included free, as is WiFi.  Luxurious bed linens and towels, large cupboards for storage and 2 good umbrellas were also part of the appeal. Cooked to order breakfasts are also included, the food is ok. The hotel is in a very quiet residential street in Mayfair, but just a 3 min walk to Green Park tube, 5 min walk to Buckingham Palace, 8 min to Oxford St shops.",4,2011,07,28
105,mini room,"We stayed here on our way for a 2 week trip with lots of luggage. There was no dresser in the room, no desk and no room to open a suitcase. We called to the front desk and they said they would store our luggage or we could pay $300 more per night for a larger room . We were told that London has small rooms and get used to it.  We frequently travel to NY and I do know about small rooms in big cities, but this was ridiculous. We could not store luggage as there was no place to put anything. We had other folks arrive later who were put in suites at our same rate.",2,2011,07,27
105,Nice hotel in good location,"We found the Chesterfield as nice as most other reviewers do and will probaly be back.
The location is excellent. Close to everything, but still very quiet. The staff is generally very well trained and is very service minded. Atmosphere is old fashioned, very British.
But we have to mention a couple of things we did not like. The junior suite did not have a proper chair or a comfortable sofa, and is clearly over-priced (even by London standards). The breakfast is crowded and you may have to wait. On top of that, the quality of the food is only average and the service not very friendly",4,2011,07,25
105,another fantastic stay,Our 5th visit and again it does not dissapoint. We had a lovely bright twin room with lots of light and loads of home comforts. The staff are just wonderful and a request for a slip mat made in the lift to the housekeeper was forfilled imediatly. I bring my mother every year and she just adores this hotel. Afternoon tea was part of the package and was a real bonus which was taken just before we left the hotel for our return journey. Thankyou to all at the chesterefield for making our holiday so special.,5,2011,07,25
105,"Absolutely lovely, we will be back","Charming boutique hotel on quiet, lovely, side street in the Mayfair area.  The staff is incredible and make you feel as if it is truly their pleasure to help you.  Walking distance to Hyde Park, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, New Bond Street shopping and the Green Tube Underground.

Although room size is small by American standards, they are typical of European hotels.  The Chesterfield, in addition to having refreshing, up to date rooms with excellent bathrooms with a fantastic rainshower, they also offer complimentary WIFI access, have lovely china teapot, cups, coffee press, and kettle with a selection of teas, hot chocolate, and coffee in the room.  Each day the room was refreshed with complimentary biscuits and water bottles.  The local newspaper was also delivered every morning, complimentary.  

The hotels restaurant, The Butler, was surprisingly enjoyable and the food very good offering a wide selection of dishes for dinner.

The bar, while charming in decor, was our only disappointment.  We were foolish enough to order a casual dinner there one evening as we were exhausted from our day and not up to going out.  The food was horrible,  The club sandwich was mostly bread and all was ridiculously over priced. As a side for 3 pounds we were served 6 onion rings, seriously. The appetizer platter for 4 was 18 pounds and was very scant in regards to quantity and quality. The waitress was inefficient and condescending.",5,2011,07,25
105,Enjoyed our stay - Fantastic location and staff,"We stayed three nights at this lovely, quite, great location hotel.  At the beginning of our trip we stayed 2 nights and at the end of the trip a third night.  It was like coming home on the third night.  We were welcomed by name and the staff were never more than a few feet away to help us with taxi, directions or bags. Right from the moment of booking the hotel on line until the day we left they are forever helpful. The third night we were upgraded to a suite which was amazing!  We would highly recommend this hotel",5,2011,07,23
105,Fantastic Service and Wonderful Hotel for Families!,We stayed here for our 10 day trip to London.  The staff was very helpful and treated our children very well.  Staff was exceptionally helpful with everything from things to do to how to get around.  We loved the breakfast every morning and the rooms were wonderful.  It was centrally located in London and everything was close or a short tube ride away.  We will be staying here again on our return trip to London!  Loved it!,5,2011,07,20
105,Lovely Hotel,We stayed at the Chestefield hotel in Mayfair for 2 nights in July. The rooms and hotel were wonderful and the staff very friendly. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a central london hotel as it is close to all the popular spots in London.,5,2011,07,19
105,A Civilised Afternoon Tea,"We checked in for afternoon tea and can highly recommend it. Excellent sandwiches on various breads, delicious pastries, cakes and scones with clotted cream. The selection of teas is endless and the service was exemplary. A pianist plays gently in the corner and it is an oasis of calm and serenity amongst the hustle and bustle of London.",4,2011,07,18
105,Very nice hotel,"This is a very nice hotel and part of the Red Carnation group. We have stayed at the Ruben which is also part of this hotel group and this has a nicer suite but the Ruben has a better location. The only problem was that we had some issues with the repair in the room (shower door, toilet). They did fix it but we thought that it should not have been an issue in a suite. The suite had two bathrooms which was very nice and something we were not aware of when we booked since we brought our adult daughter with us and it made it very easy to get ready each morning. Also, they pick you up and take you to the airport in their own car which is another nice feature. I would stay in this hotel again.",4,2011,07,10
105,Perfect stay,myself and my fiancé  had a wonderful two nights.  We were upgrade to the jungle suite with complimentary champagne.  The room was very large and luxurious.  Service from all members of staff was of an extremely high standard. The breakfast was delicious and location wonderful would highly recommend this hotel.  This was our second visit and shall visit again and again,5,2011,07,08
105,Our first choice whenever visiting London,"My wife and I returned to the Chesterfield Mayfair for the third time, this time with our younger son.  As before, the staff made us feel very much at home and more like familiar guests than just like customers.  The staff engineer, Tony, was able to make a repair to the wheels on my wife's luggage that otherwise would have put a damper on our further trip to the continent.  Unlike our previous visits, the hotel was full this time and this did show in our rooms not being available early, as we had asked.  The Mayfair neighborhood is mostly residential and quiet but in five minutes you are in Green Park with all the crowds and excitement one could ask for.  We will be back.",5,2011,07,06
105,Lovely Stay!,"We only had a brief 2 night stay but we absolutely adored this lovely property and the surrounding neighboorhood!  Everything from the fabulous location, intimate lounge, beautiful rooms and brilliant staff!  We will always seek out the Chesterfield Mayfair on our visits to London!  The hotel is remarkably well priced for a property as nicely located and well kept as this one. We also enjoyed the great pub right down the street...it was such a local gathering spot full of character and high energy! Can't wait to return!",5,2011,07,05
105,I want to keep this a secret but it would be unfair,"Simply amazing. When we got in to the lobby we were greeted with smiles and immediately felt welcomed. The decor was amazing and due to my previous experience the night before I can honestly say this hotel saved our weekend.

Naturally the free upgrade was a pleasant surprise but in reality the staff, the bar, the restaurant  and conservatory pulled off a cosy yet luxurious feeling.

The breakfast is a little overpriced though was well executed. The menu prices for a place such as this were not outrageous at all and in some cases the set menu is excellent value though we did not take advantage of this.

The location is amazing. There are a number of cute parks around the area that are hidden away. Have a look here to see the parks http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hyde+Park,+Westminster,+London+W1,+United+Kingdom&hl=en&ll=51.511968,-0.147661&spn=0.007385,0.01413&sll=50.907525,-1.403267&sspn=0.014965,0.02826&gl=uk&geocode=FQUGEgMdV4n9_w&t=h&z=17

I would come again and again and again! Thank you so much!",5,2011,07,04
105,Absolutely lovely. No complaints at all!,"This was our first time at the Chesterfield but certainly won’t be our last!

Conveniently tucked away on a quiet street in Mayfair, just a couple of minutes walk from Green Park tube (Piccadilly line direct to Heathrow). It is also very central for sightseeing (Buckingham Palace is just across Green Park), Bond Street is close for shopping and Leicester Square etc is ‘walkable’ after a night at the theater. Shepherds Market is one block away and is a great place for breakfast alfresco if you chose not to eat in the hotel.

The staff were discrete, helpful and very pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble.
I loved receiving the phone call within 5 mins of us checking in to ensure everything was OK with the room. The one minor repair which was needed was dealt with swiftly.
The room was well furnished with fabric covered walls. It resembled an old sailing ship (or maybe that was my imagination). Either the room has recently been refurbished or is well cared for as everything was pristine. 
The monogrammed crisp white duvet covers, pillow cases, towels and bath robes were a nice change from the bedspreads etc one finds at large chains. 
The under floor bathroom heating and fresh red carnation (their signature flower) were a nice touch.

We faced onto a side street so it was quiet but I get the impression the rooms directly overlooking Charles street were not noisy as it is a quiet street. Some rooms faced a rear courtyard/mews so if you are concerned about potential nose, request one of those.

Our only regret is that we didn’t eat in the restaurant. Usually we avoid hotel restaurants but after making reservations elsewhere we were very impressed with the menu and, upon looking inside, it was very busy.
Maybe next time!",5,2011,07,04
105,Cozy,the hotel was nice enough. the room slightly small and no view! the lobby small but a nice bar . clean and practical. and very good location. overall : nice!,4,2011,07,03
105,I will return.,"I thought the service was very good, personnel who we had contact with were very cordial and helpful.  We had no problem with questions and service was very good.  
Room was nicely groomed and cared for, neat and tidy and clean. Bathrooms cleaned daily and arranged with clean towels and tub area. (Decor was nice, being early English.)
Not to familiar with London proper, but we had no problem with getting from hotel to points we wanted to see or visit.  This was in part of the hotel personnel who helped with questions and directions where we wanted to go.
What I liked best was the persons who worked the hotel who took their job to task and made our visit very nice and comfortable, I would come back to your establishment without hesitation and would recommend your hotel to others with approval.",5,2011,07,02
105,A wonderful stay in Mayfair,"I was recommended the Chesterfield Hotel by a friend.   

We stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair for just one night for our anniversary.   Everything was just perfect.  The hotel is a superb choice for a weekend in London being very central, and at the same time, located in a quiet corner of Mayfair.  

All of the staff we encountered during our stay were amazing and could not do enough for us.

The hotel maintains a historic and elegant charm when so many hotels are turning into bland clones.

The Chesterfield will be our first choice of hotel for when we stay in London again.",5,2011,06,29
105,Mayfair's hidden gem,"My wife and I stay in London about once every six months and have previously visited Claridges and the May Fair hotel among.  However, our recent stay at the The Chesterfield has topped all of them.  A comfortably styled hotel that you can readily relax in aligned with fantastic customer service and nice, surprising little touches. The staff were uniformly exceptional.",5,2011,06,29
105,"Loved the Chesterfield, once again!","I stayed at the Chesterfield for 8 nights earlier this month. I can't say enough about what a wonderful experience I had across the board on so many fronts  This is the second time I stayed at the Chesterfield.  Both times were awesome.  From booking my reservation, arrival, housekeeping until departure. I arrived early, and they had me checked in within the hour. The room was pristine clean and very comfortable.  The mattress comfy.  The room perfect size for one person.  I booked a single. The barhroom very clean.  The towels so fresh and fluffy!  Not sure what they are made of, but I loved them.  As well, the room was comfortable temperature-wise and it was quiet!  I felt safe staying at the Chesterfield.  I liked how one of the entrance doors was closed off to outside traffic in the later eveing. Being a single woman, this meant a lot to me.  There is much more that stood out, but for time sake these are a few of the highlights.  Thanks to the Chesterfield for another great stay!  I appreciate your professionalism and attention to so many details.",5,2011,06,28
105,Great hotel - highly recommended,"The hotel is in an excellent location and the room we stayed in was sumptuous and elegant. The service of all the staff was attentive but unobtrusive. The doorman was particularly helpful. 

The breakfast was delicious with the eggs benedict highly recommended.",5,2011,06,26
105,Customer Service Could Be Better; Rooms Very Small,"We just returned from a 6 night stay at this hotel.  First, I wanted to point out that customer service was not very good.  The staff at the front desk did not smile at all and acted as if they were doing me a favor when I asked about something.  Especially Sabine.  Also, I booked the afternoon tea at the front desk for Saturday afternoon only for them to call me the night before to let me know that they were fully booked.  They didn't know that when I was booking it.  I changed it to Sunday afternoon.  We rushed back from our sightseeing excursion on Sunday to make it on time and when I arrived, they told me they couldn't seat us because they were fully booked! I could not believe it! 
On the day of arrival, I asked the reception to change our breakfast from the last day to the day of arrival because we were leaving very early our last day and when we were checking out, the first breakfast was charged to our account!  (We had breakfast included). When I asked about it at the reception, they had no idea! 
Although I reserved a king size bed room, the room and bathroom was very small.  My husband and I are not big by any means and we could not be both in the bathroom at the same time.  When walking in the room, we always had to give way to each other because there is not enough room between the bed and table. 
Breakfast was very tasty and a large selection, although when I ordered the pancakes, they were clearly made in advance because the edges were dry as if they had just warmed them up. 
Overall, I will look for a different hotel next time we go to London.",3,2011,06,24
105,Exemplary service and the Best of British,"Very traditional, beautiful, very English townhouse hotel tucked away in the heart of Mayfair. Fantastic location for getting around- a few minutes walk from Picadilly, Park Lane, Bond St etc- close to Green Park Tube. Service was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble and the food in the restaurant was of an extremely high standard and served with flair. One of the best hotels we've stayed in, both in London and elsewhere.
We will be back.",5,2011,06,23
105,Can't wait to return!,"We recently spent a weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair and absolutely loved it!  The location was fabulous, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the room was immaculate.  Some may say the bar and dining room could use an update, and maybe that's true, but I felt  that added charm to this quaint, quite hotel.",5,2011,06,22
105,Best kept secret in Mayfair!,"The Chesterfield is a jewel of a hotel conveniently located on Charles Street in Mayfair.  Staffed by a warm and congenial group of people and beautifully appointed public space and rooms, I recommend it highly whether for a business or pleeasure stay!",5,2011,06,17
105,"""veddy""  British","Very good place to be...location, service, accommodations and price. Admittedly, however, the BIG upgrade we got (to a spectacular small suite) because our reserved room was not ready (at 6 p.m.?) has a lot to do with the feel good about this place.That said, service is top notch...welcoming, caring and professional. Breakfast is well done. Nice bar. Ideal location and reasonable...for London...prices. Would stay again. Concierge service was extraordinarily helpful. Well done, jolly good!",5,2011,06,17
105,Special...in a different way and so many things to like,"I travelled to London with my three teenage kids. The Chesterfield Mayfair was not my first choice, I really wanted to stay at a Firmdale hotel or other hotel with stylish interior decoration (for example, the Hotel Keppler in Paris) but it was too expensive since I needed two rooms. The Chesterfield Mayfair was one of the few available hotels that offered a family package, two rooms (not connecting, though) with breakfast.

The best part about the Chesterfield Mayfair is the feeling you get while you're there and long after you leave. It is not just that it is a  good value but there is a sense of generosity with this hotel. There was no inkling of stinginess or snootiness. The breakfast was generous and they brought it to our room immediately. There were no hidden extra charges or the feeling that we would have some suprise on our bill when we checked out. The front desk was really friendly and accomodating. I think they told me the hotel is run by a family from South Africa. I left feeling like the hotel owners and the hotel staff cared.  

Likes:
-Safe, quiet and good location - within easy walking distance to Green Park tube station, Ritz Hotel, Fortum & Mason, Buckingham Palace, Horse Guards, shopping on Oxford Street
-Special family package with two rooms and breakfast
-Very clean
-Newly refurnished rooms
-Pretty fabrics
-Nice linens and feather pillows
-Comfortable mattress
-Pleasant view from room
-Marble bathroom
-Excellent and abundant room service breakfast
-Friendly and helpful front desk
-Quiet
-In-room temperature control

Liked less:
-Website is not appealing (I think I looked at every hotel before I explored the Chesterfield  because their website has an outdated look)
-Lobby is a little frumpy and messy
-Could be immaculate if housekeeping would clean the doors to the rooms and freshen the air around the elevators 
-Small rooms",5,2011,06,13
105,Food you want to eat,"We eat in butlers restaurant and the food was second to none, let down a little by service but the food made up for that. 
Next time I'm in London I already know where I'm going for dinner. 
Butlers.....",5,2011,06,12
105,Afternoon Tea,"I didn't stay at the Hotel but came for Afternoon Tea and Champagne for my Mum's 50th birthday. This is the first one of these I have been to so I cannot compare with The Ritz or Claridges. The Hotel is so decadent and the staff were lovely, really attentive, they sang Happy Birthday and brought an extra special cake for the birthday girl. 

My Mum and Aunties had the Tea option with a glass of Champagne, Sandwiches, Scones and Cakes while my cousin and I opted for the Chocolate Lovers tea with the Champagne and Sandwiches but Hot Chocolate, chocolate scones and cakes! The cakes had little flags in to celebrate the royal Wedding weekend - another sweet touch. On the way out there were some pick and mix sweets to take away and very posh loos too with actual towels to dry your hands.",4,2011,06,11
105,Fabulous Hotel,"The staff at this hotel are some of the friendliest my husband and I have encountered. The room was spotless, the food in Butlers Restaurant was lovely, basically everything about this hotel was first class, we will definitely be back next time we visit London.",5,2011,06,08
105,Absolutely a great place to stay!,"My wife amd I recently stayed at the Chesterfield Maufair for two nights.  Staff was excellent, concierge team was superb, room was a little small but very comfortable otherwise.    Excellent English breakfast. Great location in Mayfair.

We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair two years ago for four nights and were equally pleased.",5,2011,06,07
105,"For the price, almost perfect!","For the relatively reasonable room rates, everything about this hotel is exactly as I would have hoped—with one considerable exception. As a ""techie"", wifi access is for me a necessity in the magnitude of oxygen and water, and that was the one somewhat weak area. During ""peak times"", I would find that my response times and bandwidth was extremely horrid. At first I thought that maybe it was just the signal in the room I was given, but when I connected to the in-room wired network jack, I still had the same problems, leading me to the conclusion that the hotel does not lease nearly enough bandwidth to match the average peak-time demand of their guests.

Again, though, this is the single complaint that I can muster. Everything else about this hotel is perfect: the location, the cleanliness, the amenities, etc.

The location is in the beautiful, central neighborhood of Mayfair, just a 5 minute walk or so from the Green Park station, and walking distance to many central locations (10 minutes to Picadilly Circus, 10 minutes to Buckingham Palace, etc.).

The cleanliness of the hotel is outstanding. Our room was serviced twice daily (turn-down service in the afternoon), and was kept spotless. They clearly maintain the quality of the hotel, from the bathroom fixtures to the televisions. The beds, sheets, and blankets were incredibly comfortable, and the size of the room itself was even better than I expected for central London.

The hotel also offers many other amenities, from a beautiful, relaxing, lush library to complimentary teas and biscuits for your room, to complimentary umbrellas to borrow for when it's raining, and so on.

In short, I would probably stay there again, even despite the wifi issues; after all, with the other great aspects of the hotel, they deserve another shot and, who knows, maybe they'll upgrade their bandwidth by the time I visit next!

Overall four and a half stars out of five for me, and a definite recommendation to everyone (especially those who aren't as hung up on wifi as I am)!",5,2011,06,02
105,A classy place at a reasonable price,"This is the third time I have stayed at the Chesterfield.  For the money, it is a great value. Located in Mayfair, close to everything in Central London and 5 minutes from the Green Park tube station.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  Restaurant is well appointed and serves fine fare. And the bar is just grand. And free WIFI throughout",5,2011,05,31
105,Felt like we were staying with friends,"My husband stays here every year on business, but this year, I accompanied him.  We stayed for 6 nights in May. This is a beautiful small hotel with impeccable service.  They could not possibly have been nicer.  The decor is lovely, with so many little elegant small touches, such as exquisite flower arrangements.  I am very fussy about cleanliness and The Chesterfield passes with flying colors!  Although the rooms are small (typical of London), the space is maximized by professional interior design.  Full English Breakfasts in the restaurant were finer than we had in other comparable (and even more expensive hotels).  My only caveat here is that the front desk twice told us an incorrect time for breakfast and I missed it twice and had to eat in the bar.  The hotel, however, acknowledged their error and reimbursed me. The location in Mayfair is  quiet (for London) and convenient to trains and many lovely places to dine within walking distance (go to Shepard's Market area). Upon departure, my husband thought he lost his watch (which he eventually found in his luggage), but the doorman could not have been more helpful or concerned had it been his own watch.  We look forward to our return to The Chesterfield next year! Many thanks to all of the staff  and managers who were so cheerfully helpful to us during our week stay!!!",5,2011,05,28
105,Individual hotel in Mayfair,"Stayed here for a night either side of a trip on the Orient Express.  Booked through LateRooms so got a good deal on room and breakfast rates.First room was quite small , second was much larger and had a bath, but both v comfortable and not like 'chain' hotels. Ate in hotel restaurant, not particularly good value for money, and I object to optional 12.5% service charges. Reception rooms very plush, staff attentive, enjoyed listening to piano player in the bar. V good breakfasts. Would stay again.",4,2011,05,28
105,A unique hotel with fantastic service and comfort,"An impulse weekend trip to London to see a theatre play with my aunt, turned out to be a fantastic memorable event thanks to the unique Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel! The location is perfect and the staff is beyond expectation positive and attentive. We booked an offer called ""Mayfair Weekend""  package directly from the hotel website wich I strongly recommend. The Afternoon tea and full English breakfast is included at the same price as the reasonally priced rooms, so is a bottle of nice champagne, late checkout, newspaper and free internet. The rooms and bathrooms are great, so is the restaurant. The staff made us feel welcome from the first moment, the atmosphere of the place is friendly, professional and cheerful at the same time. Lovely details revealed themselves during the stay. Top quality and well worth the price! My search for a decent hotel in London is over- I will prefer this hotel at any chance!",5,2011,05,28
105,Highly Recommend,"The hotel room had been recently renovated, it was one of the most tastefully decorated hotel rooms  I have seen recently.  The  staff was warm, friendly and helpful.  The location is in one of the best parts of London. The food in the restaurant and room service was great!  I would return myself and recommend to others.",5,2011,05,19
105,Amazing experience at The Chesterfield...,"After scouring trip advisor for a London hotel with flair and originality, we decided to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair overnight on 7/5/2011 to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We were not disappointed. The hotel is right in the heart of Green Park, less than 5 minutes walk from the nearest tube station but down a side road, meaning that you still get a quietness rare in London. Upon arriving at the hotel, the friendly door man opened the door and let us in, where we were quickly greeted by reception. The lady on reception (unfortunately I did not take her name) checked us in and informed us that the hotel had awarded us a complimentary upgrade. At this point we were hot and bothered and said a quick thanks, and went off to find our room (I really hope we did not appear ungrateful at this point, and did venture back downstairs to reception later on to thank the staff again.) 

Upon searching for our room, we discovered the enormity of what an upgrade means at the Chesterfield Mayfair. For a piece of background information, I had been studying all the rooms at the Chesterfield Mayfair, trying to decide which room we could afford to book, and also the fantasy “if money were no object” room to book. The room we booked was the superior king, but for me, my fantasy room had to be the African suite. Loving all things African/safari style, loving the décor and visiting a zoo at every given opportunity it just seemed perfect for me. We couldn’t find our room at first; searching the hallways we discovered a side hallway off the main and ventured in. I sneaked a sly glance at the plaque on the wall and my heart skipped a beat when I saw the African suite listed, though I didn’t dare guess that that would be our upgrade… what would be the chance of that?

Well it seems the Chesterfield Mayfair are psychic in some way, as as you have probably guessed, we had the suite of my dreams! I literally spent the next ten minutes running around the room, saying oh my gosh oh my gosh over and over and over again. It is beautiful, themed to the max but in such a tasteful way. The room itself is large, with a seating area with very comfy chairs and a leather sofa with cushions, a table full of magazines to browse through, walk in wardrobe, TV, and the most amazing king size bed ever! The curtains and headboard was my favourite feature of the room, and the small touches, such as the hand painted bin and stationary box on the vanity table. I couldn’t stop looking at the paintings of animals around the room, and the bathroom was amazing, with a rainfall shower AND Jacuzzi bath, large sink area, clean WC and another TV. After a while we tore ourselves away from our room to go to the theatre and to dinner, only to discover a card through the door on our return, stating that the staff had tried to drop by with complimentary canapés, ice and lemon, and should we still want it, all we needed to do was call reception. It was the small touches like this, the mints on our pillows and the framed message from management that really made our stay special and personal. 

 All in all the hotel was wonderful and most definitely made our anniversary perfect. The staff are in equal parts welcoming and professional, breakfast was lovely and the décor of this hotel is something else. For anyone seeking excellent service with personal touches and amazing style this is definitely the hotel to book.",5,2011,05,16
105,Perfect Hideaway in London,"I travel often for business and regularly stay at four star hotels, so it goes without saying that it takes quite a bit to impress me.  I was beyond impressed with my recent stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  I was familiar with the hotel, but had never stayed there previously.  I booked the Mayfair Weekends package which offered a tremendous value - full English breakfast each day, afternoon tea for two and a late checkout to make the most of the time in London!  My grandmother had just arrived from the US and we checked into the hotel at about 9:30am - I was expecting to just leave our bags and come back later, but to my surprise, our room was available and my grandmother was able to freshed up from her flight, which made the rest of our day so much more enjoyable.  Breakfast each morning was lovely; afternoon tea was a treat; and every staff member we came into contact with was friendly and welcoming.  Everything about our stay exceeded my expectations and the hotel has a perfect central London location.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,05,09
105,"Great Service, Great Location, Great food, Small rooms","Having arrived here directly from the George V in Paris, we were not disappointed by the quality of service...great recommendations, help with several requests, etc...  Location is as good as it gets.  The rooms are nice, but small (not atypical for London)...also, no connecting rooms, in case that's important.  Pleasantly surprised by the restaurant/breakfast room nice environment and good food.  All in all, very good experience.",4,2011,05,08
105,GOOD HOTEL,"Very nice holet
But a little boring,clean rooms, good location",3,2011,05,08
105,Fabulous Stay in Mayfair!,"I was travelling with my spouse who tagged along to sightsee while I was in London on business. Absolutely beautiful hotel in a perfect location. Walking distance to everything, including a Tube stop (Green Park). Ridiculously clean - one of the only hotels I've stayed in where the hallways smelled lovely (almost flowery)! Rooms were much bigger than I'd expect for a London hotel and spotless. I've stayed in several different hotels in London on business and pleasure and I'd highly recommend staying here! Would definitely come back.",5,2011,04,29
105,Amazing hotel and staff made my 30th perfect.,"I never normally write reviews but I felt that I just had to for the wonderful Chesterfield Mayfair.  My husband and I stayed here to celebrate my 30th birthday and everything was just perfect from beginning to end!  We had booked a standard room as we have just had a baby so were on quite a tight budget.  We were however absolutely delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite.  And what a suite it was!  The Garden Room was stunning, by far the best room we have stayed in for a long while (even better than the suite we had in Dubai for our honeymoon).  It was, however, the little touches that really made our stay.  The card and cake from all the staff, the quality elemis toiletries, the helpful and friendly staff, the amazing breakfast (trust me, it was amazing - I am very, very fussy!) ...  On top of all this, upon my request, the hotel arranged a personal wine tasting session.  This was a very enjoyable experience that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed - the hotels sommelier, Antoine, really is a credit to them!  All of  this in a fabulous neighbourhood - what more could anyone want??  Thank you Chesterfield Mayfair, we will most definitely be returning!!",5,2011,04,27
105,Good price great service and room.,We stayed here for a second time after our last stay was so nice. Even though most of their staff had change since our last visit they were still very welcoming and didn't look down on us when we walked in in shorts and t shirts (like we have had at other hotels of similar standard.) we had a normal room this time because last time we stayed in the executive suite and we felt it was wasted as we didn't spend enough time in the room to make the most of it. It was just as nice only a third of the size and only one tv. Everything about this hotel is great. I would recommend it to anyone.,5,2011,04,23
105,They won me over from the moment I arrived!,"I had business in Ipswich and decided to take a couple days in London for myself to unwind before coming home.  I chose this hotel based on the reviews and location.  It is very close to Green Park tube station.  It is in a beautiful neighborhood in Mayfair and great walking distance to everything I think.
When my taxi pulled up,  the door man jumped to my aid and took me to the front desk where check in was very quick.  Since I was traveling solo I booked a single room which was on the small side but since it was just me I was fine.  The room itself was very nicely appointed with great amenities.  It was clean, comfortable and quiet.  Windows are double paned.  The food is a little pricey at the hotel so I ate out which is fine because there are lots of options one block away on Curzon Street.  Try Tempo Italian.  It is excellent!  The hotel bar is very nice and the staff are very entertaining!  They will chat you up and give you good recommendations for sites and dining etc.  I really wish I could have stayed on an extra day.  I know I will stay here again when I come back to London.",4,2011,04,20
105,Welcome...Welcome home!,"Where to start...Where to start...
Well, let me start with the location; You are staying in mayfair, a very quiet place, but only 2 minutes away from the action; Piccadilly! 
I thought the location was a bit to ""posh"" for me, but not in a scary way. 
Although the street is very quiet, it is easy to find a taxi if you need one.

When the doorman greets you when you get out of the taxi, you immediately know that your visit will be great; THESE DOORMEN ACTUALLY SMILE! They also remember who you are, ask how your day was and they wear their uniform with pride! 
And that last one goes for the rest of the staff as well! 
The staff is amazing and makes you feel welcome and that is what it is all about!
The staff is professional, but human; Not pre-programmed robots in a uniform.

I was sleeping in room 417, a room for single travelers. 
The room was small, but big enough for a single traveler!
What I liked most about the room was the fact that what you see is what you get; The pictures of the rooms on the website of the hotel are spot on! There is a picture of another room (double) which had the exact same pillows, wallpaper, mirror, TV, bedside lamp, etc... as my room had...Even the clock on the wall was exactly the same! usually you book an hotel based on the pictures on the website and when you arrive...you realize your room doesn't even look like the one on the picture..
The bathroom was spacious and it had all you could wish for! 
But what made it special where the little things; In the top drawer I could find a scissor, post it notes, pencils, a stapler, etc... a very nice touch for someone who is there for business! 
The room had it's own door bell, a little red light to replace the 'Don't disturb sign on the door"", complimentary Wifi... 
It is very clear that this room was designed to make your visit as pleasant as possible!
the color scheme in the room was very good and also the way they used light to create that luxurious feeling was amazing!
Even the wardrobe had a light in it which switched on when you opened the doors of the wardrobe. And to prove how quiet the location is; My room had a view on Charles Street...No noise of traffic at all!

The bed was great; Usually I do not sleep very well the first nights in an hotel room...In this bed I was asleep even before my head hit the pillow!

If I had to point out one thing that I would improve it would be the room service.
Don't get me wrong; The room service is amazing! On saturday I had only 40 minutes time to eat and they managed to serve my dinner with only 12 minutes between the order and knocking on my door! 
But there were two minor things I found a bit strange; I ordered a diet coke with my food and they brought me a glass with ice and lemon, a 33cl bottle of diet coke and...a corkscrew...Yup, a corkscrew...So I had to open the bottle with a spoon :-)
It is just a little mistake which you just have to forgive them, but it was a bit strange.
Second thing; a sandwich or burger is served in the Chesterfield hotel with a little jar ketchup and a little jar of mustard. I asked if I could have some mayonnaise with my sandwich and they brought me two little jars of ketchup and one with mustard...No big deal, just a little thing I wanted to point out. The food of the room service is amazing, so it made up for those two minor things.

The overall experience was great! Really great!",5,2011,04,18
105,Wonderfull hotel,"I´ve been in this Hotel for 4 nights in March, and found everything perfect, The service, the room, cleanliness, location, etc. I'm brazilian, and travelled in my vacations. The staff was very gentle an helpfull. I hardly recomend, and when I come to London again, I'll stay there for sure.",5,2011,04,17
105,is this the perfect hotel in London?,"We have just returned from staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and believe we may have eventually  found that perfect hotel for us for visiting London. We are always looking for the one we can make home during our many trips to London but something always makes us feel we can do better. Red Carnation hotels are always our first choice and we love the Rubens but it can be noisy with the sound of traffic. The Chesterfield is a smaller, slightly more classy version of The Rubens but best of all it is quiet. We had a room at the back and could hear nothing,  the best nights sleep ever experienced in London. We missed the lovely lounge of The Rubens where we loved to have an ice cream and coffee after the theatre or dinner or to just sit quietly in the afternoon reading with a tray of tea. The small library at The Chesterfield looks a little formal to eat ice cream in!  The bar at The Chesterfield is however much nicer. For people reading the previous reviews dont worry about the size of the rooms. We had a standard room and it was fine, very typical of rooms in English hotels and it was beautifully equipped with comfy beds and wonderful pillows and linen. We did not eat dinner but the breakfasts are wonderful and worth spending  time over, make sure you are hungry and give it the time it deserves, a lot of thought goes into the range and quality of food. (Try the porridge with whisky and brown sugar) The location could not be better and there are many small and inexpensive restaurants close to the hotel. The standard of personal service is of course what makes Red Carnation hotels extra special and for that we say thank you to everyone for making our few days special. We will be back and may never need to look at other hotels in London again.",5,2011,04,16
105,What a nice Londonhotel,"We had three wonderful days at Chesterfield, asuper small hotel in lovely Mayfair. 
Great room with lots of space for business and pleasure, and perhaps the best serviceminded personell we haver ever met in UK.
From the doorman to our friendly waiter Christian- just enjoy.

The dinner at the hotel is the only disappointment, too pricy and not near the quality on offer close by. 
Breakfast is super, and dont forget to have tea in wintergarden.
We will be back - because we loved this hotel.",4,2011,04,07
105,"Great service, Terrible Housekeeping","I travelled to London last summer and stayed at the Hotel 41. I was so delighted with the experience that this time around we decided to stay in another Red Carnation hotel. Like the Hotel 41, the Chesterfield had impeccable service, however the bathroom was filthy. When I first entered the bathroom on day one, it looked like there were stains on the grout that perhaps housekeeping was having difficulty with. I don't normally snoop around hotel bathrooms because I'm terrified at what I may find, however on the 4th night of my stay I dropped a cotton swab directly behind the faucet on the sink. What I found was a disgusting pile of hair as though men have been shaving their faces and dropping the hair behind. My husband shaves in the shower, so I  know it wasn't him. That prompted me to grab a washcloth and rub the grout- needless to those stains came off. There was a small area between the toilet and the shower. When I looked there it was filled hair and orange algae. I immediately called housekeeping. They put me in touch with a manager who immediately wanted to correct the situation. He apologized profusely and even gave us a complementary night! He then sent housekeeping to clean the bathroom. I wish I could say the bathroom was then cleaned, but although housekeeping did go to my room, the bathroom was nearly identical to how I originally found it. I did not want to complain again, so I dealt with it. Although I appreciate the manager's efforts, I would have liked a clean bathroom more than a complementary night. I will be posting picture of the bathroom AFTER housekeeping came as soon as I can get my camera to cooperate with my computer.",3,2011,04,06
105,Excellent Hotel - Fabulous customer service!,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a real gem and we thorougly enjoyed our stay at the hotel

Every member of staff we encountered were absolutely lovely - Christophe in the bar and Laura at Reception were especially fantastic.

We felt like the Chesterfield really embraced customer service and ensured each guest felt special -  little touches enhanced our stay, including turn down service & bath salts left on bed side. (There was even a 'stationery' drawer for those people staying on business!)

The food we ordered for room service arrived promptly and the food not only tasted delicious, but was hot! Perfect!!

Our only slight 'issues' were during a shower the water went cold and the 'faulty' card reading machine at checkout caused some problems, but as soon as the hotel were informed, they acted quickly to rectify the situation and kept me informed.

Well done Chesterfield Mayfair - you rank #1!",5,2011,04,06
105,Excellent Value,"Just one more rave review to add to the pile.  Excellent value, friendly staff, great location.  Trying hard to think of a nit to pick, but difficult to find, unless one wants a full-blown hotel with gym, pool, discotheque. If one wants just a beautifully appointed hotel with great staff at a good price, look no further.",5,2011,03,23
105,"The best hotel in London, hands down.","After visiting the hotel several times we decided it was the only place we wanted to get married in and have our reception.

The day was fantastic and all the staff helped create my dream day and every last detail was spot on, the food at the reception was amazing and everyone is still raving about it. We had a small wedding with 36 guests and had the reception in the conservatory it was romantic and intimate just as we wanted.

All of our guests loved their stay, the rooms and everyone commented on how good and helpful the service was from all members of staff.

Anyone looking to get married in london should give the Chesterfield a look.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone, they will not be dissapointed and will walk away feeling well looked after and spoiled.",5,2011,03,18
105,City Hotel with friendly service,"Have stayed at this hotel twice but with a gap of several years in between. Unfortunately we don't have opportunity to visit London as often as we might like. On both occasions we have found this hotel to be excellent in every way. Unlike most big city hotels the Chesterfireld has friendly, personal service without being too pushy. We just love staying there.",5,2011,03,18
105,This fabulous hotel in a great section of London is our favorite!,"We stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair whenever we travel to London (as long as there is a vacancy).  It is a charming and elegant ""Old-English"" style hotel where we receive wonderful service.  The staff is friendly and more than helpful in every way possible.  The dining room provides a fabulous menu and impeccable service.  And the rooms, while small according to US standards, are very attractive, cozy, and comfortable.",5,2011,03,15
105,What a Gem in a great location,"I spent quite a while looking for a nice hotel in London.  I stay in London quite a lot on business and end up in characterless large chain hotels, with poor service, and no personal touches.   Happened across the Chesterfield, read the reviews and tried.  Went for the 'Mayfair Weekend' - and would recommend anyone do likewise - fantastic value.  The staff were great, friendly, attentive and showed a genuine interest in us - which is rare.  Breakfast was lovely - tried both restaurant and room service - both spot on.  Bar and conservatory which we used for afternoon tea was so calm - nice.  Bedroom not exactly huge, but the bed was, and the linens were fantastic.  Bathroom squeaky clean.  You can probably tell was impressed by this place - thumbs up for sure.",5,2011,03,15
105,Wow what a gem !,"Wonderful hotel in great location. Amazing staff who can not do enough for you. They really go the extra mile. Wonderful room.  Amazing food.
What more you could you want !",5,2011,03,15
105,Luxury hotel with a great resturant and service for all our needs.,Wonderful hotel in a great area.  The staff are very helpfull and knowledgable in every way.,5,2011,03,13
105,"Quiet, relaxing and wonderful staff","We stayed last weekend (705).
Our 2nd visit! 
One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.
Lovely staff! Amazing breakfasts!
Be back soon!",5,2011,03,12
105,"Lovely hotel, incredible staff, great location.","My business travels take me to London very frequently and I’ve stayed at many different hotels.  Now I only stay at the Chesterfield.  I like the atmosphere of the hotel, small and warm, rather than the impersonal feeling I get when I stay at some mega hotel.  

But what really sets this place apart is the staff.  More than just their friendliness (I’m always addressed by name); it’s their willingness to help with whatever needs may arise.  On my last trip I had a snafu with Eurostar tickets to Paris (my fault).  The concierge told me “no worries” and that he would correct the matter.  When I arrived back from a meeting all was corrected.   

The restaurant is very good, and the bar fun (I love the dog motif).  

Highly recommended.",5,2011,03,11
105,"A great stay, stellar staff, perfect location","My husband and I recently stayed at the Chesterfiled. I can only say that we  were most impressed by this hotel. Not only was the room comfortable and clean, the staff were stellar. On two separate occasions they came to our assistance, the first, in locating a package left on the inbound flight to London and arranging for its retrieval on our departure and the second, in finding and returning to me, via courier, a valuable handbag I had inadvertently left in the hotel room. I can't say enough nice things about service like that. Not only was the hotel an enjoyable place to stay and the location perfect, but they have staff which displays professionalism, honesty and efficiency at every turn. I heartily and unreservedly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling on business or pleasure to London, England.",5,2011,03,10
105,Absolutely perfect!,"Stayed here last Sat as a belated Valentines/Xmas getaway. Can't fault a thing about this hotel. Staff went out of our way to ensure we were comfortable and were always smiling, efficient n most of all sincere which is unheard of in a west end hotel! The room was gorgeous, fab shower, lovely toiletries and a fantastically comfy bed (so comfy we slept through breakfast). The champagne I had pre ordered arrived bang on time and the turn down service added a lovely touch. If I won the lottery I'd happily move in tomorrow. Thank you Chesterfield we will most definately be back!!! Katy Smith room 411  ",5,2011,03,04
105,Unparalleled Service,"I've never experienced anything like the service we had during our recent stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The rooms were on the small side (we had a king room), and they were clean and comfortable, but the service was absolutely incredible.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and special because you're a guest at their hotel.  I asked the concierge to make a dinner reservation for me one evening and the doorman actually followed us out of the hotel, walked down the block with us to direct us to the restaurant so that we wouldn't get lost.  We were late for breakfast one morning and the buffet had already been cleared away, but Antoine accommodated us and kept the kitchen open so that we could start our day with breakfast.  We also had afternoon tea at the hotel one day and Loris made us feel so welcome, he even took a photo of our group with his phone camera and e-mailed it to me because I didn't have mine with me, and this type of personal service continued throughout our stay.  There are also two computers on the lower level for guests to use and the complimentary bottled water was just a bonus.  I already know where I'm staying on my next trip to London.",5,2011,03,01
105,absolutely perfect,Nothing more to say than absolutely perfect! The service is incredible good in a very relaxed atmosphere. Sure come back again!,5,2011,02,28
105,A disappointment,"Won't stay here again. The rooms were the size of a matchbox. If you didn't hold your breath you couldn't pass between the bed and the dresser.  You are told when you check in that you can use the television to check your emails, search the internet, etc. When I had a problem with this and asked at the Front Desk I was told that my keyboard's battery was probably low or dead and that I should go down to the basement to use the computer there. The keyboard battery was never replaced during my 4 day stay so I was schlepping down to the basement every morning and evening. Yet my biggest beef is with the check-out and the charitable donation the hotel sticks on your bill. When I questioned the Front Desk about it, I was told the hotel does that automatically - they just stick a charitable donation on your bill. They don't forewarn you - they just do it. Are you kidding me? To make matters worse, if you question it the people at the Front Desk do their VERY best to embarrass you into thinking you're some sort of cheapskate for questioning them. I will not be staying here again and I advise others to stay away as well. The one plus is the location - close to Green Park, Hyde Park, Piccadilly and good restaurants and with a tube station about 5 minutes away.",3,2011,02,25
105,One of the Best!!,"My wife and I alway stay at this hotel when we visit London, it is in a superb location for Bond St, Regent St and Oxford St, and only a short walk from Piccadilly and Green Park Underground. The pub ""The Only Running Footman"" is just down to road near Berkeley Sq should you fancy a pint of beer instead of the hotel bar.
Rooms are nicely furnished and have complimentary robes in the bathroom.",5,2011,02,22
105,"Staying at the chesterfield hotel, mayfair","I came to the chesterfield for a family birthday 3 weeks back and was very impressed; I had the pleasure of dining there and staying for the night. Little did I know that this would be one of the best evenings I have ever had when it comes to functions in town. Everything was just perfect. The meal was astounding for how many people the chef was cooking for (well over 50).
The service and staff were attentive yet unobtrusive and at times quite humorous! I liked this!
The bar service was also brilliant. Then onto bed, the room was beautiful, clean, and quiet and I was able to get great nights sleep too followed by what now think to be the best breakfast in London. This is a hotel that really focuses on customer service and is evident when you stay there. Outstanding.",5,2011,02,22
105,It was a great place to celebrate my brother´s 80th birthday.,having travelled from Spain for this party I found all the staff extremely kind and helpful the room was very pleasant bed very comfortable.     the  dining room was amazing seating more than70 people at one table all the food was excellent and served hot   actually there wasnt anything I could have faulted  10 out of 10 for thoughtful and efficient staff.,5,2011,02,21
105,If you're looking for an exeptional hotel in London - THIS IS THE ONE!,"I recently had the good fortune to stay at The Chesterfield for an 80th Birthday Party, and was extremely impressed. 

I arrived mid afternoon and took advantage of thier Afternoon Tea. Truly exquisite. I had always been under the impression that The Ritz and Claridges were world renound for their afternoon tea,  why has the Chesterfield not been mentioned? 

From my first impressions walking in, I was won over. 

I couldn't remember how to tie my bow-tie, so rang down to the Concierge for assistance, they tried to find someone who could help, but alas coundn't so they printed off some instructions from the internet and a member of staff assisted me with these instructions - SERVICE!

We had a sit down four course meal for 80 odd people, the room was unbelieveable and the food memorable, Even though I was part or a function for 80 people the food was divine. Lobster, Beef, Fois Gras. Cooked perfectly if this is the quality of food, I'm certainly going to be eating in their main restaurant very soon
.
The service was very professional and attentive but the main factor, that has stuck in my mind was the mood; The  staff were happy and smiling all the time, the difference being that they meant it, not like some restaurants and hotels in the area when you get the feeling that they don't want to be there!

I will definitely be returning, now I have found this Gem of a place 

What more could I want from a hotel? Great service, food, atmosphere, décor, lovely bar area, wireless internet, friendly staff and gorgeous room. This hotel is a must. Their may be some people who think the likes of Claridges, Dorchester and the Ritz are the be all and end all of great hotels and service- I thought that too. Not any more. Not when a hotel like The Chesterfield offers service to this standard. It gets my vote.

So if you want the Best London can Offer - go to The Chesterfield - I will be!!",5,2011,02,21
105,What a Delight...a gem of a place,"Recently attended an 80th Birthday Bash here....it was fabulous. Hotel,staff,food etc all wonderful. Couldn't fault it!",5,2011,02,18
105,Dignified elegance in a wonderful location,"The hotel is  old- fashioned in appearance, and you expect Lord Peter Wimsey, complete with monocle, to appear at any moment.   The staff were warm and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble.  The breakfasts are splendid, and served in a dining room overlooking a delightful walled garden.   The peace and quiet, just a few  moments' walk from Piccadilly, was a real treat.   Comfortable rooms with adequate bathrooms, a little cramped, but we were in the standard rooms.   Would stay again like a shot if someone else was picking up the bill!   It is expensive, but the experience was unforgettable.",5,2011,02,15
105,My Birthday Suprise,"Visited for afternoon tea with hubby, daughters, sons-in-law and 3 year old grandson.  We were welcomed warmly and given time to take in the surroundings before being excorted to our table in the conservatory.  The staff were couteous and very welcoming.Particular attendtion was given to ensure our grandson was comfrotable.  The food was well presented and we all experienced different teas.  We never felt rushed. To end the afternoon I was given a rendition of Happy Birthday by the Staff.",5,2011,02,13
105,An experience my wife and I will truly remember and never forget,"I booked this Hotel as it was recommended by The Jesmond Dene House in Newcastle where I regualrly stay on business. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to be within walking distance of great  ,shops , theatres and restaurants.The Chesterfield is perfect for this, 10 mins from Bond Street , Regent St, Oxford St ,Burlington Arcade. I had booked a table at Cecconis for brunch at 11.ooam (walking distance) then on to the shops, back to the Hotel for pre-theatre dinner in Butlers restaurant at 5.30pm ,tickets for Les Miserable at The Queens Theatre at 7.30pm. Not a taxi insight.
My wifes birthday is a ""double edged sword as it is a day before the anniversary of her mother's death so it is tricky , you just have to hit the right note and did I hit the jackpot. I had dealt with Amy Blake at the Hotel and explained the situation. Upon arrival the Reception staff were excellent.As soon as I gave our name they wished my wife a happy birthday , were freindly and efficient, we even got upgraded..The room was beautifully appointed.We had an enjoyable day.At Bultlers restaurant we had a superb meal , the service was exceptional , freindly and attentive. Having had an enjoyable evening we returned to the Hotel bar and enjoyed a nightcap and retired.
Breakfast , again in Bulters ,having sampled dinner the evening before was as we expected , faultless.
I cannot thank the staff enough for making it a great stay.I have stayed in many fine hotels around the world and the service here was as good as any and better than most.
Will we be staying again -? Yes and will we recommend it , definitely but not on days we are staying as we dont want to be disappointed.
If we stay in London it is The Chesterfield for us from now on.

105,"Honestly, it was just stunning.","Though not the flagship hotel, The Chesterfield Mayfair is certainly far from being the vignette of the Red Carnation Group. I had the pleasure of staying there for one night last week as part of a private function. My room, the soft pink and green ‘Chesterfield Suite’ took my breath away on entry. Maybe it was the spun glass chandelier hanging from the high ceiling? Or even the four poster bed with mirrored headboard? Space was certainly generous everywhere – from the walk-in wardrobe to the separate shower in the en-suite. An antique silver cabinet and matching dressing table came stocked with a myriad of useful little extras– a stationery tray and a mini bar full of favourites (champagne, chocolates, spirits and soft drinks). There was also a flat-screen TV on the wall and easy internet access for my laptop both via an LAN cable and wireless. At the foot of the bed there was a table stocked with a wide choice of current magazines – perfect for reading while lounging in one of the beautiful upholstered chairs that came dripping with cushions. The oversized bed was simple and elegant, dressed with plain white linen and soft and dreamy to sleep in. The bathroom was bright and clean with luxurious products like a great conditioner (though this isn’t the case in standard rooms).

At the function (an 80th birthday party), drinks were served in the conservatory, which, lit by candles and filled with greenery, felt like something out of Pygmalion. We dined in the function room upstairs which had been decorated to a similar standard with silver chandeliers, candles and a well chosen jazz three-piece that played gently in the corner. The menu was inspired and the food was beautifully presented and served on time. It was the kind of meal cooked only by a chef who truly loves his job - and that's how it tasted. The staff provided excellent service throughout the night, despite the huge attendance, children and amount of alcohol consumed– a combination which I’m sure tested their patience. I found them to be down to earth and friendly at all the right moments, but always consummately professional.

The staff at reception were lovely and very helpful – they organised for my pillows to be changed straight away after I explained I had an allergy. Their uniforms have a touch of the traditional English about them, yet I got the impression they were an eclectic bunch – I recognised South African and European accents during my stay.

When I next have the opportunity to stay there, I will definitely consider spending more for an upgrade. Though I can’t imagine how my room could be any nicer. 

The best thing about the hotel in general was the attitude. The staff, the facilities and the decor – they all screamed that of a hotel that takes itself seriously – i.e. it lives and breathes amazing service. I doubt anyone leaves feeling unsatisfied.",5,2011,02,09
105,Always remember my visit,"My husband and I spent the our wedding night at the Chesterfields. I was really looking forward to my wedding day which was at the Town hall not far away and after our reception, it was such a wonderful surprise to be upgraded one of the Suites.  The service and attention to detail was great and you generally feel very welcome at the Chesterfields.  We did experience some minor noise at the venue next door which wasn'y great but we were so tired that we slept very well. Breakfast was a full English and just how we like it.  I've also been to afternoon tea there and its always been nice to relax and enjoy the hotel. Thank you to the GM and the great staff for a memorable stay.",5,2011,02,03
105,Absolutey exceptional in every respect!,"Not the first time I have stayed here - and I would definitely return again.  Though there for a nearby conference, my wife accompanied me.  The location is great; near everything - the West End, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly, Oxford St - whatever you could want.  Easy access to public transporation, more great restaurants nearby than you could ever use in one trip.
This is a high end small hotel.  Exquisite decor.  Excellent restaurant.  Full range of services.  The rooms are individual and quite plush.",5,2011,02,02
105,Great Hotel! Everyone is so friendly!,"I stayed here with my partner and we had a great experience. Everyone was extremly helpful, especially the concierge, Chris. The food was lovely and everyone was really helpful. We are definatly staying here again. Many thanks to all at the Chesterfield, Mayfair.",5,2011,02,02
105,Impeccable from start to finish,Hotel staff was beyond superb.  Prompt attention to the slightest request.  Rooms were lovely and clean.  Butler's restaurant was terrific! The best hotel experience I've had in a long time.,5,2011,02,01
105,"Peace,Location,service,price.","Just returned from a weekend at the Chesterfield Hotel with my wife for our wedding anniversary.The hotel is in a nice quiet location of Mayfair.The Service was excellent,with smiling profesional staff at all times.The price for London is very reasonable.
I would not hesitate to re visit and this is from someone who is hypercritical.",4,2011,01,31
105,The best service I have ever experienced,"The best service I have ever experienced. The staff is very friendly and attentive. You feel very special. The food is delicious, suite is beautiful and spacious. Bar has huge choice of cocktails and drinks. Free wi-fi ( which is a huge bonus) I would recommend it to everybody!",5,2011,01,31
105,Old fashioned charm,"Our third stay at the Chesterfield & can't think of where else to stay in London. Small enough for personal service, but excellent quality and very quiet. Some lovely restaurants (non chain) in nearby Shepherd Market but close to Green Park tube station & Hyde Park for exploring London.",5,2011,01,30
105,Just Outstanding!,"My Wife and I after many visits to The Chesterfield decided to get Married here last August. We took 45 people to London and we had a ball! 
Firstly the Hotel location is perfect, the hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff really are second to none! (look out for the concierge Chris... a legend).
You are greeted by name and it really is home from home!
The food is fantastic.
Ok some of the rooms are small but what hotel in London does have large rooms, check out a suit though!
Our wedding was perfect!  Every detail was seen to, nothing to much trouble!
Thank you Chesterfield
See you soon!
Dont stay anywhere else.... you will regret it!
The Andersons!",5,2011,01,22
105,Comfortably stimulating,"Sleep well in your quiet room equipped with internet, flat TV, etc.. Walk through Green Park in the morning toward Buckingham Palace. Relax every afternoon in the Chesterfield Lounge with an expertly made drink and some snacks. 

Butler's Restaurant serves excellent food and drinks. Some have complained that the service is slow, but it is not that slow, plus, these are French-style meals. You are not supposed to care about speed because you are supposed to be enjoying your conversation with your friends and family, and, well, digesting your food so that you can enjoy each course.

Housekeeping is efficient and diligent. The Tube is a five- to seven-minute walk. 

I would certainly make the Chesterfield part of my vacation routine ... and at the same time, you are well-connected to London's business world, so you don't feel completely isolated from your real life.",5,2011,01,15
105,A home away from home,"I have stayed at the Mayfair many times over the last three years and have had a consistent level of excellent service. As a single business traveler I am always welcomed back by name and I feel I am staying with friends. Although some of the rooms are small they are comfortable, clean and well stocked. Location is great for restaurants, theater , the tube and both Hyde and Green Park. I felle safe no matter if it is an early morning walk or a late night stroll back to the hotel. 
Highly recommend for a very pleasant experience.....not a typical business hotel but all the amenities you need to do your business.",5,2011,01,14
105,Classy Hotel at a Reasonable Price,"We spent 4 nights at the Chesterfield for our honeymoon.  We got a good price on-line and it was well worth it.  This is a very push hotel by our standards, and we were treated very well.  The staff were extremely attentive and made us feel very special.  The room was very nice with all the amenities one would expect in a nice hotel.  Food was excellent.  What made it extra special was the staff.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2011,01,11
105,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed for two nights with my Husband for a theatre break Rooms, staff, food all excellent and the position of the hotel 10 min walk to Oxford st could not be better. Would stay again",5,2011,01,11

very comfortable room and good sized bathroom.",5,2011,01,10
105,Christopher the Concierge ROCKS!,"My mum and I journeyed to London in November for holiday.  I chose the Mayfair secondary to it's location and other reviews.  The area where the hotel is located is beautiful, quiet, and very safe.  However, it was quite cold there at the time and the 3 block walk to the tube station was murder!  The rooms are small (it's a British thing) but very neat... think of an old English men's club, and the service (Christopher the concierge) was excellent!  He made reservations for us, made sure we were on time when walking to a destination and overall made us feel at home.   However, the price is STEEP, but I also think this is par for the course in London.  Overall, I highly recommend!",4,2011,01,05
105,Step Back in Time,"If you are looking to step back in time to a traditional upper class English hotel, then this cannot be beaten. Great service, breakfast and all round experience.  Would recommend private transfer car that the hotel organizes for you on request. Very professional and not much more than a taxi.  
The decor such as velvet wallpaper and the overall social class age group presented an air of upper class stuffiness. Be careful younger travelers as this may not be for you.  
My only real downside was the room was small and had no minibar. Too small for a mini bar....
Would stay again...location is excellent and overall service was great...but it would have to be for the right occasion.",4,2010,12,25
105,Well worth it.,"Excellent staff and concierge, beautiful and relaxing library, great cocktail lounge, quiet rooms and close to subway stop that services three lines.  Within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace or Picadilly Circus.",5,2010,12,17
105,A pleasant surprise!!,"This is a very typical English hotel, all the decoration is in an old style but very polished and very cosy. The entire decoration was carefully chosen to make you fell in another century, which is very nice to see.  I was a bit sceptical because normally I like hotel with modern decoration, but I´m glad I was mistaken.  Mayfair area is a fantastic area to stay in London and the o hotel is just a short walk to the tube station. I asked room service for dinner which was good and with a very acceptable price. The breakfast is also very good and I will definitely go back next time I’m in London! I will strongly recommend.",5,2010,12,15
105,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Chesterfield with friends for 3 nights and found it to be excellent. Breakfast was brillianr , freshly cooked hot food and buffet for cold. Staff were very helpful and friendly.",5,2010,12,13
105,Take a step back in time to a classic hotel !,"We usually stay in hotels in the same area and often walk past the Chesterfield.. One day on saying hello to the ever smiling doorman as we passed by, he invited us in to have a look around. We did and  decided to stay there on our next visit. On entering we found  that the ever beaming doorman is now one of the concierge staff. Our stay could not have been more pleasant, from the cocktail bar complete with superb pianist, the unprententious and affable restaurant manager, the freshly prepared breakfast served by delightful staff. The efficiency of the staff complemented by the elegance of the surroundings.  The ambience reminded me of the sadly now demolished Savoy in Madeira.  So much better than a corporate hotel where you are treated as a customer not as a valued guest.  I highly recommend a visit to this wonderful hotel",5,2010,12,11

105,The Chesterfield Mayfair is my favorite hotel in London.,"The Chesterfield, Mayfair provided me with warm and efficient reception on arrival; a plushly comfortable room with elegant decor; delicious food and wine in the restaurant, bar, and from 24-hour room service; friendly, attentive service from every member of the staff; free internet; and an excellent location near Berkeley Square. It doesn't get better than this at any price.",5,2010,12,11
105,Warm and friendly,"Stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 3 nights end of September 2010 while in London on business.  Location is perfect close to all the best sites and shopping.  Hotel lobby staff and doorman were extremely friendly and helpful.  Coming back to the hotel in the evenings the staff remembered me and greeted me ""home"" offering a complimentary sherry in the very cozy foyer/lobby.  Rooms could use some modern bedding and new carpeting.  Bathroom was nice, large soaker tub after an evening of walking around shopping was just what I needed. The only downside was the restaurant.  Had a breakfast there which was okay....dinner one night with colleages was very dissapointing.  Food took forever and was cold by the time we got it.  Not a big deal though as there are plenty of options within walking distance.  Overall I enjoyed my stay and would return there.",4,2010,12,09
105,GREAT EXPERIENCE FROM A CENTRAL HOTEL- ONE TO RETURN TO FOR PLEASURE,"I stayed with a colleague at this very good hotel, unfortunatly is was only for 1 night.
   I had been looking for a central hotel  close to Covent Garden area , but would have a wow factor for the prices that central London hotels charge. I looked to book on line but could not fathom how to select 2 rooms . I emailed the hotel on what I wanted & the dates & the reservations manager replied with a detailed breakdown of the booking I wanted , all I had to do was e mail back yes & credit card details to secure. - Good initial response from him. 
 So I made the booking for 2 King rooms & sent back confirmation , impressively received map for area around the hotel , tube map , special request form. I also e mailed asking if we could check in swiftly on the day @ 2:00 pm as we were on a tight deadline with train only getting into Euston @ 1:40 and we were due to meet some businees partners @2:30 for lunch in Covent Garden area.
 On the day check in good & swift as indeed all detail was ready for us. We were also upgraded to suites , we both had large rooms with sitting areas. Both rooms were well furnished with fine decor , with everything spotless. We were not around the hotel much bar sleeping , but the rooms were very comfortable , also very quiet which you cant always say about central hotels. Allthe staff we encountered were very efficient esp @ check in / out.
   We both said that the hotel was a great find both for location  near Green Park Tube , service , quality of rooms. We would look to use for both Business & our own pleasure.

105,Great Service - Great Location,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for only two nights. Most guests seemed to be there because of leisure reasons. A lot of couples, even quiet young, probably trying to get a 5-star hotel experience which is not as expensive as the Claridge's or the Dorchester. 
The hotel itself is oldfashioned designed, making you feel like London in the pre-war times. Staff is very attentive and always helpful. Especially Front Desk Team is friendly and always available for assistance, even if the Lobby is a very stressful spot to work at, as it is very small and during the day and evening extremely busy and always crowded! The Barkeeper was very helpful in suggesting a good drink!
The room was on the smaller side, but which one in London isn't? Large flat screen tv, complimentary internet, A/C - everything you need!
Only disadvantage was the breakfast. It was very boring, staff was not able to handle all guests and the buffet was rarely fully stocked, there was always something out and not refilled for quiet some time.
Anyways, the rates are extremely good for the service, the hardware and the location. I'd always stay again there!!!",4,2010,11,30
105,My favourite London hotel - never beaten on service.,"The Chesterfield has always been a memorable hotel, the staff will go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  I always try to stay here when visiting London and have been staying at this hotel for the past 5 years.  The attention to detail is what makes this hotel, the beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is excellent.",5,2010,11,29
105,A well run comfortable hotel with impeccable service.,"We stayed here on a Saturday as part of a weekend when we visited the Gauguin exhibition.
Very good location close to main areas of London with only a few stops from Green Park to Marleybone or Southwark for the Tate.
We stayed in room 316 which was very comfortable quiet and had all the amenities we could wish for. 
Breakfast was excellent in plush surroundings with again very good service.
We left our cases on the Sunday morning in order to visit the local church for Mass.
Do not on any account fail to visit this Jesuit church of the Immaculate Conception as this is a jewel within Mayfair and as Catholics a wonderful experience to hear the sung latin mass accompanied by the beautiful organ. It was truly the icing on  the cake as part of our weekend in London.
We enjoyed it so much that we left it too late and had to dash back to the hotel to pick up our cases. Did we have to wait? No in true fashion our cases were passed to us within minutes and we just made our return  train in Marleybone with minutes to spare.",5,2010,11,24
105,"Beautiful hotel, attentive staff. One of my favourites","My boyfriend took me to The Chesterfield for a night to celebrate my birthday in late October.
Check in was very straight forward .  When we got to the room, there was a birthday card awaiting me signed by all the staff and a birthday cake. This was a very nice thought from the hotel. 
We had dinner at Tamarind restaurant around the corner followed by a couple of drinks in The Terrace Bar back at the hotel. Everyone was very friendly, especially Hani the night manager and John the pianist.
Breakfast was very nice in Butlers and again all the staff was friendly to us both. We would also like to say Eric the doorman was very helpful looking after our car and when we was leaving he took our keys and packed our luggage in for us. He even stood there and waved us off.
The Chesterfield is a very classy hotel in a lovely area of Mayfair. The staff are all very friendly and nothing seems too much trouble for them.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2010,11,24
105,Superb Stay!,"Stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary. Fantastic experience from start to finish. The Hotel itself is beautiful, but it's greatest assets are definately the wonderful staff. All of them were so friendly and helpful that it made my first visit to London very special. A big thank you to everyone at the Chesterfield. I hope I am lucky enough to come back!",5,2010,11,22
105,Superb Quality at a fair Price,"This one night stay could not be faulted in any aspect from arrival to departure.

Very slick service, Rooms with every amenity, a great location and restaurant. What more could one need ?

The prices were very much in line with what one would expect to pay in Mayfair but on the whole they were fair. here are a few examples; 3 course pre theatre Dinner about £25.00 pp. Bottle of Chapagne £ 48.00 ( Strange but true, you can buy two half bottles of the same Champagne at a £5.00 saving !), Wi- Fi Free, 'Full Monty' English breakfast £22.50 pp, Room service snacks are all reasonably priced too.

A great stay, not cheap, but I can honestly say that I didn't feel ripped off on any of the charges.

There are many little things that made the stay special, but one that springs to mind is   a single blue neon light in the Bathroom, so if you need to make a nocturnal visit , it is there to guide you so you don't end up in the wardrobe!

If there was anything to critcise it would be so minor that most people would not even worry about it. I was not worried, but finding a plug for the kettle wasa challenge, but finally I located one of many lurking behind the mirror on the desk.",5,2010,11,21
105,lovely,"Location is great, within walking distance to Picadilly Circus.  Service was excellent.  Room very clean but very small.  Had room service dinner, breakfast and lunch, food was good but a bit pricey.  Many restaurant choices are available at Shepherd's Market a few minutes walk away.  Would stay here again.",4,2010,11,17
105,Delightful,"During our four-days stay in London, we more than thoroughly enjoyed this place. Centrally located, which is fine for shopping and exploring.. The room was rather small but more than adequate, with an excellent bathroom,. Service was really perfect, from all staff members. I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London on either leisure or business.",5,2010,11,16
105,Excellent Stay in great Hotel,"The Hotel is in a really good location, 5 minutes from Green Park and Piccadilly and within striking distance of all attractions etc.

The service is what sets this hotel apart from the rest we have stayed in London, very friendly and sincere. I think it depends which room you get as to how you rate your stay, the first room we were shown only had a shower, the 2nd was very close to the air conditioning vent (and quite noisy) , however I am pleased to say that the 3rd room was fine. Whilst it was small, it was well equipped, the hotel rooms are very traditional, but very comfortable, especially the bed. As this room overlooked a courtyard, this was one of the quietest hotel rooms we have stayed in in central London.

The Breakfast was very good, in a really nice setting and unlike most hotels Breakfast is served to you !

Overall, excellent and would definately consider for another trip, although might be worth upgrading to an exec room to get a slightly larger room",4,2010,11,15
105,Comfortably Classic  in  the  heart  of  Mayfair .,"Chose  the  Chesterfield  for  a  weekend  break  because  we  like  to  spend  our  evenings  in  and  around  Mayfair . Hotel  ideally  situated  just  off  Berkeley  Square .Welcomed  by  the  hotel  doorman as  soon  as  we  got  out  of  the  taxi , and  led  into  a  delightfully  English  foyer . Check-in  was  quick  and  efficient , and  our  room  provided  everything  we  needed  for  a  comfortable  stay. Particularly  liked  the  bath  crystals  as  an  alternative  to  the  'pillow  chocolates'  at  evening  turn  down . The  Terrace  bar  was  the  perfect  location  for  an  early  evening  cocktail , while  listening  to  a  very  good  pianist  playing  familiar  tunes. Breakfast  in  the  hotel  was well  cooked  and  served  efficiently  by  friendly  staff. Our  stay  was  further  enhanced  when  we  stepped  out  of  the  hotel  on  the  Sunday  morning  to  find  ourselves  on  a  film  set - the  street  had  been  transformed  overnight , back  to  the  style of  the 1950s.",5,2010,11,14
105,Worse than a bad B&B,"With 4 kids under the age of 8, we dont get much time away together minus ""the tribe"". So in a rare treat, we booked a junior suite for a mere £500 a night, total cost for 2 nights well over £1,000. When you pay these kind of prices (and granted I will not be again), you expect something pretty special. The so called ""African Suite"" was small, tired and nothing special at all. The air conditioning barely worked, the ceiling fan was linked to the master electricity switch, so only operated with all the lights on - leaving no option to have the fan working during the night. The icing on the cake was a trickle of hot water on the first night, and no hot water at all on the second night. Neither was it possible to operate the shower and the bath at the same time. Granted the hotel manager discounted our bill by half, but the complete lack of charm or manners from the Amercian receptionist on our departure confirmed what a ghastly, overated hotel this is. Be warned: this is a hotel which needs a radical overhaul, starting withing a complete re-plumbing from top to bottom. Then a decision as whether to be a proper hotel or a poor imitation of a 1970's carry on film.",1,2010,11,08
105,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at the Chesterfield October 16th-19th and it was wonderful. We arrived very late as our flight from Boston (USA) was delayed, so by the time we got our luggage, met the dirver, etc. it was 11:30pm when we arrived at the hotel.  They were very nice and prompt to check us in as we were drained.  The bellman was very fast as bringing our luggage up and very nice.  We were celebrating our First anniversity and the hotel had a card and cupcake in our room for us to celebrate along with champagne.  Very nice touch. We were starving so we ordered room service from their 24 hour menu and was surprised how great the food was for the time of night, just sandwiches and fries but hot and tasty.  We were on East Coast time so we also took a walk around the block when we got there and saw all of the people heading into the clubs in Picadilly Circus...not to be missed!!

 We had a King room, and while the room was small, it was perfectly laid out.  There was a desk and drawers lining one wall which gave us plently of storage space, and two closets which fit out ouggage perfectly.  We had 3 large suitcases as we were going to to the QM2, and had no problem fitting them.  The bathroom was also small, but the shower was amazing.  It had a rainfall shower head which provided excellent pressure (with thick hair I appreciated it).  We had the breakfast package, so we received a full english breakfast every morning.  The first morning we went to the dining room which was so nice and the staff was friendly and the food wonderful.  With this option we also received the contiental breakfast buffet which had fruit and muffins, etc to choose from.  We choose to have breakfast in our room the next two mornings and were able to receive everything we would in the dining room.

We also had a full Afternoon Tea as part of our package and it was WONDERFUL.  I could not speak more highly at the quality of the food.  The service was great, and we really enjoyed it, not to be missed at all.  We even upgraded to the champagne tea as it was out anniversity and really it was lovely.

The location is perfect for anything you would want to do, 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, shopping is right around the corner, and Pickadilyl Circus is a 5 minute walk.  It really cannot be beat.  There were also really nice Pubs right around the corner (2 minute walk) that we went to two nights as we love the pub food when we visit London.

Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel, it was perfect in every aspect. Even free high speed internet!! We stayed the The Ritz on a previous visit and while that was nice, I would come back to the Chesterfield first.",5,2010,11,07
105,Wonderful weekend in London,"Location - great, in the heart in Mayfair but in a quiet side street, 10 min walk to Leicester Square.

Rooms - lovely plush room (Deluxe), modern but with character. Tea/coffee facilities, SKY TV, Gilchrist & Soames toiletries, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!

Staff - the key selling point of this hotel - from the doorman to the receptionist to the cleaners, everybody went out of their way to make you feel special - we've stayed at the Renaissance and the Waldorf Hilton (admittedly bigger hotels so will be less personal) but the staff at the Chesterfield were far better in every way.

As a 4 star hotel, this is as good as any and we will be returning when we next visit London.",5,2010,11,03
105,We were treated like V.I.P'S from the moment we arrived.,"I booked a champagne weekend at the chesterfield Mayfair to celelbrate my Mum's birthday. 

From the moment we arrived at the hoel door we were treated like V.I.P'S nothing was too much trouble, the staff on reception wished my Mum happy birthday, and whilst our room wasn't ready we were welcomed into the hotel, our luggage was taken from us and we had a lovely drink in the bar, after sinking into the comfy chairs with a glass of wine and taking a moment to catch our breath we then were ready to do some shopping.

We checked into our room which was fantastic, it had everything and more that you could wish for, the beds, bedding and pillows made you want to get into bed and not get out again, little gifts were left on our pillows at night when the maid came in to turn our beds down which was a lovely touch. 
The twin room had lots of room, loads of sockets for hair dryers, straightners etc, and lots of mirrors, (with two women you need that). With three windows the lighting was really good as with lots of hotels the rooms can be quite dark

We had our champagne in our room, which was shortly followed by a birthday card (signed by all of the staff) and a birthday cake for my Mum. We were both very touched by this gesture.

We ate in the restaurant before seeing a show and the food was lovely, the staff again wished Mum happy birthday and again couldn't do enough for us.

Bring a big appetite with you for the breakfast's as you will want to try everything, but you will soon walk it off when you walk round London.

We had an amazing stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair and would reccomend this to anyone visiting London, and can't wait to stay there again, maybe with my husband next time as he was really jealous.",5,2010,10,29
105,Afternoon tea perfection,"Having been to afternoon tea at The Chesterfield previously, I decided to go with my husband for his birthday. The experience was just as good if not better than before. The sumptuous yet comfortable and traditional not ostintatious and clinical surrounding that is unfortunately becoming the norm we really enjoyed. A delicious choice of teas non-stop sandwiches and cakes with very respectful and friendly service is a joy. Mrs L. Prior, Coggeshall",5,2010,10,29
105,"A Classy, Quiet Choice","My twenty-something son and I shared a room at the Chesterfield for a week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is a block off Berkeley Square, and centrally located among Oxford Street shopping, Hyde Park, and Piccadilly.  Leicester Sq, Soho, the West End, Trafalgar, Knightsbridge and the Thames are not far away by foot, and it's two blocks to the Green Park tube.  We booked a room without breakfast (lots of Prets and the like within a block or so) -- the rate was quite reasonable, especially for Mayfair, and came with free wifi and guaranteed, and quite comfortable, twin beds.  The room was typical London -- small but more than adequate, if not a bit cozy, with an excellent bathroom, especially the high water pressure overhead shower.   Service was friendly and helpful -- after we arrived late in the evening on a morning flight across the pond, the night clerk happily opened the bar and served us drinks at 2 am, and the concierge the next day quickly found us tickets to the sold out Chelsea match.  There are lots of excellent hotels in London, but many of them are American style chains or on busy streets.  When in London, do London, and the Chesterfield is a clubby, delightful and quiet enclave.  I would happily stay there again.",5,2010,10,26
105,Will never stay anywhere else in London ever again!!!,"I simply cannot rate this hotel anymore highly, it is fantastic.  Ticked all the boxes.  The staff at this hotel simply make it special.  I struggled up the road with my suitcase (I can't understand why I thought getting the tube would be easy??!!) only to have the doorman come rushing up the road to meet me!  Nothing is too much trouble... love it, and can't wait to return",5,2010,10,25
105,Small things would have made it much better,"The Chesterfield sits in an excellent location on Charles street, a short walk from Green Park tube and just off the busy streets. In many respects its location is excellent quiet but two minutes walk away from the lively bars and shopping areas etc.
Upon arrival the entrance to the hotel looks impressive with its many national flags flying proudly outside and the entrance lobby certainly does not let the hotel down in any way. Greeted by the concierge in full top hat and tails the hotel entrance and lobby gives a strong impression of grandeur decorated with fine art work and history. Checking in was easy and hassle free; reception staff in the hotel were polite, genuinely warm in their approach and always willing to help and offer additional service without request (calling taxis, storing luggage, offering ravel advise etc). It would be very fair to say the staffs who man the reception area were in my opinion a strong asset to this hotel. 
Upon arriving at my bedroom, located on the fifth floor (standard double), initial impressions were slightly small but certainly not unbearable; in addition, cleanliness was of an exceptional quality and could not be faulted in any way shape or form. In terms of facilities the room was equipped with air conditioning, under floor heating, wi fi, flat screen TV and complimentary bath robes in addition to all other usual facilities. For me the room lacked just one item I would have almost expected as standard in a four star hotel, a trouser press, though iron and ironing board are provided. In terms of the quality of sleeping arrangements the bed was extremely comfortable and was adorned with quality rich cotton sheets.  My only other slight niggle with the bedroom was the picture on the television set which was not of great quality. Whilst staying in the room we did use room service which was reasonably priced, considering location. 
My biggest disappointment in the hotel was at breakfast and this was the only area I felt the hotel really fell down. Before commenting on some of the niggles, it is important to point out the quality on the provisions was excellent and also offering good wide variety. In addition, there is a lengthy window in which breakfast is served, ideal if you have had a later night in the West End. However the staff manning the restaurant where breakfast was served left a little to be desired in terms of their focus. For example, on the two occasions I went to get fresh juice there were no glasses so ended up asking, my partner even had to ask for a bowl to put her cereal in as there were non on display.  Upon laying out our table there was no butter for toast, just margarine, all other tables had both butter and margarine. The waiter brought out our cooked breakfast before clearing the table of the cereal bowls making it difficult and tight for space. Brown sauce and red sauce are upon request; they arrived five minutes after the cooked breakfast. Then I saw the one thing I certainly never expect to see in a one star hotel, let alone a four star. Whilst setting up the table next to us for the next guests, the breakfast waiter dropped the knife and fork onto the floor; I was totally astounded to subsequently watch him pick up the knife and fork and place them straight back on the table! I would have expected to see him go off to fetch fresh cutlery, the right thing to do; failing that at least make some half effort to wipe the cutlery clean again, but nothing; off the floor on to the table no bat of an eyelid. Whilst in the breakfast restaurant I was trying to decide why the service in here was letting the rest of the hotel down, there were six waiter/waitresses that I counted looking after around 24 tables in a half self service restaurant, so a shortage of staff certainly didn’t seem to be the issue; therefore I can only put it down to either training or leadership of their immediate supervisor. It is a shame about the service at breakfast because that is the only major negative I could see in an otherwise well run hotel. 
In summary, would I stay at the Chesterfield again? Yes; very comfortable, very friendly reception staff, excellent quality food, good quality fixtures in the bedroom. If I were a business traveller the trouser press might be a bigger issue for me, but to be honest using the hotel for leisure it was not a major problem. As for the television picture, should it be better quality? Of course it should, but this is London a city that genuinely never sleeps, who wants to watch television when there are all those fantastic shows in the West End. Which just leads to the breakfast issue, my one hope is that someone from the hotel reads this, takes note and does something about that because I am sure that is very easy to rectify at little cost!",4,2010,10,24
105,"Faultless Service, Excellent Value","Because of the numerous consistently high reviews of Chesterfield Mayfair, and its’ very-well-deserved (as we discovered) high ranking on TripAdvisor, we decided to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair during our recent trip to London.

The staff at Chesterfield Mayfair welcomed us very warmly upon our arrival, and throughout our stay treated us as if we were special, valued, and appreciated. 

Front desk staff, bellmen, doormen, restaurant staff, housekeeping staff, and concierges all went out of their way to make our stay at Chesterfield Mayfair as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.

The package we were on included a bottle of Champagne, one English High Tea service for two, and daily breakfasts.  All very nice, and added up to excellent value.

The only thing we didn't like about the Chesterfield Mayfair was the small size of our room, but considering the historic nature of the building, and it being centrally located in the heart of Mayfair, this is but a minor consideration, and will not stop us from returning to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair when we are next in London.

Our stay at Chesterfield Mayfair was quite a nice change from the usual business/conference/resort hotels in which we usually stay, and we're glad that we decided to try something different.",5,2010,10,08
105,Celebration in luxurious style,"We stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel for our wedding anniversary, and the hotel totally lived up to all our expectations. We had chosen the hotel from a previous visit when we had taken 'high tea' and had been impressed by the sumptuous surroundings and the quality of the service which was impeccable. We stayed in a standard double room, which would have put most other hotels executive rooms in the shade. No faux marble bathrooms here, with everything as you would expect from a high class hotel.
Breakfast in the morning was scrumptious with a choice of menu to suit all tastes, from the healthy muesli and yoghurt brigade to the full English breakfast lovers. The central location also makes it ideal for getting to attractions, shopping and night life. All in all, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a special hotel for that special occasion, as you will not be disappointed. Such was our enjoyment, we are returning for another special occasion in April 2011.",5,2010,10,03
105,Coming home!,"Everyone checking in and staying at a hotel like to feel that they are being greeted and treated as  old friends. The Chesterfied Mayfair does that very well from the door man to the front desk, the conceirge and the all the other staff members including the excellent dining room,
The rates are comparable with the better hotels in London and I would reccomend a Junior suite as being very well furnished, comfortable in size and worth the price.",5,2010,10,01
105,First stay but definitely not the last!,"Brilliant Hotel in a good location.Stayed for only one night but what a pleasant stay. The room was tastefully decorated and for a twin room we found quite spacious.The evening my daughter and I arrived there was an event being held next to the Hotel.The staff informed us of this and also to the possibility of a busy restaurant for breakfast the following morning. Breakfast was good and an excellent menu.Having stayed in a few Hotels in London in the past ,we will now return only to the Chesterfield with its excellent staff and service.",5,2010,10,01
105,"A hotel with character, class and unbeatable service","The Chesterfield is a hidden gem in Mayfair.  The hotel itself oozes character and old English charm making you feel like you've gone back in time!

The bedrooms are themed and ours was the jungle room which had every convenience.  I wanted to take the bed home with me, it was so comfortable and had the best nights sleep!

Our stay was made all the more pleasurable by the wonderful staff.  Nothing was too much trouble; they made us feel welcome and paid attention to every little detail for our stay and went the extra mile throughout. 

The location is brilliant. If you fancy a short walk, Piccadilly and Regent Street are just round the corner, and even closer is Shepherds Market which is a lovely area for food and drink - we ended up at a fantastic little mexican/polish restaurant.

Without going on further, this a brilliant hotel and I would recommend this to anyone, for business or pleasure.",5,2010,09,30
105,5 Star Luxury in a 4 Star Hotel!!,"We stayed just one night at the Chesterfield but we had a fabulous time.  The hotel itself is luxurious and decorated beautifully.  The rooms are very comfortable.  Without exception, the staff were extremely professional and friendly.  We only ate breakfast in the hotel but it was delicious with a wide choice - the restaurant is a lovely place to eat.  The hotel is well placed for Mayfair, Green Park, etc and is in a quiet street off the main track.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2010,09,29
105,"Great staff, pretty public rooms, okay value, British plumbing","Because the staff and service are so pleasant and helpful (I can't emphasize enough how good they are; they went out of their way in several dimensions to be helpful) and the public rooms are so beautiful, I wish I could second the general rapturous consensus about this hotel.  But we found the truth to be more mixed.  It's well located in the heart of Mayfair, but close enough to the Green Park tube stop to allow some escape from the excellent but appallingly expensive London cabs.  The very comfortable public rooms are suffused in Edwardian ambiance and the breakfast in the restaurant was first-rate.  Free wireless in the room was also a plus.  
BUT:  1) our ""junior suite"" (styled the ""Mayfair Suite"") was a double room only very slightly larger than the double we had recently occupied in the Hilton Garden Inn in Emeryville, CA. It was basically a double with two rather petite sitting chairs and mini-ottomans at the foot of the bed. The linens were superb, but the king bed managed both to be too hard (and I like a firm bed) and to sag in the middle because it was made up of two mattresses abutting.  The toilet wouldn't flush properly and the shower was hair-trigger from cold to scalding because the hot water was very hot and the cold water was meager in volume.  There was a light in the bathroom that couldn't be turned out.  The ""do not disturb"" and ""please make up the room"" sign operated off a toggle switch set in an engraved brass plate at a height that couldn't be read without crouching.  Would I stay there again?  I'd think hard about it.  WOULD I RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND?  It would depend on how much the friend valued style and grace over function and room comfort.",3,2010,09,28
105,Excellent hidden away gem,"Very friendly and polite, helpful staff. Rooms clean and tidy and nicely decorated. Very comfortable beds, duvets etc. A really good nights sleep in central london. Also, it was my birthday and they went to the trouble of providing me with a birthday cake - which doesn't happen very often in a central London hotel!",5,2010,09,28
105,Amazing staff and location make this a perfect hotel in London,"I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Chesterfield and I cannot say enough positive things about it. Every single employee was extremely nice. I had a late check in and they were super accomodating. 24 hour room service and complimentary plums in the room when I arrived. Lovely bath products. Free wi-fi. The lobby bar is open 24 hours and they gave me several complimentary drink vouchers upon arrival. In the afternoon/evening the bar has a pianist which made a lovey atmosphere even lovelier. The location is around the corner from Berkeley Square and some amazing restaurants and even nearby shopping. Within walking distance to Picadiilly, Oxford Street and Bond Street. As I checked out very early, they called a cab and insisted on bringing complimentary coffee while waiting. I've stayed in London several times and I have to say this was the best hotel experience thus far.",5,2010,09,27
105,"Wonderful Hotel, better staff","We visited the Chesterfield in late June as part of our first trip to London.  After spending time with Darren and the rest of the staff, I must say that we look forward to many return trips to the Chesterfield.  

Being London novices we were a bit like deer in headlights after being dropped off at the front door.  No worries though as we were consistently helped with everything from finding the best place to watch the World Cup (and having a friendly debate on the merits of the US winning the group ;)) to the best sights and sounds of such a great city.   

The room was tastefully done, and our only complaint would be the apparent age of the technology in the room.  Primarily due to the late night replays of the Cup matches.   Another minor complaint was the bed.  Two full sizes pushed together to make a King was fine, but there was a definite divide between the two (worn feeling) mattresses.  Aside from that there was little to complain about.  The hotel was quite clean and very friendly.    We actually booked a couple of excursions and sight seeing tours throughout our stay.  Twice our company let us down with pick up and drop offs, but thankfully the concierge was there to pick up the slack and made sure we were able to get where we needed to be when we needed to be there.  

We ate at the hotel once for dinner - on the first night as jet lag was catching up, and were quite pleased with the menu and quality.  Each morning we ordered breakfast and were overwhelmed by the portions and taste - all very good. 

Can't wait to get back to London in the future and hope our travels return us back to the Chesterfield.",5,2010,09,26
105,As good as ever!,"We stayed with some friends on one of the Mayfair Weekend packages and could not have had a better time.The hotel staff and facilities were as ever excellent and we will certainly be going back.
Our friends had not been to the Chesterfield for a long time and had forgotten just how good it was.
Thank you for a great weekend.",5,2010,09,25
105,Wonderful Service,We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Chestefield Hotel. The level of service is second to none and the location is fantastic. I have never stayed anywhere that the staff have been more attentive without being over bearing. The hotel itself has a cost old world charm that was a refreshing change to the ultra modern uniform  style in most hotels.The bar food was fantastic and breakfast was a real treat - everything made fresh to order and the quality was superb. We would stay again in a heartbeat!,5,2010,09,19
105,This was our first stay at The...,"This was our first stay at The Chesterfield Hotel, and as soon as we arrived, we were very impressed. For such a busy London hotel, the atmosphere was incredibly intimate, whilst the staff were impeccably professional. Having stayed at one of the other Red Carnation Hotels previously, we had great expectations, which were exceeded! It was easy to forget that one was staying in the centre of a capital city, and as such I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in London for business or pleasure. We really enjoyed our few days away in this establishment..... Thank you Red Carnation!!!!",5,2010,09,19
105,Excellent 4* quality hotel in quiet setting just off Berkeley Square yet within easy minutes of Oxford St/Royal Parks,"We stayed for a special weekend and wanted somewhere within a few minutes walk of Gordon Ramsays at Claridges. The staff were friendly and helpful. Decor excellent. Quality food/restaurant. The room was quiet, very clean and comfortable in keeping with a 4* hotel. It is ideal as a quiet/quality place to stay whilst enjoying a short stay in London and much better than the budget hotel option. We will use this hotel again for our next London break.Only a few minutes stroll from the Royal Parks, Hyde Park< Buckingham Palace and Oxford Street.",5,2010,09,16
105,"Excellent location, helpful staff, comfortable rooms","Stayed at the Chesterfield for 8 nights. Trip was for pleasure and used the hotel as a base for doing tourist itinerary. 
LOCATION: Most of our destinations were within walking distance eg. Buckingham Palace, Natural Science Museum, V&A Museum, British Museum, Churchill War Rooms, Westminster Abbey, even the Tower of London though that was the better part of an hour walk. Oxford Street shopping and Soho theatres also close by.
ROOMS: For London the hotel's rooms, (I had a King bed, my son had a double in his room), were reasonable sized. I've paid much more per night for smaller sized rooms in London and Paris. The rooms were well maintained, clean and everything operated as expected.
STAFF: Helpful and friendly in a ""British"" way.
Food and Bar: Had breakfast each morning in the restaurant. Fairly limited choice for the buffet, better selection with the menu. Still not great value. Bar can become crowded after work hours but later in the evening it thins out and the service and choice of food and drink is good, in a very comfortable setting.

Overall excellent stay, (my second time there in the last 3 years), and I would stay again.",5,2010,09,16
105,Another Excellent Stay at The Chesrerfield,"We have had another excellent  stay at the Chesterfield all the staff are very friendly & helpful nothing is to much trouble for them.
The hotel is situated close to the West End, Oxford Street, Bond Street & Regent Street.",5,2010,09,14
105,Amazing Hotel - Would Recommend to Everyone!!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week last September and I've been meaning to write a review about our wonderful stay... We live in the United States and came to London for a vacation and to visit some friends. 

Without knowing a thing, my boyfriend worked with the hotel staff to help him arrange the most amazing proposal I've ever heard of! We got engaged on our second night their on the London Eye.  While we were out at dinner celebrating the hotel staff (who all knew we were getting engaged that night) moved all of our luggage into a suite, complete with rose petals, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  They arranged for transportation to and from the London Eye and to dinner in a gorgeous BMW, complete with our own personal driver.  The entire hotel staff was so friendly and knew both of us by name by the end of our stay.  It was such a pleasure to stay somewhere with this type of attention and service.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice getaway.  The location was perfect for walking around the city or grabbing a taxi.  I loved everything about our stay and will remember it forever!  I cannot wait to go back and stay there again!  :)",5,2010,09,10
105,"Really lovely place, great service","A lovely hotel, tucked away down a quiet street.  The room was very clean - towels and bed linen were very good quality.  The service was excellent, all of the staff were very obliging - we were there for my birthday and they put a cake and card in our room whilst we were out shopping - a really thoughtful touch.  The room service was very good - quality food; breakfast was excellent.  When we left, the staff on reception were very obliging and swiftly checked us out and ordered a taxi.",4,2010,09,08
105,Perfect Location,"Travelled just for 2 nights and had an enjoyable business trip at this lovely little hotel.

What a treat, great service and food. The decor was lovely, bathroom starting to look a little tired but frankly well worth the money that was paid. Booked on Hotel Bookings . com and got a great deal. Will definately use htis place the next time I am in the city, a very relaxing stay, thank you",4,2010,09,02
105,"Perfect location, great service, English charm","My wife and I stayed one very enjoyable week.  You can basically walk to everything within a few minutes from this location.  The hotel is distinctly English  (being a conversion from several historic  buildings) and fits the locality perfectly, the service is excellent, the food great and everyone is friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended,",5,2010,08,27
105,A very enjoyable stay,"We chose the Chesterfield for its position in a quiet neighbourhood but still very central. It was perfect. Everybody was very friendly and efficient. Our first room was changed to a better position without fuss. A very enjoyable, charming place and one we will come back to.",4,2010,08,26
105,"Nice and friendly staff, nice location, but not nice room.","Sorry my bad spelling. Thats why i never write a review. but now i must.
We were only there for 2 days, and didnt bother to complain. But it was a bad room. Loked funny with fake books on the wall and everything, i like scandinavian design more, but that is a matter of taste. But the air were bad. You couldnt open the window, and there were no real air condition only a cooler. I was kind of desperate about oxygene. In Denmark it wouldnt be allowed. I do not think it is healthy, and it gives a heavy air, like in a coffin. I was thinking of kill bill and breaking out, breaking a window or something. And there was something else. the floor squeekd so much, that you could here every move from the nabourgh room. So if you stay at this hotel. avoid the rooms without air. The price for this room was more than 200 pounds pr. night. But as i said. the staff were nice. and the afternoon tea a comfort.  Sincerely Eva",2,2010,08,26
105,Lived up to reviews,"Booked a weekend package ......what a lovely way to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by Eric on the door (Very charming gentleman, and helpful) checked in to our room and shown around the hotel.  Afternoon tea with our bottle of champagne which is included in the weekend package was lovely with cream cakes which are out of this world; although we thought the scones were disappointing.  Breakfast both days was freshly cooked and most enjoyable eggs Benedict and the haddock with hollandaise made my day.  I have already started to recommend the Chesterfield to our friends as the location is brilliant.  I doubt if there is a hotel in London that is so noise free, with such charming staff that have the ability to make you feel at home and relaxed, a total stress free weekend.  Hope to return again soon.",5,2010,08,25
105,"a miniature, up-market version of Claridges","I was most pleased that the genral manager actually took the time to read my  prior comments - but I would expect nothing less from the Chesterfield. I would, however, like to additionally point out that you have an outstanding Concierge in Christopher and an outstanding maitre de hotel in your returaunt - Malcom.

However, please fix your showers before my next visit.",5,2010,08,24
105,"A Fabulous Hotel, full of English Charm!","Our family of four, including two teenage children ages 14, 16, recently returned from our trip to England.  We were fortunate to book an amazing hotel through Priceline called the Chesterfield.  Not really knowing what to expect when we arrived I was really pleased to see that this hotel lived up to my expectations!  We were greeted by name at our arrival and the staff went our of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  We booked two double rooms with two single beds in each room.  If you have heard horror stories about the small rooms in England don't be concerned with the Chesterfield, there is ample room to store your clothes and suitcases, I heavily overpacked for our two week trip and had plenty of room to hang my clothes and put away all my things.  The rooms are decorated in true english style and they are lovely and clean!  I'm extremely picky when it comes to hotel rooms so please take my word that this hotel is imaculate!  The hotel is located very close to shopping and transportation, the district of Mayfair is upscale and a great place to walk around.  The bar in the hotel is quaint, well appointed and a comfortable place to sit and relax after a hectic day of sightseeing.  Would I recommend this hotel to my friends?  Absolutely, in fact we plan to visit again next summer.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2010,08,24
105,In our opinion a 6* Hotel!,"A very warm welcome, excellent customer relations, beautifully decorated hotel, rooms were stunning, and extremely clean, a very enjoyable stay, we had breakfast served to us beautifully and tasted excellent! Can't wait to return.",5,2010,08,24
105,GREAT,"Everything perfect: the room, the room cleaning, the room service, the reception, the atmosphere at the bar... I'll be back! (and not only for the excellent afternoon tea)",5,2010,08,18
105,"Gem of a Hotel in Mayfair, London",Only stayed for one night but it was fabulous.  The service from everyone was exceptional.  The staff were all friendly and very helpful.  The room was beautifully furnished and the bed really comfy.  We had dinner in the restaurant (the room is magical).  Small but exquisite menu and again the staff were smiling and helpful.  We ended with cocktails in the bar whilst listening to a live pianist.  Breakfast in bed was prompt and hot.  Could not fault this hotel at all.,5,2010,08,18
105,Simply the best for a special occasion,"We went to the Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. A special weekend that was made more special by the hotel. Our trepidation at going to a luxury hotel in Mayfair was allayed within minutes of our arrival by the reception we received from the staff. Where else could you find a luxury hotel that makes you feel so at ease that you felt you were among friends who all had the same aim of you enjoying the stay. All the staff seemed to be enjoying working at the hotel and proud to be there. The afternoon tea was excellent and scones were to die for !.We were even offered the recipe they were so sure we would enjoy them. The Terrace bar is an oasis of calm that we used often for a quiet snack and a drink. Our celebration meal was everything we hoped for with champagne , supplied by the hotel, and the quality of the food was excellent. So much so that I doubt we will find its equal until we go back to the hotel. And the final action of the staff to bring out the decorated  plate and small cake with a candle was typical of the friendliness of the staff and their determination to ensure you enjoyed your  stay. Our room was excellent even though the bed was so big we had trouble finding each other!!
This review may seem over the top but it really reflects our feelings about the hotel. A BIG BIG thank you to everyone.",5,2010,08,18
105,Excellent hotel and staff.,"This was our second stay in The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel, and with no doubt not the last. The pleasure starts in the moment you turn the street corner. After that, all you have to do is relax. The atmosphere in the hotel is perfect for a quiet space of time with one you prefer to join a good time with. All the staff is genuine persons who want to give you that feeling, and they succeeded. Last, but also nice, is the location. It is a short walk to “City of London”.
Thank you for a splendid stay.",5,2010,08,18
105,"A pleasure to stay in a top class hotel, sevice with a smile","Before staying in The Chesterfield, like most people, we researched reviews from past customers. We liked what we saw and booked for 3 nights. From the moment my wife and I walked up to the front door, we were greeted by staff and helped with our things. It didnt changed for the next 3 nights.The hotel is a mix of old school English charm, with modern touches included. All the staff were helpful, the breakfast was sensational and in a fantastic part of town. We meet the General Manager of the hotel in the bar, and he chatted to us like we were long lost friends. It wasnt necessary, but a wonderful touch. Will be back to stay again next time we are in London. Thank you",5,2010,08,15
105,Outstanding,We stayed there 5 nights.  This charming hotel far exceeded our expectations.  The staff was extremely helpful and polite.  The hotel was elegant and lovely and in a very good location.  The breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant was excellent.   No wonder it is one of the best hotels in London!,5,2010,08,09
105,A perfect stay in a perfect hotel,"Went with my hsband to celebrate our 5th anniversary.  From the moment we checked in...and were given an upgraded room to a suite :)...... we were looked after and taken care of.  The staff were friendly and seemed to genuinly care about us, the hotel was spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated, the room was amazing - it even had two bathrooms.  The only thing I was a little disapointed with was the romantic turndown - just petals which stained the covers and footcream, not worth the £15.  Didn't have breakfast but it was a super stay.  Would definately go there again.  We have stayed in many London hotels and this has been the best by a ong way so far.",5,2010,07,30
105,Excellent choice,"We llke to stay iin the Mayfair section of London and have stayed at a number of hotels there.  I think we will stick with the Chesterfield Mayfair now that we have found it.  It has a lovely ""old London"" feel in atmosphere but the rooms are modern, very comfortable and very clean.  From the moment we were greeted by the doorman and reception staff, until the time we left with a fond Cheerio, we felt at home.  A number of the staff remembered our names from arrival on.   As Americans, we are used to larger beds than most European hotels provide.  Our choice of a superior king was perfect for us - in reality it is slightly larger than our definition of a queen bed - and very comfortable.  The air-conditioning is excellent, necessary sometimes in the summer months and for the fact that the windows are unable to be opened.  We purchased the Mayfair Weekend Package for 3 nights and thought it was an excellent choice for us as it included full Engllsh breakfast and an Afternoon Tea which we enjoyed.  Also included was a bottle of champagne which we enjoyed sharing with friends in the bar - it even tasted really good.  Certainly the star of the hotel is it's staff.  We had dinner one night in the restaurant, Butler's, the food was excellent and price comparative to any nice restaurant in a large city.  Green Park tube stop is a short walk, there are restaurants in the area, we recommend it for sure.",5,2010,07,27
105,Excelent hotel one of the best for...,"Excelent hotel one of the best for service, location and quality. Highly recommend the afternoon tea too. ",5,2010,07,25
105,THE CHESTERFIELD IS A HIDDEN MAYFAIR GEM,"My stay was exceptional.  I've been a frequent traveler to London over the past 20 years and have stayed extensively in the Mayfair area.  The Chesterfield was by far my best experience and value.  The area is great for walking and easy access to underground.  Many execptional shopping and dining locations nearby.  

This was my first time with The Chesterfield.  It was FIRST CLASS.  I had a business meeting at the hotel on my day of arrival and we did so while enjoying tea in the garden area next to Butlers restaurant.  

Very professional and supportive staff.  I was pleasantly surprised to see complimentary towels and water bottles in the lobby for joggers after my early morning run - an unexpected but very welcome touch of hospitality.   

The Chesterfield will be my only choice of hotel for London in the future.  

Too many people to thank - every aspect of my visit was WELL DONE!",5,2010,07,21
105,Excellent service and location,"My wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair during a visit to the UK in June. The location is a major plus - close to many attractions, in a quiet area, and close to Green Park tube station. We have stayed in a number of different hotels in recent years in different parts of London, but found this the best so far. The hotel is in the older but elegant style, with first class service at every turn. Staff were very attentive and helpful. The meals (breakfast and dinner we experienced) were excellent quality and service.",5,2010,07,21
105,We were made to feel like special friends in someones beautiful home as opposed to being just another hotel guest,"This was an exceptional experience as we were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. This is a most elegant hotel where one feels you have entered  an atmosphere that ehibits the opulence, charm and warmth of a bygone era, the hotel exhibits a distinct feeling of being loved.
Management should be congratulated for creating a feeling of genuine friendship , this was evident from all who looked after us. Their attentiveness, responsiveness and willingness to make our stay a special experience was unique. Management have found the secrect ingredients for combining all of these atributes with consumate professionalism. I am not sure how they have done it but they should bottle it and sell it to some of the big brand establishments we stay at around the world.
Located near Berkley Square in the middle of Mayfair, within close walking distance to the Green Park Underground Station and all the tourist bus routes on Piccadilly. The hotel is within short walking distance to all the options of  West End shopping, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and many more tourist destination, it is perfectly located.
My business activities are all within the city and access to these via Green Park Station means this hotel is perfect for both the business person and tourist alike.
The Chesterfield is also approximately 100 metres from the quirky restraurant and pub precint at Shepherd Market in Curzon Street providing a wide variety of cuisine options.

The best compliment we can provide is that we cancelled a week we were intending to spend  travelling to other parts of the country, in favour of coming back for an extra week at The Chesterfield.

Our tips for making your stay as good as ours, one,be prepared for and open to the friendliness of the staff, have a chat with the concierge team, they have some great advice and love a laugh. Two, remember hotel staff like most of us respond positively to a smile.

Will we continue to come back to the Chesterfield, of course we will, it's our London home.",5,2010,07,14
105,Great Location,"+ great location with a short 10mins walk to the Green Park underground station, 7mins walk to Green Park and 10mins walk to Hyde Park. Picadilly Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street are all within walking distance. great train connection from the Heathrow Express to Green Park station, just ensure luggage is not too heavy as there are not necessary lifts all the way through. 
+ less than 2 mins walk is the Shepherd's Market = many choices of cafes and restaurants and an express Tesco supermarket. 

- bathroom is small and the shower cubicle is even smaller in the standard room. 

we'd recommend this hotel for its location.",4,2010,07,10
105,All in all a hotel I would definately return to,"London hotels can be difficult to review.  As a general rule you get what you pay for but having visited quite alot over the last 25 years some are definately better than others.  The Chesterfield definately comes into the latter category.  Excellent location - central yet quiet - with ""reasonable"" valet parking.  ALL staff friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful.  Standard of rooms both public and bedrooms excellent with everything you would expect.  All in all a hotel I would definately return to.",5,2010,07,09
105,Great location for first-time visit to London,"If you're comfortable with the Tube (one of the easiest public transportation systems to use in my opinion) this hotel is located quite close to the Green Park station, at which you can catch three major underground lines). The rooms were Manhattan-sized, i.e., small but functional. The staff were wonderful: I arrived quite early into London (9:30AM) and they were able to make a room ready for me by 10:30AM which is well before the normal check-in time. I could tell that they were accustomed to getting this request and were quite prepared to make it happen. Overall a great experience.",5,2010,07,08
105,Excellent and friendly hotel,Having now stayed at the Chesterfield on three occasions I would thoroughly recommend it. The service and staff are excellent,5,2010,07,06
105,"Superb service, excellent location, fantastic breakfast; this hotel is wonderful for a London break.","We have just spent a weekend at the Chesterfield. The staff were charming and helpful, the food was freshly prepared and of the highest quality, and our room was a restful haven from the bustle of London. A short stroll from Green Park Underground, the hotel is also conveniently located for Regent St and Oxford St, Hyde Park, St James Park and Buckingham Palace. Highly Recommended.",5,2010,07,05
105,A Class Operation!!,"What a glorious experience!!!  The Chesterfield Hotel was wonderful.  A glass operation from the moment of check-in through check-out  and everything in between!!

The overall ambiance of the hotel was A-1, as was the staff.
The warm feeling in the bar/lounge, dining room was terrific!!

We enjoyed the 6 days so much that we are going back for 10 days

105,"Nice Location, but...","as allways in London the value for this price is unbelievable bad. The rooms are tiny. That means you are not able to stand in front of the bed properly, due to the desk which stands right in front of the bad. The bathroom was old fashioned but very clean. The TV was not working good, but it was fixed immediately. The Breakfast buffet was large and delicous. As written in the headline, the best thing about this hotel is the location. Walking distance to most of the shopping streets like bond street.",3,2010,06,30
105,Lacking in thoughtfullness!,"Both my husband and I stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair two nights, 24th to 26h June.   Hotel itself is lovely, staff friendly.   Unfortunately, while I was there I developed a really  bad tooth abcess and the concierge called a doctor for me late on Friday night. My cheek was badly swollen. The painkillers that the doctor left me were very strong and he had told me I would be extremely sleepy.   The next morning my husband rang down to reception to ask as he had to call the doctor the previous night if we could stay in the room until 3.30 as our flight home was not until 7.20 that evening and I was really sick and at this stage my whole jaw had completely swollen.   He was told they would check but they came back to say that ""sorry, they needed the room at 12.30"".   We packed up and left our bags with the concierge and walked out for an hour to pass the time, however, I was extremely sick we had to return to the hotel.   We sat in the lounge for 2 hours, while I sipped on a bottle of water to pass the time before going to the airport.   I have to say that this thoughtlessness let the hotel down completely!  My husband and I are not people to complain but I had to write this review as I was really upset about the whole thing.   The hotel isn't cheap by any means but we had picked it because of the great reviews.   We were let down badly.  It was awful being so sick on a week end away that we had looked forward to but for the reception staff to refuse an extra few hours in a room was the last straw.   In all honesty I couldn't recommend this hotel.",4,2010,06,29
105,"Faultless, glamorous, luxury hotel ... you won't be disappointed.","I was recommended to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair by some English friends who had stayed there, and had their wedding reception there. I found it to be exactly as they said: a five-star luxury hotel, without the impersonal feeling of the large chains, but with all of the glamour. The staff are thoughtful and discreet. The rooms are large (something that is very unusual in London) with excellent inclusions and lovely English furniture (there was even a full stationery kit with stapler, scissors, etc., in one of the drawers ... I've never seen that before). The marble bathroom had fantastic lighting and lots of mirrors (including an illuminated close-up mirror) and there was no flushing noises from any other room at any time, including all night. I had a wonderful room-service meal there one night ... three courses at amazing value (there was enough cheese on the cheese platter for three people). Breakfast in the restaurant was quiet, with a full range to choose from, plus all hot dishes were made to order and weren't sitting dryly in a bain-marie as one now expects. And the location is central to everything one would want to see in London. Hyde Park and the Brompton Road (Harrods) a few minutes in one direction by foot, and Piccadilly (Fortnum & Mason, theatres, Leicester Square, Buckingham Palace, etc.) a few minutes in the other direction. Plus, it's a quiet location in one of the best streets in London. I'll be going back, and am looking forward to it.",5,2010,06,25
105,"A unique friendly, family atmosphere","This is our third time of staying at the Chesterfield, we have tried other luxury hotels in London but this is by far the best. When you enter the  hotel you immediatly get a feeling of friendliness from all the staff, the reception staff are extremely friendly, welcoming and they really do want you to have a good stay. The bar staff are very efficient they even remember what tipple we liked from our stay 3 months before. The rooms are furnished to a very high standard and lovely and clean, the maids are friendly too and always have a smile. The location is excellent a few minutes from Green Park Underground.  There are some nice pubs/eating places in the area, with that local feel but without the spit and sawdust. The food is excellent I can honestly say it is the best breakfast we have ever had in a hotel, the produce is fresh and lots of different dishes for everyones taste.  We have only eaten in the restaurant once, purely because the timings of the shows we go to, but the service and food was excellent we were in a bit of a rush for our show, but the staff did their best to serve up quckly.  So now we opt for the afternoon tea, which is lovely, much better than some of the other well known establishments offering afternoon tea.  The package we go for is the special weekend package/champagne/afternoon tea/deluxe room etc.  Well worth paying the extra,  but having said that the normal rooms are still very good. All this makes our stay at this hotel wonderful but I must say the staff are the ones who bring it all together to make a memorable stay.",5,2010,06,23
105,"Outstanding First Rate staff - lovely dining room and great breakfast, superb location.","We stayed here at end of May in 2010 for the first leg of our honeymoon. The price was very good for this section of London, so not fair to be too picky. 
The dining room and breakfast was outstanding in terms of decor, food and service which could not be better. We also had delightful afternoon tea there one afternoon. I would stay here again if I come back to London. 
The room as others pointed out was extremely small. We had to climb over the bed to get to the dresser area. No where to put anything. However, the bathroom was very nice and luxurious all marble with great shower - two shower heads, sprayer, etc. heated marble floor. The only thing to complain about here (noted the same thing in our Paris hotel bathroom) is that there is only one on off switch for the entire bathroom so no way to only turn on one bathroom light instead of all of them. Also, regarding the room - ours came with a large heavy furry blanket which I had them remove immediately for the duration - i would think this is unsanitary and probably harbors an entire planet of mites or whatever. Also, I would suggest getting a room with a queen bed if you are not really large people - we dont need a king size and next time i would rather have more floor space rather than have the bed take up the entire room.",4,2010,06,21
105,Small but perfectly formed,"Excellent luxury hotel in the heart of London's mayfair area. Very good service levels and superb full English breakfasts, cooked to order. Being right in the centre of town, room sizes are small but bedrooms and bathrooms are very well designed to make up for this. No health spa but guests can use the nearby fitness centre free of charge.",5,2010,06,20
105,Beautiful hotel with friendly  world class service in a great location,"We stayed for 10 days at The Chesterfield Mayfair and loved everything about it! The service was wonderful! Very friendly and helpful.We had a one bedroom suite that was decorated very nicely, more to a man's taste however.It was quiet, very clean with lovely amenities. We had room service a few times and they were prompt well presented and delicious.The hotel was expensive, but I felt it was worth it. Do not miss the high tea in the garden room, lovely!",5,2010,06,19
105,Absolutely Perfect!,"Stayed for 5 nights and our experience couldn't have been better.  The rate seemed a little pricey but, after getting there, it was well worth it.  The room was slightly smaller than some American hotels but it was well appointed and the bed was luxurious.  The full, complimentary breakfast was exquisite.",5,2010,06,19
105,Another wonderful stay,"This our 4Th stay at the chesterfield and i wouldn't book anywhere else. We both look forward to our stay every year the reasons are clear. The hotel although in the centre of London is so peaceful allowing a good nights sleep. The staff are so friendly and go out of there way to make you feel special. The rooms have everything required, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent. We have not had an evening meal but this year my mum was poorly one night so i had room service and was not disappointed it was lovely. We have described this hotel as a home away from home. Would definitely recommend to anybody wanting a special experience at a reasonable price.",5,2010,06,10
105,The 'only' freshly cooked breakfast in town!,"We have stayed at so many 4 and 5 star hotels in London - we go to the theatre a lot and like to stay over - and the Chesterfield is the only hotel we will go back to.  It is a cosy and very pretty hotel, the staff are excellent but the best was the breakfast - actually cooked to order.  The display of cold foods was superb but to have a properly freshly cooked breakfast made the day.  Learn from this you chains of 5 stars!",5,2010,06,09
105,"Charm, comfort and location - this one has it all!","A delightful, thoroughly British hotel. The room was small but well appointed. Staff was terribly kind and helpful, down to the top-hatted doorman whom we would have liked to spirit away to on our next stop, Paris. So accommodating, down to the Starbucks coffee/tea cart in the lobby each morning. Delicious food. In the cozy bar, I was not even bothered to pay more than $24 for a scotch - when it came with a tray of nibbles and great good cheer. Fine scotch, I might add.",5,2010,06,06
105,Charming Old English hotel,"This was a very charming hotel in a great location in Mayfair.  It was close to many restaurants in the Shepherds Market area.   A wonderful staff was very helpful and cheerfully accommodating.   There was a very nice bar in the hotel...a perfect place to relax at the end of the day and after the theatre.  
Room was small but comfortable.   The shower water did splash excessively on the small bathroom floor...we mopped it up each time.    The room faced the back...no view to speak of but quiet.    This was the first stop on our month long European trip and our last.   Both times were delightful.  Would highly recommend staying here.",5,2010,06,06
105,Centrally located Gem,"The rooms are small (the only reason 4 stars instead of 5) but beautifully decorated and contain everything necessary. The bathroom has more useful space than in most hotels we have stayed in. The entire hotel—lobby, restaurant, bar—all are beautifully appointed. The food is well prepared and presented. The staff could not be friendlier and the concierge, in particular, is a gem! Check any bags not needed at the lobby desk and the small room will be just fine.",5,2010,06,04
105,Great Experience - Wonderful Staff,"We recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in London for 4 nights in one of their Junior Executive Suites (the African Suite).  We were really impressed by the Chesterfield.  Their staff took great care of us and was there with whatever we needed.  They were really friendly and gave us great directions as to what to see and how to get there. Their location is a very convenient base to see London from.  It is very close to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and Tube stations. We easily walked to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, and Big Ben.  Highlights of our stay were the time we spent in Butler's Restaurant and the Lounge.  The staff and bartenders in both were wonderful to us.  We can't wait to go back!  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,06,03
105,great central place to stay,"less than 100m from green park tube station. great location. nice area, felt safe at night. Sainsbury and M&S over the road.
walking distance to oxford street, knightsbridge and loads of other places.
lovely hotel reception, they allowed us to check in at 11am.
lovely room, lovely bath room. Plenty of storage. however no view from the windows of the room. But when staying in London, you don't spend a lot of time in the room through the day. 
all the staff were great. Breakfast expensive (£15 at the weekend), but really tastie and loads of choice.
only critism, the hair dryer was rubbish!!! and that really it.
would definately stay there again. Great hotel, great weekend stay.",5,2010,06,01
105,Excellent location,"We recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair based on recommendations from this website.  We found it to be everything others were raving about.  Great location!  Fabulous staff, great rooms, quiet, good bed, lovely English breakfast in the morning.
Would definitely stay again, and recommend to friends.",4,2010,06,01
105,WOW. JUST WOW.,This is THE hotel to stay in upon your visit to London.  They really have thought of everything when it comes to fulfilling the needs of the guests.  The service was exceptional... the location.. perfect.. and the beds were the best we have ever slept on!  We will always be staying at this hotel on future visits to London.,5,2010,05,25
105,Home away from Home!,"The hotel accomodations were top quality.  Service was excellent. Personnel were friendly and accommodating.  Restaurant served spectacular food.  Lounge was cozy, hospitable, quiet, piano entertainment, and great assortment of drinks with snacks and light meals available.  We have been here about 5 times for stays of a few days to 16 days this trip.  This is a 5 Star Hotel with quality service.",5,2010,05,24
105,"Cute, Traditional English Hotel","Stayed in this Hotel during my cousins wedding, this is where most guest stayed as the reception was just next door,
I find this hotel cute, but very old. I think it was built in the Tudor times. Breakfast was fantastic. Typical English. Hotel bathroom is very mordern and clean. I find the staff to be extremely helpful. Also, the was free internet. 
The best part of this hotel is the location. Very prime, this is the downtown of London city.
Would recommend for business or couple but not family.",4,2010,05,23
105,Lovely staff and cozy luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"My mother and  I were planning a weekend trip to London and after going through the hotels on tripadvisor, we decided on the Chesterfield Mayfair Weekend Break. We had been to the hotel once before, for Afternoon Tea in the conservatory, and fell in love with the hotel then and there. We were thus extremely excited to spend a weekend at the Chesterfield and arrived with high expectations. 
From the moment we arrived at the hotel, all those expectations were met and even exceeded. Every single member of staff was friendly and helpful, our luggage was carried upstairs and we immediately felt right at home.
The room (on the fifth floor) was absolutely lovely, but it was the little things that made it extra special: the personalised welcome card, cute slippers, flowers, lotion on your pillow...lovely!
The weekend break included Afternoon Tea, which was just as good as we remembered, and was followed by a walk around the neighbourhood. It's truly a wonderful location. 
All in all, we've had the most amazing weekend which was largely due to this gorgeous hotel, its friendly staff and the excellent food that was served. I would recommend the Chesterfield to anyone, especially female travellers as we felt very safe throughout our stay. 
My only regret? I just read that the slippers were complimentary... I would have brought them home with me had I known that... hopefully next time :)",5,2010,05,23
105,Just has to be the best hotel in London by far,"You might be reading this planning your first international vacation, not really sure where to stay, which areas, unaware of the locations etc as was I when i was booking my first vacation overseas.  You're probably on this site trying to find a nice, comfy hotel to stay for all of what you've been saving up to spend on your hotel for this trip. 

Book. This. Hotel. With all my heart I can confidently say, you will love this hotel.

My friend and I stayed in 3 hotels on our first trip to London/Paris. This was the first of the three and it trumped them all. This hotel is right off the Green Park station which has THE most convenient Tube lines to go on, Piccadilly, Victoria, and Jubilee. You could get close to anywhere from our hotel. Easy breezy. 

The moment we walked in the lobby, the concierge put down our bags and gave us a tour of the hotel. The desk staff were SO PATIENT and SO KIND. Great great group of people working there, outstanding and willing to go out of their way to help us on our stay. For example, an electricity converter that my friend bought was faulty and burnt out her hair straightener. The hotel sent up an electricity converter right away and offered her a hair straightener. From Tube directions to even Paris travel tips - I can't stress how phenomenal they were.

The room - was stunning. Absolutely stunning. comfy, cozy, home-y, luxurious, gorgeous. The room service was delish. They even offered free apples in the lobby. Free Wi-Fi in the rooms and free internet on the two computers they had in the basement which was beautifully furnished and a staircase away from the main lobby. I felt completely safe there. 

So internet readers planning your vacation, stop your search right here. As I wear the comfy complimentary slippers I brought home I can't stress to you enough - book this hotel.",5,2010,05,21
105,"Elegant, traditional hotel with superb service!","We had planned our return to The Chesterfield for six years since our first visit in 2004. We loved it then and had great memories and had followed the reviews since then - our expectations were therefore very high - we were not at all disappointed. 
We spent four wonderful nights at this little gem in Mayfair. After lots of research we chose The Music Room which used to be classed as a suite but because of it's size( not huge) has been reclassed as a Superior. It was absolutely delightful - Gorgeous 4-post bed - amazing bath in shape of cello - music notes and music memorabilia around the walls - very quaint and interesting. Everything you could want in the room - LCD TV, free internet, mineral water, wonderful bed and pillows , magazines to read , lovely toiletries etc etc. 
The breakfast was fantastic - beautiful menu choice plus a buffet of wonderful goodies - fruit, yogurt, cheeses, warm pastries etc. Dinner also wonderful - loved the Sunday roast - waiter came with elegant trolley and carved & served at our table - amazing!
As for the staff - they are as good as everyone says - they make you feel so, so special - nothing is too much trouble. 
 The special deal we stayed on was fantastic value as well - Mayfair weekend - which included breakfast, bottle of champagne in you room and best of all the wonderful Chesterfield Afternoon Tea! This was so amazing - beautiful scones, sandwiches and cakes and the most amazing array of teas ( coffee also). Also it didn't end there as the wonderful waiter kept coming over asking what else you would like - I said I loved the little round chicken sandwiches and he then came back with a plate of them for me - WOW!
 Since our visit six years ago this has been our favourite hotel and absolutely still is - worth going to London for. Unfortunately it's a bit far from Australia! We do hope to return some day to the wonderful Chesterfield Mayfair!",5,2010,05,21
105,Small but all you need,"My friend and I stayed her for 2 nights from Friday 7th May, on the week-end package.  The doormen and porters are all very friendly.  The room although a little old fashioned (I prefer modern), it had everything we needed.  The beds are so comfortable, and the room very quiet apart from someone next door having their TV blaring at 7.00am on a Sunday morning. It was a really cold week-end, but you have the air conditioning in the room so could turn it up to warm the room up when we came in of an evening.  The breakfasts were superb, the best porridge we have EVER tasted.  Every thing you could possibly want for a breakfast including fresh made smoothies, which I love, set you up for the day.

We took the tube directly from Heathrow to Green Park (no changing), (roughly 45 mins)and then it is only a 5 minute walk to the hotel.  You are right in the heart of the city and it is only a 20 minute walk to Harrods.  

The hotel has some nice little touches, which we all like.  In the dining room there are jars of sweets (the old kind), white chocolate mice, aniseed balls, shrimps, black jacks, fruit salad etc, and you can help yourself.  Not that you want sweets after your breakfast, but I put them in the pocket of my jacket and forgot about them until well into the afternoon, and then you have a little sweet to eat.  On our second evening when we came in, a little bottle of foot cream was set on our pillow. very nice touches.

Afternoon tea in the conservatory was wonderful, nice sandwiches, home made hot scones and lovely cakes. 

There is FREE internet access in the basement and you can also check in for your flight and print your boarding pass.

All in all a lovely hotel right in the heart of London, I will certainly go back.",5,2010,05,16
105,"Just perfect, friendly and great location","Looked on trip adviser before we booked for a top hotel in mayfair and this came up and looking at the reviews we decided to book, well every one was right it was just perfect and the staff are the friendliest of any place we have stayed.
you will not be disapointed if you book this small hotel and if you book the breakfast, well it was fantastic, i must stop praising this place else you all will think i have been payed to say this, but its all true!",5,2010,05,12
105,Charming boutique hotel. Staff went out of their way to help us.,"My son and I stayed at the Chesterfield in February and enjoyed an amazing three night stay! We flew to London for a movie premier and due to a flight cancellation arrived a bit frantic. The staff went out of their way to meet our last minute needs. The staff is truly amazing, but the hotel itself was a pleasure. Our room was large, comfortable and appointed in the classic english style. Located within a quiet residential area it is a short walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and the surrounding shopping areas. The theater district and excellent restaurants are a short cab ride away.
We will definitely be back!",5,2010,05,12
105,An excellent stay at the Chesterfield,"As soon as you walk through the door of the Chesterfield it is like coming home, all the staff are very freindly & helpful. The breakfasts are freshly cooked & you have an excellent choice.
The hotel is in an excellent location for shops, theatres & attractions.",5,2010,05,11
105,A wonderful birthday treat!,"This was a treat for my 40th birthday from hubby and within a nano second of the taxi pulling up outside the hotel, the door was openend by a very friendly doorman and our bags were out.  A helping hand was offered and we were inside instantly.  Very warm welcome as soon as we were inside with professional but friendly reception staff. Not sruffy at all.  Very luxurious, old fashioned feel to the hotel. The hotel room was very nice - not overly large - but wonderfully furnished and the most comfy bed I've experienced in a hotel for as long as I can remember.
The location of the hotel is wonderful for access to the parks and also Picadilly.  Very quiet area, very clean.  check out an area nearby called Shepherds Market - very quaint, typically english area with a village like feel - great local pubs and cafes. would definately recommend this place and would stay here again.",4,2010,05,10
105,Excellent stay,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times on business in London and found it to be excellent. 
It is also an excellent choice for a non-business stay.  It is a very, very well run hotel. The service is excellent and friendly.
The breakfasts are superb.
It is remarkably intimate hotel in a great location.",4,2010,05,09
105,It's all true,"Overly enthusiastic reviews of any hotel put me on guard, but as they apply to the location, staff, and amenities of The Chesterfield Mayfair -- it's all true. The staff and management seem eager to find ways to make you happy. Manager Oliver Raggett could not have been more receptive to our requests and needs, Amy at the front desk found us a fine room with a view (to the extent possible in central London) and Darren, the concierge, saved our bacon in a medical min-emergency. A superb hotel in every way, Don't  bother looking elsewhere if The Chesterfield Mayfair fits your budget category (it didn't ours, but they made it work!).",5,2010,05,08
105,Outstanding hotel in every possible way!,"My friend and i have an annual weekend break in London and have stayed in many hotels but nothing has compared to The Chesterfield! Everything was class-booking,service,staff,room,breakfast,ambience.Just perfect. A very nice personalised letter from the manager thanking me for my completed questionnaire was a nice touch.We shall always stay there and in fact my husband and i have booked to stay at the Chesterfield for our ruby wedding anniversary in December.",5,2010,04,29
105,The most charming and relaxing hotel in London,"The hotel is a very good well kept secret. Upon arrival your bags are taken of you and after check in you are shown around the hotel and evrything is explained. You are instantly made to feel at home. Once in your room you can see how well apointed it is with all the little extra touches that you may take for granted. Attention to detail is everything and i think they have got this spot on. Nothing is ever too much trouble. The dining room is excellent and the waiters are friendly and very polite. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced as are the rooms. We had a Champagne weekend which included a bottle of Champagen in your room when you wanted it and a free afternoon tea, probably the best afternoon tea in London and we have tried quite a few. 
All in all i do not think you could find a better hotel, if you like shopping it is in easy reach of Oxford street and Piccadilly and for shows it is in easy reach of the West end, just a 30 minute steady walk.",5,2010,04,28
105,An oasis of quiet near Piccadilly,"We enjoyed staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair very much. It was quiet but not austere; the staff was very friendly and the service at the restaurant was excellent, as was the food.

We liked the location very much; accessible to other things but removed by a few short blocks  from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly. Exactly what a hotel in a large city should be. The Chesterfield website is excellent and is very helpful in planning your visit, as it includes much information on London places of interest within walking distance of the hotel.

We stayed as part of a package with the Royal Academy which is near the hotel. Also, on Half Moon Street, within two blocks of the hotel, is an excellent Japanese restaurant, Kiku.",5,2010,04,27
105,Amazing hotel and exceptional staff made our trip so special,"From the moment our taxi arrived, we were so impressed by the Chesterfield.  The staff are completely amazing, extremely friendly and helpful, without being in your face.  The breakfast was delicious and we are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2010,04,25
105,Planning to make this our London hotel,"We travel to London frequently (we used to live there) and on each trip tried a different hotel in Mayfair.  Now that we have tried the Chesterfield, we will make it our hotel for future stays.  We gota good deal (190GBP) on the hotel's website, and we knew the location was ideal -- close to tourist activities, and Greek Park tube has the most connections of all.

OK, the rooms are small.  And the place is very British (even grey pin-striped flannel walls in our room).  But that's part of being in another country, to soak up the culture.

The staff is outstanding.  When we checked in, the clerk told us our room came with complimentary buffet breakfast.  We hadn't thought so, but went down to breakfast the next day.  After our meal, we were told it was not complimentary.  We complained to management.  Not only did they credit that charge; they added complimentary breakfast to our room for no extra charge.  I don't think there are many hotels that would be so accommmodating to first-time customers in the smallest room, at a discount rate.  We were impressed.

BTW, if you book a room that does not include breakfast, no worries.  Take a quick walk to lovely Berkeley Square and dine at E.A.T. or Pret a Manger.",4,2010,04,23
105,excellent hotel with very good value,"Very good hotel!  the situation is wonderful, near  the tube. On a very quiet  and lovely street: no noise!! Service is perfect! Staff very kind and professional.
Room not enormous, but very good furnished, and perfect clean! Bar, breakfast very good.
Value very very good!!
I warmly recommend this hotel!!",5,2010,04,19
105,"great location, wonderul service","Lovely hotel in convenient location, walking distance to everything. Comfortable, attentive service",5,2010,04,14
105,"A gem in all respects, with service second to none","My wife and I and three children has a wonderful stay at The Chesterfield during Easter. I travel a lot but I very rarely experience the level of service and attention to detail that we see at The Chesterfield. This being our fifth stay our expectations were high but we were not disappointed; throughout the hotel we experienced the same courteous, discrete and high-quality service that really made us feel special.

The dinner, the breakfasts and the afternoon teas we had were all superb, both for food quality, service and ambience. The rooms are comfortable, quiet and well-appointed; the free internet access being a welcome addition from last time we stayed.

The location is excellent - close to Shepherds Market, Piccadilly and Hyde Park, less than 10 minutes walk from Green Park metro station, 5 minutes taxi to Knightsbridge.

The Chesterfield is our 'home from home' in London and we are never disappointed.",5,2010,04,14
105,felt like a 5 Star hotel,My daughter and I recently visited London and found the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel to be more than we expected.  The service was the best we received any where...they responded promptly and courteously to any request we made.  The room was spectacular...comfy and clean.  The robes were of course a nice touch.  The restaurant had the best service and food we experienced on our trip.  A marvelous selection and presentation at every meal.,5,2010,04,08
105,"I am a convert. Style, location, service and good rates in the world's best city.","As an American who spent 6 1/2 years in Central London before reluctantly returning to the States, I was dubious when a French friend told me she had found a wonderful hotel in Mayfair where I could walk to West End theater, great restaurants and galleries, and avoid the constant tube problems or overcrowded buses. Since we were celebrating her birthday, I agreed to abandon my creaky favorite hotel on Sloane Street to try The Chesterfield, and I will go back again in June.  My small room was beautifully appointed with stylish and modern furnishings (faux fur throw, lovely linens), I had a lovely (and occasionally sunny) view over the rooftops of Mayfair, the English buffet breakfast was the best I've ever had at a hotel , and the service was efficient and good humored.  To be a half block from Berkeley Square was fantastic. I just hope too many people don't try to book it in June when I hope to stay there again.  A great find I recommend enthusiastically and am again bested by my French friend who knows everything I do not. Oh yes, don't miss the high tea with incredible chocolate tarts, scones and brioche. It came free with our room.",5,2010,04,05
105,"Ideal location, traditional elegance, great front desk service","We visited London for two short days on our way to a wedding in Cambridge and were looking for great location as well as comfort for our jet-lagged bodies.  Chesterfield Mayfair exceeded expectations in many ways.  It's located in Mayfair, which is an ideal location for dining, strolling, shopping, walking to Harrod's in Knightsbridge, taking a long walk in Hyde Park (we walked all the way through it to the foot of Portobello Road), walking to Picadilly Circus, jumping on the tube (3 blocks), and even catching an independent movie (where you can enjoy a glass of wine with international cinema titles that you won't see in the U.S.).  We did all of that in our two day stay, and more.  The hotel is all old-world charm, traditionally appointed.  Our room was large enough to accommodate the king sized bed and a comfortable chair; the bathroom was best suited for one at a time but clean, well lit and well stocked with fluffy towels and robes.  It met our needs but Chris, at the front desk, did far more.  Not wanting to commit to the cost of a West End show, I had read about the small cabaret at Pizza on the Park in Knight's Bridge.  Chris was familiar with it and we thoroughly enjoyed the reasonably-priced entertainment of Shoo Shoo Baby in the elegant downstairs cabaret.  Chris lined it all up for us and provided easy walking directions.  He later assisted with a host of other requests, including best underground lines and stations to get to destinations.  We appreciated the quiet; the Chesterfield Mayfair is on a small street and doesn't get the noise of nearby Knightsbridge, West End or Picadilly.  Only downside:  the late night bar menu was uninspired.  The chicken sandwich was bread, chicken and a little mayo.  The hotel doesn't have a gym but we didn't miss it with all of the opportunities for great walking nearby.",5,2010,04,01
105,A Wonderful Experience,"The service is gracious and intimate from the arrival to departure.  The room is comfortable with all the necessities including twice daily maid service, deluxe toiletries, plush bathrobes and complimentary bottled water, tea and coffee making facilities and treats left each evening with the turndown of the bed.The location is perfect in the Mayfair section close to parks, palaces and wonderful restaurants.  It is close to the tube station at Green Park and makes getting around very easy.  This was our fifth trip to the Chesterfield and the staff has always recognized us.  The breakfasts  include both menu options or a wonderful buffet. The Terrace Bar and Conservatory lend a wonderful experience to any meal.  The staff is most welcoming.  Wouldn't think of any other place to stay in London.",5,2010,03,29
105,Wow!,"We stayed in the Chesterfield to celebrate the final part of my wifes Birthday, staying over night and going to the Theatre the following day to see the Jersey boys (superb).
The Hotel. Absolutely excellent, had a real feeling of luxury and the staff obviously love working there and are so professional. I had put on the booking form the reason for our stay and during Saturday my wife recieved a Birthday card hand written with messges from all the staff, its things like that, that make one hotel stand out from another.
The food. We ate in the restaurant Saturday evening and while it was quite expensive (remember you are in Mayfair) it was really good food with top notch service. Breakfast was good as well.
The location. We haven't expored Mayfair before and had a nice quiet (Yes in London) walk Saturday evening around the tiny streets. Sunday after breakfast walked around a lovely area close to the hotel called Shepherd market with small bars and cafe's, we really enjoyed it.
Overall. This hotel is a credit to London, and speaking of London those of us who are lucky enough to live here, we should do more walking and discovering as there are some fantastic hidden jems!",5,2010,03,27
105,Best hotel of my life!,"I have been lucky enough to stay in many wonderful and exclusive hotels and this was the best.  When we arrived the service was fantastic with helpful and friendly staff.  We had a beautiful room with IPOD speakers, a huge bed, a jacuzzi in the bath and a wonderful view of London.  The hotel treated us to champagne and canapes and gave us helpful advice for anything we needed.  The silent night, comfy bed and breakfast in the morning all added to the stay.  The location was great and if it hadn't been for the rain we were going to have a walk in Green Park on the Sunday.  I didn't want to leave in the morning!  I can highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning.",5,2010,03,25
105,Perfect,"I chose this hotel based on the reviews here at Tripadvisor. It's an incredible hotel. It's really well located, in a quiet area but near Piccadilly Circus. The decoration is beautiful, but by no means modern - it's an antique style, wich I loved. We made the reservation at the hotel website so as not to have any problems. We arrived at 5pm (after a lot of trouble with our flight) and we rushed to the room, wich was very nice, but didn't have a tub as we expected. We phoned the reception and asked if they had a bigger room with a bathtub and they promptly arranged us a wonderful room, bigger than the other and with a bathtub, as we asked, without any additional charges. The room is filled with some amenities such as women's magazines, iPod charger, pressing iron and so on. The staff was really nice, with no exception. We stayed for 10 nights and haven't had any problem. I just can't say anything about the breakfast as we chose not to have ours at the hotel. I don't think I would do it again; it was really difficult to have a decent breakfast in London - the traditional english breakfast consists mainly in bacon, eggs and things like beans and tomatoes, wich is really weird for us brazilians who eat mainly fruit and bread at breakfast. Also, about the afternoon tea, we chose not to have one at the Chesterfield, but at another very fancy hotel near Bond Street. It was really expensive and I hated it - greasy sweets and poor sandwiches - so I guess many hotel afternoon teas are bad even if the hotel is good. 
Anyway, I reccomend the Chesterfield to anyone who wants to have comfort staying at London.",5,2010,03,24
105,Very pleasant stay at the Chesterfield,"Pleasantly surprised at my recent stay at this hotel.  Booked by a friend who we met at the hotel, I had not received any more info rather than the price, and I have to say ,this hotel provided value for money.
Breakfast was great, and the buffet element was very good indeed.  I like the idea of ordering your hot breakfast element, rather than selecting from a hot buffet, so found this service great at the Chesterfield.  Very good choice, well presented.
Room was fine, maybe a touch on the small side, but perfectly adequate, after all, you are in London and how much time are you going to spend in it??  Comfy bed, good shower and all the basics covered.
Service was very good, with nothing seeming like a trouble to the team.  We had a Afternoon Tea included in our package, and when I asked the waiter if we could bring down the complimentary champagne from the room, he advised it was no problem, and then promptly changed our warm bottle for a chilled one.  Good stuff.  Afternoon tea was very good, and dont panic when they bring only one tray of goodies out for four of you, they do replenish them!!!
Only negative comment would be the Surly check out, early on Sun morning.  It was early, but surely the Night Manager is used to this hour of the day, and could manage a thank you and a smile.  
Other than that, great stay, and loved the sweets at the entrance to the restaurant.  Forgotten how good ""Fruit Salad"" sweets were!",4,2010,03,22
105,Not great unless you are very short!,"Looks great on their website but expect a reality check when you arrive (I was dissapointed).  I booked a superior double and was amazed how small the bathroom was esp the shower over the bath - the fixed head shower rose is so low you cannot stand under it!

As its fixed head it comes down from the ceiling rather than off the wall on to your shoulders so unless you're very short you have to shower whilst bending your knees!!

I was shown another room which had exactly the same problem before being upgraded (superior king) where they had fixed the problem by building the shower head into the ceiling (although this was leaking).

They wanted to charge me for the upgrade until I had to ask for the manager...

When you book a hotel you expect to be able to stand and have a shower - basics!

Also noisy and fussy decor but that’s a personal taste thing.",1,2010,03,22
105,"Aside from a couple of small issues, we enjoyed our stay...","This review is a little late, but better late than never....

We spent a week at the Chesterfield Mayfair in October 2009 and enjoyed our stay.  We had booked a Superior Room and specifically asked that it be located in a quiet area.   That night we heard odd sounds, like someone dragging furniture, but it wasn't constant and there were no meeting rooms around us, so we decided to ignore this and press on.

The next night - sure thing - furniture moving again... long story short was we determined that one area of our room (307) backed onto the elevator... and this was what was likely causing the noise (cables and doors opening/closing)... so we approached the front desk and mentioned this - they didn't seem that 'surprised' by this and arranged to have us moved to another room (206)...

No odd noises in the new room... but... at 3am we were awoken by the noise of people partying in the next room... a call to the front desk seemed to get this resolved in about 15 minutes... and then about an hour later... we were awoken again... but this time due to a definitely different activity next door... this passed after a while...

The final five nights were great... quiet!!!

The service at the hotel is very good.  Everyone greets you and says hello, people recognize you after a couple of days and inquire as to how you are enjoying your stay/visit, etc.  Although we only ate dinner at Butler's Restaurant once during our stay, the meal and service were excellent.  

As to our reservation, after deciding on the Chesterfield Mayfair (thx to TA), we checked out their website and noted the variety of special offers... after exchanging notes with them a few times, we were able to combine a series of offers for our one week stay... one theatre night, Mayfair weekend, and another special that I can't recall...  By the way, if you are going to stay here, I highly recommend that you book a package that includes a full English breakfast... nice way to start the day, good value and excellent choices.

All in all, we really liked the Chesterfield Mayfair... their staff are great and it's central to everything... you really aren't more than a few blocks from most places which makes London suprisingly walkable... but if you need transportation - taxis and the tube are close by.  When our travels take us back to London, we'll defnitely want to go back to the Chesterfield Mayfair.",4,2010,03,20
105,Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield,"We stayed for a weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair in February to celebrate my husband’s 50th birthday.

We flew in to London City airport and the chauffeured car was there as the hotel promised, which was a lovely surprise for my husband.

As we arrived at 10am, I had asked in advance if there was a chance of having our room ready early, but I was doubtful. The Chesterfield didn’t disappoint! We were taken straight up.  

The Superior King had lovely decor, a great shower/bath and plenty of room for clothes etc. A bottle of champagne with a personalised card was waiting. In addition, the nicest touch of all was that the staff had personally signed a birthday card for my husband.

We had drinks in the relaxing bar each evening, which were reasonably priced for a London hotel, and came with a variety of nibbles (free of charge!)

The English breakfast was simply one of the best I’ve ever had. The breakfast room was absolutely stunning, as was the breakfast. A huge variety of choice and the English breakfast was hot, fresh, and delicious. They even had marmite (my husband’s favourite!)

On the Sunday, we had the Traditional Afternoon tea. Sublime! Lots of little sandwiches, cakes and scones, along with a large pot of tea. All served in the lovely light conservatory.

We had late check out which was great, as our flight didn’t leave until 7pm Sunday evening.

It’s in a great location, minutes from the tubes and in a very quiet street.
All the staff were very friendly and approachable which made such a difference.

The only little down sides were:-
1) Room got far too hot, and although we turned the air con down as far as it would go, the cleaning staff kept turning it up!
2) We were locked out on our last day, as they’d forgotten to reprogramme our key.
3) Our King size double was actually 2 single pushed together.

Having said that, we’d go back again without hesitation (and will!)",4,2010,03,19
105,Wonderful Stay,My friend and I stayed at the Chesterfield in February 2010. What a pleasure the staff were so helpful and the room very comfortable.  Would not hesitate to stay again.,5,2010,03,18
105,Service above & beyond,"This was our second stay at the Chesterfield when we traveled to London for my 50th birthday. On arrival we were checked in quickly and efficiently, and greeted warmly with ""Welcome Back"".. I know it was on the data base but stuff like that matters. We are asked the purpose of our stay and offered help if we needed to get tickets for shows or table bookings , and when my wife mentioned it was a birthday treat the concierge wished me many happy returns, pleasant I thought but nothing more. Imagine my surprise and delight when we returned to our room after dinner to find a card signed by all the staff on duty. It didn't have to be done, but it makes such a difference. That set the tone for the weekend, Nothing was too much trouble, no request too big or too trivial, all done with a genuine smile and professionalism.
I have to commend both the concierge, Chris, and the doorman, Eric, who's weather forecasts are more accurate than the met office or the BBC, but really it's unfair to praise any individual as all the staff were great.
The rooms are a tad small by many other city standards, but this is Mayfair, and it's not a cheap place to stay, BUT value is terrific.
Its  handy for exploring the sights on foot with Green Park & Buckingham Palace a short stroll away,and the tube station is also very convenient, as is Knightsbridge with the shops and people watching.
The pubs & restaurants in Shepherds market are worth a visit and  offer decent value (For West London) food and  drink.
So for a discrete, almost private home feeling with superb service this is the place. I will be back very soon",5,2010,03,18
105,Very small quibbles put right by excellent customer service,"We booked a ""Mayfair Weekend"" package over Valentines weekend, which includes champagne, afternoon tea, breakfast and late checkout. Choice of hotel was down to reading tripadvisor reviews. It is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair, close enough to Piccadilly for easy access to restaurants, shops etc, but also out of the way enough to be a quiet hotel.
The room I had e-mailed to request the previous week was waiting for us on arrival and was exactly as expected. Breakfast was great, afternoon tea was great, the champagne much appreciated. 
A few days after we left, we received an e-mail from the management checking everything was fine with our stay (how often does that happen...?!) and I wrote back saying that generally everything had been excellent but a couple of little details hadn't been completely 100% - eg. king bed was 2 singles put together without the necessary overlay to make it more comfortable. We immediately received a reply detailing what must have gone wrong an offering an upgrade to a junior suite on a future booking ""to restore our faith in the hotel"".. I have since booked this and look forward to taking them up on it in October, 
I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel!",5,2010,03,14
105,Luxury tucked away in Mayfair,"This was our first stay at the Chesterfield, although we have been guests at two other hotels within the Red Carnation Group.

We chose this hotel as it was a partner with the Royal Academy of Arts and offered a package which included tickets to the Van Gogh exhibition (which we can thoroughly recommend).

The hotel is just off Berkeley Sq and conveniently located to Picadilly via Shepherds Market.   Our room was relatively small buy well appointed in traditional dark wooden furtniture.  The bed was exquisite and we did not hear any noise from other rooms - I am a light sleeper and had two restful nights.

We only used the restaurant for breakfast which was a silver service affair with all hot food cooked to order.

The staff are extremely professional, courteous and knowledgable.

I would highly recommend this hotel and intend to return.

(For what it's worth, we had a great meal across the road in a gastropub called the Only Running Footman - google it!)",5,2010,03,09
105,Very helpful and caring staff,"Good hotel, good location, and yes the staff really are as helpful as all the other reviews have said. We were upgraded to a junior suite for a small extra charge, the room was not very big and it was decorated well but all the wooden furniture was very dated and scratched, and the bathroom was very dated. Everything was very clean, all toiletries replaced every day even if they were only half used  and piles of big fluffy towels - which made lovely change from normal hotel policy of one per person. the little touches make the difference in this hotel, big piles of apples everywhere - just help yourself.  Our room had a large stack of nice magazines, an umbrella and drawer with sellotape etc. they really do try and think of everything.",4,2010,03,06
105,Very special,"We somewhat took there breath away arriving on motorcycles in a rush and very stressed the staff however after there initial gasps looked after us superbly well. The hotel location is excellent the rooms with there theme brilliant and staff professional. A lovely venue for any break, it does not get much better than this.",5,2010,03,05
105,CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR A WONDERFUL LONDON EXPERIENCE,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff could not do enough and the breakfasts were enjoyable. The hotel location was close to the piccadilly shopping area which includes Fortnum & Mason. My wife and I had our first high tea at the Chesterfield Mayfair and were quite impressed.,5,2010,03,02
105,An oasis of tranquillity,I stayed here one night on a business trip. Could not find fault would highly recommend this sophisticated yet relaxed hotel in centre of Mayfair. I selected a single room (due to budget) but was pleasantly surprised by how well appointed it was. Service was first class and food excellent.,5,2010,03,01
105,I'll Stay Here Again.,"I was booked into The Chesterfield Mayfair by my client for my Jan. 2010 business trip to London.  I was very pleased with the staff and accomodations.  Mayfair is a great part of the city, and you can see a lot of the city by walking.  The room was quiet and clean.  It was on the ""small"" side, but I think that is to be expected of most London hotels.  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to London",5,2010,02,22
105,Our new home away from home,"The Chesterfield Hotel was an elegant and beautiful hotel, which was also comfortable and relaxing. Nothing was too much trouble for the lovely staff. Our complimentary afternoon tea (which was included in the Christmas special) was delicious, and the fish and chips available from the Terrace Bar (open 24 hours) and room service, were amazing - we'd never had anything like them! Breakfast was always something to look forward to, with a huge variety offered for the continental breakfast, as well as many tasty choices available from the hot breakfast menu. There were always apples or mandarins available by the lifts as well which we enjoyed! 
The room we had was really nice, and we enjoyed the peace and quiet. It was cleaned thoroughly everyday and tidied well, and the bed was turned down every evening. 
The only drawback for us was that the tv channels were a bit limited and we would like to see BBC3 included next time :) 
The free high speed wireless internet was incredibly useful - and something which other hotels charged exhorbitant fees for. 
The location was very good....just a few minutes walk to Oxford Street, where we did a lot of our shopping, and in easy walking distance from many other attractions. 
We have certainly already been recommending the Chesterfield to our friends and we look forward to returning in the near future!",5,2010,02,21
105,first class hotel,"Excellent staff, they try extremely hard to please a guest. Great location; rooms on the smaller side but well decorated. You can't go wrong staying here. We had a wonderful time and hated to leave.",5,2010,02,20
105,How staff can make a difference,"My wife and I have stayed at the Chesterfield on many occasions and are always delighted to return. The rooms. location, food etc are excellent but what marks it out as special for us is the staff. For one thing we see the same faces time after time. They are welcoming and attentive in a friendly and professional way not obsequious as can sometimes be the case . 
The Chesterfield is not  a large hotel and the atmosphere created by the staff makes it into a home from home. It is a delight.",5,2010,02,16
105,"Fantastic location, fantastic room, fantastic hospitality","Having stayed at plenty of London hotels, including some of the more luminous, I was after something a little more personal for a special stay in London with my girlfriend.  After a lot of research settled on the Chesterfield.  Location was key and was perfect for both shopping, eating and show purposes - as well as drinks afterwards.

The staff were hugely accomodating and welcoming and the room (The Grosvenor Suite) was beyond what I was expecting.  Perfectly attired and immaculately clean.

The next morning we awoke to a truly awesome breakfast and left with a very satisfied feeling - I urge others to follow suit and enjoy an special experience.",5,2010,02,10
105,"Perfect, great hotel, great staff","I stayed at The Chesterfield in Jan 2010 as I had a night out planned for my girlfriend's birthday, I've worked in Mayfair for many years and didn't even know this hotel existed until recommended by a friend.  It's central enough to be within 5-10 mins walking distance of most of the west end, but far enough off the beaten track that there is none of the usual London buzz of traffic, people etc.  The rooms are beautifully furnished, everything works, everything is clean (surprising how many hotels get this most basic thing wrong !)  Would highly recommend and will definately stay again.",5,2010,02,03
105,Great location Great Staff,"Have just come back from a weekend stay at the Chesterfield. 
I have stayed in this area a few times but never at the Chesterfield. The staff can't do enough for you, ultra helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is in a great location quite street but not too far from the night life. Would recommend a stay here.",4,2010,01,17
105,Treated like favorite American cousins,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel from Christmas Day until New Year’s Eve, and it was divine!  From the moment we entered the hotel until we departed for the airport, we were treated like favorite American cousins.  There was always someone at the door ready to greet us, no matter what time we returned.  The décor is sumptuous, but unpretentious.  We especially liked the bar, which had cozy nooks for quiet conversation.  The restaurant was beautiful with pale wood, rich red and leopard accents.

Our room was smaller and plainer (grey suiting fabric – no chintz) than expected with a bit too much furniture, but we didn’t complain because we had a great package rate that included breakfast, a welcome drink and the Afternoon Festive Tea.  Be sure to try the mulled wine.  There is no better way to warm up after a winter’s stroll. We are tea lovers, so the afternoon tea gave us a chance to experience new flavors.  I had Dragonlily tea, which is a flower tied with tea leaves.  It “blossoms” when it hits the hot water.  We had a three-tiered tray with sandwiches, cupcakes, tarts, and scones.  We couldn’t eat it all.

I’d say our favorite spot was the dining room.  We ate dinner there three nights and had delicious comfort food such as roast turkey, ham and chicken – each hand carved at our table.  The service was impeccable.  Loris, the restaurant manager, attended to us personally, and we became fast friends.  Bhushan was our waiter, and he did a great job.  

On Christmas Day, we ate lunch at Noura, a Lebanese restaurant located two blocks away, and it was also delightful.  We really weren’t familiar with the cuisine, but that didn’t matter because our waiter made the best suggestions.  We had grilled chicken shish kabobs, salad, hummus, and aubergine (eggplant dip).   We also ate in one of the pubs in Shepherd’s Market.  All the pubs serve the same basic food.  Try the meat pies.  They are delicious, especially on a cold night.  We were even more thrilled to find American football on a big screen upstairs.  

I’d like to point out two free amenities that I thought were quite rare.  There was free Internet access on two computers located at the foot of the stairs.  We greatly appreciated this service since it was too costly to use our iphones in Europe.  And, there was always free bottled water in our room.  

Sadly, I can’t remember everyone’s name, but I wanted to say a special thanks to Loris, Bhushan, Darren, Tony, Eric and Chris.

The Chesterfield Mayfair was the best hotel experience we’ve ever had.  It was the perfect blend of kind attention and quiet discretion.",5,2010,01,17
105,Thoroughly delightful stay. Wouldn't hesitate to go back.,"We stayed for one night on the 18th of December. My wife was attending her company Christmas event, so we decided to stay over and do some shopping in the West End the following day.

We selected the Chesterfield as we wanted to have a little luxury even though we were not going to spend a great deal of time there. We were out in the West End, and wanted to shop in Knightsbridge, so the Chesterfield seemed ideally placed.

The atmosphere and helpfulness of the staff was outstanding. My wife had taken the train with her work colleagues, and I was driving up with the luggage after work for the balance of the fun. There was an accident on the M4 which meant I was an hour late, so arrived at the hotel in a huge rush. Luggage and car were whisked away quickly and efficiently, and I was given the good news that we had been upgraded to a suite!

I was in a much better mood when I arrived at the evening event than I would have been. Later that evening we arrived back, and found a fantastic bedroom awaiting us. It had an African them, and my wife was really happy, as she has a special fondness for that continent.

The cleanliness and presentation of the room was impeccable and the bed was so comfortable we need to go back and find out the make as we want one!

In the morning, we had a delicious breakfast and were made to feel very welcome.

All in all it was perfect. We wanted a little taste of luxury and got exactly what we hoped for.",5,2010,01,17
105,Great Hotel,"I stayed here in Dec 09 with my husband and 8 year old son.  The staff are marvelous and nothing is too much trouble.  There were not many children at the hotel but the staff were fabulous with our son.
The rooms are lovely and the location of the hotel couldn't be better for getting around tourist attractions.
Would recomend this hotel to anybody.",5,2010,01,10
105,Great Hotel,"Stunning Hotel in top location, can not really fault it. Breakfast in the morning was first class, hotel staff not as eager to help as they seem to be for the arab staying guests. But that apart was a great time had.",4,2010,01,04
105,Boutique hotel with quiet luxury,"The hotel is in a great neighborhood near Green Park and a brief walk to the tube. Our room was wonderful -- large and very very comfortable with all the amenities. The hotel was immaculate and the staff were the most attentive I have experienced. All in all, a wonderful place to stay. It wasn't the cheapest place to stay in London, but far from the costliest and I can't imagine a better stay. One tip if you're on a budget -- get a rate that includes breakfast if you want it -- the restaurant breakfast is quite expensive otherwise.",5,2010,01,01
105,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Excellent hotel and wonderfull staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair!  My girlfriend and I planned a ""girls only"" weekend in London and I choose the Chesterfield because of the excellent reviews at Trip Advisor.  It couldn't have been better!  
Location is great!  Walking distance to all the shopping; we felt very safe walking places during the evening; taxis are always available too.
The hotel and rooms have a very nice, ""English"" feel.  Beds are very comfy; nice bathroom too.   We had the English Breakfast: one can choose from the buffet and can order hot breakfast from the card.  Very pleasant restaurant.
The staff is great!  They are all extremely welcoming!  And very helpful! With everything!  Afternoon Tea is delicious too!
We tried to book a table at the Murano Restaurant (which is just around the corner from the hotel!); unfortunately there was no table available. If you want to eat at this well-known restaurant, it is recommanded to book a table well in advance.  Shepherd's Market is also nearby and lots of little restaurants there too.  
We had a wonderful time and I will definitely book at the Chesterfield Mayfair again!",5,2009,12,24
105,Just perfect,"Having stayed at many 4 & 5 star hotels in London this has to rate as the best.  The service is excellent and the staff fantastic, all very grand without feeling stuffy and made you feel instantly welcome.  The beds and linen are so comfortable too.The location is great, giving easy access on foot to Hyde Park, Piccadilly and Oxford Street aswell as many more attractions.  Breakfast was 5 star and I can recommend the Afternoon Tea.  I have paid far more for far less in London and the area is really nice.  Try booking the weekend specials as they have perks and a very useful checkout time of 6pm.",5,2009,12,21
105,Afternoon Tea. What A Let Down,"After reading the reviews on Afternoon Tea at the Chesterfield decided to book our treat.
What a complete let down.  We was placed in the library along with two business men
discussing their business plan.  The room had a really bad feel to the place, no ambience
what so ever. The sandwiches was very mediocre, 2 fruit tarts and fairy cakes (supposedly
cup cakes) they could have been made by a 10 year old they had a dollop of white icing
with another dollop of green icing meaning to be a Xmas tree, 3 little scones. Our tea was not even served in china tea cups but iron stone cups and saucers, same as the tea pot  the cake stand looked as if it had seen better days..  For all of that we paid the 
sum of  £53, my husband gave the waiter £60 to which he replied 'do you want the change'
We normally go to Harrods for a beautiful afternoon treat, which is superb.
I would never go to the Chesterfield Hotel again, we also would never recommend  to our friends.",1,2009,12,20
105,London's finest and friendliest hotel,"I have just returned from a trip to London, and cannot recommend the Chesterfied Mayfair highly enough. The staff are superb, friendly, as well as extremely profession in their work. I just wish all hotels were this good, and I have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels. The small things like ALL the staff remembering your name, from the front desk to the restaurant staff, and the place is immaculate. They made my trip memorable, and as far as I am concerned, the Chesterfied Mayfair is my London Hotel from now onwards.",5,2009,12,17
105,Highly recommend,Stayed at the Chesterfield in early November.   Great hotel in a handy location.  Staff were very helpful.  We arrived early but this was not a problem.  Breakfast is first-rate and could also recommend the afternoon tea.   Would certainly visit again when in London.,5,2009,12,16
105,Excellent Old British Hotel,"I could not say enough about the treatment given us during our stay at this hotel.  The staff could not do enough for us, from ensuring a reservation for ""high tea"" @ Harrod's to making sure we never missed any part of Lomdon that we wanted to see.  Very ""old British"" and wonderful.  I highly reocmmend this establishment.",5,2009,12,10
105,Excellent Hotel in Mayfair.,"We have just returned from a fantastic weekend break at the Chesterfield, Mayfair.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and full of character in the heart of Mayfair.  All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome.  On arrival we were upgraded to a Suite, which was amazing.  The suite had two bathrooms, one with a shower and the other with the bath.  A huge king size bed, a sofa area, table and chairs, mini-bar, tea/coffee facilities, all luxury toiletries, slippers, towels, dressing gown, iron, ironing board, shoe shine, safe and lots of extras.  We came home on our first evening in London to find mince pies placed beside our bed and the beds turned down.  There were soo many lovely touches from the Chesterfield and they made us feel very special.  The hotel is great for a romantic weekend away, especially if you have a suite.  We have previously stayed in another hotel is Mayfair which is slightly closer to Oxford Street but it did not come close to how we were treated at the Chesterfield and how beautiful this hotel was. The hotel is walking distance to Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street.  The weekend we were there 5/12/09 which was VIP Day, this is where Oxford Street and Regent Street are closed to buses and taxis and it is pedestrians only all day, apparently the dates each year for this day can change.   There was street entertainment  and lots going on and it was a real christmas feel.  We went to The Punchbowl Pub, which is owned by Guy Ritchie, this is just around the corner from the Chesterfield and is a real London pub with a great atmosphere.  We spent time in the Hotel bar which was very relaxed and again remarkable staff.  We wished we had stayed for another night but we will definitely return next year and this time stay for longer.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend away.",5,2009,12,09
105,A perfect retreat with excellent staff and facilities,"I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair on 24th November as I was visiting London on a business trip along with a colleague. The hotel is excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful or attentive. We entertained clients in The Terrace Bar and the setting could not have been more perfect since a pianist played throughout the evening and he was great! We then dined in The Butler's restaurant - both food, wine and service were second-to-none. On the whole, a very pleasant stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone/everyone! I will certainly stay again in the future.",5,2009,12,08
105,Wonderful Hotel Experience,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 6 nights, with an overnight to Paris in between.  We stayed in two junior suites--the Garden and Dartmouth--with their 3 nights for two suite offer.  Both suites were very comfortable, but small by american standards, which we understand to be the case throughout London and Europe in general.  The rooms were clean and the bathrooms quite up to date, clean and with more size than expected.

The service at this hotel is what sets it apart from our other travel experiences.  They were over the top helpful and hospitable in that proper British way.  From the front desk, to the concierge, to the waiters at the restaurant, the bar tenders and the door men--all could not be nicer, more helpful or polite.  They made our stay an unforgettable experience and we will certainly return.

The restaurant was very nice and the breakfasts had lots of choices.  The location in Mayfair as also great, and close to Green Park tube station, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and much more.  

So here's a thumbs up from someone with more than one post on TA.",5,2009,12,07
105,Perfect for a small conference!,Have been to The Chesterfield Mayfair many times privately and always been very happy. Went there now with some colleagues for a short conference. Everything worked exactly as planned due to the fantastic work of the Event Manager. The conservatory was a nice place to be (but it was a bit cold). Breakfast and lunch was excellent!,5,2009,12,07
105,"A wonderful, relaxing visit.","The staff in this hotel do everything possible to make your stay enjoyable. They are always ready to assist, the concierge, reception and restaurant staff  are friendly and totally professional.

The afternnoon tea was a particular joy!  We enjoyed it immensely and  were also given the receipe for the delicious scones when we remarked on the high qulaity.

Breakfast is excellent with a good choice.

The rooms are small but very well equipped.

We will always return to the Chesterfield when we are in London.",5,2009,12,03
105,A home away from home,"Upon arrival at the Chesterfield Mayfair, we were met with a warm welcome, a personalised service, a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Style, good taste and refinement, in the foyer, the dining room and bar, the halls, the room. Within walking distance of central destinations in busy London, yet nested on a quiet street in the 'village' of Mayfair.  A home away from home, of which there are only few in large cities.

105,might be god for you! but not for me!,"it was such a lovely hotel with an amazing view and location. 
but the disappointment start at the stay,... where your breakfast room service waitress is pathetic. she doesnt speak english correctly.. was not even able to take my order properly. and has attitude. i was supposed to go early  with my tummy full but was not able to .... other staff was ok. the room was small and no option to upgrade was given. 
i would not like to choose it again... may be but no...",2,2009,11,30
105,Will return and would highly recommend,"We stayed in an Executive Suite for three nights recently at the end of a long-haul trip and could hardly fault the hotel.  The service is exemplary - nothing was too much trouble.  The Head Concierge Darren Briggs is a charming and knowledgeable gentleman who dealt efficiently and promptly with our requests.

The one idiosyncracy was that each morning they managed to get our breakfast slightly wrong however this was rectified immediately as soon as it was brought to the staff's attention but this really is a case of trying to find fault.

The suite in which we stayed was filled with antiques and was particularly charming - if you are looking for state of the art formica surfaces and flat-screen TVs you should perhaps consider a Novotel but if you are looking for a hotel that goes the extra mile to ensure an outstanding experience for its guests then you should certainly consider this excellent hotel - my family and I will certainly be returning.",5,2009,11,30
105,Pretty Good,Pretty good although not really sure why fellow TA contributors have placed this hotel currently at number 7. Location must be the best thing about this place…5 mins from Green Park underground and 10/15 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus. We had diner at Murano which is less than a minutes walk away. Most of the staff were absolutely charming but not all of them. The main problem is the hotel style and décor….there is a minuscule line between shabby chic and just shabby….unfortunately I am not convinced this place is on the right side of it! We were upgraded to a junior suite which was a little disappointing and the bathroom nothing special. In my opinion there are some better hotels for the money.,3,2009,11,26
105,"Nice hotel, staff very helpfull, excellent location","Stayed here on business purposes. Arrived late at night by underground from Heathrow - very close to Green Park station (10 minutes walk). Checked in and got upgrade to twin room. Not too big. bathroom actually small, but convenient (coffee/tea making facilities, hairdryer, ironing board, complimentary water, bathroom amenities, bathrobe). Beds very good. Breakfast menu for warm items. Helpfull and service minded staff. 
Very close to main shopping street (Oxford street, New Bond street, Picadilly Circus - all within a 10-15 minutes walk). Would certainly stay here again!",4,2009,11,25
105,Great Location,"Great Location, for restaurants and shopping but it has very small rooms. The service is very good.",4,2009,11,25
105,Best boutique hotel ever!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for three nights in October and we couldn't have been happier:  The accommodations were excellent, the personnel attentive, the breakfast copious and delicious and the location of the hotel perfect for exploring London on foot.   We have absolutely nothing to criticize about this hotel and will definitely stay there again on our return to London.",5,2009,11,21
105,Highly Recomended,"Following our Celebratory Birthday/Anniversary stay in the Chesterfield [14 Nov 2009] (Our 2nd Stay @The Chesterfield) - I will post  the following:
The Chesterfield Mayfair: A Wonderful Hotel - Just the right size not to be too imposing/sprawling, whilst also being just the right size to keep it feeling homely. This together with the excellent welcoming service makes the Chesterfield a truly marvellous hotel.
Superb Hotel, Superb Restaurant, Superb Staff - SUPERB!

Highly Recommended.",4,2009,11,20
105,Impeccible service as only the British can do it.,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for four nights in a junior suite.  My son and his wife joined us for the first two nights when we dined at the hotel's Butler's restaurant.  Every aspect of the hotel service was outstanding from the moment our taxi pulled up and the doorman helped us out, to the desk staff and through to every aspect of our stay.  The neighborhood is quiet and charming.  They serve a true English breakfast and dinner for my wife's birthday was quite special.  The reputation for their Dover sole is well deserved.  We have been to London many times and stayed in fine hotels but the Chesterfield is our new first choice for our next stay.",5,2009,11,15
105,Highly recommended!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel as part of a weekend theatre break package. We had booked a King Room and were upgraded to a Suite on arrival - what luxury. It was my birthday and I received a signed birthday card from all the staff - nice personal touch.  Although the hotel was busy, it didn't feel like it - very calm. Breakfast was included in our package and was excellent with great service. I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel and recommend it to all.",5,2009,11,15
105,Loved it! Book it!,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel and will recommend thehotel to friends, family and business partners. The Chesterfield Mayfair is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in London. Although the rooms are small, the attention of the staff, the unique surroundings and the general perception of luxury and calmness made the stay really memorable. Every positive review you have read about The Chesterfield Mayfair is absolutely true. I always spend a lot of time to find the best hotel when I'm travelling, and after some hours of search I found this hotel. It absolutely lived up to my expectations and standards. Loved it! Book it!",5,2009,11,06
105,A Mayfair Gem,This hotel is a hidden gem. The service is top notch and the Mayfair location is wonderful.,5,2009,11,05
105,SPECIAL BIRTHDAY TREAT,"From the moment we arriived the staff were wonderfull. Knowing it was my birthday Chris would bow and kiss my hand whenever he saw me,""now i know what royalty feels like"".Thanks to all the friendlly staff {who all signed a birthday card for me} Myself and all my friends had a fantastic weekend. Hotel location was within easy reach of many famous attractions but situated  in a quiet area where traffic noise was minimal.We all had english  breakfasts ordered and cooked to each   individual taste.Each of the 3 rooms were luxuriously furnished.I will most definitely stay here again..",5,2009,11,05
105,"Spectacular location, extremely friendly and attentive service, great rooms""","When we checked in, we were given an upgrade to a suite.  This was awesome because we were travelling with our two daughters, so it made our stay much more comfortable than staying in two rooms.  Our daughters were delighted with the Wi included in the room and with the nightly gifts that the hotel left on top of their beds.  At night when we all went back to the hotel, our daughters would run to their room anxious to find which little surprise was waiting for them. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive.   It is easy to find in every hotel one particular employee who has provided exemplary service.  It is rare to find a hotel like  the Chesterfield where every single employee provides exemplary service.  They all made us feel welcome and went out of their way to make our stay memorable. The location could not be better. Very near Hyde park, right next to amazing shopping and great restaurants.  Overall, a wonderful experience.  Would not think about going to another hotel in our next London trip.",5,2009,11,04
105,Wonderful Hotel!,"My wife and several family members and friends have stayed several times at the  Chesterfield Mayfair over the past five years.  It's not the cheapest hotel in London, but if you're looking for quintessentially British impeccable service, luxurously appointed rooms, great bar and restaurant, and a great location in Mayfair with easy walking to Shephard Market and Oxford Street be sure to stay at the at the Chesterrfield.",5,2009,11,01
105,A Real Gem- Can't  Wait To Return,"The  net bottom line is that The Chesterfield Mayfair is a real gem.  We spent five nights here this week in two rooms- one junior suite and one double room. Our expectations were high after reading all of the comments and we were not let down.  Upon arrival we were given a tour of the hotel and then accompanied upstairs to see our rooms.  Both rooms were lovely and well thought out.  Our rooms were next to each other as requested.  We filled out a checklist before check in, and everything that we noted was in the room. This included our choice of pillows and duvets, a printer and drivers for my laptop, and converters and plugs.  A yoga mat was in my daughter's room as requested.  The double room even had two closets in it. The couch in the suite even had a rather large full drawer underneath with the equivalent space of another three deep drawers. The desks were large with small storage drawers. As others have commented, the desk drawer had office supplies in there- clips, staplers, etc., should one need to work.  A full layout for coffee and tea in the room, complete with coffee press and biscuits, was well appreciated by all each day. The bottles of still and sparking water were always replaced each morning. Apples were always available in the lobby and were a great snack either on the way up to our rooms or on the way out for the day. There was always a place to plug in our multiple cell phones, hair blowers, laptops, and camera batteries.  There were more available outlets than I've seen in any US and European hotels. The room was spotless each day and maid service came in the evening to turn down the beds and leave some amenity like pillow spray or foot lotion. Their hair blower was great- don't even bother to pack your own like we did! There were even interesting and current magazines to read in the room- In Style, Gardening, Cooking, etc.
The staff was incredibly upbeat and helpful, including all management, front desk, concierge and restaurant staff. We had emailed the concierge prior to our arrival regarding theatre tickets, and all tickets were waiting for us upon arrival.  Email exchange was prompt and very helpful with regard to touring and tickets. In terms of location, we were a few blocks from the Green Park Station and walking distance from the theatre district, Buckingham Palace, Oxford St, Regent St. and even Covent Gardens.  Somehow we even walked the longer distances to the London Eye and to Parliament although we took a cab back that afternoon. Once we learned of the Oyster Card for the Underground we left from Green Park each day.  We ate a few our dinners in nearby Shepard’s Market.  
Breakfast each day was delicious. Even though we had the full English breakfast in our room rate, we could order from the menu and also from the buffet as well. Great cappuccino! 
I have traveled to London about 15 times prior for business, but decided to visit again, purely as a tourist, with our oldest daughter. I have always stayed either in Claridges, The Landmark, The Dorchester, or The Four Seasons , so my expectations for this hotel were lower in terms of services, room amenities, and staff. I expected to be staying in a small hotel with limited services. I can tell you that this is not the case at all.  We can't wait to return. The hotel is just lovely, including both of our rooms and all public spaces. This hotel should be one everyone's short list and is a great value.  Feel free to email me with any questions that you may have.",5,2009,10,29
105,"Excellent service, lovely hotel","My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair about 4 years ago and I just stayed there this past weekend, Oct 24-26. Some US friends were in town for the NFL game that was played at Wembley Stadium on the 25th and wanted to stay at this hotel so thought I'd give it another try, so glad I did.

The hotel was lovely just as it was the last time I was there. Things looked better than before though, common areas appeared to be the same only nicer. My room wa nearly identical to the one I'd stayed in before, lovely amenities and per usual, the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean.

The main thing I did note this time around (it was fine last time as well) was the service, it was outstanding and everyone on the hotel staff from front desk to waitstaff and to housekeeping seemed to want guests to feel as if the Chesterfield were their home away from home and all were treated just as we would treat a treasured guest in our own homes.

It's nice to see good hotel become even better!",5,2009,10,26
105,Look no further! The best place to stay in London.,"The positive reviews on this hotel are spot on!. This hotel is excellent. It oozes homely comfort. Staff are friendly and attentive. Great location, just a couple of minutes walk to the Ritz (where the Evan Evans tour busses pick-up from), Oxford St shopping, and top rated restaurants. Just around the corner is Murano (a Gordon Ramsay restaurant) this place is perfection in food & service. We were pleasantly surprised when we were welcomed and seated by Jean-Philippe (the Maitre 'D from the Hell's Kitchen tv show). Hotel breakfast & dinner was top quality. What else to say. Worst part about our stay was having to leave for Paris.",5,2009,10,26
105,Excellent,"Excellent weekend stay. Great Mayfair location. 'Mayfair' weekend package excellent value - late checkout, breakfast, afternoon tea and bottle of Champagne. Room small, but comfortable - good attention to detail - robes, foot lotion (!), tea/coffee, free wi-fi etc etc. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Best Central London Hotel I've been to.",5,2009,10,26
105,A Lovely Place to Stay in London,"The Chesterfield is a top choice in a city where hotels are generally too expensive or too minimal. the Chesterfield is a delightful luxury establishment whose prices are often comparable to very good chain hotels rather than ultra luxury establishments. The staff is incredible, tremendously competent, friendly and accommodating without being overbearing. The breakfast is magnificent - ask when booking - if the hotel will include it in your room rate. Dinner is also outstanding, among other treats, some of the best Yorkshire Pudding in England. The Chesterfield is more a home away from home that a typical hotel and that is the reason why it has so many repeat clients who will stay nowhere else while in London.",5,2009,10,22
105,Classic hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"The Chesterfield was just had we had hoped, we were not disappointed. The very informative Web site indicated what we were to expect. From the time my daughter and I arrived we were made to feel very welcome. We had a quick tour around the hotel while our bags were taken to our room. The room was very comfortable with everything you would expect in a 4 star hotel and more ( the lovely soft slippers supplied). Unfortunately our stay was only for one night, as we were attending the Dorchester for a charity event, and we did not sample the Evening meal but the selection at Breakfast was excellent. I would recommend this Hotel and staff any time.",5,2009,10,22
105,WOW!,"A completely huge surprise. Better than our most optimistic expectations. Even our cab drivers said we had found a real gem. Comfortable,quietly elegant, first class in every way. The diverse staff and management  was superbly competent, knowledgeable and couldn't be  friendlier.  On a light note. Try the English breakfast- the Losely yoghurt alone is worth the price. This hotel should be rated 5 stars!!

105,Another lovely stay at - The Chesterfield,"Stayed with my husband and my parents on Friday and Saturday evenings on the hotels 'Mayfair Weekends' package, which included amongst other things, a bottle of champagne in each room, a full English breakfast each morning and an afternoon tea.  We all thought this deal was very good value.  The breakfasts and the afternoon tea were delicious!  Our room on this occassion was a little on the small side, but was very well appointed, beautifully decorated and serviced to a high standard.
We have all been to this hotel on several occassions now, and always find the standard to be excellent.  We particularly enjoyed the bar each evening where there was a pianist playing.
This is our favourite London Hotel, although others that we have been to in the same group, Red Carnation, have all been very good and of a similar standard.  Would highly recommend.",5,2009,10,20
105,A Totally Delightful Experience,From the moment I arrived at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel I was looked after by very attentive staff in beautiful suroundings. Although my room was fairly small it was extremely relaxing and comfortable and I slept well. My stay there was perfect.,5,2009,10,16
105,Might have slipped a little,"I really hate to write any negative comments as we had adopted this hotel over the last 4 years.  We have spend more than 15 nights in this hotel.  This last visit we received a room that at least seemed smaller than the ones that we have received in the past.  Room service delivered a cool meal because it was not covered.  We were also not told we needed to book a table for the ""Afternoon Tea"" when we check in and therefore we ended up with room service ""Afternoon Tea"".  The concierge service remains top notch as was the front staff.  Wish I could say we will be returning but we are giving it second thoughts.",4,2009,10,14
105,Unadulterated Lavishness - just what the Dr ordered!,"Just back from a few nights stay at this gorgeous hotel.  It was our 3rd stay and I have to say, our best yet (not that we were disappointed on the other occasions – far from it!).  We were spoilt rotten and made to feel ‘at home’ from the minute we walked in the door.  The Concierge even remembered our name!
In fact, all the staff are fabulous, nothing was too much effort and our needs were anticipated before we even knew what they were ourselves!
We dined in the Restaurant twice and had the most delicious dinners.  Breakfast was fit for a King and never ending.  We tucked up cosily in our stunning bedroom and ordered room service which arrived promptly and was just divine.  Afternoon tea was full of delightful cakes and surprises – the only complaint was we ate too far much.
If you’re after a truly relaxing weekend we highly recommend this perfectly situated hotel.  It’s stunning inside and stunning outside – with some of the worlds’ best parks and shops right on your doorstep.  What more could you want!",5,2009,10,12
105,Promoting trip advisor - if you liked it............,"When we had paid the bill and checked out, the staff member asked it I enjoyed my stay, upon replying yes (to be polite) I was aksed if I new about the Trip Advisor web site.  I wonder if people are reading a skewed sample if only people who liked it get asked to do reviews?

Anyway - we stayed for nine nights in the Chesterfield Suite and based on the web site and the price had high expectations which were not met.  Check in was good and the introduction for the room very good.  The decor of the room is impressive if you like it which we did not.  Overfurnished with too much in the room which was filled with furnitured which was painted silver with black antiquing - ick.  The bed was comfortable but the long thin pillows on the King bed were not comfortable.  The TV was sequestered in the console and was old and had bad reception (annoying when I spent a day in bed with foor poisoning).  The room had a damp smell which didn't go away.  You couldn't open the window to let in fresh air and the carpet was quite grotty (we only noticed it when we spilt some tea and cleaned it up with a towel and shampoo thus causing a clean spot)

The bathroom was tiny and asked you to becareful with water as there was an 18th century fresco in the room underneath but the hotel had oddly not installed a drain in the bathroom floor to manage the problem themselves.  The bathroom was small and if you had broad shoulders (which I do) you couldn't sit back on the toilet.  Its definitely a one person bathroom.  There was a shower and a bath (which had a spa) as seperate entity but both were small and using the bathroom was quite challenging.  The bathrrom ventilation was quite bad and it often retained a fecal odour which is unpleasant.

Staffing is quite hit and miss.  We had one great concierge and a couple of very bored and uniterested ones.  Some of the waiting staff are great some couldn't care.  All the poeple who serviced our room did a great and very consistently good job.  You don't want to arrive back at your hotel to see the doorman see your car and disappear round the corner for a smoke at eleven on a Saturday night.  Weekend and evening staff in the lobby were generally quite bad and not knowledgeable.  If you promote the 'Chesterfield Experience' your guests will expect it.  The bar staff on the one night we used the bar were lovely apart from a very rude and drunk non hotel guest who, when he was not asleep on the bar at one in the morning, abused me, my wife and two other hotel guests.  This needs to be managed - especially when we complained saw the night manager dress down the worker in front of us.  Incidentally well done Chris and well done Petra two very good staff.

Food - a poached egg is the best test of any hotel kitchen.  Failed 6/8.  Breakfast in the dining room a few days and room service on the others.  Room service was good but really just OK breakfast eggs often hard.  Served a broken and overcooked egg on two occassions in the dining room.  Breakfast buffet good but not outstanding.  Had room service on two occasions for dinner and food arrived not as described on the menu.  Thick cut chips are not French fries and when you ask the waiter they reply the menu is wrong - so reprint the menu.  Second night well done burgers came medium rare again with fries and the salad was wrong.  Sent it back to get no salad returned and long wait for burger still with fries.  Night manager (same one) was not really interested.

So what did we like?  The lady who looks after the dogs - she is fab,  the decor in the lobby,  the fruit by the lift,  walking in Hyde Park,  paper delivered daily,  The beautiful bowls of red carnations and fresh flowers but for the money and inconsistency we won't be back",2,2009,10,11
105,What a treat!,"A friend and I were spending a weekend in London and booked this hotel through Superbreak.com. What an absolute bargain we got. I'd read the reviews online so knew that the hotel had a good reputation but for the price we paid I wouldn't have been surprised if we'd been given the shoe cupboard! 
Check in was a breeze...we arrived just before noon and were given our room keys ( room 401) and very soon after we'd gotten in reception rang to make sure everything was OK. The room, although small( the space between the twin beds was inches..), was immaculate, as was the bathroom. Lovely snuggly robes, and a welcome touch of slippers. Plenty of storage and the tea tray provided was brilliant, it even had a cafetiere. 
The  beds were very comfortable, our room was at the back of the hotel and we heard no noise whatsoever. Turn down service is provided, the staff here are just lovely.
Breakfast ( which was included in our deal) was absolutely gorgeous, again the staff were brilliant.
The proximity to the tube station is great..I enjoyed the walk down Queens St , and then through the little alley way. Some beautiful places to wander.  

If I am ever lucky enough to get the chance to saty here again, I'll jump at it",5,2009,10,09
105,Even better than its splendid reputation.,"We had an excellent trip to London because of our stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair.  The staff was superb from the front desk to to the hotel's management.  Butler's Restaurant in the hotel was as good as the best in London and that's saying a lot.  The food, preparation, service and ambiance was top notch.  We started each day with a breakfast that was extravagant and absolutely wonderful.  I would recommend it to any traveler in search of comfort and elegance.  To top it all off, the hotel was a short walk to Green Park, the tube, and the best shopping in town.  Regards to all and thanks again.",5,2009,10,08
105,Friendly staff,"We stayed at this hotel based upon other reviews we saw on tripadviser.  Good location!
We were most impressed by  the staff, all were friendly and always helpful.  We stayed 4 nights before we left on our cruise and 1 night after the cruise before we flew back home to San Francisco.  The first room we stayed in, ""the music room"",  for the 4 nights was a small but adequate.  Our biggest complaint was the surround shower configuration which, if used as intended sprayed the bathroom with water.

We enjoyed the bar and the breakfast offered and ate dinner once in the dinning room.  We thought the dinner was OK but not worth the price.  We expected more in quality and choice.  The evening we ate there  their were only a few other people in the room.  Could it be a reflection of the quality of the food.  The quality of the service and staff in the dinning room was was outstanding.  We decided not to eat dinner there again.

The last night we stayed before returning to the States we were given a different room which was a bit larger and more comfortable than the ""music room"".

When we return to London we would stay here again.  My wife and I are both 66.",4,2009,10,08
105,Even the cat was pampered...,"We spent nearly 2 weeks at the Chesterfield while we waited for our home in London to be ready.  See we came to London from the states and needed a place that would accommodate the four of us and a cat.  It was a pleasure.  They even made Cali, our cat, feel at home, with visits while we were away sightseeing.  The African Suite was gorgeous!  We would gladly stay there again.",5,2009,10,06
105,Making business on a weekend brilliant,"We stayed at the Chesterfield on Friday & Saturday as we had an event in the hotel over the weekend. We encouraged our delegates to do the same.  They thanked us.

As an event organiser you can imagine my delight when the feedback sheets on Sunday were filled with compliments on the quality of the venue, amazing service by the staff and everyone raved about the food!

The conference team could not have been more helpful, even when we wanted to rearranged our set up three times they dived in to help with a smile and a real attitude that they wanted to help. 

Our room was stunning. I work and travel with my wife and we agreed that we must book some leisure time at the Chesterfield so we can really enjoy all of the facilities. 

The location of the hotel is quite special too. In the heart of one of the wealthiest areas of London, it’s worth taking walk down the road to snoop at the Bentleys and explore the squares.

We have visited this hotel several times and without a doubt know we will be back very soon.",5,2009,10,05
105,fantastic!!!,"my husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary for three nights. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. checking in was a breeze and the reception staff were so lovely, friendly and helpful especially Julien.they even wished us a happy anniversary, which was lovely.nothing was a problem, everything was handled with care and courtesy. the surroundings are plush and luxurious but not so overly stuffy that you cant relax. in fact it was the most relaxing experience ive ever had. the hotel itself is so well presented and clean. the decor is beautiful and we were so happy with our room. the room was quite small but very well presented and had everything one would need during a stay. we found the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in(and my husband and I are fussy). there was tea and coffee with biscuits, still and sparkling water and bathrobes-all of which I find so important in a hotel. the bathrobes were so cosy. there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room and a box of chocolates for our anniversary. even the small touches like two chocolates wrapped in a voile bag left on our pillows, then another night a bottle of pillow spray to help you sleep, then on our last night a box of bath salts. lovely!! there was heating and airconditioning in the room so we never got top warm or cold. we ordered room service the first night and the young man who served us was so polite and friendly. couldnt have been nicer. the room service food was divine!!really delicious. that was our only time eating in the hotel however as we were out sightseeing every day and ate in different restaurants each evening. the breakfast buffet and selection is to be commended. the staff in the breakfast room were delightful and made us feel so welcome and at home. the selsction in the buffet was magnificent-every sort of fruit imaginable including poached pears and stewed apricots which were the nicest i have ever eaten!!! so mnay different types of cereals and toppings, croissants, baked goods, yummy yoghurts, several types of freshly squeezed juices. the list goes on. we were also able to order a hot breakfast from the menu and again the selection was amazing. i tried the pancakes(delicious), porridge(fantastic) and sausage and egg.my husband had eggs every morning, cooked a different way every morning. oh and just to say the concierge was so helpful and such a lovely man. we cannot fault this hotel on anything. it is top class and we were so sad to be leaving it. we will definatly stay there again if we return to london. well done chesterfield mayfair!!!",5,2009,10,03
105,Wish I had enough money to stay here every time I come to London...,"This is an oustanding hotel.  The staff are exceptionally pleasant and helpful, arriving at the hotel one is made to feel instantly at home.  It is very well located and presented, (lovely flower arrangements)but small enough to feel relaxed. Our car was parked for us and retrieved when we left: a real boon in central London.

Our room was not large, but every effort had been made to make it comfortable and it was well furnished and decorated.  The bed was large and comfortable and the hospitality tray was restocked when the bed was turned down in the evening which was welcome on a late return.

We were here for a wedding in the hotel itself, and this was well organised and the wedding room  appropriatly presented.  Other guests had also much enjoyed their experience of the hotel, I heard nothing but praise.",5,2009,10,02
105,"Wow, this hotel was lovely, clean, friendly, helpful and the staff was professional.","We arrived at The Chesterfield Mayfair and the staff helped us with our luggage, gave us a welcome card and also brought snacks to our room in the evening. The service by the staff was impeccable.   We had a delicious breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant .  Our room was immaculate, the bed was very comfortable, the bedding was outstanding and we had free internet service.

The doorman helped us with information about sightseeing and set up a sightseeing tour guide for us.  

The only problem we had was that the safe, in our room,  was not bolted down and someone could have walked off with it.

We would definitely stay at the Chesterfied Mayfair again and because our experience was so good, we will stay at their affiliate hotels also.",5,2009,10,01
105,HONESTLY - THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON !!!!,"Have just come home from a night in the Chesterfied Mayfair London. (1st October 2009)

From the moment you walk through the door, you are treated like royality. Everyone looks happy and pleased to do things for you. Your bags are whisked to your room. The rooms are so spacious and elegant. Everything is fine quality, beautifully clean. It really is a home from home. 

The beds are huge and so, so comfy. The linen is crisp and cold and the throws velvets and mohair. All sheer luxury. I watched tv in the bath!!! Free canapies were delivered to our room and we had a free couple of sherries before going to dinner !

The next morning the breakfast was outstanding - everything tasted delicious and the choices were  fantastic. 

You could not possibly choose a better hotel for luxury, service, comfort, location and most importantly value. It is worth every penny. Even my husband was impressed and he has stayed everywhere in the uk and abroad on business.",5,2009,10,01
105,"Some problems, but still highly recommend","We had the Garden Room (junior suite).

Pros - The Chesterfield is very generous with the amenities. We always had bottled water (still and sparkling) at no charge, wi-fi was free, and there was always something sweet on our pillows after turn-down. Big, fluffy robes, too. The staff was friendly, polite and helpful (with one exception). The hotel is clean, crisp, and perfectly located for exploring London whether by cab, tour bus, or on foot. Lots of great shops and restaurants close by. While not great, the hotel's own restaurant is good. Our room was mostly quiet (with another exception).

Cons - The hotel is old and our windows were leaky. The room always smelled of fried food. Trucks with back-up beepers did something in an adjacent alley every morning starting at 4AM. Also, an adjacent building renovation project fired up at approx 6:30AM every day. We asked to be moved twice, but were blown off by a polite but unconcerned desk clerk. 

Pro from a con - Because of the noise and smell, we decided to check out a day early. When the manager heard this she literally ran into the lobby apologizing and asking us what she could do to change our minds. She even offered to move us into a full suite for the night. We'd already booked - and paid for - a room at The Ritz, so we left anyway. Shortly after we got home, we got an email from the Chesterfield with another apology, an assurance that the desk clerk was receiving extra training, and the offer of a free night in another junior suite should we return. Now THAT is customer service.

Despite the problems, we really liked the Chesterfield and I don't hesitate to recommend it. We'll go back if we can.",4,2009,10,01
105,"wonderful hotel, i will come back","I am a Chinese and I chose this hotel from the website before my UK trip. So I hope my comments would be helpful to you. The hotel is in a very good location, minutes to many tourist places. The rooms inside have lovely traditional English decoration. and they are quiet which is very important for travellors. The breakfast in it is also lovely with various fruits choices and many hot dishes. I loved the porridge with cream. They also offered whisky on side for the porridge. Interesting to me, as a foreigner. One more advantage of the hotel is free access to the Internet. This is the only 4-star hotel with free Internet service in the central London that I could found. 

I will definitely recommend the hotel.",5,2009,10,01
105,Nice botique hotel in a very classy area,"Recently stayed at the Chesterfield for seven nights.  I decided to upgrade to a junior suite based on reports of other rooms on the small side.  The upgrade did not come cheap, but I think it was worth it based on a longer seven night stay.  I stayed in the Berkely suite which is on the second floor.  The suite was large enough though not particularly well-designed in that there was no way to watch TV and eat a dinner unless you moved some of the furniture around.  The bathroom was small but clean and had two showers though one was not even large enough to turn around in.  The room was on the street side and I could hear some street sounds, but was never bothered by this.  It was also difficult to figure out how all the light switches worked.  Overall, however, the room ended up being just fine for my purposes.  I tried room service several evenings and was greatly impressed by the service and the quality of the food.  Highly recommend the grilled salmon and the lamb chops.  As mentioned by others, the staff is very friendly and efficient and more than willing to help with any problems.  In summary, I can highly recommend this hotel even though it does have its quirky side.",5,2009,09,27
105,"Perfect Location, Professional Staff","Stayed for 6 nights.  We arrived early but was able to check-in right away.  Graciously greeted by the doorman and our luggage quickly whisked away.  The staff was professional--quite attentive without being intrusive.  Room was very pleasant and clean and the size was quite adequate, especially for London.  Enjoyed the different goodies left on our pillows every night.  Room service was prompt.  Location is perfect--it is in a very quiet, residential neighborhood close to Green Park Tube and many attractions.   Shepherd's Market is nearby where there are many choices of restaurants.  There is a small Tesco and a bigger Sainsbury's within walking distance--great for picking up snacks.  I would have given a perfect rating of 5 except for two things:  my morning paper not delivered 2 days in a row--I had to remind the staff twice.  The staff was very apologetic each time.  Also the price of their full English breakfast--£22.  But again with its great location, many restaurants closeby where you can get a FEB for less than half the  price.  Otherwise, still enjoyed the stay.  It was a beautiful hotel and would not hesitate staying here again.",4,2009,09,26
105,Excellent two nights at the Chesterfield,"Excellent two-night stay at the Chesterfield.  Very clean, staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were decent enough size and quiet!  Perfect location, near restaurants, the tube and sightseeing.  Breakfast was ample and we ate dinner at the restaurant and the food was very good.  The only complaint was that the water pressure in the shower was weak (could it be b/c I stayed at the top floor?).

I would definitely stay at the Chesterfield again.",5,2009,09,23
105,Service as it should be.,"I love this hotel! The Chesterfield Hotel is elegantly old fashioned without being in the least bit fuddy-duddy. From the moment you check in, you will see how charming and efficient the staff are-if only customer service everywhere was like this. The bedrooms are nicely furnished and the bathrooms spotless with good lighting (often not the case in other hotels). Having sampled breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner here recently with my sisters and Mother, I couldn't fault anything we ate and neither could they - and being a chef myself, I can be quite critical! The location is perfect for sight-seeing, theatre, shopping etc and on top of all that, the room rates are much better value than similar hotels in London. Can't wait to go back!",5,2009,09,22
105,Delicious afternoon tea and brilliant service,"I went to this hotel for an afternoon tea. The selection of the cakes and pastries were excellent. The sandwiches were a hit and the scones were amazing, best we have ever tasted. Will definately be back for another afternoon tea.",5,2009,09,20
105,Brilliant hotel - Location good for easy stroll into heart of London,"Staff very welcoming and helpful
Room well appointed. Good facilities and decor.
Breakfast very good although expensive if its not included in the room rate.
Quiet, not subject to the usual London traffic hum drum.
Overall very pleased and will stay again.",5,2009,09,20
105,A cozy gem in Mayfair,"Traveling to London with my dad we chose the Chesterfield Mayfair because of its proximity to everything. As a first time visitor to London, it was such a great location. Close to the tube, Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, I felt like we could walk almost everywhere.

The rooms were very well appointed, a bit small for the singles, but well set up with the TV also doubling as a computer station with internet access in each room. The bathrooms were tiled in beautiful marble floor to ceiling. The most convenient part about being an American traveler is the US outlets in each room. I didn't have to dig out my converter at all and that was a small touch that made a huge difference for me.

We grabbed a coffee one morning from the bar in near the lobby, but decided that for what it was it was completely overpriced. There are many cafes in the neighborhood that offer much better and more affordable options.

Overall, it was great to be so close to everything, activities, attractions, restaurants and pubs.  Next visit I have no reason to stay anywhere else.",4,2009,09,18
105,another chill out weekend,"how lucky are we to have stayed at this hotel twice in one month! we ate drank and shopped. we had a lovely room on the seventh floor which was bigger then the last one we stayed in. we always eat at el pirata a spanish tapas resteraunt on friday night if we are in london, ask oneof the concierge at the desk for directions its about 5 mins from hotel, just a great place to eat. the staff at the chesterfield were as lovely and helpful as ever, i could quite happily live in this hotel, i wish!!!! we also went to the new westfield shopping centre in sheperds bush, its worth the trip if you like shops, i do.this hotel is great for seeing central london on foot as its close to all the major sights you would want to see.",5,2009,09,17
105,"Finest hotel, wonderful staff, perfect stay","My sister and I stayed here on the Mayfair Weekends Package at the beginning and end of a 2-week tour of England (3 nights each time).  We were greeted as we exited the taxi from Paddington, our luggage was quickly taken care of, and we were escorted to our room, a superior twin (non-smoking--and the hotel goes non-smoking as of 1 September!).  The room wasn't huge, but it was certainly enough, with the 2 closets, to suit us.  Beds were very comfortable, and the climate control was efficient.  That evening, while we were out exploring, a bottle of marvelous champagne was delivered to our room, and our beds were turned down, with a small bag of treats for us.  As part of the package, we enjoyed a full English breakfast each morning, and the restaurant staff is simply wonderful.  Prompt, friendly service, very welcoming and yet professional.  There were fresh croissants (chocolate and plain) out of the oven, fresh fruit, yogurt, a fruit and cream concoction, smoothies, and we ordered oatmeal cooked in milk with cream, brown sugar and whiskey every day (incredibly good!!).  Also as part of the package, we enjoyed afternoon tea at the hotel, a full meal in itself, and it certainly sufficed for dinner.  Excellent sandwiches, rich pastries, and of course, fresh scones with all the trimmings of a cream tea.  The concierge assisted us with directions to wherever we wanted to go, including a recommendation for a local pub with the best fish and chips.  The hotel is located close to the Green Park tube station, and it is an easy 10-15 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and the shopping on Oxford Street--location is obviously prime.  It is also next to Dartmouth House, where we had lunch one day.  The lounge is open all night, and there was live piano music when we sat there of an evening.  We had dinner there one night--very good!  It is difficult to say what I liked the best about the Chesterfield Mayfair, but I suppose I would have to say the staff--professional, thoughtful, good people.  And you know what I liked the least:  leaving!",5,2009,09,09
105,Exceptional Hotel,"We recently spent 6 nights at the Chesterfield and cannot say enough good things about our stay. The hotel itself is convenient to all the major tourist sites and the rooms were comfortable and quiet. However, it was the hotel staff that made our stay memorable. From front desk, to bell staff,  to the restaurant they were exceptionally professional, courteous and competent and went out of their way to make their guests comfortable. We booked a 2 room special which was great for families. We would highly recommend the Chesterfield and plan on staying again when we are lucky enough to return to London.",5,2009,09,08
105,We could not fault The Chesterfield in any way - perfect!,"This was our first stay at the Chesterfield and it certainly will not be the last.  
Our room was beautifully presented and equiped with just about everything you could possibly need, even down to paper clips and stapler (and if there were something more required then I am sure the excellent staff would do their very best to supply it!).  The bathroom sparkled and again was fitted to a very high standard, all in perfect working order.
Although only staying for one night, we did order food from Room Service, which arrived within 15 mins, as promised and also had food in the bar, all of which was excellent.   Our Full English Breakfast the next morining was one of the best we have had in a hotel for a long time.
However, the thing that made this hotel stand out from the rest, has to be the wonderful team of the most friendly staff imaginable - every single one was so pleasant and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. 
A brilliant place to have found.",5,2009,09,02
105,Small Scale Elegance - Great Staff & Location,"My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London and we were not disappointed.  The hotel has an elegant boutique feel with special attention to detail.  It felt to me like the prototype the Ritz-Carlton might have used to formulate its standard of elegance and service on a larger scale.  The staff was attentive, room service was excellent and our stay could not have been more comfortable.  The location is convenient to the theatre district and it cost us only about 6 pounds to take a taxi to a play.  It is also a very short distance from Picadilly Circus, Buckinham Palace and Herrods.  You will not be disappointed if you choose this hotel.",5,2009,09,01
105,Another lovely stay,"My wife took me to the Chesterfield as a birthday surprise - combined with a guided tour of Buckingham Palace and dinner at Murano. A fantastic day in every way.
The Chesterfield gave me a birthday card signed by all the staff! they do seem to do things properly here. Nice quiet room (ask as those at the front can be a little noisy due to taxis etc) friendly staff and a great location ensure that we will return next time we have a London Break",5,2009,09,01
105,Truly Excellent !,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 3 nights over the August Bank Holiday weekend, this hotel is without doubt the best hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying at in London. The hotel is located about a 7 minute casual walk from Green Park tube station in the very elite Mayfair District. Without doubt the best part of the hotel is its wonderful attentive staff, before we even got to the door of the hotel the Doorman was running down the street to assist us with our luggage, how he knew we were staying in the Chesterfield I don't know, but he did ! We were welcomed by our name at the reception and the Hotel Duty Manager Ben Saeger greeted us personally and gave us an introductory tour of this wonderful hotel. The personal touch of being continually addressed by our names by all members of staff continued throughout the entirety of our stay, every morning the Housekeeping staff would greet us ""Good Morning Mr & Mrs Burr"", as would the restaurant Manager and table waiters, the best of which was Carolina, she was superb and gave such sincere ""motherly"" attention to us each morning. The rooms at the hotel are furnished with luxury linens and amenities, yes they are a bit on the small side but this is pretty much normal in London unless you pay for Grand Suites, we booked a Superior Room and it was absolutely ideal for our 3 night stay. The hotel Restaurant ""Butlers"" was excellent, we dined there on our first evening and the quality food and attentive service reminded us of the Cunard Lines White Glove service and standards of old, simply the best ! Book this hotel and it will be your new London home for ever, we can't wait to return !",5,2009,09,01
105,Truly Enigmatic,"So many members have rated this hotel as 'perfect' that it makes me wonder about their judgment, or what sort of other hotels they have stayed in. Sure it is nice, and I would stay there again, but there are so many things that simply do not live up to expectations. It is well staffed, maybe even over-staffed, and most of them are professional and genuinely friendly, but overall guest service was no better than average. There were four people behind Reception but none of them could break off whatever it was they were doing to acknowledge that I was there even though I was the only one there. There didn't seem to be any bellhops - only 'managers' - maybe that's why my luggage took about 20 minutes to arrive. The 'manager' showing me to the room just went on and on about wanting me to have a perfect stay at his hotel and I regret to say I played a little trick on him - after 10 minutes or so I gave him a £5 tip (for what?) and he shut up and left immediately. Decor is a personal choice  - some rooms pleased me some didn't - but inexcusable was the amateurish workmanship in many places. Windows that rattled, blinds that didn't stay shut or open, silicone sealer in the bathroom just plain ugly daubed on. Doors squeak. Floorboards squeak. There's no excuse for this in the 21st century. I know I'm being critical but I think it's justified when a hotel claims to be so good. The bathroom design in my room was strange - a nice large whirlpool if you like that sort of thing but a shower stall so small you couldn't wash your hair without banging elbows on the faucets. Oh and the plumbing - the hot water took at least five minutes to arrive and when it did come it was almost hot enough to scald. Turning the faucet towards cool had no effect until suddenly you got a cold shower. Very 1950-ish. The bar and the pianist were fine - except for inconsistent air conditioning - cold in some areas, warm in others. Afternoon tea was OK - well almost - I hadn't realized that  thick bread with the crusts left on was now considered acceptable for this delicacy. The dining room overall was acceptable but not fabulous - service was slow and meals were not served hot (maybe the kitchens are too far away but even if they are a good restaurant would reheat to sizzling before serving) - two evenings the featured dinner entree was finished and not available as early as 7pm. Breakfast was noticeably mediocre with limited choice, cold, thick toast and service being slow and somewhat inattentive. Some may think I'm being overly critical but just imagine how great it would be if the little things, and a few big ones, were attended to.  Also disturbing was some of the clientele - quite a number in the dining room and lounging around the bar and entrance foyer wore clothing that not too long ago would have been considered underwear. As I titled my critique - The Chesterfield is truly enigmatic.",3,2009,09,01
105,"Convenient location, extremely comfortable and inviting.","This hotel is everything that one would imagine a wonderful English establishment should be.  The decor is elegant and reminds one of an English manor, surrounded by horse and hound pictures and beautiful dark woodwork, complete with comfortable library.  The staff also compliments the surrounding by making you feel that they are all there at your disposal for whatever your needs may be.  The consierge, the matre'd, the chef - everyone we encountered on the staff where congenial, polite and extremely helpful with only our comfort in mind.  The location is great - just steps away from wonderful restaurants, within walking distance of Buckingham palace and many other sightseeing destinations.  The dining room and bar were both beautiful and the food and drinks excellent.

The rooms were very well equiped and extremely comfortable with everything neatly encased with  built-in efficiency, including a tea tray -extremely refreshing after a long day of meetings, or sightseeing.  The bathrooms were beautiful in marble, including heated floors.  My husband and I stayed here for five days, (he on business and I for pleasure) and had a wonderful time.  If we have an opportunity to travel again there is no place I would rather stay.",5,2009,08,30
105,Outstanding!!!!,"This was the second time staying in this lovely hotel.  The staff from the front desk to the dining attendants, to the bartenders and piano player , to the housekeepers,  all go above and beyond as far as customer service.  The hotel is in a perfect London location in the heart of theater, shopping , food and pubs. Wonderful food and afternoon tea.  Loved every minute of my stay here.  I'm already making plans for my next stay there--can hardly wait!",5,2009,08,28
105,as good as ever,"i stayed in the chesterfield in mayfair with my husband in early august, this is  the third time i have stayed in this hotel and without a doubt it has never let me down.  The ambience , decor , professionalism of the staff was without question.  the breakfasts are one of the best i have ever had in any hotel in europe, and i find myself coming back time after time.",5,2009,08,27
105,"Excellent Service, Clean and Convenient!","The location was very good, rooms are well decolated, not too much, but clean and comfortable.Staffs were all friendly. The price was a little bit expensive, but worth staying anyway.",5,2009,08,26
105,Luxurious surroundings and an intimate atmosphere,My husband and I spent a long weekend at the Chesterfield and had a wonderful time. We had a lovely room overlooking a quaint courtyard. All of the furnishings at the hotel are luxurious and you feel pampered as soon as you step through the door. One of the best features of the hotel is the staff who cannot do enough to make your stay enjoyable. We shall definitely return.,5,2009,08,24
105,This is the best hotel that I have ever stayed at.,"There are hotels that give you five star service and then there's the Chesterfield.  Everything is similar to what you would expect from a normal five star hotel only it is all just a little bit better.

Of special note is the staff.  All were helpful beyond reasonable expectation.  The level of service at the restaurant was truly exceptional as was that at the reception desk.

Full marks.",5,2009,08,24
105,Best Hotel in London,"I've stayed at the Chesterfield repeatedly on business over the last number of years and it is without exception the best hotel I've stayed in.  The staff  and service are excellent, and the restaurant and bar are great, it is also in a great location.  Some of the rooms can be a little on the small side and there is some inventive use of space.  I stay in hotels alone on a weekly basis and believe the Chesterfield to be the best, it is personal,  welcoming and friendly.   If you have to be in London the Chesterfield is the place to stay.",5,2009,08,22
105,Still great after all these years,"We stayed at this hotel 24 years ago during our honeymoon. We were back in London, this time with our two kids seeing the sites of London for a week. Unfortunately, we did not stay at this hotel, chossing one in South Ken instead for a variety of reasons. On our last night, our family had dinner in Mayfair and we stopped in for dessert  at the Chesterfield and to show our kids where Mom and Dad stayed years ago. We were graciously directed into the dining room and served by a head waiter by the name of Loris. We told him about our visit  and we struck up a genuinely warm and fun conversation with him. It was a stark contrast to the other hotel we were staying at that had no  personality or warmth. It was nice to see that quality has not changed all of these years. It still had the elegant and warm vibe we felt those many years ago. On our next visit, we will go to the Chesterfield.",5,2009,08,21
105,fantastic,"brilliant hotel. fantastic staff, and a very enjoyable stay. we were treated very very well indeed. can't wait to visit again.",5,2009,08,20
105,I wouldn't stay anywhereelse.,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair, London recently.  The service was absolutely fantastic, the staff were exceptional, very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.

Our room was lovely, everything we needed, clean and well laid out.  

Breakfast at the Chesterfield was absolutely wonderful, again the staff were extremely nice and friendly and of course we had the english breakfast which was by far one of the best we have had in any hotel.

The hotel itself is gorgeous, I can't think of onenegative thing about this hotel, we really enjoyed our stay.  Next time we visit London we will definately be staying here.",5,2009,08,19
105,"If I were to return to London tomorrow, this is where I would stay.","I traveled to London with my 15-year-old grandson and chose the Chesterfield Mayfair because of its proximity to major attractions and its (for Mayfair) reasonable rates.  We were welcomed with warmth and efficiency and treated wonderfully throughout our 5 day stay.  Inobtrusive yet constantly available service was our experience throughout our stay.  The room was perfect - bigger than many in London.  Internet access was simple and free. The English breakfast in the restaurant was just great for a teenage boy.  
The location could not be better -- we ate every night within easy walking of the hotel, most frequently at one or another of the nice restaurants in Shepherd's Market.  I will recommend this hotel to anyone interested in a charming, very Engish, yet fully modern hotel in London.",5,2009,08,15
105,comfortable elegance in a superb location,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair with our three daughters and my parents for four nights.  This was our first trip to London, and I believe we could not have chosen a better place.  From the moment we arrived, the staff made every effort to make our stay memorable.  The rooms were lovely.  We had a beautiful suite with three beds, complete with teddy bears,  made up for the girls.  We enjoyed a delicious breakfast each morning.  The location was convenient for walking or for taking the underground to sights throughout the city.  After busy days of sight seeing, it was a pleasure to be greeted with a smile and welcomed by name back into the hotel.  My nine year old daughter wrote in her travel journal, ""Perfect Hotel""    I agree.",5,2009,08,15
105,Olde World luxury & high class service in busy London,"This Red Carnation group hotel lives up to its web site 100%.  Traditional, elegant furnishings, excellent meals and high class service.   Peaceful refuge in a busy city, easy walking distance to Oxford St, Bond St & Hyde Park.    I stayed 2 nights and they OFFERED to hold my bags on my departure day .   My suite was larger than the often ""shoebox"" size of London hotel rooms, but then the price is at the high end so its reasonable to expect some space.   I'd recommend the Chesterfield for the luxury and  service I experienced .  If you're looking for somewhere special in a good location, you can't go past this hotel in Mayfair.",5,2009,08,13
105,Relaxed yet traditional,"Bad points first - some of the bathrooms are almost comically small although very well fitted out - heated mirror to avoid condensation, heated floor.... Some of the drinks / snacks in the bar are pricey but I think worth it for the relaxed ambience, quality of service, little nibbles that come with cocktails, capuccinos etc. Overall though I have stayed several times and never found it anything but excellent. Service is very efficient and friendly from all staff - reception, doormen, breakfast, bar staff etc. Quality shines through everywhere in a tradiional yet efficient way in a little oasis of calm amidst the madness that is London. In fact the immediate area is a very relaxed location and Shepherd Market close by if you want restaurants and bars with a bit more life ! It's not cheap but it's very easy to pay a lot for very litle in London. Here you pay a little more but you get a lot more. Oh and breakfasts are very good, especially the cooked options. Cold selection is a little more limited but still reasonable. Overall highly recomended.",5,2009,08,12
105,Afternoon Tea was a great disappointment,"I relied on great reviews from the Afternoon Tea Guild and decided to book afternoon tea at the Chesterfield.  It was a huge mistake, from beginning to end.  The only thing the hotel seemed to excel at was quickly taking my money after I paid.  Our table wasn't ready although we had reservations.  We were told there was no child's tea available, although the hotel website stated otherwise.  Our server asked if we wanted water and when we asked for tap water he disappeared and we never received it or saw him again.  No one asked if we liked the tea and no one offered to refill or warm the pots.  We drank lukewarm tea during most of the meal.  My spouse's ""Chocolate Tea"" was supposed to include a chocolate bar but, of course, it was never delivered.  The Chocolate Tea was nothing special at all except for the fact that the scones were chocolate flavored.  Attentive service would not describe our experience until - of course - I paid the check.  I paid with cash and thought it rude of the staff member to immediately take it as if to count the money to ensure all was accounted for.  I had wanted to stay at the Chesterfield but will refrain from doing so as my experience with tea left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Never again!",2,2009,08,11
105,Absolutely splendid,"Stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel, staff and service are all first class, and this is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. 
The lobby area is charming, the restaurant quite smart, and our bedroom - Room 527, 'The Music Room' - was outstanding. As expected the room had a music theme, and although I am normally quite dubious about themed rooms this one had been decorated thoughtfully and was very impressive.
We had a 4 poster king size bed which was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was a good size with a huge free standing roll top bath, and a rain shower at one end of it. Ample fluffy towels and toiletries available in the bathroom, and a bathrobe and slippers each in the bedroom.
Plenty of tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits in the bedroom, we received a newspaper each morning, and an evening paper each day also.
The room was cleaned every day but we didn't see one chamber maid during the whole stay - how do they do that?! It was also extremely quiet, we hardly heard a noise from our room, it was hard to believe we were in central London.
The breakfast was the best we've ever had in any hotel, an amazing selection of cooked choices, aswell as various fruits, cereals, pastries etc, the coffee was also so nice had to stay for an extra pot, and the staff in the restaurant gave superb customer service.
The hotel's location is perfect for exploring London, Green Park tube station only a 5 minute walk away, plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and an easy 15-20 minute stroll to Piccadilly Circus.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and will definitely be coming back for another visit.",5,2009,08,11
105,A unique hotel to make any occasion truly memorable,"From the minute we arrived at the front door of the Chesterfield every member of staff we met greeted us warmly and seemed naturally customer focused. The hotel is in an ideal location for easy access to other areas of London, numerous bars and restaurants within walking distance and a stroll along New Bond street up to Oxford street provided all the shops anyone could possibly need!
The hotel from the lobby to the bar, restaurants and rooms is unique in every way with obvious signs of personal dedication to ensuring a memorable stay.",5,2009,08,09
105,An aristocratic touch..,"-Location is in Mayfair, one of London’s most exclusive districts.
-A few minutes’ walk from the Green Park tube station, Green Park, hard rock café, Dover street, Buckingham Palace, St. James park, Park lane boulevard, Hyde Park, Oxford street and Piccadilly (10 min walk).
-The Sheppard market with its distinguished restaurants and pubs are just around the corner.
-The Chesterfield staff are always there for you with a great welcoming smile to answer or assist you with anything you may need.
-Housekeeping staff are so great and up to all the small details.  Nothing is left un-attended.
-Hotel is extremely clean, perfectly managed, lobby & dining area & bar are very trendy.  
-Rooms seem that they have went thru the hands of the best interior designers to assure that every single inch is being made use of and that the best décor, furniture, colors and lightings are being used.  It might be that the rooms are small but to me they were perfectly up to my requirements.  More than enough closet space to hang my cloths.  An iron & board well stored away in the closet, a mini bar, refrigerator, water kittle, free supply of brand name tea/coffee and water bottles and also a cute LCD TV.  And if I remember correctly I had a Bang & Olufsen radio & iPod audio system.
-Room lighting are designed to be used for different moods.
-Furniture/bed/wall décor etc. are very trendy and well thought of.  Bed was very comfortable with exclusive feather pillows and soft comforters. 
-The bathroom is extremely clean has everything, from high quality bathrobes to well known brand names for shampoo, soap, lotions, etc. 
To sum this up, I had a great time at the Chesterfield Hotel, I personally prefer such hotels that reflect the aristocratic feelings on a small scale rather than a huge hotel with marble floors everywhere and the feeling that I’m walking into a shopping mall.  For sure I will be staying at the same place on my next visit to London (if the prices remain intact).",5,2009,08,08
105,Even I can boil an egg!,"This was my fourth stay at the Chesterfield and it remains my favourite London hotel - the location is excellent and the staff are always amazing.

The room I was originally given was beautiful, very feminine and charming, but unfortunately it had no bath, only a shower.  When I asked to be moved this was done immediately and, although the second room was much plainer, it did have a nice big bath.

The only problems I had on this visit were with some of the food.  My room service dinner was delivered promptly and tasted good,  but at best could be described as lukewarm.  When I asked for a soft-boiled egg at breakfast, the first one I received was almost raw, the second was as hard as a bullet.  Now I'm not a great cook, but even I can boil an egg!  It's not a huge issue, of course but I would expect a chef to be able to cook an egg.  However, they still make the best porridge I've tasted in a long time.",4,2009,08,05
105,A magnificent treasure hidden in the heart of Mayfait,"I stayed in the Chesterfield hotel for the fourth time.  I always come back to this hotel, because in my opinion: it's the best!
Altough the single rooms are small, they have all the luxury and comfort one needs, even in the little details.
The most wonderful element of this hotel is the warmth and the service from the staff. They are impeccable!!!
And if I may give you an advice...If you go there, do try the restaurant. Mr Lucchini is the most wonderfull restaurant manager and the food is the best in London!
I do know where I will stay , the next time in London.",5,2009,08,05
105,Excellent - with old world charm,"All the reviews for this hotel are spot on - excellent service, great location & old world charm. It is very oldy worldy but I knew that before I got there. The location really is superb & lots of lovely restaurants nearby - can recommend Le Caprice if you looking for something special.
Was really impressed with one aspect of the hotel - filled out a comment card on leaving the hotel and made a small comment about an additional amenity that could be made available to guests and within 2 days had received a letter from the hotel referring to my comments and what they were going to do about my comment - I have never experienced this from any other hotel. Would definitely return.",5,2009,08,03
105,This is jewel where we felt welcomed and pampered in a perfect location in London.,"Recently, July 22-25, 2009, my 13-year old daughter and I had a wonderful stay in this lovely hotel. We enjoyed ourselves immensely, and felt constantly pampered and taken care of. The service went above and beyond the call of duty when I realized, just I had sat down on the Gatwick Express train to the airport, that I had left our passports in the hotel safe. In a panic, I called the hotel from the Victoria station. The reception staff calmly come up with a solution and sent over one of the door-men, in a taxi, our passports in hand. I have never been so relieved or grateful for such service. I had my passports delivered to Victoria station in under 15 minutes! 

I also would like to thank the reception staff, particularly Tony, for all the useful advice about 'things to do' in London. They were very patient in showing us maps and directions. Darren was also a pleasure to meet. Everyone staff member at the hotel met us with a smile and were always willing to offer advice or help. It was an absolute pleasure, and I will be sure to recommend your hotel to my numerous travelling friends.",5,2009,08,01
105,Everything you could hope for,"We were relieved to find the hotel was every bit as good as described. The service from all the staff was impeccable and we were made to feel that they did actually care about the quality of our stay. We had a minor problem that was dealt with incredibly quickly and to our complete satisfaction. The room was spotless and the bed linen was very good quality. The restaurant staff were friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. The hotel is centrally placed, which made getting around to see all we wished to see, very easy.",5,2009,07,30
105,Disappointing,"We have stayed here a number of times previously and really enjoyed our stay before. This time we were really disappointed. The children aged 10 and 15 were put in a room on another floor and the receptionist seemed very put out when we asked for rooms on the same floor (which we had originally requested).
The under floor heating in the bathroom did not work, the shower screen did not shut and there were no ordinary tea bags in the room (Earl Grey only).
We had previously found this hotel comfortable and found that it provided a touch of luxury. We were disappointed on this occasion and wish we had stayed in a cheaper chain. I think we were most put out by the attitude of the reception staff at that time-the porter and dining staff were great and the breakfast was still good.",3,2009,07,27
105,"Traditional hotel, friendly in great location","Comfortable rooms and friendly staff.

Breakfast disappointing.

Great location, Murano round the corner!

Checkout at 12 - great!",4,2009,07,21
105,Absolute luxury,"This is the best hotel I have ever been to. I love that the rooms are all unique and contain the nicest linens. Everything was clean and well thought out. The English breakfast was amazing - I couldn't ask for more. The staff was extremely nice. The location was perfect - close to Green Park tube station, Buckingham Palace, pubs, restaurants, and more.

I will be back again - hopefully soon.",5,2009,07,21
105,Would return in a heartbeat,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is truly a great find in London. The hotel is very charming and the service staff could not be more accommodating. The location is in the heart of Mayfair near many quaint restaurants and a short 5 minute walk to the Green Park metro station. The rooms were a bit small, which is typical for London, but nicely appointed with marble bathrooms, nice toiletries, and comfortable linens. We had breakfast included in our package. The breakfast was nice, however expensive if you were paying on your own. Try to get it included if possible. The front desk was helpful for any tourist tips and dining reservations. They actually were able to sell tickets for certain attractions such as the Tower of London so that we could avoid the queue. They had a charming bar off the lobby. Overall, we would highly recommend this place.",5,2009,07,20
105,Beautiful Hotel With Outstanding People Working There,"I don't think I can come up with anything bad about this hotel, everything about it was good and met my standards. The people who worked there are very helpful and helped us with any questions we had as far as getting around town. It was puring rain there and as soon as we arrived in taxi there was a door-man waiting for us with an umbrella. The room was a pretty good size considering its in London. Downstairs they have complimetary internet and that was nice because I was able to check into my flight before departing. 

The hotel is in a high end area, very close to shops and tourist sights, easy to get around. They have a good variety of teas and buscuits in the room. As soon as we arrived they knew the room was for three people because there where 3 bath-robes, 3 slippers, 3 shampoo's, 3 everything lol.

We had the continental breakfast and it was really good, big variety of fruits and juices, plus pastries followed by your choice of a main dish. For exampple, eggs, hashbrowns, and sausage. 

All the people who worked there we crossed with are very sweet people, I swear my mom talked to each one for at least 10 minutes each. They knew us when we went in and out of the hotel.

I will come back here for sure, will bring others too!",5,2009,07,14
105,What a value for London!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for three nights, at the tail end of a trip spent mostly in France. It is all that it has been described to be on this board. We paid 195 pounds per night, including breakfast for a King Superior room. The room was cozy, not large, but adequate in size. The bathroom, I would say, was attractive, but very small and tight. I ran into things in the bathroom a few times. Overall, the room was clean and solidly nice for a four star hotel. The service was very good, particularly the concierge and the restaurant staff. Afternoon tea was very nice, with tasty scones and finger sandwiches and nowhere near as stuffy as afternoon tea at the 5 star palaces like the Dorchester or the Ritz. The hotel's location was ideal for us, on a quiet street in Mayfair, but walking distance to much shopping (Harrod's, Fortnum and Mason) as well as restaurants. It certainly is not the place to stay if you are planning a theater-heavy trip, but it was perfect for us as we had no shows planned on this trip. We have stayed at the sister Red Carnation hotel, the Hotel 41, and we felt that we liked the Chesterfield better, for location and for service. Breakfast was nice, including made-to-order hot foods. There were two computers with internet access on the lowest floor for guest usage. Very good 4 star hotel, great for the money that you pay here.",4,2009,07,13
105,A Wonderful Hotel,Completely fulfilled my family's expectations and gave us a great London experience.,5,2009,07,11
105,The Chesterfield Mayfair offers the ultimate in service and savoir faire.,"There are luxury hotels and there are the grand palaces of overnight stay and then there is the Chesterfield Mayfair, a rare, stand alone class act with all the characteristics of the aforementioned. 
My wife and I were smitten by this hidden London jewel a couple years ago for a brief stay in the Mayfair District of the city. We were traveling with other members of our family who had booked rooms at the nearby Dorchester. Our initial impression of the Chesterfield Mayfair at that time was a bit reserved as we were slightly intimidated by the seemingly darkness of the interior  and the 'properness' of it all. Our room seemed ancient and small but was very clean and comfortable and the service was impeccable. We were first time, typical inexperienced American visitors to the city and apprehensive of every little thing, not sure of how to blend in or how to interpret our surroundings. Our own reservations were quickly put at ease. 
The comfortable, well staffed restaurant served a delicious breakfast with considerable choices in fresh fruits and juices and offered a wonderful lunch and dinner and again, the service was very personable, relaxing and accommodating.
We have since returned to this 'well kept London secret' this past June and snuggled into the Grosvernor Suite where we were treated like royalty  by the forever smiling and engaging staff. Every contact that we had with these kind folks seemed memorable, from the room service, the maid service, the friendly and knowledgeable concierge and front desk to the ever friendly door man. 
We will highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair to our friends. It is situated in a quiet area of London near Hyde Park and convenient to a quaint neighborhood grocery/drug store, hidden backstreet restaurants, shopping, bookstore, pubs and the Green Park tube, all with-in walking distance. Location, location,location.",5,2009,07,07
105,"Great room, fantastic service, amazing location - will stay again.","I stayed at the Chesterfield last week and had a wonderful experience. The staff were attentive and friendly from the moment we arrived right up until we left. The room was great and had everything we needed and was really comfortable. The hotel is walking distance from the west end and located in a great part of london. Breakfast consisted of a buffet selection of fresh fruit etc, however the full english breakfast was cooked to order and was fantastic. I genuinely enjoyed my time there and would recommend highly.",5,2009,07,07
105,Service with a broad smile,"Having stayed at this hotel for one night only I wasn't able to experiance the full quallity of the staff and accomodation. However, the service we received during our stay was the most pleasurable experiance of the year so far. You are greeted by a doorman with a very large smile and from then on it just got better. There is no parking at the hotel but they will take your car from the front door to an NCP car park, all you have to pay is the rip off NCP overnight charge. we arrived at 5.15 and were advised that parking is free on single yellow lines after 6.30 and it would be cheaper if they parked my car on a meter then moved it oposite the hotel at 6.30. This free service saved me over £32.00, thank you whoever moved my car

The room was spotless when we arrived and after rushing to get showered and changed for the theatre it looked like a bomb had hit it!!! Upon our return and night cap in the bar we were greeted with the room completely restored to pristine condition

If you are going to a show in the west end you can easily walk to theatre land, we didn't realise how close we were and took a cab. Because of the traffic it took 25 minutes to go about 1 mile, therefore we decided to walk back which took about the same length of time

If anyone reading this revue has booked to stay I AM VERY JEALOUS, enjoy yourselves x",5,2009,07,05
105,A good reason to visit London,"The kindness, helpfulness and courtesy of the staff is equalled by the first rate dining room and the hopitality of the Bar, having tried many London hotels we have at last found a place which of itself would be a good reason to visit London",5,2009,06,30
105,Weekend Package at it's best,"We booked this hotel using the weekend package deal, more expensive than we would normally  have paid for a weekend trip to London, but the extra money was worth the extra treatment we received.  We had a free bottle of Champagne and an afternoon cream tea also inlcuded in the price.  The food and the service at this hotel was excellent, the best breakfast I have eaten anywhere.  My only 'gripe' was the size of the bathroom, very small, including the width of the bath which meant that water from the shower went everywhere.  Also drinks were on the expensive side, £9 for a vodka and diet coke which does seem a little excessive to me, but hey we were in Mayfair.  Apart from those two things our weekend experience was fantastic and we will seriously consider other 'Red Carnation' hotels in the future.  Thank you The Chesterfield.",5,2009,06,27
105,A Real Treat,"My wife booked us into the Chesterfield for a short stay to coincide with a theatre trip. This was her surprise gift to me to celebrate my 60th birthday. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere and we felt very comfortable and at ease during our stay. The staff are very friendly, professional and attentive without crossing the invisible line and becoming intrusive. The food is wonderful and if you can eat a full English breakfast and manage to finish all your toast, you're a better man than me. A well stocked bar is an excellent dropping off place for a nightcap before bedtime. On reaching your room, you'll find your bed has been turned down for you. The Chesterfield is a real treat, we'll be going back.",5,2009,06,27
105,Not as nice as I expected,"My husband and I had a two-week European vacation. We also stayed at a sister property, the Montague on the Gardens in Bloomsbury. I enjoyed our stay much more at the Montague. We had a package that included a Superior King room, a bottle of Crystal and a full English breakfast at the Chesterfield.

The room was not as nice as the pictures on the website. We were told that it had just been remodeled, but it had a musty smell.  

This was the smallest room we had during our entire vacation, and it didn’t help that they tried to put too much furniture in the room. There was a rolling chair that had to be shoved under the desk (that ran the whole length of the room and included a dresser and the mini bar) in order for you to walk in front of the bed. It had a turquoise and brown color scheme that was not to my tastes.  

The English breakfast was wonderful. It was served in the hotel restaurant, and there was a list of entries that you were able to choose from.  We had lunch one day at the Only Running Footman Pub that is down the street from the hotel.  We enjoyed our meal there and the atmosphere.

The hotel was only a 15 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and about a 30 minute walk to Hyde Park.",3,2009,06,26
105,I can recommend the Chesterfield Hotel for visits to London,"I stayed for a long weekend in June 2009 and had the most wonderful time.  From the moment the taxi drew up outside the hotel I was looked after so well.
The suite was decorated beautifully,  the service was 1st class and the staff always had a smile and a greeting.
As I had a lot to do over the weekend, the only meals I had were breakfast.  The breakfast menu was excellent and the food was hot (warm food is one of my pet hates).  
I stayed  at the Chesterfield Mayfair on my own but I can't wait to go back with my husband, he will love it.",5,2009,06,25
105,"In Brit Terms, The Chesterfield Mayfair is ""Brilliant!""","The Chesterfield Mayfair has it all: superb location, attentive service, warmth and British charm. The concierge staff -- especially Tony and Chris -- are extraordinary, offering wonderful advice on restaurants, transit (even during a Tube strike), theater and attractions. Rooms are on the small side, but tastefully appointed -- the most comfortable hotel beds in the world! We would not hesitate to recommend this gem to anyone.",5,2009,06,20
105,Great hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. very good experience. the hotel staffs are very well trained. they are very kind and very helpful. nice decorations of the room, clean and comfortable. a few minutes walk to Hyde Park and near to many places of interest. recommend.",5,2009,06,17
105,The ONLY place to stay in London,What a terrific place. The staff was sincerely attentive and the service exceptional. I have stayed at several London hotels and this was without question the most enjoyable in every regard. True English hospitality.,5,2009,06,16
105,Just perfect!,"If you want a great location, attentive and charming service, comfortable accommodation then this is just the place.
We had a one night stay in the Chesterfield and found the reception staff especially efficient and thoughtful. They had even signed a birthday card for my daughter! The concierge advised us the cheapest way to buy last minute theatre tickets rather than booking them for us through an agency who apparently charge commission which was fantastic and saved us a lot of money.
On Saturday morning a member of staff offered to store our bags for the day, whilst we shopped, before we had even thought to ask..
Our room was delightful.
Need I say more?",5,2009,06,16
105,When staying in London its got to be the Chesterfield.,"On returning to the Chesterfield after an absence of almost two years, my wife and i found it just as good as it was before,a truly wonderful experience.
           The staff are polite and helpful and nothing is to much trouble,the location of the hotel is great being in a quiet part of Mayfair but convienient for the shops and theatres.
But it really is the ambience of the Chesterfield that sets it apart,simply superb.",5,2009,06,14
105,Brilliant,"Staff very friendly , helpful and courteous. Nothing too small was a problem for them when asking questions.

Room facilities excellent .  Room cleaned daily and bed turned down at night.

Sorry I did not manage to use leisure facilities.

Although pricy for a single person.  I would use this hotel again as it is central for all",5,2009,06,13
105,"Superb Service, Excellent Location, and Comfortable Guest Rooms!","My wife and I stayed in London for 21 days.  We stayed at a different mid-range hotel south of Kensington our first two nights, and we rented a flat north of Kensington near Notting Hill Gate tube station for 16 nights.  We decided to stay in a more up-market hotel during our last three nights and chose this hotel in Mayfair.

We arrived at the hotel at around noon.  We were greeted by a door man who graciously took the three pieces of luggage we had just lugged from the Green Park tube station.  We were warmly greeted by reception upon entering the lobby even though we were not dressed in suits and professional garb like the rest of the guests waiting to check out in the lobby.  The staff person at reception was courteous, prompt, and very polite.  We received our keys to a room that she described as a favorite of hers for couples.  I thought that this was hyperbole at first, but after the bell hop took our luggage and showed us to our room, I realized that she was being sincere!  It was a very nice corner room decorated in an elegant fashion.   My wife especially enjoyed that there were two windows in the room.  I appreciated that the room was not facing the street and that it was on the 5th (6th in the U.S.) floor.

We had afternoon tea at 4 p.m. and I believe that it was the most luxurious full tea I have ever had.  The tea was promptly served, the scones, cakes, and sandwiches were generously proportioned and delicious.  The room was decorated in a way that emphasized romance and elegance.  The staff was very attentive without being intrusive.  This tea was memorable in every way.

After returning in the evening, we found that the room had been ""turned down"" and that a chilled bottle of champagne inside a ice bucket had been left on the dressing table.  We were very please.  But, we didn't have the energy to drink alcohol that night and saved it for the next evening when the staff was kind enough to bring a fresh bucket of ice for our champagne!

Internet access is available from two computers in a lower floor.  We used this to obtain our boarding passes.  I used it before to catch up on e-mail and to post on Facebook.  I really appreciated this opportunity to communicate with family and friends at the close of our trip.

We had breakfast at the hotel every morning.  The service was excellent because they were professional, but not cold.  The breakfast choices ran the gamut from a traditional English cooked breakfast to a continental style breakfast from a juice, fruit, yogurt, etc. bar available.  The food was scrumptious! 

The morning that we checked out illustrated to me how well this hotel is managed and just how good the staff really is.  As we checked out, they offered to keep our luggage while we did some last minute sightseeing/shopping.  And when we declined, they offered to get a car service for us.  And when we declined that and asked to be permitted to exit toward the back where a mews is located so that we could walk to the tube station, they were very accommodating.  

As a member of the rapidly dwindling middle-class, I truly felt that this hotel lived up to its reputation as a luxury boutique hotel because its staff treated us as if we were deserving of spectacular treatment.  I would never hesitate to recommend this to family and friends.  Including members of ethnic minorities.  As a member of one who often notices little signs of negative treatment, I can say without reservation, that I never felt singled out for less than admirable treatment by the staff.

p.s.  Management left a note stating that a neighbor had scheduled a party that night that was supposed to end by  11 p.m.  The fact that the management left such a note was both wise and classy.  Furthermore, management demonstrated it's concern for the comfort of its guests by indicating that they intended to undertake measures to ensure that the (loud) party would not go beyond 11 p.m. I was up until midnight and was pleased to note that the music had died down and that I could get some sleep.",4,2009,06,10
105,First class hotel with matching service in a great location!,"Just spent the weekend at The Chesterfield. Booked it thru Hotels direct(paid 1/3 of normal price and got breakfast inc too) Its a 5 min walk from Green Park tube. Pictures online made it look a little old style and stuffy, far from it!
Weekend was a birthday treat for my mother, having never taken her away before and knowing how fussy she is, was a tad nervous.
We arrived at 10.30am and although rooms were not available until 2 they took our bags and put them in our rooms for when we returned late afternoon. It was raining on arrival but we were given hotel umbrellas to use for duration of stay, nice touch.
The rooms were immaculate and had everything you could need. The single rooms are not massive but more than enough. I have enclosed pics of room and bathroom.
Ha drinks in the bar late Friday and Saturday night, not cheap(£9-00 for double Hendricks & tonic) but this is London. Chap playing piano,not my scene but was pleasant.
My mother met a friend for afternoon tea on saturday and said it was gorgeous,praise indeed!
Breakfast was continental buffet and everything from fresh fruit,yoghurt,meet and cheeses inc all types of pastry were available in a beautiful dining room with outdoor seating for when the sun came out:))
I'm a young-ish person and would normally say that this hotel was aimed more at the middle to older aged group, however, for style, location,service and total hospitallity i just couldn't fault it. Would i return? YES and i have booked again already for when i bring my girlfriend to a gig next month. 
I paid £209 for 2xsingle rooms inc breakfast, normal price £330. Got this deal thru HotelDirect
If you can get a great deal then go for it, you won't be disspointed.",5,2009,06,09
105,Wonderful hotel with lots of character,"Booked this hotel through the secret hotels and what a great weekend it turned out to be. Hotel ideally situated for theatre land, just a few minutes walk. Staff were wondferful, especially at reception.  Rooms are beautifully decorated, not everbodys cup of tea with the decor, but all of an excellent standard. The hotel knew about it being our anniversary weekend, so added a special touch at breakfast. 
Just to be aware that not all rooms have a bath!!",5,2009,06,03
105,Great Mayfair hotel,"We spent last weekend of may at this lovely small hotel.
We took advantage of the Mayfair weekend package for a superior king room. Mine was 216 a small one overlooking a back courtyard and a wall and was a smoking room too. It was not a great problem and luckly  the windows was partially unlock so a little fresh air come into the room. The room was classic but a little old  without a minibar and with an old bulky TV. As I don't use neither of them wasn't a great loss. The bathroom is small but well organized and with excellent  bathrobe and towels, sleepers were comfortable too. The staff is very friendly and cooperative, waiters are very professionals and try to accommodate every request.  Location is excellent of course if you know the area that is one of the most elegant of this great town. The breackfast was good as the afternoon tea.",4,2009,06,02
105,Chesterfield Mayfair exceeded our expectations,"Located on a quiet street in Mayfair, the Chesterfield was a wonderful choice after recommendations from 2 sources. Perfectly located near the Green Park Tube, the hotel allows an easy walk thru the park to Buckingham Palace and then on thru St. James Park to the Cabinet War Rooms, Westminster Abbey, etc. Around the corner from the hotel is Shepherd's Market, a quaint area with numerous, small shops and restaurants: a French Brasserie, Italian Trattoria, Indian Restaurant, and several others. A perfect place to eat before the theater.  The hotel concierege was gracious and helpful; dining room staff efficient and friendly; the common rooms lovely. My husband and I would definitely return to his hidden gem.",5,2009,06,02
105,Confortable and Charming,"It has been really a pleasure to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff has been extremely kind with us and we enjoyed a lot the atmosphere and facilities of the hotel.
Fantastic location and very attractive weekend rates.",5,2009,05,27
105,Exellence is a rare find these days..but we found it here at thishotel.,"Many hotels worth mentioning these days are normally run by corporate companies......leaving the smaller ones to pick up the pieces.This will never apply to the chesterfield in mayfair if they carry on doing what they are.Every request is carried out with so much pleasure to serve,even the piano player is happy to play a request in the bar whilst having a drink.A truelly memorable stay....so much as to say ""any time we are in london the chesterfield will be our choice of hotel"".",5,2009,05,27
105,Great stay at this hotel,"Enjoy the afternoon tea and the restaurant.
Great location, professional staff.",5,2009,05,25
105,A REAL GEM!,"My daughter and I have been planning a trip to London for several years, and were delighted to have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair!  We relied on TripAdvisor to guide us to a highly-rated hotel and were not disappointed.  The location is fantastic -- close to shopping, sightseeing, and in beautiful Mayfair.  It is within easy walking distance of the Green Park tube station.  The thing that sets the Chesterfield Mayfair apart is SERVICE.  The staff are attentive, friendly, and helpful at all times.  We both highly recommend this hotel!  The service is top-notch.",5,2009,05,20
105,We had the most enjoyable stay...,"We will definitely come back. We found our place to stay in London.
Our room was beautiful - full of little attentions. The ambiance is very warm and the bar is a nice to rest after a day shopping/visits.",5,2009,05,20
105,"Excellent Service, Great Price, Perfect Vacation","My mother and I have been planning a trip to the UK for quite some time and after reading numerous reviews, and the advice of our travel agent, we selected the Chesterfield Mayfair.  From the time we arrived, the staff was extremely courteous accomodating and pleasant at all times.  The location of the hotel is within a 5 minute walk of the tube, and near a number of excellent pubs and parks.  When it came to the hotel itself, we were very impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms--the beds were extremely comfortable, and the bathrooms are luxurious--just perfect after a long day of exploring the city.  We also quite enjoyed room service one evening--the food was above par for a hotel, and the delivery woman inquired later on if we enjoyed the food--a level of service you typically do not receive these days.  Turn down service was consistent, and the cleaning staff was always thorough and very nice.  The rooms were in excellent condition, however, our view was not too intriguing out the window (although we did not request a good view).  The staff were always ready to answer questions, suggest restaurants, and assist us with good money exchange locales.  Even though my luggage was a day late in arriving, the staff consistently checked up on it, and delivered it to my room once it arrived.  Overall, we REALLY enjoyed the stay and service with the Chesterfield, and upon return, will stay there again.",5,2009,05,19
105,Elegant hotel - bad service,"Me and my son (11 1/2 years old) had wrote in an e-mail to the hotel that we wanted a room early in the morning since we came right from America. When we arrived, the hotelroom was not ready. I had to sit in the lobby over an hour with my son sleeping beside me. We were both very tired and exhausted. Since we should up very early next morning (04.45) I telephoned room-service so we could have breakfast before we should take taxi to the airport. I was told that we could get what we wanted from the continental menu, except cooked food. We were very disappointed when room-service came with our breakfast. We got wrong juices and wrong food. We went hungry from the hotel. 
The hotel is nice decorated and everything looks great on the surface, but I'm sorry to tell that the service was zero.",2,2009,05,18
105,A perfect base for our London vacation.,"Simply put, the Chesterfield is a wonderful hotel - luxurious and comfortable, just what we'd imagined for our London trip. The staff was very helpful with dinner recommendations and getting us theater tickets. The location was perfect for our daily adventures - easy access to the Tube or walking to parks and city sites through great neighborhoods. We would definitely stay at the Chesterfield again and hope to soon!",5,2009,05,16
105,Little Gem,"Whenever I visit London I always stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair situated in a quiet street just off Berkley Square.  It is like walking into a family or friend's home.  The staff are excellent, resturant and food superb never been disappointed.
Ghazalla",5,2009,05,16
105,At last a real deal !,"We have stayed in several 4 stars hotels in London and believe me this hotel is one of the best ones. 
most of them are over rated and over priced .So it  was a real treat for us to find this hotel .Staying in this hotel  is really part of your experience of being in london .
Superb location, traditional English decore' and most importantly, 5 star customer service .",5,2009,05,14
105,Unmatched level of service,"The hotel is a gem in Mayfair where our extended family stayed for two nights for our daughter's wedding. The bedrooms are well appointed (with a superb bridal suite), the restaurant, conservatory and bar are attractive and welcoming, and the standard of service could not have been better, with the friendliest and most helpful hotel staff I have come across in a long while.",5,2009,05,13
105,LOVED THE LOCATION,"We recently spent one night at the Chesterfield Mayfair, we were booked into room 415 which overlooked the front of the hotel.
The room was clean and comfortable, huge bed, with tea and coffee making facilities and complimentary water provided.  Nightly turn down service also included.  The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with directions etc.  I loved the old charm of the hotel and if I stayed again would book afternoon tea which l regret not doing.  
We had continental breakfast included in the rate which had lots of choice and a complimentary newspaper delivered to the room.
This is a perfect hotel if you are looking  for a location to stay close to shops and  the theatre district, a taxi from/to Euston station was approx £13.00 one way taking around 10/15 minutes.
The only let down for us was after returning home we realised my husband had left his jumper in  the room hanging up and after making several calls to the hotel they have no trace of it.  Such a pity otherwise our stay  would of have been perfect.",4,2009,05,11
105,Absolutely lovely gem in Mayfair,"We recently stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for one night, and found it absolutely lovely and charming. It's a small boutique-style hotel with old style furnishings (though not downtrodden in the least); the rooms were a good size; the staff extremely helpful and professional; and a good price. We would definitely stay here again. Also, you must dine at Tamarind (Indian food) around the corner. It's fabulous.",5,2009,05,08
105,Loved it,"All good, read the other reviews, they are all spot-on correct. My queen room wasn't as nice as the web pictures but still pretty comfy.

The 24 hour bar off the lobby was too cool to compare.

The international staff was A+ #1 ! ! ! 

During my stay, my colleagues stayed at the modern Park Lane Intercon. I spent some time there and realized it was waaaay more expensive but not nearly as inviting or nice...other than the 7' goddesses hosting at the Randall restaurant  that any man should consider crawling though broken glass to get a glimpse at.

PS. go to KOKO's in Camden for some wild live music.",5,2009,05,04
105,Exceeded our expectations in all respects.,"Wonderful hotel, beautifully appointed with excellent service. I was traveling with my wife and 16 yo son. We had a junior suite with two full bathrooms. Staff at the front desk were very helpful with all our requests. Breakfast (included in the rate) was excellent and the hotel location is ideal.",5,2009,05,03
105,Absolutely fantastic,"Cannot fault this hotel absolutely superb from the moment you walk in the door, service throughout our stay exceptional to many moments to praise the staff for their attentive behaviour throughout. 
We dont normally consider booking the same hotel, but this hotel exceeds any other hotel we have stayed in over the world and on another trip to London would not hesitate. 
P.s. Their correspondance after we left was very appreciated and outstanding as to correct the only fault we could find and that was to make sure a mini bar was in our room next time we visited.",5,2009,05,01
105,A standard of service that makes you feel special and reminds you of what London is about,The staff at the Chesterfield could not have done more to make sure our stay was comfortable and pleasurable.  Along with the quality of food and drink and the experience behind the bar the whole experience matched what I always hope for in London but rarely find so many of those boxes ticked.,5,2009,04,26
105,One of our BEST hotel EXPERIENCES in past several years,"The Chesterfield is a jewel of a hotel well situated in the fashionable Mayfair District of London. The staff is professional and gracious and very attentive in both the hotel and the Butlers restraurant.  The decor throughout is lovely and our room was tastefully decorated and spotless.  We will definitely recommend the Chesterfield to our friends.

105,Fabulous experience,"We couldn't have asked for a better room, better service, or a better location than we found at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The staff was wonderful, catering to our every need with enthusiasm and a smile.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to experience the essence of London hospitality and elegance.",5,2009,04,25
105,fantastic,"Having being lucky enought to have stayed at this hotel on three different occasions recently i thought i had given them enough chances to get something wrong,but they came up with the goods everytime.I have stopped looking around now for better deals and will just book here when ever i need to be in London.The location is great for all you need to do in London,shops,shows and dinning.The only down point i have come across and i dont think it will bother most people is the lack of car parking at the hotel which does not exsist and the parking near bye is resident parking only.",4,2009,04,21
105,The perfect hotel for a once in a lifetime weekend,"I chose the Chesterfield for what I intended to be the backdrop for my 50th birthday celeb weekend with some special friends.  The main events of the weekend planned were  theatre / Thames speedboat ride and other activities, however rather than just provide  the accommodation, the hotel also turned out to be an event in itself.  The rather English afternoon tea provided a perfect start to our weekend. The rooms especially the bathrooms were a pleasure.  I don't think I've ever stayed in hotel before where you are known by your name rather than a number.  On our first day's breakfast, a large table had been reserved so we all sat together; choice was excellent.  The location was perfect, a small street in Mayfair, but only a short distance from the shops. The only issue we had was an over zealous steam iron which leaked.  When we all left on Sunday, even though it had been my 50th birthday celeb weekend, I think we all took away some special memories and the Chesterfield had contributed in a big way to the success of the weekend.",5,2009,04,20
105,Fantastic Hotel,"I just returned from three days in London with my ten year old daughter. After reading positive reviews of the Chesterfield Mayfair I booked it and was absolutely, positively pleased with our stay there. The rooms are a bit tight but very well appointed in that classic British style and since we were in London to see London we did not spend a lot of time in our room. The location and the friendliness of the staff is above par. We were central to the tube, the parks and a block away tucked into a court yard called Shepards Market is an assortment of pubs and restaurants with a divergence of cuisines. The Chesterfield Mayfair was a delight and a home run with my daughter enough said!",5,2009,04,19
105,"Nice hotel, try to get a deal.","This is a delayed review but I made detailed notes of my travels and well remember this hotel.

The hotel is in an excellent area of the city, but was still a fair walk from a tube station (5-10 min walk).

Buffet breakfast was included, and it was generous with an excellent selection.  We were able to gorge ourselves on this wonderful breakfast so we weren't hungry until later in the afternoon.  Saves food costs, which in London are substantial.  If you need bottled drinks, snacks, or toiletries, there was a nearby Sainsbury's supermarket.

The room was beautiful and well kept.  Very luxurious bed.  The bathroom was clean and fine, though the bathrobes behind the door were so poofy and large they were intrusive and we had to move them outside.  A minor issue, but it just made the bathroom seem more cramped.  I also remember that the shower had a *very* high wall, so I could imagine people with mobility problems might have trouble getting in.  And getting out was like climbing down a wet, slippery hill.  A little scary.  The room had a very convenient ""do not disturb"" switch on the wall.  I've never seen that before, though its never a big deal to hang the do not disturb sign on the doorknob if they didn't have this switch.

Our room deal came with included champagne and chocolate.  We asked for the champagne to be waiting for us when we arrived home after seeing Les Miserables one night.  When we came home (Les Mis was superb), the champagne was not there.  We had to call down for it.  Not very good service, since we had given a specific request.  We also received a free tea brunch, but we found the staff inattentive.  I ordered a ""chocolate"" tea selection, and after much delay received some scones which were nice but it wasn't what I ordered.  And then we were ignored for perhaps 30 minutes?  We were given no explanation for this, and there were many servers and few guests so they shoud have had time for us.  Considering this was a selling feature to the hotels website deal (English tea service), we found the lack of service and courtesy inexcusable considering the posh-ness of the hotel and upscale area.  I did complain to one of the servers, and she was very nice and apologetic, and gave me back my tea coupon which we used the next day.  The next day's service was fine, so they did make up for this problem.

London hotels are expensive, but this was on the verge of traumatic for a value traveller, considering it didn't really wow us.  There are other hotels that would be more value for money.  A decent hotel or B&B close to a tube station, and you're on your way.

Overall it's a lovely hotel, but the service was lacking and I am sure there are better ones for same or less money.  But it is London, so nothing is cheap.  I would recommend this hotel.",4,2009,04,17
105,Excellent-The best hotel in London,"Having just spent Easter at this hotel I would recommend it to everyone. 
We were looking for a Central London hotel at a reasonable price that was clean and of a good quality. I had seen a great deal on this hotel and all thereviews seemed positive. Neither the hotel nor the reviews let us down.
The hotel is central to allow easy access to shopping (it is just off Piccadilly and only 10 mins from Regent Street). It is within easy walking distance to many of the central theatres and Green Park is only 5 mins away which gives a leaisurley 2 minute walk across it to BuckinghamPalace (and then onwards to Westminster etc if required).
The mangement of the hotel at front desk and within the restaurant were as helpful as you could ever expect in any top hotel anywhere in the world. Newspapers provided free to the room each morning.
The room itself was not large but was of a very high standard both of cleanliness and the facilities it offered. There was the usual hairdryer (high powered) and full tea,coffee and hot chocolate making facilities. Lovely towels and individual bath robes. Maid service to the room from turning down the beds in early evening to providing extra tea and coffee was first class.
We only took breakfast in the hotel. Our charge included full English which was very good and again the waiters were more than happy to mix from the various (large) selection on offer. The only negative bit here would be if you booked without breakfast as full english would have been an additional £22.50 - a bit steep.
We travel alot both in the UK and overseas and I would rank this hotel up with the best as value for money and undoubtably better than any other I have stayed at in London either for leisure or work.",5,2009,04,15
105,Nice shopping weekend,"Hotels in London are small and so are the rooms at Chesterfield. But they have managed to get the most out of the space available.

Even before arriving we had a great service in that the Hotel send us a great guide on how to arrive at the best Hotel from Heathrow.
Room was ready at arrivial as was a nice bottle of champagne included in the weekend package.

Breakfast next day proved to be a bit of surprise in every positive way. A la carte eggs - never tried that before.  Buffet had everything I would exaect and some.

After a nice shopping trip we came back and got the tickets we ordered at the reception for a musical in one of Londons theatres. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea also included in stay.

All in all a very pleasant stay and I would certainly recommend anyone to make a stay at Chesterfield and check out the weekend deals at the red carnation hotels.",5,2009,04,09
105,Oldest scam in the book!,"Well, I know times are hard, but it takes something for a hotel to pull the oldest scam in the book - put a non-smoker in a smoking room, and the only non-smoking room available happens to require an upgrade. Tsk, tsk Chesterfield, you've lost 2 first-time guests who will not be returning.",1,2009,04,07
105,Disappointing won't stay here again,"We arrived on a Monday at 3:30pm only to find our room was not ready. We were told we could wait in the bar area and no complementary drinks were provided. Also reception were poor in giving information on when the room would be ready and other details such as where the restaurant was located, breakfast times ect. We booked this hotel on the basis of the general good reviews written on trip-adviser- but find that this hotel is greatly overated. We stayed in a superior king which although nicely decorated was very small and not as clean as we would have liked eg/ fabric walls had layer of dust around the tops. We were disappointed that after sitting in the bar for over an hour on a Tuesday evening no pianist was playing- when we asked where he was we were told he was on a break- a long break by any ones standards.
The only real good thing about this hotel is the central location.",3,2009,04,06
105,Fantastic hotel,"I had booked a junior suite on the web using the 3 nights for the price of 2 offer. Upon check-in they said that I had been upgraded to an executive suite, the Dormer Suite. The room was beautiful, and included a king bed in the large bedroom, marble bath with a seperate shower stall and and additional shower head in the tub, and a sitting room with a sofa, 2 chair and a desk with another chair. 

A complementary decanter of sherry was on the sideboard, as well as coffee and tea making supplies. It was nice to see a proper teapot and kettle instead of expecting you to run water through a coffee maker to heat it. The tea selection was impressive.

We ate dinner in the restaurant and I had the carving trolley, which is a large silver trolley with the roast of the day and they carve it tableside. Considering the class of hotel and location, I though it was good value at £16.50.

Overall it was a great hotel, and for what we paid the room was an incredible value for the amenities and location. We'll stay there again the next time we're in London.",5,2009,04,06
105,Great value at an excellent location in London,"Ok... the key word is  value.  Is it the best hotel in London, no. The fanciest, no. The most glamourous, no. However, for the price, location, atmosphere, and friendly staff, it is hard to beat.

The rooms where I stayed  we rather small, but elegant and functional.  

I felt like a special guest from the moment I walked in the door.  The staff is truly friendly.

I had requested a non-smoking room but they didn't have one for the first night of my stay.  As agreed, they moved my belongings to another room then next day.",4,2009,04,05
105,lived up to expectations.......,"having stayed at the milestone ,a sister hotel within this group....we found the chesterfield was superior to the 5 star milestone.
Upon check in we were upgraded free of charge to a junior suite...very grateful as was my partner's birthday.staff were superb and very helpful.i still find the size of the rooms on the small side,but are fantastically finished with all personal touches.i suggested in room spa treatments would be an added bonus.
Breakfast was a good selection although we found the waiting staff a little 'distracted'.
Will definately return and try Butlers for dinner next time.
Excellant location as we ate at The Square restaurant on the sat night.
Wonderful experiance...we love Red Carnation hotels and are going to Summer Lodge in May for our anniversary!
KEEP IT UP............",5,2009,04,05
105,Staff did it all!,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and I got a superior room on the first floor, unfortunately I had expected a flowery female room but got a very maritim room for a man, which was a little unlucky, but the room, even though it was small it had everything you could ask for. After the first night, I asked for a twin room since a friend was coming and staying with me and that was arranged very quickly by the staff and I did not have to pay someting in between. Staff helped me to carry my things to the new room and the new room was on the fifth floor, and nicely decorated with more female colors which we appreciated. 

Unfortunatly I was food poisoned (at a SOHO resturant) and called down to the reception and asked for more complementary water, I also said that I were going to spend the entire room in the hotel so that the cleaning lady should not come during the day. Just after 5 min the manager of the hotel called me and said that she heard that I was sick and asked if there was anything she or the staff could do to make my day better, I thought that was very nice and thoughful of them and it ment a lot to me. 

I used the wifi everyday (for free) and it was really fast and good!

The other days were fine and we appreciated the stay very much for the service and that you felt safe in the hotel, service is excellent and you can expect to get help regarding the question. 

The only thing that was negative from my perspective was that the wall between our room (526) and the room next door was a little bit thin so you could hear their TV and when they were talking to eachother. But that did not bother me so much. 

From my perspective is staff and comfy bed the most important when I go on a business trip and this hotel have so good staff and the beds and linen are so nice, even the pillow was soft and nice (they always tend to be to high and hard)

(I am using my fiance's profile for this review since I do not have my own yet)",4,2009,04,05
105,A little disappointed relative to expectation,"I chose this hotel for two reasons, the generally excellent reviews on Tripadvisor, and a  prior good experience of this hotel group in an English Country House hotel, which they carried off very well.

So I had quite high expectations ...

I called ahead to check the check-in time (1400).  But when I arrived (1530) my room wasn't ready and wouldn't be until 1800 (this was a quiet Monday, but it  had been a busy weekend apparently).  I was offered a somewhat superior room but asked to pay an extra £20.  I expressed my displeasure and, after a minute or so of consulting with a superior, I was given the superior room free of charge.

The room itself was of reasonable standard, though pretty small (I'm glad I didn't have my original one!) and a little noisy for a while as it was near a function room being set up for the evening.  But generally I had a comfortable stay and an adequate breakfast.

On the positive side the staff - initial check-in friction excepted - were indeed friendly, helpful and knowledgable.

All in all the stay was OK, but I wouldn't rush back.",3,2009,04,02
105,Pleasant traditional hotel with tiny rooms,"The Chesterfield is a pleasant, traditional hotel in a great location on a quiet street just off Berkeley Square in Mayfair. It is one of the most highly rated hotels on TripAdvisor for London, a distinction which might be a little too generous. 

London is know for small and expensive rooms, but the rooms here are uncomfortably tiny. I booked a  Superior King room and was a bit surprised by just how small it was. I have stayed in London on many occasions, and this room was by far the smallest I have seen. Not a great place if you have a lot of luggage or travel with someone else. Lovely room if you like the traditional touches, and well appointed by any standards, but tiny. And the bathroom is even worse--certainly not room for two people. And if you are anything more than skinny, the shower might be a bit tight for you as well.  

I booked the Mayfair Weekend with included a full English Breakfast and Afternoon Tea, and both were fantastic food-wise. The scones are simply wonderful, and the service is friendly and efficient. The breakfast room again is a question of personal taste--very traditional. At 200 pounds per night, the Mayfair weekend is a good deal for two nights with the breakfast, afternoon tea, bottle of champagne, free Internet, bottled water and late check-out.  

As mentioned, the location is fantastic, with easy access to the Piccadilly Line via Green Park tube station. Most everything is in easy walking distance and Mayfair is extremely safe, even late at night.  

Overall, a great place for slender tourists on a first trip to London. Business people and those seeking a bit of personal space around them might be happier somewhere else--the rooms are simply uncomfortably small.

I would likely not stay there again simply because of the size of the rooms, but  I might recommend it to friends looking for a very ""English"" experience.",4,2009,04,02
105,Our favourite hotel in central London.,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield, it is in a great location and easy to get to. The staff were attentive and friendly and made us very welcome. Our room was excellent and really comfortable, we didn't want for anything.
Our favourite part was the delicious breakfast, great choices and wonderful service.
The only disappointment was that we could only stay one night but we will definitely book again and we will recommend it to our friends and family.",5,2009,04,01
105,The staff couldn't have been better in any way...,"Stayed here last weekend in twin room (304) with friend. At first disappointed with room, as nothing like those pictured on website: Meticulously decorated and extremely well-equipped, but small, and quite dreary colour-scheme. All very mann-ish - would suit a couple of blokes better (we were hoping for one of the completely over-done flowery numbers!). Hardly any space at end of beds, and bathroom really tiny. Having said all of that, there was LOADS of wardrobe and drawer space, LOADS of top quality toiletries, amazingly fluffy towels, tea and coffee tray with proper cafetiere and real coffee, free internet on TV in room (and also downstairs in the computer centre), real hairdryer (ladies, you know what I mean!), the most comfortable duvets, pillows etc., and even a stationery tray in the drawer! Staff were exceptionally friendly, welcoming and helpful - seemed to anticiapte every request and deal with them professionally and happily. We LOVED this place. Gorgeous little pub across the road (""The one and only footman""), 10 mins walk from Green Park tube and buses, one of the most beautiful and safest parts of London. There was even a friendly bloke in the building opposite who waved at us every time we looked out our window! I can't wait to come back to The Chesterfield!",5,2009,03,30
105,Absolutely Wonderful,"Husband & I decided to splurge & stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair post cruise. And it was worth every penny! Booked a special rate which included breakfast every day, tickets to King Tut, English High Tea and picnic. Location great in the heart of Mayfair - close to all the places you read about, the Ritz, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, the Dorchester etc. The small boutique hotel has old worldly feeling with service to match. The hotel was very accomodating and there was no problem switching one breakfast for a lunch. The concierge was in a class of his own - incredible. High tea was a meal in itself and the wonderful picnic so plentiful it fed not only ourselves but the relatives we visited (a family of 6).  We had upgraded to a superior room - it was comfortable but tiny compared to North American standards and had no view.",5,2009,03,26
105,A shining example of superb service,"We stayed here from 19-22 march and took advantage of a ""mayfair weekend"" package including breakfast, champagne and afternoon tea as well as late check out. We had room 419 which was at the end of a corridor and as such very quiet. From the minute you make your booking until the minute you check out you are treated to service as it should be - friendly, unobtrusive, caring and pleasant. Rooms are small but good with quality fittings and an attention to detail often missed at other similarly starred hotels. Everthing worked as expected and rooms exactly shown as on their website.

Breakfast was probably the best ever at a hotel. Choice was extensive and it did not stop there. I overheard an American family on the next table order their breakfast and was astounded at their choices (what is it about our american friends and their weird sense of food combinations?!) but the waiting staff did not miss a beat and duly obliged.

At the bar we were treated to quiet but efficient service (pricey though!) and afternoon tea in the conservatory was everything that you would expect. Nothing was too much trouble throughout and everyone from the chambermaids to front desk were charming. A true example of the customer as king and meaning what you say and do.

I have stayed at other Red Carnation hotels and am a firm supporter and advocate. You will not be disappointed at a stay here.",5,2009,03,23
105,"Overall pleasant stay, with a few minor issues.","We stayed in a Superior King room for 5 nights in February 2009.  While the location is good, the bed extremely comfortable, and the service attentive, a few problems we encountered would make me think twice before staying here again in the future.  First of all, the wifi service, while included with the room rate, was down for the entire night on 3 of our 5 nights there.  This is a problem for me.  Also, we ordered room service one evening and the chicken breast in my salad was very undercooked and had to be sent back, and the chicken noodle soup tasted like hot water added to a soup packet.  However, the daily complimentary water, fruit and biscuits were appreciated. If you don't use the internet in hotels and don't plan on ordering room service, this hotel would be a good choice.",4,2009,03,22
105,An excellent hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel when visiting London. It's in a great location, with Green Park station just around the corner. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. Rooms are great. Top class hotel. Will be back here again when in London.",5,2009,03,20
105,Enjoyed our Stay at Chesterfield Mayfair,"The most important features of a hotel for us are the location, the bed and service.  
With the Chesterfield Mayfair, the location is excellent, just a few blocks from Hyde Park, a short walk to Buckingham Palace or Oxford Street, and the subway was just around the corner.  
The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were big.  
The service was friendly and helpful.  The decor is extreme English...I thought it was over the top but if you are visiting London for the first time, it may be charming.  
Breakfast was good and served till 11 am so if you are a late sleeper...no problem.  Make sure when you make your reservations that the breakfast is included, otherwise, it's expensive.  
Overall, I think the Tripadvisor reviews had my expectations extremely high and I felt a bit disappointed during our stay.  But overall this is a nice place and a good value for staying in the Mayfair neighborhood.  I would recommend this hotel but I would try another during my next trip to London.",4,2009,03,18
105,Over And Over Again,"Every time I visit London I stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair. It’s become my home away from home, for real. I stayed there by myself and with my family as well, and every time I felt the warmest attitude of the staff and their sincere readiness to do their best for making me happy. The personnel are the main treasure of this beautiful hotel. Kasia and Peter at the Front Office, Darren at the Concierge, Loris at the Butler’s Restaurant (btw, my cordial congrats to Loris with his prestigious 2008 – 2009 professional titles) – I’m ready to mention almost everyone, and all of them are great, and it’s them who make The Chesterfield Mayfair incredibly  popular among travelers all over the world. 
Besides its great personalized service, The Chesterfield Mayfair got many other advantages:
-    Stylish rooms decorated in lovely traditional English manner – wherever I’ve stayed – either in regular double or super-king bedrooms, or a junior suite - all the premises possessed the fleur of chic and comfort;
-     Appropriate price-quality ratio bearing in mind that hotels in London are extremely expensive;	 
-     A lot of special offers – don’t miss my favorite “A Classic Weekend Break” including accommodation for two, daily full English breakfast (Scottish salmon bagel is a must), one traditional 5 o’clock tea at Conservatory for two (unforgettable, reservation required), a bottle of nice French champagne  in room upon arrival, and late 6pm check-out;
-         Nice pre-theatre dinners at the Butler’s;
-	Unbeatable location between Piccadilly and Oxford streets;
-	Short walk distance to the Green Park tube station, St. James Park, Buckingham Palace, Royal Horse Guard, White Hall, Trafalgar Square, the Houses of Parliament.
And have you been thinking still guys where to stay in London?",5,2009,03,18
105,"Most helpfull, friendly staff I,ve ever found","My husband and I found this hotel on the net Dec 2008 we went there for our wedding anniversary and could not get over the relaxed and friendly  staff , yet still very profesional.
The hotel itself was lovely , perfect location to explore london but be away from the hustle and bustle .
So because we loved it so much we went back in Feb 2009 , and again can,t complain at all , in fact Peter one of the supurb staff help out with my husbands new jacket he had bought that day ,when we were ready to go out that evening we noticed the surcurtity tag had been left on, so I went to reception to ask for any help or advice and Peter went running round london to find a shop still open to get the tag removed , which he managed to do so my husband was able to wear his jacket and we had a gret evening.
Having stayed in several more famous 5 star London hotels I would be surprised to find that level of service while still being friendly.",5,2009,03,14
105,A terrific hotel that I'd receommend to most anyone,"I've stayed in many fine hotels in great locations in London (this one near Marble Arch with plenty of access to things you want to see/places you want to go). I particularly liked the Chesterfield Mayfair for several reasons: the service was terrific--from sending free bottled water up to the room on a moment's notice to efficiently fetching taxis and givign directions; the room was clean, quiet, and comfortable complete with lovely bed, a heated bathroom floor, and an iron/ironing board; and they have a gorgeous lounge and terrace: I prefer to eat out for obvious reasons (and dod so here) but I'll stay in at least once next time to enjoy the ambiance of these beautiful spaces of their's.",5,2009,03,04
105,What a brilliant place to stay,"We came to London for a weekend break with my wife and young son. We got to the hotel to be met by Chris who made us very welcome and explained all that we needed to know. Nothing could be too much trouble for him and the staff and even told us places that our son would be interested in. The room was just what we required. The extra touches, ie the heart shaped soap and the gifts for our son as well as the complimentaries, were an added bonus. The restaurant and staff was excellent together with the meals. The bar  was very cosy and relaxing. The hotel is close to the places of interest and the tube station is only a short walk away. All in all a fantastic place to stay and like an old saying you get what you pay for, and this was worth it!!",5,2009,02,26
105,Great Location and Friendly Staff,We stayed for 2 nights last weekend. Very nice hotel in very central location in mayfair. 10 min walk to Oxford St. Lots of nice restaurants around the corner in Shepherd Market.  We'll be back.,5,2009,02,23
105,Top Service - Wonderful staff - Great location - will be back!,"I stayed here in Feb 2009 with a group of friends - we were celebrating the 40th B'day - the hotel couldn't have done any more for us. Staff were friendly and helpful - the level service was wonderful.It's good value when you take into account the location, the afternoon tea provided, the champagne on arrival, the level of service, the heavenly beds and the quality of  the breakfast menu...I could go on! The bar is buzzy and a good spot to have a drink after a long days shopping! Location is a big plus - so easy to walk/taxi to shopping, restaurants etc. It's old worldly - so if you're looking for modern it's not the place for you. But if you are looking for a warm hotel experience in the heart of London this is the place for you.",5,2009,02,21
105,Best hotel ever - service and room was without fault,"Our stay at the Chesterfield was faultless.  Right from the initial contact with the hotel through to our departure, everything was amazingly friendly and efficient.  On booking we were asked about our preferences - bedding, diet, etc - and these requests were remembered throughout.  The room was beautiful and very clean. Afternoon tea is highly recommended; wonderful cakes, scones and sandwiches.  We will certainly return.",5,2009,02,15
105,Sweet Hotel in London,"Staff was very efficient and friendly.  Excellent communication via email during reservation process.  Good location, close to Green Park Underground, fun shopping, and great little restaurants around the corner (wonderful lunch at Caffe In).  

Room was clean.  Towels and linens top notch.  Bed was very comfortable and we slept well.  Fresh carnation in the bathroom and heart shaped soaps at turndown – nice touches.  

We were due to check in Monday and the BIG snow hit London.  We were coming in from Horsham and all the trains were cancelled.  We waited until late afternoon to see if the situation improved and it did not.  When we called to say we could not make it in, they did not charge us for the late cancellation and no- show due to the weather.  When we arrived very early the next day, our room was ready for us.  We enjoyed our stay!",4,2009,02,08
105,Im Lovin It,"Great hotel, have stayed many times over the past few years and It keeps getting better. The staff were so friendly, the service bang on and the location ideal!",5,2009,02,03
105,Good Stay aside from 1 or 2 things,"This hotel is tucked away in the beautiful Mayfair district of London. Great location, walking distance to Oxford Street for all the shoppers, Hyde Park and Bukingham Palace to name but a few places of interest.

Greeted very warmly when I arrived. I was a little early but my room was ready.  I did bring my own bag up as it was just a small one but the front desk did offer to have it brought up for me.

The room itself was small, but perfectly formed. In the centre of London you are not going to get massive rooms. The bed was comfy and the room in general very clean. If you are expecting high class Widescreen TV's this is not the place for you, its old style but everything works and looks in place in this hotel.

Went to the bar later afternoon to sit and read while i waited for my boyfriend who was arriving later that evening. The bar staff were very attentive and you could relax away a couple of hours in the very plesant atmosphere of the bar.

Had a booking in the restaurant (Butlers). This is the only place i had fault. The food was OK, nothing very special for the prices they charge. I did make a complaint to the head waiter that my Baileys coffee was cold, he just huffed at me and took it away and popped it in the mircowave and left it back onthe table without saying anything. I thought this was very rude. In an establishment like this if the coffee is cold - replace it dont microwave it. Needless to say i just left it there and did not drink it. This should have been taken off our bill but was not.

Had room service the following day and that was lovely - great club sandwich and very reasonably priced, arrived promptly and staff very nice.

Check out was very good as well and staff offered to store our bags as we wanted to go out walking before we had to depart to the airport.

All in all i had a really nice stay in this hotel. I would stay there again although i have to say i would not eat in the restaurant - there are plenty around the area to choose so would not be stuck for somewhere to go.",4,2009,02,03
105,"Great Locale, Excellent Service","For Americans, the Chesterfield's rooms will be small, but think of it as a B&B.  The rooms are very clean, the staff extremely helpful, and the service is excellent.  Although meals/drinks are expensive, you get what you pay for: first class all around.  At least the Internet/Wifi and Business Center are Free!

The location was the biggest draw for me: a few minutes to Green Park Underground Station, and a quick walk to excellent shopping in Mayfair.

I would stay here again for work, and even for holiday.",5,2009,02,02
105,Everything I had heard about the Mayfair was true!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Mayfair from December 28 '08 through January 3rd '09. We booked our vacation through American Airlines and had carefully read the TripAdvisor reviews prior to booking.  All the positive comments were true and if I ever have the chance to stay in London again, the Mayfair will be my only choice.  The staff was *5 STARS,*  the hotel and rooms sparkling clean, the bed/pillows were perfect for a good night's rest, the breakfast was lovely and full of choices, the ambiance of the hotel, dining areas and lounge warm and welcoming and the street and location of the hotel was beautiful and convenient.  This was my youngest daughter's senior graduation gift from me and having had a less-than-delightful experience at another hotel booked through AA.com for my oldest daughter's trip, I really did my research prior to booking this time.  I chose the best hotel in London and *THANKS* to all the reviewers who had been before me we had a trip of a lifetime together!",5,2009,01,31
105,Romantic and beautiful,"I booked this hotel for my girlfriend with a view to having a romantic weekend, it was the perfect choice and perfect weekend.

The room was superb and everything said by the hotel in it's profile is spot on. 

In the upper market of location and hotels in London, the staff do not rest on their laurels and reputation, customer service is of the highest order.

The only downer, was the price of drinks in the bar. £15 for a Vodka and Orange ? Then again my girlfriend was half hammered after one so it was a relatively cheap night !

I brought my girlfriend a necklace from a jewellery display cabinet at the hotel, it means so much to her, a lovely reminder of the time we spent at the Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2009,01,26
105,Excellent aside from one thing!,"Whilst the hotel itself, and the reception/door staff were excellent, one evening myself and my girlfriend were stuck in the lift when we returned after an evening out. After 20 mins I pressed the alarm and about 15/20 mins later voices were heard outside and then a spoon, and screwdriver where then shoved into the lift doors to try and open them. I was concerned that no reassurance was given and no thought as to the safety of the lift occupants. I asked if they could call the fire brigade which in total after nearly an hour they done. 
We were offered a drink but decided to head back to our room. No apology the next day and I wrote to the hotel, with the main reason being concerns about their protocol when it comes to such an event. I have since had no reply which disappointed me as it was a wonderful hotel and location.",4,2009,01,22
105,Very pleasant indeed,"Stayed here for the weekend for both pleasure and business in London and had a superior king room.

The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Green Park underground station, which is very useful and the setting in Mayfair is very attractive.

The staff were extremely friendly and efficient from check in to departure. Their manner was such that nothing was too much trouble in attending to your comforts and requirements.

Both the public areas and room had tasteful, traditional decor and the fittings were good quality. Both the bed linen and towels were also good quality. Comforts in the room made for a home from home stay, including bathrobes, slippers, complimentary refreshments and iron/board. Our room had a rear aspect looking over the hotel courtyard and it was very peaceful.

The breakfast choice was extensive and tasted delicious.

It's not the cheapest hotel (where is in London?) but it is well worth the money. 

A final point which always helps me decide if I would stay somewhere again, even though a hotel cannot always have control over this, is the other guests. A well behaved, pleasant and decent lot. 

Would certainly think about staying here again, should I need to venture to my capital city.",5,2009,01,20
105,What a delight!,"I surprised my husband with a two night stay here to celebrate his 65th birthday. 
From the moment we arrived at reception we were made to feel special. The staff, without fail, were polite, efficient and couldn't do enough to make us welcome.
We had booked a Mayfair Weekend so we were able to partake of the wonderful afternoon tea, not good for the waistline! 
With the hotel's cooperation, our two children and partners arrived for breakfast and no-one let the cat out of the bag! My husband was so shocked.
After a busy day sight-seeing it was so wonderful to arrive at our oasis in Mayfair,away from the hustle and bustle of London. We had a great night's sleep and were never aware of any other noise from adjoining rooms.
How wonderful to find a hotel that seems to enjoy looking after their guests!
I will be returning with my sister in March.",4,2009,01,10
105,Little Gem,"Really enjoyed our weekend break at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff were exceptional and everything was very professional. The hotel is in walking distance of Picadilly, Regent St, Bond St etc but remains in a very quiet area so you return to a completely relaxed haven.
The breakfast was the best choice we have ever encountered and again the service was exemplary. My only complaint was that the room was quite small but had everything that a top class hotel should have and was beautifully appointed.
Would not hesitate to recommend this gem and do hope to return. Got my deal through lastminute.com which wasa fab sparkly weekend with champagne and a superb afternoon tea. The scones were to die for.",5,2009,01,09
105,Chesterfield 's  - 'up with the big boys',"I don't write long laborious reviews...just down to earth comments.
Absolutely wonderful place to stay.Ideal location and the most attentive staff one could wish.
Attention to detail paramount ,,,can't wait to return.",5,2009,01,08
105,New Year at The Chesterfield - Wonderful!!,"My daughter and I booked into the Chesterfield for New Year using the hotels 'New Year Package' this included champagne reception, 7 course meal, music/dancing, brunch and a late check out. It was a fabulous night and a great way to see in the New Year. The food was delicious, service was excellent and the company of all the other diners was wonderful.
I can't fault a thing. I have included 10 pictures of the hotel including some from previous stays so that you can get a real feel for the hotel itself ... and see just how happy we are when we stay there.
Communication on booking was exceptional - preference forms are sent out so you can detail any needs/desires for your stay.
Our room was boutique style - although the blue stripes on the wall and red flowered linen and upholstery were rather scary initially but suprisingly actually did work well together! The bathroom was small but compact and pretty and worked perfectly well. A/C was quiet and functional. It wasn't one of my favourite rooms but it was fine.
Turn down service is particularly thoughtful - sweeties on the pillow, water restocked, bathroom straightened etc.
We went for a wonder into Bond Street (a stones throw away across Bertkely Sq) to purchase some essentials for the evening (new Gucci shoes)  and on our return there was a plate of fresh fruit in our room - very kind and thoughful touch.
Considering it was New Year our room was very quiet. 
Reception staff were (as always) friendly and attentive. The bar staff were welcoming and charming. Loris and his team in the Butlers Restaurant were exceptional.
Brunch was a really good idea - breakfast is always good in the restaurant - being able to saunter down after 11.30 was a real bonus. We had a very lazy morning!
I have stayed at this hotel about 10 times, it never fails to impress me and I always feel well looked after and a little bit pampered and special. The way you should feel when you take a break away from the busy demands of normal life! 
Loris needs to be patted on the back yet again as he is exceptionally good at his job.
Thankyou again The Chesterfield we will return in summer :) xx",5,2009,01,08
105,"OK, Not What I expected.","I stayed at the Chesterfield on December 26th for two nights.  Check in was no problem and the room size was what I expected.  The bed was a king as requested and was one mattress, not two pushed together as in so many other hotels. The bathroom was tiny also.  It was difficult to take a shower as the floor all over the bathroom got soaked.  

The negative things I experienced were that on the first night after my transatlantic flight I woke up at 3 am and realized there was a radio on somewhere right outside my room.  I thought this unusual as the room faced the back of the hotel and just looked over the roof of the restaurant and the conservatory.  But it was loud enough to keep me awake.  I phoned the reception desk and was told it would be checked out.  Nothing happened.  After about 20 minutes I looked more carefully outside the window to try to determine the location of this radio. There were lights on in  what looked like was part of the hotel's kitchen and I saw the radio placed right next to a window.  I phoned the front desk again a little more persistent this time and told the clerk that I thought the radio might be in the kitchen. Again he said he would check it out and a few minutes later it was turned off.  Someone evidently was careless and left the radio on.  Also the remote control for the television was not working and needed to be changed.

The room was clean and the staff were pleasant but it is not in the category that some on this site have said, especially by North American standards.  It looks a little worn out, especially for Mayfair.  For the price though it was decent, but do not expect a luxury hotel by any means. Ate in the restaurant the first night and the staff were very pleasant and tried their best but the food was mediocre at best.  All in all decent, but not worth the hype.",3,2009,01,05
105,Could not be better,"We stayed for 11 nights at the Chesterfield that included New Years Eve.  We stayed for 11 nights because we got an amazing deal on a website that offered a number of free nights with our booking.  The fact that we had paid less than the normal rate had no bearing whatsoever on the courtesies that we received from everybody at the hotel.  The service was just brilliant.  Clearly, management has instilled in the staff that they are in a service business and that the customer is their lifeblood.  The staff responded superbly.  There was not a hint of stuffiness, and they responded to all our requests with a smile and efficiency.

Our room was small, but very functional and had many luxuries, including free coffee and biscuits; free bottled water ( a rarity in the States) and extremely luxurious bathrobes and towels.  The bathroom was small, but, again, very functional.  We had dinner in the very stately dining room on two occasions.  The hotel and its public spaces have a very ""clubby"" feel.  They are mostly dark woods with an old world charm. The food is well prepared, but not spectacular.  Again, though, the service is top notch.  They simply could not do enough for you.  And, the bar area and the bartenders are extremely engaging.  After watching the fireworks over the Thames on New Years Eve, we came back to the hotel for a drink in the bar.  It was packed, but the bartenders on duty made sure that they found a space for us and served us without undue delay.  

The location of the hotel is fabulous.  It is about a five minute walk to the Green Park tube station and a ten minute walk to Oxford Street.  If walking is your thing it is about twenty minutes to Picadilly Circus and about the same to Trafalgar Square.  It is actually only about thirty minute walk to Harrods.  

All in all, the hotel lived up to everything that we could want in a hotel.  And, for Mayfair, the prices are downright reasonable for the rooms as well as the restaurant.  What a great place!",5,2009,01,05
105,Very Good,"We have just had a very good three night stay in the Hotel, we were very happy with every aspect of the experience, from the initial contact and booking to the car parking and porter service.

Various people have praised the staff, I can only add to that praise, it is quite refreshing to visit a Hotel that have staff that really care.

The only minor grumble was that the shower in the room was fairly useless.

We will use the Hotel again.",4,2009,01,05
105,"once again, faultless charm","taking into account the rates, simply the best hotel in london. period! from the location, to the wonderful staff, to the rooms, the food, the ambience, the price, the englishness!!! why stay anywhere else in london.",5,2009,01,04
105,Absolute gem.,"Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so we were treated to complimentary drinks in the bar. Our room had everything we required even a little note saying we could request fresh milk from room service, we did this and within the time it took for the kettle to boil our fresh milk had arrived, a small but very welcome detail. We were celebrating our tenth wedding anniversary and decided to eat in the Butlers restaurant on the 30th, the a la carte menu was unavailable due to the fact that much preparation was required for the following night but that didn't detract from the tasty dishes we chose from the set menu.  Time constraints meant that unfortunately we couldn't try their Afternoon Tea, voted bested Afternoon Tea two years running by the Tea Guild, this alone will make us return. Every single member of staff was pleasant and courteous and seemed proud of the fact they worked there.",4,2009,01,03
105,Nice hotel but not worth the hype,"I stayed at The Chesterfield with my husband during the Summer and found it disapointing. Having reviewed their website I was very excited about our stay especially when they sent me a form to fill in prior to arrival listing all of our likes and dislikes - it really set the expectations high.

The hotel is beautiful, and farily exclusive, and all the staff are very polite and attentive but the wow factor that I was expecting just isn't there. We were in a suite which was beautiful, but after all the hype of the website and the guest preference form the fact that it was just an overgrown hotel room was a massive disapointment. The room had two ensuite bathrooms, a huge bed and the usual bathrobes and slippers but that was pretty much it. All of the gifts and modern technology that you were set up to expect just weren't there, I dont think they even had satellite television.

My husband and I dont eat fish as we stated on the guest preference form so were disapointed when the (small) tray of complimentary evening canapes was brought up and was  both cold and 50% fish items. The list of drinks, films and music we liked that we were asked to give to them was a complete waste of time.

We had afternoon tea while we were there which was lovely, the 'chocolate lovers' tea was especially good though the room it is served in was cold and lacked atmosphere. Compared to other afternoon teas in Mayfair, such as at the Lanesborough, it really wasn't a grand affair.

Overall it was a pleasant hotel and we had a nice stay, but I would definitely choose the Grosvenor or somewhere a bit more flashy if I was looking to be wowed, especially at Mayfair prices.",4,2009,01,02
105,Oasis of Calm,"We have stayed at this hotel on two occasions and have just booked to stay again. The location is fabulous - within a 10 minute stroll to Oxford Street but situated on a blissfully quiet street. The staff are charming and professional - you genuinely feel like a valued guest and nothing seems to be too much trouble. We were up graded to a superb ( recently refurbished ) room on our first stay - a large , beautifully decorated room, exceptionally quiet, clean and comfortable. On our second stay the standard room was smaller but still adequate, clean and quiet. We have only eaten breakfast in the restaurant( - the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs were superb )  but look forward to the opportunity of eating in the restaurant.",5,2008,12,30
105,New Years at the Mayfair,"We are on a mid-winter trip to Europe with 5 nigts in London.  I booked the Mayfair directly with the hotel - they had a very reasonable price for a 5 star hotel (just under 200 UKP / night).  The hotel is 'old world bijoux' with al the usual amenities for a hotel of this caliber.  The rooms are not large -- and just a bit cluttered -- but very comfortable indeed and well placed just 2 blocks from the Green Park underground station.  Berkeley Sq. is a block away (you can go see the Bentlys there).  All the public parts of the hotel are finished in dark wood and they give the appearance of quiet refinement.  As an example of what to expect at the Chesterfield, I had a strange yearning for hot incemeat pie all day (having seen an ad for this somewhere in London),l and at the bar last night, over a Pimms cup, I asked if they could bring me a slice.  After some scrambling around, they did indeed produce a slice of hot mincemeat pie.

105,Outstanding!,"Booked this wonderful hotel for a weekend break in December - from the moment my wife & I arrived we were treated like royalty. I had booked the hotels ""weekend package"" which included a bottle of champagne and complimentary afternoon tea. To our surprise and utter delight we were upgraded to a suite. The standard of the room was exceptional and all that you could need was provided.

Dinner at Butlers was a quality experience and throughout our stay the staff were extremely helpful, courteous and professional. For a real ""treat"" would recommend this hotel whole heartedly.

Luxury at its best!",5,2008,12,30
105,Loved everything from the very first to the last minute!,"Together with our daughter and our son-in-law, my husband and I spent an absolutely lovely long weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Staff is extremely friendly, the rooms are charming, breakfast is generous and Afternoon Tea in the Conservatory splendid. You can spot the red carnations everywhere, they are a beautiful decoration. We had such a good time with you and we will certainly return to spend another unforgettable weekend at your hotel, a real gem!

105,Amazing gem of a hotel,"Wow, this is the most amazing hotel, I almost don't want to review it to let the secret out, but its such a great find that it deserves every success it has coming.

I arrived at 7am on Christmas morning after the hell trip from Australia.  The lovely man at the desk informed me that the single room I had booked was not available so early but that it was not a drama, he upgraded me to a double room and led me upstairs immediately.   First, the technicalities: I booked on the hotel website, the weekend package, a single room.  This cost 115 pounds a night plus tax, and included breakfast, a bottle of champagne on arrival, afternoon tea on one day, 6pm checkout, and various other things that are not advertised, as I found out along the way: free internet (both wifi and cable), complementary bottled water in the room, the ability to have your breakfast served in your room instead of the restaurant, a newspaper daily, lovely fresh apples scattered around the hotel, tea and coffee in the room, sherry in the foyer...  This is a very very classy boutique hotel - the fact that all of these things are included in the room rate rather than one feeling constantly 'nickel and dimed', is exactly what a hotel should be.   Along with the wonderful warm welcoming hotel staff, and the high standards of cleaning and furbishments generally, it made for a truly blissful stay.  

I have read some negative reviews of this hotel on this site but having now stayed here myself I would be inclined to attribute these more to the writers than to the hotel.  for instance, some might say, looking out of the window to my room, that the view is bleak - down below are air conditioner fans.  But if you look up you see an incredible view of regency roof lines, its amazing at dawn and dusk, to see the horizon over such a view.  And the rooms are no doubt small - as are all old hotels in England and Europe generally - but rather than finding this a negative, I find it charming and amazing at how they have managed to make so much space available in such a small room - its really incredible.

other things I noticed:

the bed is blissfully comfy - firm but squishy at the same time.  and the pillows are easily the most comfortable I have ever slept on and I have asked for the brand so I can try and track them down myself.  There is a turn down service each night which is a lovely treat.   They ask you to choose between feathers or not, and between duvet and blankets.  the linens are top notch - deliciously crisp and yet soft and beautifully monogrammed. As are the towels, so thick and thirsty and soft.  and the bathrobes...

 Instead of dumping your paper on the floor each morning, it is placed in a canvas bag and hung from the door knob - I am sure that that attention to detail is appreciated by the older guest who finds bending down a challenge.

the water pressure is amazingly strong - and wonderfully hot.

there is a safe (digital, free) in the wardrobe which was the right size for my powerbook although I never felt the need to lock it away and just used it for my passport and jewellery.

the location!  I have never stayed in Mayfair before and now I can not understand why not - its a ten minute stroll to Regent Street to the right, ten minutes up the road to Oxford Street, 5 minutes below to Piccadilly, and five minutes in the other direction to Park Lane.  Everything you could want right on your doorstep!

the ability to have the breakfast included in your roomrate, served in your room, is just a really special treat. I have never stayed anywhere where that was the case, and being able to eat brekkie in your PJs while reading the paper, instead of having to get dressed first, for me, makes a holiday.  hurruh!!

So, to me this hotel is an amazing find and it is very hard to leave.  I am staying at one of the sister hotels (the one near the palace) at the other end of my trip, and am slightly concerned because I now have such high expectations!!

OK, I must stop raving and actually go check out!",5,2008,12,28
105,Shopping and Christmas stay,"We booked two rooms for a 4 night stay, just prior to Christmas. My wife and two children (18 and 22) The hotel is located in Mayfair and is so convenient for Oxford Street, West End, Hyde Park The service was excellent and the staff very, attentive and respectful. It was like steeping back in time when tradition and values mattered. We all enjoyed  the full breakfast and afternoon tea.  My wife can only eat gluten free food, which the chef aways provided and which was always to the highest standard. I would recommend this hotel as a throughly English establishment, which provides super service, in a great location",5,2008,12,27
105,Afternoon tea,Visited this so British and stylish hotel for afternoon tea.  Would have been great to stay too!  Wonderful light scones and strawberry jam and delightful cakes.  The only disappointment being very plain and uninteresting sandwiches.  Delightful staff and such a pleasure to be able to sit and chatter and not to be rushed out.  We enjoyed the decor of the main restaurant and the stylish ladies' powder room which is usually indicative of a good hotel.  We shall be back.,4,2008,12,15
105,"Very good hotel, although not quite perfect","We stayed in the Chesterfield for one night to follow our office Christmas Dinner there.

The hotel was very much as we expected it, being of a Regency style and with excellent attention to detail.

In retrospect, the hotel probably wasn't the best venue for a lively group in their 30s and 40s, as it seemed the regulars were typically of a more sedate stage in life, and this was reflected in the bar after the dinner. While one barman was fast, efficient, and polite, the other we assumed to have been assigned to the bar from other duties and against his will, as he declined to utter a word to us all night, and met every order with a gruff, reluctant expression. It seemed the fifty or so people in the bar were beyond their service capacity, and at one point I waited over 15 minutes and changed position three times to try to place my order.

However, they did have a reasonable selection of drinks, and those of us who ordered cocktails after our meal upstairs, said they were very good. The meal, although a Christmas Dinner and probably not representative of the restaurant, was a very traditional turkey dinner, and also good.

The staff in reception were very helpful and friendly, reception itself was gorgeously decorated with a Christmas tree and real Gingerbread House, and our standard room was lovely, although small-as-expected, with shuffle-room only around the double bed, but this didn't feel oppressive at all. The bathroom was a decent size, with a walk-in rain shower. The bed was lovely, comfortably firm, and the linen, dressing gowns, towels, etc. were all very luxurious. Everything was perfectly clean, and the hotel well-heated even on the bitterly cold evening we were there.

My only other criticism would be that the English breakfast delivered to our room was only lukewarm by the time it arrived: again, not a big deal, but for such a highly rated hotel, I expected more. Also, the man in the kitchen who took our order had trouble understanding my English, which again, is a minor frustration that I have accepted in many other hotels, but I wouldn't have expected here. I was slightly relieved to see our breakfast arrived as ordered. The fact that our rate included breakfast, and there was no charge for having this in our room, was a pleasant surprise.

So, overall, the Chesterfield is a lovely luxury hotel, but probably more appreciated by those who are visiting the UK as tourists and specifically enjoy the Regency style. I was shocked that they would even employ such an unfriendly barman, but in all other aspects the service was good.",4,2008,12,15
105,Terrific Stay in London,"We had a wonderful visit to London which included 5 nights in this excellent hotel. Our room was lovely and included all the extras one needs. The hotel was well located, a15 minute walk to Leicester Square, the National Gallery, etc.. It was also a very quiet area. Staff were very friendly and professional. Even though it was expensive, given we were paying in Canadian dollars, it was worth it and probably good value compared to other top hotels.",5,2008,12,11
105,Perfect room for single traveller,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for one night this week. I had just arrived at Heathrow, quite late in the evening, to be in the city for less than a day before taking a train north. I was travelling alone and had requested a single. My room was nearly the smallest hotel room I have ever seen, but it was immaculate and met all of my needs. The furnishings were beautiful, the bathroom handsome and spotless, and the staff was helpful in every way. Furthermore, the price and location could not be beat. I was happy with the Chesterfield in every respect.",5,2008,12,05

absolutley fabulous decor meals and afternoon high tea superb staff very very helpful treatedmy sister and i like queens i thoroughly recommend staying there",5,2008,12,05
105,Great apart from the smelly room,"Booked a night with my wife in a standard room on the 29th November. Check in was smooth and efficiant and the doorman and other staff were genuinly interested in us and offered their help. Unfortunately despite booking a no smoking room we were put into a smoking room and given that the walls of the room are fabric lined it was pretty smelly. We asked to move immidiately but were told there were no non smoking rooms available but they could put a room freshner in the room!! We had to put up with it which really spoilt what was a pleasant , decent sized room. How come that you cant smoke indoors anywhere in the UK anymore except, it seems in hotel rooms.
 Fairly good value but watch out when you book the room direct as they quote a net VAT rate which doesnt help if youre not there on business. Mark Sussex",4,2008,12,03
105,There can't be a better London hotel,"This is our 4th visit to The Chersterfield and they never fail to surpass themselves.
The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, theaters and sights, we didn't need a taxi.
The food is excellent and reasonably priced, with a breakfast to die for, although the conservatory is a little cold in winter.  The pianist playing in the lounge is a perfect end to a good day. 
The staff are always helpful.
Rooms small but big enough and very well appointed, we loved the music room (bedroom).

We have used this place twice before for business and it has proved a consistently high satndard",5,2008,12,01
105,Amazing!  I'll be back!,"I decided to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair based on reviews that I read on tripadvisor, plus the value for what you get and the location. There is so much positive I could say about this hotel but I'll just name a few.  The room and bathroom were super clean.  The bedding and toiletries were of high quality which I enjoyed immensely.  The towels were so cuddly : )!   The service was impeccable, there when you need it but not intrusive.  Also, I loved the staff in the bar too, they were fun to talk to and provided great service.

One other comment, I travel a lot for business so get to interact with alot of staff at hotels.  It was refreshing to see how the staff was playful and light hearted with each other.  One day I was walking by the lobby and heard them singing.  It was so nice to be on a break in London and feel the joy of others around me.  What a statement without words, to be able to observe people enjoying  where they work and  with the people they work with.  Seems like a happy place to work which was reflective in the service and experience that I enjoyed at the Chesterfield.  Thanks for the wonderful time!  Judy Becker, San Francisco",5,2008,11,29
105,Always a pleasure!,"We stayed here last weekend on the Mayfair Weekends package and once again, were not disappointed. We have stayed 4 times previously, and it really was like coming home. The room was a king size and although it was small, it was perfectly formed. We came here from another hotel and whilst the other hotel room was much larger, it was nowhere near the same standard of perfection. It really is worth the extra cost. The staff are wonderful - so polite- and actually look interested in you. The breakfast is superb, cooked to order and there was an incredible buffet selection-you certainly would not come away hungry! We would like to thank all the staff for a wonderful stay once again and will definitely be returning.",5,2008,11,25
105,Absolutely beautiful hotel,"I stayed for one night at the Chesterfield on my own as I had been invited to a swanky party in Mayfair on a Saturday night and decided to treat myself.  I did, however, get a fantastic deal on a website called hoteldirect I think and got a beautiful yet small single room with breakfast included.  I turned up on Saturday afternoon and have to say that my entire stay was memorable!  The room was beautiful, the bed so comfortable and the bed linen elegant and fine.  The bathroom was gleaming marble with lots of lovely goodies and a huge shower.  I was on the 3rd floor and it was incredible quiet.  On Sunday morning, I ordered room service for breakfast which was such a treat and delicious.  I don't often have the need to stay in London, as I live near Richmond but the hotel made my weekend a weekend to remember!  Thank you The Chesterfield!",5,2008,11,25
105,The Hotel Chesterfield - a fabulous experience,"We stayed at the Hotel Chesterfield a few weeks ago and we are still talking about the wonderful time we had there.

The rooms are beautiful with fine attention to detail. There were all the essential comforts one appreciates like a plush bathroom robe and slippers as well as the everyday essential such as internet access and business supplies.

The hotel's restaurants and bar were top notch. My sister in law came in late one evening and we were delighted to find that the bar  remains open  late into the night and serves food for their guests. The food was quite delicious and very welcome after a long day of travel. 

We had a English breakfast every morning in the main dining area and tea in the conservatory. Every meal was well prepared and again there was fine attention to detail.

Without a doubt the most impressive part of the stay was the dedicated and caring staff at the Hotel Chesterfield. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. They were truly concerned that our trip be a great experience that they planned every outing with us, helping us get reservations and play tickets and last minute cabs. On a particularly busy evening we were running late for the theatre and the usual line up of cabs were not in front of the hotel. The doorman said I should wait inside, out of the rain and he would get a cab. I was so impatient that I went outside and didn't see him. Thinking he went home I wasn't sure what to do. Just then a cab pulled up with the doorman in the back. He had run out to the busy main road to make sure I got a cab and made it in time for the curtain to go up. That is all you need to know about the staff. They are all fantastic!",5,2008,11,25
105,London weekend,"This place is completly different in a good way from many others.  Warm atmosphere with live piano music, old-fashioned design of rooms and public places, excellent staff and service make the hotel very special.

105,Girl's weekend to remember....Fantastic,"Booked our weekend break back in March, got a great deal for 2 nights inc breakfast, champagne and afternoon tea. We were celebrating a 40th birthday just for me and my cousin, leaving the men and children behind.

Arrived at 5.00pm on the Friday night. Fantastic location. 8 minute walk from Green Park tube station. You go down Berkeley Street and into Berkeley Square, and then Charles Street is right there.

Lovely greeting from all the staff we ever had contact with. Room on the 4th floor which was a superior twin. Gorgeous bed linen, comfortable beds, fluffy robes and complimentary slippers.

Breakfast was served until 11.00am on a weekend which was perfect for us because we really had planned to chill out. Short walk from Fortnum & Mason. Also Green Park, St James Park, Buckingham Palace etc all so so near which makes the location superb.

We loved the Chesterfield Hotel and would highly recommend it. Their staff are a credit to the hotel, and I could go on and on.

Would we return ...... can;t wait to go back !!!!",5,2008,11,17
105,Thoroughly recommended!,"My husband and I stayed for two nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair from Friday 14 November 2008;  a special day as it was my birthday and our annual getwaway to London to visit The Good Food Show.   We had stayed in many of London's good hotel's but The Chesterfield was one of London's most finest with exceptional staff and service.  

First impressions, we were greeted by an attentive Consiage who showed into a beautiful Reception, and assisted by a highly efficient and friendly Reception team.  Alex checked us in and was totally professional, he made us feel extremely welcome.  Coincidentally he checked us out and even remembered it had been my birthday!.

Our room, like the hotel in general, was elegant and stylish.  It had kept its traditional atmosphere and beautiful decor, still offering the latest hi-tech facilities.

After returning to The Chesterfield late on Friday night, we were also greeted by a charming and interesting French Barman.  The exceptional service continued at breakfast the following morning and there was a variety of  dishes to choose from. I can recommend the grilled kippers with baby quails eggs ! 

We found The Chesterfield was located on a beautiful Mayfair street and easily accessible to the delights of Mayfair, Regent Street and Picadilliy, the theatres and Green Park tube station.

The only problem we experienced with our stay was that it was not long enough! It was a fantastic weekend and a birthday I will most certainly remember!",5,2008,11,17
105,enjoyed our stay at The Chesterfield,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a 2 night weekend break. We booked direct with the hotel and our rate included breakfast and afternoon tea, which we thought was extremely good value. The food was excellent, our room (a superior king) was very comfortable, and the marble bathroom with toiletries and robes was very luxurious
  
The staff were helpful, storing our case on the Sunday because our train was not until late afternoon.
  
The location was perfect for shopping and a trip to the theatre. It is also very close to Shepherds Market with its pubs and restaurants.",5,2008,11,14
105,Wonderful Hotel,"My stay at The Chesterfield At Mayfair was a wonderful experience. I was on my own and the staff were very pleasant. Just walking in or out I would receive a friendly wave from reception. The door men were very pleasant and the restuarant staff  were excellent especially Fee.

I would highly recommend this Hotel to any of my friends that intended to stay in London.

Thankyou for the wonderful attention that was given to me.

Sincerely yours

Celia Semitecolos",5,2008,11,13
105,The Reviews don't lie!,"My wife & I stayed at the Chesterfield for 5 nights in late October to celebrate our Anniversary. We booked a superior King room directly through the hotel. The phone reservations were very easy & the follow up by the reservation staff was excellent. We were sent a form for our preferences & the attention to detail was great.
The Check in was perfect but the room seemed quite small. I was promised another room in the morning but realized we did not need it as the space was more than adequate. We had a breakfast cooked to order every morning included in the room rate & the quality of food was very good. All the classic English breakfast items were available to choose from & the service impeccable. We also had one afternoon tea in the lovely Conservatory & a dinner at the Butler restaurant which were also excellent.
The service was well beyond what I have experienced in any European hotel. The hotel has a feel of a very English house with beautifully decorated corridors and rooms. The rooms are appointed very well & the concierge, Chris, was fantastic at helping out with restaurant reservations. I would like to make a special mention of the location of the hotel which was perfect. It is within a 15 minute walk of most Central London landmarks, theaters & good shopping . It is a fantastic hotel in a great city.",5,2008,11,03
105,Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield!,"After reading the reviews on the TripAdvisor website - I thought I would try this hotel - as I  like the Mayfair area.  Stayed 3 nights (Oct 17-20, 2008).  Both my girlfriend and I had a wonderful time - felt like we were coming home each day.  The entire  staff were very nice and couldn't do enough.  The housekeeping was great.
In room touches - a coffee press, coffee, wonderful teas, two types of water, cookies - all complimentary.  Room was small, but efficient.   Breakfast was very good, as was high tea . We had dinner twice at the Butler resturant in the hotel, too -service was excellent as was the food.  
Quiet neighborhood and a short walk to the tube and Green Park and Bond street shopping.",5,2008,10,24
105,Comfortable and Friendly,"We have stayed at this hotel twice.  On the first occasion, the Junior Suite we had booked was so small that there was insufficient space to unpack 2 suitcases, let alone set up a laptop.  What was otherwise a very high standard in all the hotel departments was let down by the room size.  This was not a Junior Suite at all, in fact it was no larger than a small single room.  I wrote to the management after our stay, and received an immediate and apologetic response stating that they had now downgraded the description of the room in question and offered us a complimentary stay in another suite, which we took up in October 2008.  

The suite on our second visit was adequate in size, very comfortable with excellent bedding, separate shower unit plus full sized tub, plenty of hanging space and a pleasant seating area.  I believe they may have 'upgraded' us to a full suite in view of our comments after the first stay.

In every other respect, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel, offering service levels well above the norm for London.  The doorman parked my car, returning it punctually when requested.  The room service was incredibly fast.  The Butler restaurant served us an excellent dinner and the breakfast offerings were of the highest standard.  

If you are travelling 'light', I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, situated in a quiet and elegant part of London within an easy walk of the West End.",4,2008,10,24
105,Great location in Mayfair,"I stayed at this hotel twice with a two week break inbetween. The first time, I was alone and was given a small room, I did not know where to put my luggage. 
When I checked in again two weeks later, having booked a romantic weekend package for me and my partner, I asked if we could receive a larger room and mentioned my earlier experience with the suitcase. The receptionist gave me the option to stay at a larger suite for an extra 40 GBP per night. I felt this was too much but then she offered another room for 20 GBP extra. Wonderful, I thought, until we got to the room. The Jungle suite was a quaint little smoking room. A strange smell put me off but I openend the window and did not think about this any further. At night, we shut the window due to the noise of the traffic. 
At 4 a.m. I just could not stand the smell any longer and detected a 'very strong and smelly' room freshener pluged in the socket. I unplugged it but a few hours later the poignant smell of old smoke in the curtains, wallpaper and carpet came out.

We were lucky they could give us another room. Having stayed in 3 different rooms, I don't think I want to book that hotel again. 

The staff  was very friendly and helpful at all times. We also thought that the afternoon tea was a highlight.

P.S. back home I had to air everything I had along",3,2008,10,23
105,Perfect,"This small boutique hotel exceeded our expectations. Everyone made us feel so welcome and the high tea was a real treat. Breakfast at The Chesterfield was one of the best and the staff are all so professional, friendly and helpful. The hotel is incredibly clean and the housekeepers deserve special praise as you would be surprised at the poor standard of cleanliness we experienced at most of the other hotels in the UK and Europe! The room was so special and cosy and the linen and bed divine. A special thank you goes to Mr Ben Seager who not only changed the dates of our arrival at the last minute but also accommodated our friends at the same special rate.  The hotel is small, exclusive and perfectly located.  

A 5-Star experience!",5,2008,10,16
105,Exceptional Hotel,"Outstanding service from the minute we stepped out of the cab.  The hotel surpassed our expectations, the service was exceptional and were pleasantly surprised but the hotels ambiance and location.  Would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2008,10,15
105,Not as good as we expected,"We were finishing a tour of Europe and thought we'd stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair since we read such great reviews about it.  The hotel was just not what we expected. It was a nice boutique hotel in a very posh neighborhood, but beyond that we did not experience the great service that others on this site have talked about. On the contrary, I found the service to be ""stuffy"" and not very friendly. We have not recommended this hotel to any of our friends who are looking for an amazing hotel in London.",3,2008,10,15
105,Fantastic service,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights with my girlfriend. The entire hotel has a distinct English feel to it and is located in the heart of Mayfair, perfect for exploring the City.

The staff went out of the way to help me procure a piece of jewelry - thanks again!

Sumptious breakfast. Also, try the English Afternoon Tea, which was excellent. Would definitely stay again!",5,2008,10,10
105,Great Location - lots of staff!,"We just returned from a two night stay at the Chesterfield and we were happy overall.  We had 'The Mayfair Weekender Package' which includes champagne in the room on arrival, afternoon tea, late checkout....  Unfortunately we were put in a smoking room but did not realise this until we had unpacked and arrived back later that evening.  We had not been asked about what would have been our preference which I thought was not good.  The corridor did smell of smoke a lot and was not very pleasant at times but it was only for two nights so we didn't want to have to move.  The room although nicely decorated was small and had a small window which over looked grey walls.  I suffer a little from claustrophobia and to be honest found the room a little inhibiting!  
Staff were numerous and friendly although I have to say I was a little bemused to be asked, after check in, if we could manage our two cases ourselves!  Not a great start.
After that we had a nice stay until Sunday morning when I thought I should telephone reception to remind them of our 'Late Checkout'.  We left the hotel at 1.30, leaving our bags in our room.  We returned at 3pm to find we could not access the room, card was rejected.  When I went to reception to explain this, I was told that it was standard 12pm checkout, I mentioned that I had confirmed this morning(part of 'weekender package')....  I got no apology from this girl at reception, she just reactivated the card.  Thought this was a bit rich. Yes the hotel is in a great location and is very comfortable and beautiful in many ways unfortunately we just got a few negatives along the way also.",4,2008,10,06
105,A truly wonderful experience!,"I spent a long weekend at The Chesterfield Mayfair prior to going to a conference in Oxford and then returned there for a shorter weekend when the conference ended.  Both times (separated by a week) were excellent.  My room was a bit larger the first time (I believe I was upgraded) and I enjoyed the extra space, but the smaller room was just fine too.  The staff was lovely and worked hard to accommodate my need to get into my room early, following an all-night flight from the US.  When I couldn't get my computer to work (and panicked!), they sent the hotel engineer who was able to sort things out and was very kind and friendly.  Breakfast was an absolute delight--including being greeted each time by name by the hostess after my first morning there.  The tube stop was about 10 minutes away (but a lot of stairs!) and it was also easy to walk to places I was interested in seeing.    There were fun extras such as a bottle of champagne in the room, the signature red carnation, and a complimentary afternoon tea each weekend I was there--so much food that I skipped dinner.    I am looking forward to introducing my husband to this hotel when we can both go to London.  It's charming, gracious, and in an interesting area of London.  I definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2008,09,28
105,Pampered Luxury,"My wife and I stayed at The Chesterfield  in Mayfair earlier this month. We travelled down to London on the Friday evening and checked in late. Upon arrival the hotel staff were warm, friendly and extremely pleasant and efficient.

Tired and with a big weekend ahead of us, it was important to us that we made the most of the weekend. We made good use of
room service and again were impressed by the staff, not to mention the quality of the food.

The room itself was well equiped and decorated nicely. Most things were catered for and compared with other similarly priced hotels in London, The Chesterfield offered a more spacious area that helped create that feeling of pampered luxury.

Prior to our visit, I had organised for chocolates and flowers to be in our room upon our arrival. The hotel staff carried out this request perfectly and helped to make our stay a wonderful experience. Finishing touches, such as the fruit that was provided in our room, also helped to make our stay extra special.

The hotel also provided us with the opportunity to cater the room for our particular tastes and requirements. As an allergy sufferer, I found the ability to order non allergenic pillows and duvets a welcome facility.

The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Mayfair. All the staff proved themselves to be courteous and charming. The Hotel bar provided us with an ideal area for meeting our guests and later, for a relaxing drink in nice surroundings.

The reception staff were extremely helpful and were able to make suggestions regarding our plans for the day and the Concierge were only too willing to hail taxis and help with luggage and all with a friendly smile and a warm manner, not something that is always on hand in London.

All in all, I would thoroughly recommend anyone to experience the luxury of a few nights stay at The Chesterfield in Mayfair.

We'll be back!",5,2008,09,28
105,Superb in every way,"The Chesterfield was superb in every way. The room, restaurant, and service were all excellent. Most especially, we appreciated the help of the concierge when we were planning each days' activities. All of his recommendations were great and saved us time. 

Truly, The Chesterfield is an oasis in the middle of a big city where one can rest, work, or just enjoy one of the world's greatest cities.",5,2008,09,24
105,The outstanding Chesterfield,"We (my wife and I) stayed at the Chesterfield during a 3 night stay in London, in short we had a fantastic time the hotel lived up to its world ranking, it was outstanding. Everything about the hotel was 5 star apart from the staff who were 7 star, nothing was to much trouble and the pride they took in carrying out their tasks was evident through out. Yes you pay for what you get but unlike some other hotels, we left the Chesterfield not begrudging a penny we had spent during our memorable stay.",5,2008,09,17
105,Fabulous London hotel,"My family and I stayed at the Chesterfield  for 4 days last July. I must say it was one of the nicest staff we have ever met! From the moment we entered the hotel, 'till our departure, everyone was really nice ,corteous, and funny! They made us feel very welcomed. When we arrived, the manager noticed that we had a lot of luggage, and upgraded us to a much larger room. Very professional. The room was spotless clean and big. Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was good .  The location is perfect, pretty close to Hyde Park, but in a quiet and charming neighborhood. Well-worth the price. The Chesterfield will certainly be our  # 1 choice when we go back to London, and we hope it is soon! Thank you, Chesterfield, for a memorable stay!",5,2008,09,17
105,"By far, hands down, the best of the very best","My family and I are extensive travellers, going to Europe/the US more than once a year.  Our wonderful experience with the Chesterfield Mayfair is unparalleled and their exceptional, professional and courteous services began even before our arrival.  This is going to be a long email, but they deserve it.  

When we first made our booking for a  triple room, I contacted the hotel via email, asking if it would be possible to get a somewhat large room because my elderly mother was to be with us and she is a bit claustrophobic.  As the triple room also did not have a minibar, I asked if it would be possible to put one at an extra charge.  In less than ten minutes, I got an email stating that a larger room would be made available and a minibar included in the room FOR FREE.  Once we reached the lovely and charming hotel, we were delighted to find that the hotel decided to give us a complimentary update to a junior suite for my elderly mother's sake! 

The junior suite was lovely, with all the amenities that one can think of.  My mother requested an additional mattress because of her bad back.  Again, only a few minutes passed and a charming member of the management team, Ms. Devlin, came to apologize that they do not have additional mattresses and for that, they are offering a COMPLIMENTARY single room on the same floor to my mother.  We were speechless.  This proved to be a sample of the wonderful, courteous and personal touches that mark everything at the Chesterfield. 

On a daily basis, you get complimentary biscuits, candy, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and bottles of still and sparkling water.  There is free internet in your room and free access to the internet and a printer in the lower level of the hotel.  The suite, as well as my mother's lovely single room had also: a hair dryer, pens, paper, pencils, earser, post it notes, ruler, sharpener and scissors.  Basically, everything you can think of and need whether you are on a business trip or if you are there for lesiure.

The rooms and especially the bathrooms are spotless clean and shower and bath gels, soap and lofas are replinished daily.  

On your way in and out, you are greeted  with a smile from everybody asking if you had a good time, if there was anything they can assist you with, directions, cabs, suggestions for places to go, and they also alert you if the weather was about to change.  The doormen always gave my mother a hand as she got on and off the cab.  We once had dinner at the hotel restaurant and not only was the treatment superb, but a few days later (we stayed for a week), we ran into the gentleman who was serving us, and he remembered our names!  Ms. Devlin also ran into my mother at the hotel's lovely library and was keen to stop and ask if she was enjoying her stay, if the liberary room temperature was comfortable, if she needed anything at all.

One day, we found letters, signed by the hotel manager, alerting us that neighbors were having a party that could stay a bit late into the night, apologizing if this was a bother and assuring us that the hotel would make sure that the music would not extend beyond 10:30 PM.  We thought that this was a very nice and caring gesture.  But that was not enough for the Chesterfield; later in the day, we got a call again from Ms. Devlin relaying the same message and the apology.  What really sets this hotel apart is the personal touch and the extra mile that each and every member of the hotel staff go through to make sure that you are comfortable and that you are special.   

As to the location of the hotel - unbeatable.  Within minutes, and on foot you can be in Berkely Square, Piccadilly, Bond Street, Regent Street, Oxford street, Park Lane, the Palace, everywhere.  There are loads of restaurants, shops, bars and cafes under five minutes from the hotel.  A Boots and a Sainsbury are practically around the corner.

Would I recommend the Chesterfield to anyone else?  I already have to business associates and friends alike.  What a lovely lovely place, wonderful people and the best choice for a memorable stay in London. Cannot wait to go back.  Our enjoyment of London was to no small part thanks to the Chesterfield and their staff.",5,2008,09,17
105,Fabulous!,"A superb hotel in the heart of London. The decor is fantastic with attention to detail, the staff are polite and helpful, and the food is sumptious. 
Our room was elegantly decorated, with all the modern conveniences.
We dined in the restaurant, enjoying a beautifully prepared meal. Breakfast was delicious with choice of cooked english, continental and several other options. 
Room service was polite and prompt.",5,2008,09,16
105,Great Hotel,"My Brother and I had just finished an eight day tour of Ireland which we enjoyed. When we got to London we were looking for a four day stay where we didn't have to change hotels or Bed and Breakfast location every other day. We both got our own room. The condition of the rooms were clean and decorated very well, (although small), staff was great and helpfull. It was a great location quite and handy for the Green Park station, within walking distance of Hard Rock if you needed a good hamburger, and in a good park of London. In short this hotel was one of the best we stayed at during our trip. In addition it was a great value.",4,2008,09,09
105,It's all true.  This place is great.,"What a perfect introduction to London.  A small gem of a hotel tucked away on a side street in a lovely neighborhood.  Very romantic.  Lots of brocade, carpeted walls, and mirrors, mirrors, mirrors.  Nice bathroom and amenities, competent staff, all together a real find.",5,2008,09,02
105,All Class,"What a lovely hotel, we stayed mainly with family during our tour of England, but for our last night we splashed out.

The service was fantastic, the food great and hotel amenities almost second to none.

The rooms are on the small side considering the price you pay but the location makes up for it.

If you have the cash, then you should splash out and spend a couple nights.",5,2008,08,27
105,Intimate Hotel with Great Service,"The Chesterfield Mayfair remains my favourite hotel in London.  The location is fantastic.  The hotel is intimate and very British.  The staff, especially the concierge Chris, go above and beyond the call of duty to make you feel welcome.  Highly recommended!",5,2008,08,26
105,Loved the Chesterfield,"My girlfriend and me were meeting in London for a pre-honeymoon and discovered that the best way to reassure what love is was by staying at the Chesterfield. Wonderful staff, courteous and extremely helpful for all those small details that you need in order to make your girlfriend feel the one and only. One thing that you need to know is that the Chesterfield is not the typical big, enormous spacious american-type of hotel. If you are looking for that, go to big polluting beach resorts somewhere in the Caribbean. At the Chesterfield you will enjoy a truly english exprience with charming decoration, clean bathrooms, excellent bar and cuisine, and a romantic and elegant atmosphere. Once I heard that the will be always an old, good England....well, I hope that in the future there will be always a Chesterfield in London.",5,2008,08,22
105,"Excellent hotel, great loacation,wonderful staff","We have just returned from three days at the Chesterfield Mayfair, our second stay so far this year.   It really is an excellent hotel in a great location with very pleasant, helpful staff.
We had a package deal which included tickets to the Tutankhamun exhibition with an unbelievable picnic lunch to take with us, lunch on the first day and afternoon tea on the third. 

The service in the restaurant is impeccible, as is the food - don't miss lunch in Butlers.

The room was well presented and comfortable with all the small touches one would hope to find in a top London hotel.

We will be returning later in the year.",5,2008,08,15
105,Excellent experience,"The hotel we usually book in London was unavailable so we did quite a bit of research and decided on a Red Carnation chain hotel.  Don't be put off when I say chain - because we found the staff to be incredibly personal, the property outstanding both in location and amenities and the services excellent.

The location is great for walking to all the great London shops and sights.  The hotel is located in the best part of town and there is a wonderful pub right down the block.

Be warned - the rooms are on the small side but very functional and the beds are quite comfortable.  They even email you ahead of time to find out what type of pillows you would like and whether you prefer a duvet or blanket.

Breakfast was included daily, which we took advantage of both in the restauarant and room service.  The food is wonderful and the choices varied.  We ate there 5 days in a row and didnt get tired of the choices.

Hope you all have as good an experience as we did.  The staff is wonderful.",5,2008,08,14
105,great experience,"Stayed at the Chesterfield for my 4oth birthday and fully enjoyed our stay.Location is superb staff friendly and helpful and the afternoon tea is an absolute joy.
Room was quiet and well equiped.All in all a fantastic weekend and pleasurable stay.",5,2008,08,12
105,"Lovely hotel, great location","What a wonderful start to 3 weeks in Europe.  This is a lovely hotel in a perfect location.  We walked everywhere.  Could live in Mayfair - it is beautiful.  Staff were fantastic, even watched Wimbledon Final with them in their lovely bar.  Make sure you have a drink in the bar if you stay here as it is a great way to finish the day.  The service here is outstanding.  We arrived very early after a 23 hour flight and were able to have a room straight away.  Throughout our time at the hotel staff were always pleasant and helpful.  Arranged tickets to Hairspray the Musical for us (a must see - amazing show) and gave us great tourist advice.  Would highly recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for a true English experience rather than staying in a contemporary chain hotel.",5,2008,08,09
105,As good as the reviews said it would be,"We always look for a good place to stay when away from home. I use TripAdviser when deciding where to stay and it has never let us down. The Chesterfield was wonderful. We stayed for three days during a weekend and from the moment we arrived to the moment that we left the Hotel we were very well looked after. All the staff are friendly and easy to speak with. The restaurant food is very, very good. Our room was small but very comfortable with everything working as it should. AND they still turn down your bed at night, something that a lot of hotels have stopped dowing these days. A very nice touch. We will certainly be back again!",5,2008,08,07
105,Great Hotel,"As regular visitors to London over the years and having been based there in the 1980`s and 90`s  my wife and myself have progressively ""tried and tested"" a large number of the capital`s hotels.

The Chesterield Mayfair ranks as one of the best and it delivers what it`s reputation implies. Located not far from Green Park Tube Station it is extremely well located for getting around the capital.

On arrival the receptionist was welcoming and despite a slight glitch with our travel companies reservation details soon had us checked into our room.We were on the seventh floor in a room that was of reasonable size, tastefully decorated and clean and well furnished with plenty of wardrobe and storage space. The bathroom was small but certainly adequate. The bed was comfortable, housekeeping of a high standard and there was little noise from outside or within the building. 

The hotel provides the twin benefits of staying in a pleasant residential area with quick access to transport links and local attractions. There are plenty of cafes and sandwich shops close by if you want snacks and drinks to take out for the day.

As we were either at shows or visiting attractions we dined out at night so only breakfasted in the restaurant which is light, pleasant and relaxing. The buffet was varied and plentiful and more than adequate for our needs so we resisted the temptations of the cooked breakfasts which did look appetising and well presented.

On this trip we did not have time for leisurely dining out in town but for a light pre/post show meal, if you like Italian food, try Cappuccetto in Moor Street (just off Cambridge Circus). If you want to pay £19 for two coffees and two cakes go to Pompidou in Irving Street just off Leicester Square.

On departure from the hotel we completed the guest questionaire and commented on the noisy room air conditioning, cold toast at breakfast and failure on two mornings to clear our used crockery. Within a few days of returning home we received a detailed letter from the General Manager confirming that these matters had been given careful attention. That is the good customer service for which the hotel is known.

We enjoyed our stay and will certainly go again.",4,2008,08,03
105,The Ultimate in Customer Service,"We arrived for a week's stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair and were constantly impressed and pleased by the extraordinary service that was provided.   Everyone was friendly and made us feel quite welcomed.   Our room was delightful, but a bit on the small side.  The bathroom was more than adequate.   Our experience in the bar and restaurant was similar; staff just seemed to really extend themselves to make you comfortable.

This was our first stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  Our previous visit to London was at the Stafford (same general area -- much more expensive).   We will return to the Chesterfield Mayfair.   Great value, great location and a wonderful staff.",5,2008,07,29
105,"Great Location, Charming hotel if you get a nice room.","My son and I just returned from a trip to London and Paris. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel was our first stop. I had emailed the hotel just after I booked our trip to secure a room with 2 double beds, seeing that I am traveling with my son. No problem, received a prompt reply, it would be taken care of. It was, however, the room we were shown first was drab, depressing and smelled. The next room we took for one night because there weren't any others, was equally drab and depressing, but we both slept well. 
The next day we were upgraded as promised, however they wanted to charge us $200 US for the upgrade. I told them if I was going to spend that I would check out and move to the Ritz Hotel. Didn't think the hotel was worth it at that price, an extra $200 per night. So, upon that they upgraded us to a suite for no extra charge.  I was considering moving hotels...but the suite was lovely. The only problem was the noise of cars outside our window at night. It made sleeping with jet lag a little difficult. 
It is a lovely hotel if your room is nice, the suites are nice, the other rooms need a face lift. 
I found the concierge to be very nice and helpful. He recommended a restaurant nearby the hotel for a very delicious dinner, VERY EXPENSIVE, but I knew what I was getting myself into. Try The Greenhouse if money isn't an issue, wonderful meal, beautiful restaurant and walking distance from the hotel. A wonderful French chef.
The bar at the hotel was cozy, great piano entertainment, however I do agree with another reviewer that said help in the bar is indifferent. It is though they are really doing you a favor by serving you one of their very high priced drinks--loose the attitude and it is a great hideout. 
Would I stay here again, perhaps, if I could be guaranteed a suite on the interior of the hotel. 
Great free computer use in the lower level, that was a plus, as I had some work to do.",4,2008,07,22
105,Wonderful hotel with PERFECT staff,"We spent a weekend in London at the Chesterfield Mayfair - and if I could, I'd hop onto the next plane and head right back!

Our stay at the Chesterfield was perfect in every way. First of all, the location couldn't be any better. It's easy to get around from Mayfair as the Green Park tube station can be reached within 3-4 minutes and the Oxford Street shopping area is not more than 10 minutes away.

Moreover, the staff is truly exceptional. Everybody, from the doorman to the concierge, is more than willing to help you in every possible way. After checking into our room we found out that our bed was too short for my husband. Although the hotel was almost fully booked, an extremely kind lady at the front desk took care of our problem and accommodated us in ""The Study"" junior suite (what a wonderfully decorated room!) at no extra charge. Thank you once again!

We had a traditional afternoon tea in the Conservatory twice - both times everything was incredibly tasty and we were offered more of all the things we enjoyed most. Again, the staff was perfect.

Also, we stayed in for breakfast on both mornings and the choice and the quality of the food items on the menu and on the buffet is exceptional.

I can recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair in every way. I'm sure even travellers used to very high standards will enjoy every single minute at this fabulous hotel!",5,2008,07,22
105,Disabled Guest Review,"Booked through londontown.com after reading TA reviews. Family of 4 (2 teens, 2 adult - 1 in wheelchair) stayed 8 nights in 2 rooms.  Yes, it was beyond nuts, I admit it right up front. but we wanted to be taken care of by a 5-star hotel.   We really weren't taken care of as expected (see below), but it was a nice enough place to make our stay an enjoyable experience. As a disabled guest in London for the first time, I was glad that the hotel, as expected, is centrally located within a short walk of good breakfast & lunch places (Cafe Necco is excellent), the Ritz (Evan Evans tour bus pick-up location), Buckingham Palace, and London's extensive bus lines.  The hotel doormen had to drag a portable lift to the doorway every time I entered and left the hotel. They eventually got used to the routine & were nice about it, but I still felt conspicuous. Lobby interior is inviting just like the pics, very British-clubby and elegant. Bar and restaurant are as nice as  pics as well, but staff is a bit indifferent in the bar.  Bathrooms are in the lower lobby and are not accessible at all.  The hotel provided me with a lovely and quiet accessible room dominated by the king-sized bed, which had a very hard uncomfortable mattress and several too-soft pillows that made sleeping difficult. AC was loud but tolerable.  Accessible bathroom had insufficient grab bars, and  a sloped entrance ramp that made wheelchair access impossible without help, and the rickety tub chair was truly treacherous. Still I was very glad to have this room once I woorked out a system for myself -  I used a manual wheelchair in the room, and switched to a rented electric one for outside use that I stored in the library at night. Hotel elevator (lift) was very small - I had to move the footrests back on the manual chair to fit inside, and it was a very tight fit for the electric one . Doormen assisted in retrieving & storing the ramp and wheelchairs but I had to get huffy with the night staff before they became more helpful.  After they knew I needed them to be more pro-active in setting up the ramp, getting the wheelchair, etc., everything went much more smoothly. Still, I feel that for a 5-star, hotel, I shouldn't have needed to be assertive to get help (just with the night staff; daytime staff was usually fine).  [Note: I found the London bus system to be very convenient to the hotel, and the busses were eminently accessible with excellent lifts.]  Staff was not very helpful at all re: sightseeing and transportation tips and assistance, again, surprising for a 5-star hotel.  I'm glad I'm self-sufficient and that I'd done all my own very extensive research in advance.  Still an elegant small hotel in a very nice, safe neighborhood that makes a visitor feel very good.  Prices are so  ridiculously high (even though I'd been duly warned, the money drain was much worse when actually experienced) that your money gushes out of your hands like flood water -  after 8 days in London I felt almost like it just didn't matter anymore, because I was so broke-what difference is another $40 breakfast of 4 bottles of juice, a small fruit container, and 2 muffins, anyway, after a week of crazy prices? Enough to make anyone punchy...!",5,2008,07,15
105,Wonderful staff & hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff are really friendly and the manager provided complementary breakfast after some confusion on the booking, and then a free room upgrade as it was our 50th wedding anniversary. What more can you ask for.

The hotel is well situated in the heart of London and the breakfast and evening meal were excellent. The room and bathroom were spacious and quiet.

We would gladly come here again in the future.",5,2008,07,14
105,Great Location and Service,"My girlfriend took me here for a weekend break for my birthday.
She wanted a good base for easy access to the city.

Location
The Hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Green Park Tube Station.

Hotel
The Hotel has an old fashioned warm and cosy feel to it, with all the mod cons discreetly hidden.
It was kept clean and tidy during our stay.

Room
Our room 601 was nice, not very large but more than adequate as we wasn't planning on staying in much. The bed was comfortable, there was ample storage and was kept clean to a very good standard.

Food & Drink
The Breakfast was very nice but pricey at £22.
The 24 hour room service lived up to its word and again was very tasty but pricey.
The Afternoon Tea was nice, served in the conservatory with the usual sandwiches, scones and cakes. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Staff
The Staff were great. All our needs were met when dining and checking in/out.
The cleaners did a great job aswell.

Overall
I would recommend this Hotel for someone wishing to stay in a good location to the city. It’s clean, relaxing and informal. The food and service that we experienced was to a good standard. Be prepared to pay for the privilege.",4,2008,07,08
105,Excellent!,"My family and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel for 3 nights in late June.  The hotel was offered as part of a vacation package booked through Costco Travel.  We were impressed with the level of service and cleanliness.  The staff clearly aims to please its guests.  Our room was small, but comfortable.  The hotel provided robes and slippers.  Amazingly, the bathroom mirror never fogged up after showers and the marble tiled floor was comfortably heated.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and Picadilly Circus.  The underground tube station is also nearby.  
The only drawback I can think of, is the hotel restaurant is very pricey......but so are many other things in Europe when purchased with the American dollar.   Overall, this hotel is a gem!",5,2008,07,08
105,A Ghost of a Beautiful Lady,"The Chesterfield Mayfair London has become a faded beauty, still interesting, but lacking a great deal.

I've stayed at the Chesterfield many times and have had wonderful stays.  I particularly enjoyed the elegant touches and the high levels of service.  Now, the Chesterfield is more like a ""nice Marriott"" than a speccial lady.  The location remains a postive.  However, the new smoking terraces of the nearby pubs create a din from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM.

My room was small, but filled with monsterously-sized furniture.  The results was a feeling being in a flea market vendor's small shop.  The bathroom was so small, that one had to take care not to hit the sink when exiting the bathtub / shower.  The closets were ample, but access to them required a contortionist.

What can one say about the price.  While the Chesterfield is not blame for the weak dollor, the prices have increase over 50% from my last stay 2+ years ago.  With the weak dollar, a commercial room was over $500 per day!

The service staff was, at best professional.  The old ""touch"" of the concierge and receptionists has been replaced by young, inexperienced people who do not suceed in pulling it off.

The bar remains lovely with excellent service.  Even the tennis ball that bought a round of drinks did not help reduce the sticker shock of a couple of glasses of house wine.

Breakfast was very nice; however, it was so expensive that I lost my appetite.

One might do a lot better at a Marriott.",2,2008,06,29
105,Fabulous,"Great location, Beautiful Room, Excellent Breakfast buffet with everything.
If staying over a weekend book the weekend special that comes with breakfast & an afternoon tea.
No negatives on anything !!",5,2008,06,28
105,Small rooms but excellent hotel,"Very centrally located close to Piccadilly. Arrived after midnight and met friendly and helpful staff. Room was quite small but it had everything; good bed, comfortable chair, wonderful bathroom with big shower in the tub and free wireless Internet access. Everything very well maintained, lots of dark wooden panels. Breakfast in the very nice Butlers restaurant, but price of £ 22 is rather stiff! Buffet was not impressive but hot dish made to order was very good.",5,2008,06,23
105,A Classic Home Away From Home,"I recently returned from a trip to the UK which included 4 nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair, the concluding stay of a 12 day business trade mission to the country.  I have stayed at The Chesterfield in the past as an individual and found it appealed to my sense of personal taste.  I thought the location perfect for our trade mission's meeting schedule in London, so I directed that we should lodge there during our London sojourn.  But I was a bit apprehensive, concerned if our fellow travellers would appreciate this hotel as I do.  All of them Americans (14), there was a predisposition towards larger properties with big expansive rooms, and I was concerned that The Chesterfield might be too intimate for them.  I needn't have worried.  Comfort and service will always stake a claim on the most jaded traveller, and The Chesterfield showers both on its guests.  The reception staff, from the cheerful doormen to attentive desk staff, were on top of our needs and quickly and efficiently got this large group sorted out, bags delivered to the proper rooms (with not one mistake...and no bar codes!!!!!!).  The Chesterfield's guestrooms, radiating warmth and comfort, made every one of our group feel 'at home'.  Chambermaids were efficient and never intrusive.  Room furnishings were traditional and rich, and in-room electronics were state of the art contemporary.  The bar was a joyful, pleasant, stylish retreat every evening.  Breakfast service in the bright and cheerful dining room was snappy and food quality top-notch.  Evening meals were perfection (try the salmon en croute from the trolley).  The staff cannot do enough, from directions to advice, and demonstrate not only good training but a high level of motivation and pride.  I love this location, so close to Piccadilly and the West End, an easy walk to Knightsbridge and Bond Street and Jermyn Street shopping,  in the heart of Mayfair.  I think there is value for money here.  The Chesterfield is one of those rare hotels where a guest is perfectly content to spend a day or evening 'in', despite the obvious appeal of London's endless attractions on the doorstep. I have visited London many times, and stayed in many hotels, but Chesterfield has become my absolute favourite, and for value, location, and total comfort  it is a winner.",5,2008,06,10
105,Chesterfield Mayfair,"It's an amazing hotel in Mayfair within walking distance of Harrods, Oxford street, Buckingham palace, and various parks. Public transport is also just a block away from the hotel. Staff in the hotel were lovely, being very friendly and helpful. 

We didn't eat in the restaurant but did have a couple of drinks in the bar. The piano playing in the background added to the ambiance no end.",4,2008,06,03
105,Exceptional Service,"Having stayed many times in London and received excellent service at hotels such as The Dorchester, The Grosvenor etc., I have never been treated to such outstanding personal service as that delivered by The Chesterfield. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and the staff could not have been friendlier or more attentive in a non obtrusive manner. Special mention is deserved by Loris, the most charming of Restaurant Managers you could wish to meet. Service in the Butlers Restaurant was outstanding whether it be for breakfast, afternoon tea or dinner, as was the quality of the food. The Dormer Suite in which we stayed was extremely pleasant and very quiet with little or no noise from outside or inside the hotel, together with lovely extra touches such as the decanter of sherry!! My wife and I will have no hesitation in returning on our next visit to London as this hotel fully deserves it's Tripadvisor rating.",5,2008,06,02
105,The best weekend ever!,"I have just returned from the most amazing long weekend in London, staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair. We arrived at the Hotel earlier than the usual check in time however  the staff were wonderful, helpful and friendly with nothing being too much trouble. We opted for a superior double room that I just cannot fault, the room was spacious, well decorated and immaculately clean. The bathroom was simply stunning with possibly the best shower either of us have ever experienced! Nice additions such as bath robes and slippers, bottled water plus ground coffee and a caffitier added to our stay. Our rate included afternoon tea which was fabulous with more of all the lovely sandwiches and cakes offered should you wish.  The breakfasts were equally as impressive with a huge choice of well prepared hot dishes on offer alongside the usual cold options.
Location wise the hotel is ideal, set a little away from the hustle and bustle of the busier areas, there are plenty of ammenities close by. The tube station (Green Lane) is only a pleasant few mins walk away, as is Piccadilly, certainly an ideal base to explore London from.
All in all I can't thank The Chesterfield Mayfair and all its staff for helping make our time in London the most fantastic weekend, Thank You!",5,2008,05,28
105,"Very nice hotel, great location","The hotel has terrific service.  The rooms are small, but very clean, well appointed.  The location is quiet and very convenient.  I would highly recommend.",4,2008,05,26
105,Lovely birthday weekend,"I selected this hotel from the trip advisor reviews for a weekend in London to celebrate my husbands birthday. I have to say we thought the hotel was very well located, a five minute walk to Green Park tube station and we easily walked to Bond Street & Oxford Street. We had a weekend package and thought this fantastic value. Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice and the smoked salmon was delicious, everything we ate at breakfast seemed to be very good quality. We also had the afternoon tea on our last day as part of our package and again we are big eaters but just couldn't manage it all (and the scones were just the best). Staff were courteous, polite and helpful without being too intrusive (a birthday card for hubby and additional magazines aimed at us were a very nice touch) and our rooms was plenty big enough and very clean. I often stay in London on business and was surprised to read someone thought the road noise was to loud? This hotel is in a residential area and has double glazing and we certainly didn't hear any traffic noise and we were on the front of the hotel.
This hotel is a little more than we usually pay when in London but we are definately planning to stay when we go back for our Christmas shopping weekend. We had two nights in a deluxe room plus breakfast, 1 afternoon tea and a complimentary bottle of champagne as part of their special 'weekender' package for £390 for two nights well worth booking.
PS: On the basis of this stay my daughter is also going to try a 'red carnation' hotel in a few weeks so let's hope they are all of a similarly high standard.
Many thanks to the Chesterfield for helping to make our weekend so special!",5,2008,05,26
105,A Luxury Long Weekend,"Just returned from a wonderful long weekend of luxury at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff did everything they could to make our stay special, from doing our whole stay at the weekend rate, to finding an Ipod docking station so we could have music in the room.

Our package came with a wonderful breakfast & afternoon tea - a fabulous selection & a meal in itself - both a bit expensive if paid for seperately! And watch out for the bar - £12 for a glass of Chardonay is a bit steep when there are great local pubs nearby.

The hotel location is the best, just minutes from Green Park & Piccadilly one way or Bond Street & Oxford Street the other. Trully central London.

The only minor issue was a little road noise during the night, but you are in the centre of town! Will definitely try to stay hear again.",5,2008,05,20
105,"OK, but restaurant had major problems","I am surprised at how highly this hotel is ranked by other Tripadvisor members. My wife and I stayed for one weekend night in April. The room was fine, although on the small side as most London hotel rooms are. The bed was OK, but no more than that. The mattress was not of the highest quality - certainly not up to Marriott (where I usually stay when in London on business) standards and not a patch on the ones we have at home, including the infrequently used guest room!

Generally the staff were friendly and attentive, although not overly so. At one point in the bar during the evening they all seemed to go AWOL at the same time, and we had to wait quite a while to get the bill. 

What really let it down was the experience in the restuarant. The table wasn't ready for us when we arrived, even though we had reservations and the place was less than half full.  It took almost an hour for the main course (fish) to arrive and when it did it was cold. We had to send it back and wait another 15-20 minutes for them to try again. It was a little better second time around, but still not right and by the time it had arrived we had finished the wine and didn't feel like ordering more. It seemed they had real problems in the kitchen that night. This was probably because it was the weekend and - the hotel mainly being aimed at mid-week business users - many of the key kitchen staff would be taking their nights off. In my experience this is an issue with other business hotels. There is, however, no excuse for poor service, especially given the restaurant prices.  One other moan about the restaurant - there was no atmosphere at all. A little music would have helped. To his credit , the restaurant manager responsed to our complaints in a very professional and courteous manner, but he obviously didn't have the staff to resolve the problems. I didn't envy him his job that night. 

The next morning there was a long line for seats at breakfast, so we didn't bother waiting, but checked out and breakfasted elsewhere. 

All in all I would not be in a great hurry to stay at this hotel again.",2,2008,05,19
105,Perfectly Charming!,I absolutely loved my stay at the Chesterfield.  We arrived earlier than the normal check-in time and they accomodated us.  The room was beautifully appointed and the location of the hotel cannot be beat for London sightseeing.  Lots of amenities and very conenient to the Tube.  I'll definitely be staying here again.,5,2008,05,15
105,Lovely Hotel.,"I took my wife to London for her birthday and we stayed here.
The hotel is lovely and the best one I have stayed in so far.
The staff are very pleasant and helpfull.
The Chef cooked us a fantastic meal.
The asparagus was delicious and my wife loved the chicken pie.

The room was very cosy and the bed very comfortable.

Its my birthday soon and I am hoping for a return trip.",5,2008,05,14
105,What a Great London Hotel,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights on a business trip and it was great. The meeting I was attending was at a larger hotel but I wanted something smaller and in a quieter area. I had a single room which was very small but very nice. All amenities, marble bath etc.  I arrived from New York at 10:00 AM and they had a room ready for me (I had emailed with this request) The room was on the second floor on the street but was very quiet. This Mayfair neighborhood is terrific. You can pop outside for a short walk to several very nice parks. And you are just several minutes from the tube. I had breakfast in the dining room two mornings and on the third day it was brought to my room since I was leaving early. Had a sandwich and a beer at the bar one night and that was very good. They have a computer with an internet connection which is great when you're traveling. Everyone was very nice. I hope to come back with my wife someday! Highly recommended!",5,2008,05,12
105,Extraordinary Hotel,"My daughter, grandson and I just returned from a splendid holiday in London.  We were privileged to stay in 2 adjoining rooms at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

The rooms, although small, were beautifully appointed with wonderful amenities.  The fresh bottles of water in the morning and again at turndown were truly welcomed.

The dining room is better than lovely with a full English breakfast served every morning.  Before dinner drinks at the bar and dinner at Butlers were a real treat.  

All of the above comments are a mere nothing compared to the splendid staff.  Ben Yeager, the front office manager and Sam Goss, the food and beverage manager are responsible for having the most professional team I have seen in years.

If it were not for the strong pound against our weak dollar, I would return next month to this most amazing hotel.",5,2008,05,02
105,Great choice. Great atmosphere. Great people,"I stayed at the hotel from the 24th to the 28th of April 2008. I booked it after I read the excellent reviews here.  My flight was late so I arrived very late at the hotel but I found everything to be ready and waiting for me.

 Truth be told there was a mistake with my room but I must say that they fixed it ASAP and with no problems. So please take that into consideration. Mistakes are human and the important thing for me and what I am choosing to remember  is how swiftly they were dealt with and the manner in which that was made. What I am trying to say is speak up and your issues will be addressed. And solved. In my case every little or big detail I asked for was dealt with exceptionally by the people there and always with a smile. Non of them seemed to be bored or seemed to do things mechanically. The staff is extremely helpful throughout the hotel but not oppressive. They give you room to breath sort of speak. 

On another note I loved that people throughout the hotel greet you when you pass by them at any time of the day. 
Gives the place a very friendly atmosphere. 
 
Being disabled I was a little apprehensive about staying there because allot of the reviews on Tripadvisor state that it is not suitable for people with disabilities. Because of my condition I need things the average traveller does not. 
 
  Let me tell you that I did not find a problem whilst I was staying there. The hotel is accessible with lifts and rooms with ramps if requested. There is no ramp in the entrance of the hotel but rest assured if you need help they will help you. The rooms are a little cluttered but if you wish to have more manoeuvrability you can ask for things to be taken out of the room and it will be done swiftly. That is what I did. Some things I had moved around and others I had taken out of my room and replaced with others. (in my case chairs with good back support were needed and not the average chairs in the room). 

Breakfast was lovely. I was given special seating and I used the pillows provided. They even went out of their way to bring me fresh cinnamon and honey with my pancakes and waffles. (Something I am sure is considered very strange in the UK but is very common practice in my country). 

The bar is very nice and they play nice piano music there in the evenings. It also offers snacks and light meals that are more affordable than the ones in the restaurant. 

The first night I was taken to room 415 and it was a very nice room but a bath rather than a shower. After that I was moved to room 219. It did a shower as I had requested. Rooms were also of a good size considering we are in London. 

The rooms seemed to be soundproof. I was not bothered by any noise from the rooms next to mine. Being on the second floor I did not seem to have any problem with noise as I have read on some other reviews here. 

I found the library a nice and relaxing spot to sit in. Takes you away from most of the noisiest parts of the hotel. There is also wifi access throughout the hotel which is brilliant and it did come in handy especially on the day I was checking out and was waiting for my shuttle to come. 

There is easy access to green park tube station. It is just a few minutes away and easy to get to. Next to Green park tube station there was a M&S in case I needed anything and it is not out of my way even one step as it is right next to the station. So I just stopped there before heading back to the hotel. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this hotel and am planning to stay there again. I recommend this hotel to everyone. 

The one thing  that really needs much work at the hotel is their coffee. Neither the breakfast coffee or cappuccino that I tried were drinkable. I ended up having an extra coffee from one of the coffee shops near the hotel and/or Starbucks throughout London.

It is no fluke that this hotel is so high up on London hotels list on this site. I can't wait to go back there! Had a wonderful time.",5,2008,05,02
105,Nice Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel. We found the staff to be courteous and very helpful. We had breakfast included in our package and it is extremely good. 
We had dinner at the hotel one night but did not think that the restaurant met our expectations nor those of some of the London restaurant review sites. We certainly would not have dinner at the hotel again as the food was only average.
We also had afternoon tea on one afternoon with friends and found that experience to be very good.
The room was not large but was very comfortable and provided all of the amenities expected of a hotel of this class.
We have stayed in London on four occasions over recent years and found the location of this hotel to be very convenient to public transport and many of the places that would be visited as a tourist.",4,2008,04,29
105,A very decent place to spend time,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for four days. The hotel clearly takes its reputation and its standard seriously and tries to give the guest the impression that he is in a high-class location.

Right at the beginning, an attendant showed us the room meticulously, including instrutions for the TV remote, the coffee maker and the two telephones. Although a bit overstated, it is very typical for the Chesterfield.

Rooms are in an excellent condition, shiny, clean (if you wanna be really picky: one day, a part of the curtain was not in order) and very inviting. The staff is very friendly, room, laundry and food service are very enjoyable.

The food (a buffet that was included in our rate) has everything you need, but fails to surprise you with any really interesting creations. Worse, however, is the quality of the coffee, which made us speed to the next Starbucks soon after we had left breakfast.

That being said, however, there are no more major flaws in the hotel. All of our questions regarding cultural events, cab services to further places (which appearantly is a problem in London) were met with haste and competence.

If you are into sports, the hotel might not be the best idea, though: Yes, they give you a brochure with possible running routes nearby, but the building itself lacks both a spa and a fitness centre (you can go to a nearby facility for free).

The Chesterfield does a good, sometimes even excellent service to its customers. It's probably not the best hotel of London, but well worth the money for people who want to stay in a nice area (good Indian restaurant nearby).",4,2008,04,26
105,Loved the Chesterfield,"We stayed at The Chesterfield from April 12 - 19th. It was cold and rainy but we still had a great time. Two rooms with my two teenagers and it could not have been better. Clean, clean, clean..The best location, near Green Park and Hyde Park and very quiet - but around the corner from the hustle which my kids liked.  I walked in the quiet of Green Park and Hyde Park each morning before  everyone got up.   Extremely safe  area  and  within walking distance to all the sites in London, plus Regent Street for  fun shopping.. Two local Pubs, The Red Lion and The Only Running Footman are  next door and serve up fabulous London Pub Fare. Many, many other fine restaurants  nearby - the  hotel staff was amazing!

You won't miss if you book at this hotel.  The best I have stayed at in any country",5,2008,04,25
105,Still a great Hotel,"Second stay in a year.
This is a very quiet Hotel, must have good sound proofing.
Facilities are a little limited and it is quite small but they make the most of what they do have.
Good value and wonderful location.",5,2008,04,23
105,What a wonderful experience !!!,"I could be described by my children as being rather difficult to please and I am sure when they booked the Chesterfield Hotel for my 70th birthday, they must have been a bit anxious, to say the least. Well, they need not have worried, myself and my wife had the most wonderful stay there . The staff were so kind, helpful and friendly. We were very impressed and loved everything about the hotel. The room was beautifully ( and recently ) decorated and spotlessly clean! We enjoyed the most delicious and generous breakfast every morning, a must before setting off to view the sights of London! We relaxed in the Hotel'sTerrace Bar in the evenings, where we sat istening to the piano while enjoying the delicious (and reasonbly priced) bar food. The previous month,my daughter, her husband and their six year old also stayed here and had a great time too, so it appeals to all ages!! 
I would heartily recomend this fantastic hotel to anyone , young or not so young , if like myself , they have very high standards and insist on the very best !!",5,2008,04,21
105,An average stay ......,"We booked the hotel through one of the links on tripadvisor and got a very good rate for a ""superior double"".  Having stayed at some fantastic hotels throughout the UK in the days leading up to our time in London we were dissappointed.  While we cannot complain about anything in particular we found the room to be small (we were also on low down in the hotel and near the lift lobby which made it quite noisy).",3,2008,04,12
105,Great weekend at the Chesterfield,"We have just returned from a weekend in London staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The hotel was lovely, the staff exceptional & our overall impression very good.  The location could not be better for the things we wanted to do - Knightsbridge/Regent St/Oxford St/British Museum.

The only very very slight things that we found were all down to the fact that we had our 1 year old son with us - the rooms are tiny (central london I know) and we our room overlooked the front of the property which was very very noisy on Friday night, as there is a pub just down the road.

Had we been on our own, none of the above would have been an issue.

We will most certainly return & if our baby is with us request a bigger room overlooking the back of the property.

A brilliant weekend - only real downside?  Terminal 5 at Heathrow, but that's another story!",4,2008,04,09
105,Great Easter Holiday- John & Zeline,"Our first trip to London and couldn'at have picked a better place to stay than the Chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel has great character- from the library to the restaurant, bar, lobby and conservatory. Our superior king room wasn't large, but it was quite charming. We enjoyed  the robes, slippers, afternoon snacks-great ammenities.The staff, however, is what  really makes this hotel. They were all polite, helpful, and quick to responsd to our requests. Our favorite person was Loris in the Butler restaurant. We have included his photo. Charming and a good conversationist. We recommend this hotel to all who are traveling to London-We plan to stay there soon.",5,2008,04,05
105,Exceptional stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair!,"Although it's been awhile since our visit to The Chesterfield Mayfair, I still remember what a wonderful experience it was!  We were there in June 2007-My first visit to London, I really wanted an classic English experience and this was definately the place!  My husband was working in London during our 4 day stay, so I was also nervous about safety and I can say I felt very comfortable being out and about during the day on my own.  The 5 minute walk to Green Park Tube Station was the perfect chance to take in all the local sights.  I made it to all the attractions using The Tube. I might add, as a first time visitor to London, one of my favorite things I did on my own was purchase a $25 ticket for the day to ride one of those double decker buses.  I chose the narrated routes- 3 different routes for one price-  (funny dialouge by the narrators) and had such a great view from the top deck, that i did not want to get off the bus!  Great idea for families or rainy day way to see the city effortlessly, esp to get your barings and become familiar with the layout of the city!  CLose to the hotel was The Shepard's Market, a quaint area to grab a bite to eat and Picadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, The bURLINGTON Arcade, most museums (the V & A) and Trafalgar Square all within walking distance.  I even walked to Harrod's (about a 15-20 min jaunt) because it was a lovely sunny day.  Upon arrival from the airport (after 3pm) our room was ready and waiting.  We were on the 5th floor and looked out the front of the hotel.  Not an exceptional view because of the window casing and window size, you could crane your neck to look up and down the street if you wished.  The room was very quiet and most comfortable- non smoking and never smelled any smoke at all.  The king bed & bed linens were exceptional, but seemed low to the floor for our american standards.  Yes, the room was also small by american standards, but i was fully expecting this since we were in Europe, after all!  We never felt cramped, and the size of the room added to the charm and English ambiance.  The bathroom was perfect in every way and sparkling clean. The front desk staff and concierge were EXCEPTIONAL!  We decided to have some friends join us for our reservation for High Tea at THe Ritz Carlton and the concierge was able to change our reservation for us, not once but twice.  Very patient and most professional staff that i have encountered anywhere in the world! When we inquired about  last minute theater tickets, they gave us  honest and detailed advice about checking at the TKTS booth near Leicester Square, this was perfect for us and saved us lots of $$ on last minute theater tickets.  We did not dine in the restaurant, but now reading all the wonderful reviews, i wish we would have!  We made a late night stop at the hotel bar and enjoyed the piano player and complimentary snacks.  Wonderful bartender and staff there.  I have recently recommended this hotel to several friends, and honestly you cannot beat the location and ambiance of this hotel.  I would not want to stay anywhere else in London!  Promise we'll be back one day!",4,2008,03,29

105,Business and Pleasure,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in late January, 2008, while on my return to North America from meetings in Europe.   Although I had no meetings in London, I still needed to send e-mail and faxes for issue follow-up.  The complimentary wireless internet connection provided in the room was more than adequate for the e-mail and internet research I needed to perform.  The front desk received and sent faxes for me promptly and confidentially.  Even in my single room, the workspace and supplies were excellent.  When I returned to my room after a day of museum going and generally tramping about London, it was a great pleasure to see my bed turned down, the TV guide turned to the evening's listings, and the room service menu already opened.  The first night I arrived, ragged from too much work and not enough play, I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant.  If it is possible to feel wrapped in tender care by complete strangers in a public place, Butler's restaurant is the place to provide it.  This is not always the case for business women travelling alone, and  it began my stay at the Chesterfield on the best possible note.  From service to amenities to cleanliness to location, the Chesterfield met and exceeded my expectations.  The attention to detail and overall guest care went beyond anything for which I have paid a similar price in New York City.",5,2008,03,06
105,An oasis in our capital,"This last 2 night stay was our 4th visit to the Chesterfield. From the first moment we stepped over their threshold, staff made us feel so welcome. All the rooms that we have stayed in, the latest being 522, have been great.
The location is perfect, quiet but just a 5 minute walk from Piccadilly and the same to Hyde Park and Oxford Street.
Service is impeccable, breakfast really sets you up for the day and Dinner in the restaurant is very good.
Ahhhh the thought of a sandwich and glass of champagne in the Bar, after arrival is so convivial.
Home form Home in London for us.

105,A Fantastic Place!,"General Manager Oliver Raggett and his staff know how to do it right.  They handled everything for us -- from setting us up with tours to acquiring football (soccer) tickets to giving us directions to navigating the Tube -- painlessly and efficiently. The rooms were clean and comfortable and they pampered us almost too much. They are friendly and professional, especially in the details many places overlook.

The hotel itself was luxurious and perfectly located in central London, with easy access to the entire city via Tube or walking.",5,2008,02,06
105,A charming place!,"I choose the hotel based on the reviews on this page.
I stayed a weekend (25/-27/1)  together with my wife and we loved it.
The rooms are tiny (even by London standards) but really nice and the staff is excellent.

105,Chesterfield Mayfair Happy Haven Heart of London,"Chesterfield Mayfair staff, location and comfort made our stay in London one to remember. My daughter (10 years) and I travelled without hubby who usually does booking, destination finding, carrying to much baggage and hunting and gathering (translated means: finding best restuarants). So to have staff at the Chesterfield happy to provide all these and a comfort level that saw us happily fall into bed each night after a huge day of soking up the sights was a blessing.

The staff were mostly not phased by my bute aussie accent  and bemused by my odd sense of humour ( I sometimes find the 'lack of english reaction' quite quirky). The Chestefield restaurant 'Butlers' has left me with a remembered love of tea and toast resonant of 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' famous 'Lucy's tea with Mr Tumnus' scene.",5,2008,01,31
105,Great Experience,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield from the 18-20th Jan on a 'Mayfair Weekend' package booked directly through the hotel website.  From we arrived at the hotel the service from the staff was efficient, friendly and helpful.  Our room wasn't that big but had everything we needed for our weekend break as well as being spotlessly clean.

The breakfast each morning, which was included in our package, was a dream, with a great selection from the buffet as well as a lovely cooked selection.  The service was excellent which made it a very enjoyable and relaxing start to the day.  We also availed of the Afternoon tea, which again was included, and I can only describe it as delicious, with wonderful pastries, cakes, sandwiches and scones which was served beautifully.

The hotel staff really make this place and for the first time in a long while I felt totally at ease during my stay and really couldn't find anything to grumble about.  The hotel is in a good location, about 10-15mins walk to the tube station but you can easily walk to lots of the sites directly through some nice areas.

Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back to stay again!",5,2008,01,31
105,Disappointing,"Having read all the amazing reviews in the site and after a very good experience with the authenticity of reviews on Trip-Advisor I was very disappointed with this hotel.

This is a nice expensive hotel with pleasant staff, especially the concierge but this is by no means the fifth best hotel in the world or the first\second in London. This is ridicules. I myself have been to several better hotels in London at similar prices.

Rooms – We booked 2 upgraded Superior King Rooms. The rooms were extremely small, pleasant but so small it was annoying. The rooms were facing an inside court that was looking straight at other rooms.  

Connecting Rooms – At booking we asked for connecting rooms. We were told that they can not guarantee but let us understand that they will make an effort. Upon arrival we were told that no connecting rooms were available and that the hotel was fully booked. I asked three times the reception if they can move us to connecting rooms later on our stay and got the same answer. Only on our third day, one of the receptionists told me that they don’t have any connecting Superior King Rooms, at all in the hotel. Funny they did not mention it on the phone when I made the reservation.

Service – The concierge staff were very kind and helpful, extremely helpful, the best experience we had in the hotel.
The reception staff as mentioned earlier were not helpful and were quite impatience to our simple request (we later understood why).

Location – The location is not as good as stated in the reviews. It is a nice area but a little to far to walk to places. Maybe that was because it was so clod.

Restaurant – we did not eat breakfast at the hotel (22 pounds per person) but ate one evening in the restaurant. The food was very mediocre, the staff pleasant and we had a visit of a mouse which did not seem to bother the head waiter at all. 

All in all, a nice expensive hotel but not nearly as good as described in the reviews. 
I was disappointed. I guess it is all a matter of expectations.",4,2008,01,30
105,"Good location, disappointing service","Having read all the rave reviews on Trip Advisor about the Chesterfield, we went expecting to be impressed. However things did not go well from check in onwards.

Having requested rooms together we were advised that we had been placed 5 floors apart. When they managed to correct this – after waiting a good half an hour – we were sent to the only smoking floor in the hotel – without being told. Coming from New Zealand where everything is smoke free – we were appalled. When we complained we were treated as if we were being difficult and it took a further half and hour before they managed to accommodate us – again we were 5 floors apart.

Our booking, direct with the hotel, was supposed to include a free upgrade subject to availability, but there was no mention of this at all, and the complimentary bottle of wine was undrinkable. 

The rooms were absolutely tiny – the single room could barely accommodate a suitcase and there was no view to speak of. For the price it did not seem like good value for money. 

On the plus side the concierge was very helpful, the breakfasts were adequate and bar had a very English feel. The location was within walking distance of major London attractions, like Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and the National Gallery. 

Overall we would not recommend this hotel based on the service and the size of the rooms.",3,2008,01,26
105,Absolutely no complaints,"My wife and I stayed here on a two night Superbreak stay in January and were impressed from the outset.
Upon arrival we asked if we had been allocated a quiet twin room. Without further ado we were instantly upgraded, at no extra cost, to a spacious State room on the 7th floor at the rear of the hotel. This was as quiet as any hotel room in London can be apart from a constant hum from what I took to be the air conditioning sysem in the loft above us. Oddly enough this did not in any way keep us awake at night and probably actually drowned out any peripheral noises that might have been around. Needless to say we slept well!
Breakfast was a smooth operation, despite being warned that we might need to queue for a table. In our case this comprised a very short wait whilst sitting comfortably and reading the ( complimentary ) newspaper. The cooked breakfasts ( buffet style ) were excellent and there were plenty of healthier options for those less greedy than us.
Check in and check out were painless and without hassle. Our room was pleasantly furnished with extremely comfortable beds, our only quibble being a slight tattiness here and there.
The location is excellent and Piccadilly Circus is easily walkable for all but the most slothful.
Last, but not least, there is a Tesco Express opposite the hotel, for all those midnight feast items. What more could one ask?
We hope to stay here again the next time we are in the 'Big City'.",4,2008,01,21
105,Best Hotel I've ever been in,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Dec. 07 and loved it.  We read all of the tripadvisor reviews and disagree with some of them.  There is no smoky bar - all public areas are smoke free.  If you are going to stay at the Chesterfield then save extra money and eat there.  The food preperation is unbelievable and the service excellent. A large part of the experience of the Chesterfield is the wonderful pampering by the staff.  You have to be around to be pampered.  They make you feel very special and important but in no way pandered to, nor are they insincere - real hospitality people doing a great job.  We had a regular small room, beautifully decorated, coffee, hot chocolate and plenty of cookies free.  Absolutely silent, no sounds of anykind from anywhere.  Cosy, comfortable, pleasant to be in. The hotel is located at Pearl and Charles streets.  One block down Pearl and you'll be in Shepards Market where there are plenty of bars, takeouts and markets.  Eat there if you want to be jammed in, smoked up and served low average to poor food - you'll save some money but you'll miss half the fun of the Chesterfrield.  Many people have their dinner in the bar of the Chesterfield to save on that meal.  A 20oz mug of Stella beer, a big puffy sandwich, french fires, tons of cashews, etc.  Don't take the tube from the airport unless you want fight the crowds, heft your bags up long stairs to get out of the underground and then walk a mile to the hotel (it's not as easy as some people let on).  Take the dot to dot shareride.   Seventy bucks airport to hotel door and when they pick you up, if you pay for a discounted round trip - it's your hotel straight to the airline of your choice.   I really debated with myself whether to make this review public - more people will want to come and it's going to make reservations more difficult .  There is a very good reason why the Chesterfield has so many good reviews.  ITS NOT A HOTEL, IT'S A LIFETIME MEMORY!!

105,Loved Everything,"This is Simply the best hotel in London. For couples, business men/women or  a lady travelling alone. The staff are fantastic. The food is fantastic and Loris the resturant manager is the most pleasant and knowledgable in the business. My husband and I were on business with a tourist weekend added in.From we entered the hotel and met Peter who showed us round the hotel to the maids it was like living at a home from home where comfort is the name of the game. The dinner was fantastic, the afternoon tea a dream (try the pink champagne). In the evening there is a fantastic piano player in the bar and the barstaff with their white jackets just look and are the business. Try a top of the range  French Martini.The rooms are clean and have everything, the night turn down service is bettter than The Balmoral in Edinburgh ( my favourite Hotel).
I was sorry to leave, hey I am just away to book again.",5,2008,01,17
105,Excellent small hotel in London,"Wanted a really British experience.  This is a very elegant small hotel on a quiet side street.  Very comfortable...very British in style.  Nice neighborhood, great location.... A little pricey but exactly what I hoped for.",5,2008,01,10
105,3rd visit - Wouldn't stay anywhere else,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from just after Christmas through the New Year.  This was our third stay in 13 months (significant for someone from Atlanta, Georgia). We have always found the Chesterfield Mayfair to be a wonderful place to stay. Rooms are comfortable. Location is excellent. But the most important thing - as others have mentioned - is the first rate service. We stayed at the Dorchester twice before finding the Chesterfield. And although the room at the Dorchester was incredible - the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair far surpasses them. We especially enjoyed the breafast, with Sam and Loris ensuring our every need was met.  We plan to retun in the spring.",5,2008,01,09
105,Does exactly what it says on the tin....,"Excellent hotel, excellent service. Nothing more to add!",5,2008,01,08
105,Great Choice Great Location,"Stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from 12/23 to 12/26 and had a great time. As written, the room was small but nice and we had no problems with any of the accomodations. The bed was great and the staff very friendly. The concierge desk could have been a bit more helpful with suggestions on where to eat on Christmas night (I was giving them numbers to call that I got off the ""Time Out"" website) but not really much of a complaint. Breakfast in the dining room on Christmas morning was wonderful and the staff was not at all bothered at having to work. There was a stocking filled with Candy hanging on our door when we came out that morning. The bellmen always greeted us by name and were more than helpful...The location is superb. A short walk to the Green Park tube entrance and a short walk to Trafalgar. We walked to a Christmas Eve church service at the Grosvner Chapel, and to Gordon Ramsey's ""Maze"" restaurant. The Mayfair area of London is very charming. Covent Garden and now Mayfair are my 2 favorite places to stay in London..",4,2008,01,05
105,First Class Service the Difference,"We stayed at The Chesterfield after reading the reviews on here, and managing the get a bit of a deal on a last minute room.  

The rooms themselves (we paid for a standard double) were a little dated in decor, but  very comfortable indeed, with everything we could have expected.  The service at the hotel was first class however, with friendly smiles and helpful staff from start to end.  Even though we probably had one of the cheapest rooms in the place, we were made to feel like the most important guests in the building at all times.

The location was also very good; right in the heart of Mayfair and near the tube.  

I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone, and would gladly stay there again.",5,2008,01,03
105,Exquisite,"Booked this hotel for my Husbands 40th birthday after reading all the reviews.  I am delighted to say that we were not disappointed.  I had contacted the hotel before going to arrange some balloons in our room and to have champagne in the bar.  Everything that I asked for was done.  The service was impeccable and the hotel was just wonderful.

It is really only a 5 minute walk from Green park tube and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Picadilly circus, Leicester square and more.

I cannot thank the team at the hotel enough.  Nothing was too much trouble and the staff do really make you feel welcome.  So a huge thanks to everyone who made it a memorable weekend.   

PS The breakfast was delicious!!!!",5,2007,12,20
105,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel during a week-end just before Christmas, enjoying their so-called ""week-end package"". The location was perfect, the staff very helpful.....beyond expectations. Definitely I would reccomend it and I hope to be back again.",5,2007,12,17
105,Loved it!,"My husband and I have just enjoyed a weekend in London staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The staff were attentive, polite and extremely helpful.  It is a typically olde worlde hotel situated in a quiet street.  We found the location to be ideal for shopping, theatres, galleries and just about everywhere else too!  Our only one disappointment was the lack of a mini-bar in our bedroom, although they do supply complimentary tea/coffee and water.",5,2007,12,17
105,Chesterfield delivers again!,"My hubby and I stayed here for 2 nights on 1st and 2nd December. I booked this hotel for a short break for our wedding Anniversary through the Hotels own website. 
I chose a 'Mayfair Weekend' package which I have booked before as it is such great value: breakfast daily, complimentary bottle champagne on arrival and full afternoon tea for 2 on one day, all for £215 per night plus VAT. 

I filled out the guest preference form which you can download from the website after you get your booking through and ticked a few items that we would like in the room: feather pillows, telegraph newspaper etc etc and in the special date/occasion just mentioned it was our wedding anniversary think nothing of it.

When we arrived at the hotel after a horrible flight into Heathrow, we couldn't have been made more welcome. They told us we had been upgraded us to a junior suite and wished us a happy Anniversary! There were canapés in the room and a card from the Manager again wishing us a happy anniversary, it was fabulous.The room was lovely and newly re-decorated, lovely bathroom and flat screen TV in bedroom. Breakfast was fab as usual and the afternoon tea was lovely, very filling, the scones were delicious.

I certainly did not expect any special treatment just because it was our anniversary, but it did really make our weekend, and we needed it after a month or so of stress at work! I know from previous stays that the service is great all the time, the staff go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful and it really does seem genuine.  

This is my 3rd stay at this hotel and I will not hesitate to stay there again. Other hotels, especially some 5 star ones I've stayed in should take note, this is a 4 star hotel with platinum service.",5,2007,12,14
105,Great Service - Great Restaurant,"The Chesterfield does deserve its plaudits - I guess when staying at a big city hotel we all maybe lower our expectations a little as we are something of a captive audience.   

In fairness to the Chesterfield they don't take the guest for granted and this shows from the welcome all the way to the check out.  The reception and bell boy staff are friendly and efficient and endearingly determined to make sure you have all the information you need for a comfortable stay.  I've never had such a comprehensive introduction to my room and how all the utilities function!

Our rooms were very nice, a decent size for London, nicely decorated.  That isn't to say they are overly fancy; the bedding is a little old fashioned but crisp and clean and there's no flat screen TV but overall its very comfortable and adequate.

For me the highlight is the restaurant - not just a place for guests to eat breakfast but actually a destination dining room in its own right.  This is exactly why you would choose this sort of hotel over the corporates - superb decor, service and a traditional English menu done very well.

Location is teriffic - right in the heart of things with lovely twisty London streets all around dotted with all manner of unusual quirky shops.

I've stayed in many hotels across London and this is the first time I've left not feeling dissapointed.",4,2007,12,11
105,"Great Location, Comfortable Stay, Professional Staff","A friend and I just returned from our stay in London - we spent 7 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and we couldn't have been happier. The hotel is tucked into the charming neighborhood streets of Mayfair, within easy walking distance to many fine pubs and restaurants - we were a quick cab ride to Harrods, Oxford St. and the London Eye - for those interested in taking the tube, it's a quick 5 minute walk to the closest stop - go for it.

The staff was amazingly helpful, and just as charming as the location, we felt completely at home - and often enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar after dinner.

Probably more in sync with couples traveling w/out kids, perfect for the business traveler.",4,2007,12,07
105,deserves its high ranking!,"Perfect location. Quite small but cozy and well appointed rooms. Excellent service. Deliciouse breakfast and tea. Just the nice and peaceful retreat you are longing for after a busy day in London. 5 minutes walk from ""everything"" and still so quiet, both day and night. The staff really seemed to do everything to keep us happy and satified, not because they had to, but because they wanted to. We will definitly stay there again, and have already recommended the hotel to our friends.",5,2007,12,06
105,"Great location, great service, charming hotel","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 3 nights mid September. The location is great, walking distance from the Piccadilly Circus and the Buckingham Palace. 
The staff was very warm and friendly at all times, even to my little toddler. The food is overpriced, but that is London for you!!
The rooms are a good size considering Europe's standards and the bathrooms are very well appointed. We had a great view of the courtyard from our room.
Overall, we had a great stay and would absolutely stay here again.",5,2007,12,05
105,Good central location - charming hotel,"Stayed three nights at Chesterfield based on TA recommendations.  Overall impressions were that the hotel is extremely charming and decor is consistent with the old world theme.  The breakfast was wonderful and was a real full breakfast.  We did not stay for dinner but had afternoon tea one day which was only ok for the price we paid.  Rooms were a bit small for what we expected but you sort of have to temper expectations being in Central London and especially Mayfair.  The area surrounding the hotel is phenomenal - extremely quiet and very upscale.  The area makes the stay at Chesterfield seem to be very exclusive.  Tony at the concierge even scored us a reservation at Gordon Ramsay's at Claridges - I had tried to call a week earlier but got turned away.  Overall, I would stay at Chesterfield again but perhaps splurge a bit more in a larger room.",5,2007,12,01
105,Not Quite What We Had Expected,"For our wedding anniversary my husband and I had decided on a two night stay in London. Having read the excellent reviews we were looking forward to staying at The Chesterfield. I had booked by phone in September and specifically requested the Music Room and asked to be e-mailed confirmation. Two weeks later I had to ring again and request confirmation, which then duly came. We arrived just before check-in, which is 2pm to be told that our room was not available because the previous guests were still in there, and due to a special package may not check out until 6pm. When my husband asked why we had not been told about this the reply was ""it was a late booking""! At this point I did wonder if I had arrived at the wrong hotel - not one charging £399.00. + vat.  per night. Seeing that we were not happy another member of staff came over and offered us an upgrade to another suite. We ended up in The Duchess Suite, which although perfectly comfortable was decorated in the style of a Victorian gentlemen's club - lots of old prints, very brown and dark. Not quite what we had in mind for our anniversary! Breakfast the following morning was again not what I would have hoped for at a charge of £24.00. Although the room was virtually empty - only two other couples when we arrived, every one there seemed to be having problems with getting what they had ordered. The next day we decided to breakfast out and I can recommend Europa - 37 Albemarle Street for a tasty cooked breakfast at £6.00. Hoping that the evening food would be better we ordered room service, again there were problems with the order and when my steak arrived it was completely overcooked. I would have sent it back but we were due at a concert, so didn't have time. Finally, when we got home I realised we'd been overcharged on our use of the mini bar. Now for the good bits! The location is excellent, and quiet at night. The majority of the staff are extremely helpful and courteous. We were asked if we were happy in our room and I'm sure had we wanted to raise other issues these too would have been dealt with, but we wanted to get on with enjoying our time in London together. Which we did immensely.",2,2007,11,25
105,excellent choice great personal service!!!,"Stayed at this hotel recently and arrived early (before 2pm) left our bags with the hotel, the hotel staff were very helpful and helped us with bags doors etc, went shopping and came back our room wasnt ready still alothough they were very apologetic about this and we waited in the hotels lovely bar area warm and very inviting after a mad crazy day spent shopping.

We got our room key for our junior suite eventually and our bags were all laid out for us in the room, the room had a baby cot as we requested and the room was not as large as i wouldve expected after paying extra to have the junior suite although it was themed and the furnishings were very lavish and the bathroom was large with a jacuzzi bath. (which after a day shopping in london was a delight!)

We really enjoyed the service at their bar and in the morning for breakfast the staff just couldnt do enough for you i would say the hotel should probably be rated 5 star as it was immmaculate and service was second to none.

overall apart from small rooms, the hotel is really nice with a good location just of berkley sq and 5 mins walk to oxford st, it is charming and the staff cant do enough for you, and i would stay here again.",4,2007,11,21
105,Loved the Chesterfield Mayfair,"We spent 9 days at the Chesterfield Mayfair in London.  It excelled our expectations.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  They made us feel at home.  The service was prompt and the restaurant served excellent food. 

The hotel itself has retained the old style charm of the past while it has been upgraded.  Modern conveniences have been added but the cozy charm has been well maintained.  It is charming boutique hotel.

Furthermore, the location is a plus.  It is near both the tube and bus stops.  Shepherd's Market is only one block away.  There we found a number of good little restaurants that were affordable, considering the drop in the dollar.",5,2007,11,14
105,Outstanding Hotel,We visit London twice a year and The Chesterfield is the only hotel we would ever consider staying.  The hotel itself is beautiful - sophisticated and elegant yet small and charming like a private club.  The staff is second to none and everyone makes sure your stay is the very best.  The bar and restaraunt are excellent - both the food and the very gracious staff.    The Chesterfield is like our home away from home.,5,2007,11,13
105,Lovely treasure of a hotel.,"We just finished our honeymoon with a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about the room, and the staff.  The are warm and attentive.  The room was comfortable and beautiful.  The location could not be beat.  We were thrilled with the quiet, wonderfully appointed hotel.  We would absolutely stay there again, and recommend them at the highest level to anyone!",5,2007,11,12
105,A question of luck,"This is the third time I have stayed at the Chesterfield. My first room was very noisy, as it gave onto Charles Street - just about every taxi in London must go past the hotel. At the time, I told the hotel that ""less would be more"": The small room is so overcrowded with little pillows, vases and other unnecessary items that you can hardly move round. The second time I was lucky as I had a room at the back, but it was equally clustered. This time was the worst, though I was told I had been upgraded to a junior suite. The floorboards creaked so much in my room and in those next and above it that I did not dare go to the - tiny - bathroom during the night! Short of lying on the bed, it was very uncomfortable to watch the - not flat-screen - TV. The drawers were too small to put a shirt into them. The room is being heated through the air-conditioning - very noisy and it blows the smoke from the smoking rooms into what should be a non-smoking room. So, do beware of the rooms which have a name plate on the door!
Now a more positive note: As other reviewers have pointed out, staff are very friendly and I love the restaurant, especially in the evening, though breakfast is also very good (too expensive).
I shall return to the Chesterfield, but only to eat, not to stay.",2,2007,11,11
105,"Brilliant Service, Accommodation, Location & Staff!","As with other reviewers here and elsewhere we found The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel exceeded our expectations in every respect.  As you may see from my other reviews I rarely give ""5"" ratings; simply because so few places merit a perfect score. 

The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel deserves a 5+++!  Honestly, we could not have been MORE impressed and pleased with the quality of the accommodation, location, service, staff & facilities.  Perfect on every front and we're quite demanding!  For those interested more details follow below, but in short:  a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair will not disappoint and provided very good value for price in London. Check their website directly for special offers which certainly were advantageous over the web-based travel sites. 

Reception:  We arrived at noon Friday and hoped for an early check-in.  We had let them know we'd be early and while they would not guarantee availability our room was ready upon arrival; obviously this started things off on the right foot!  Reception staff were of course welcoming & courteous.  The concierge, Darren Briggs, was an absolute GEM! He recognized our name, provided the theater tickets delivered from a friend, suggested some restaurants near the theater and gave us a brief review assuring us we'd be very entertained by the musical Wicked!

The Room (#214; Superior King) As others mention the rooms are truly quite lovely, immaculately clean and designed to satisfy travelers requirements. Our room,  is pictured on their website (taupe-striped silk draping & mirror above the bed) and was even more lovely in reality, with an extremely comfortable King-sized bed, fine linens, and ample down pillows (although hypoallergenic foam pillows were available upon request.)  We slept like babies & awakened refreshed. The thermostatic control worked perfectly; allowing us to keep our room cool for sleeping & warm for bathing.  Plenty of storage space for our clothing and luggage without taking-up room space. We were combining work with pleasure, so the free wireless connection and spacious desk area were unexpected conveniences!

The bath was slightly larger than typical Euro-baths, with marble and modern fixtures and (surprise!) all plumbing working as expected!   No bidet, which is generally not a problem for we Americans!  Bathrobes, slippers, & toweling all very nice quality, soft & brightly white.Gilchrist & Soames vanity supplies (soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.) were replenished daily.

Full English breakfast was included in our weekend package and we opted to dine in-room. Our breakfasts were delivered on-time and were simply delicious both mornings. Highly recommend the Eggs Benedict which was scrumptious and HOT upon arrival (truly a small miracle!)  My husbands traditional eggs, bacon, potatoes & toast were eaten with gusto as well, so I presume they were luscious.   

Our second evening we dined at Butler's Restaurant in the hotel. We were a bit concerned when is wasn't very busy on a Saturday--but our concerns were quickly dashed by the excellent service and cuisine!  The Scottish & Irish Smoked Salmon Duo appetizer was a meal in itself: carved table-side with a more than ample portion--luscious!  I went traditional with a Potted Chicken Pie that was not only delicious but presented more beautifully than I would have imagined possible.  My husband had a carved ham with mustard sauce and was quite impressed. No room for dessert but we were tempted to try the complimentary dark chocolate truffles--perfect finish to our meal. Tara the hostess & sommelier recommended a lovely South African white wine that paired beautifully with our diverse main courses! 

I'll wrap up this long review by repeating our recommendation that anyone looking for a luxurious, well-priced, 4-star hotel in a very walkable, quiet area of London should look no further than The Chesterfield Mayfair.",5,2007,11,08
105,best hotel in london,"stayed at the chesterfield for 2 nights at the beginning of november. wonderful experience, the staff cant do enough for you (highly unusual in london), the rooms are immaculate, food exceptional, especially the roast of the day and the superb breakfast. the location of the hotel tops it off, just quite simply the best hotel in london. i wont even consider staying anywhere else in the capital again.",5,2007,11,08
105,Wonderful Hotel!,"The Hotel is run by the same people that run the Milestone, one of Englands top small hotels and the same professional management is evident.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable and well decorated with that ""English"" look.  I actually liked the Chesterfield better than the Milestone (we stayed there September '06)  because the Chesterfield is closer to the major attractions and the theater district.  You are about a 5-10 minute walk to the tube and there are a number of good restaurants close by.  I would definiely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again!",5,2007,10,27
105,wonderfull staff,"Excellent old style hotel!
wonderful suites! I've seen most of them and they are amazing
sdt rooms a little small (for my taste but normal for such a typical building)
Excellent restaurant! and breakfast though ;)
definitely a great place to stay If you like  english style",4,2007,10,08
105,Chesterfield Mayfair - Service like no Other,"Stayed at the CM for 7 nights, the first 3 on business.  As we booked about 20 people into the hotel plus used a conference room for 2 days we received an excellent rate, otherwise may not have been able to afford this hotel due to very poor exchange against CDN $.

Hotel selected by exec assistant in London, but was happy to see it ranked so high by Trip (which I now swear by as the definitive hotel reference site in the world - yes you heard it hear.)

The CM staff cannot absolutely do enough to make your stay the best possible.  We requested a room with two beds, and although we were upgraded to a junior suite (sweet) the bed was a double that was not split.  They had just upgraded the room and converted two small singles into a jr suite.  In a few moments staffers were in the room fixing the bed.

The room had so many amenities it's hard to list them all.  Many bottles of fresh water were made available daily, each evening a complementary hors d'oeurves were provided (smoked salmon; quail eggs), and also newspapers.  There was more.

Like all hotels in Europe, rooms on the small side, even the jr suite.  My only negative is that the rooms at the CM seem to be a bit overdecorated and a bit too much stuff crammed into them. 

The staff are incredible, and the concierge will do anything and  everything to assist.  You will do best to take their advice on local restaurents and the like.  They are the best!

I would caution you on booking rooms that face the next door courtyard, on Friday or Saturday nights as they often have functions there (it's a very classy club of some sort), and the music can go on to 11:30 at night.  We had to request a move of rooms due to this, which the hotel was able to accomodate right away.  We were lucky they were not 100% full, which they can be.

The location could not have been better, and what you could not walk to (which was not much), you could easily tube it via Green Station.  

Breakfast is highly expensive at 18-20 GBP per person, which is about $40 CDN, and quite absurd at that price.  My wife found an excellent place for breakfast two blocks away on a small side street where you could get a perfectly great eggs, back bacon, toast  and coffee for about 5 GBP. Look for Le Strada, in a side street just off Berkely Square.  There is a Starbucks right on the corner.  

I have no reservations highly recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair, it is spotlessly clean, very quite (when no parties next door are going on), and has exceptional staff.  Pictures on the website and are representative, but always make the rooms seem larger than they really are (in all cases, not just here.)",4,2007,10,08
105,Good hotel with personal service,"Stayed 5 nights at this hotel.  It is in a residential neighborhood with a few neighborhood pubs.  Within walking distance to Green Tube Station, near Berkley Sq.  Our room included a full English breakfast. Nice service in the diningroom. Food so-so. The buffet is included with limited fruit, cereal, and very few pasteries.  But, when you sit down, you are served 4 slices of toast w/jam on the side immediately. The room was small and crowded by American standards. There was a King bed with a fake heavy fur comfortor. We asked that it be removed for the week and they took it out immediately. There seems to be alot of furniture in such a small space. Tiny closet too. The bathroom was big, marble and very nice. The room and hotel are very clean! One night we asked for an extra pillow and returned to our room (with turn-down service) and each side had 4 large feather pillows! The linens are lovely.The people at the front desk where quick to greet you and we found all of them helpful.  We asked Chris to check on some reservations we made on our own before leaving the U.S.  He had no problem with our request.  Seemed happy to do it.  They were helpful with directions.  London is just very expensive right now for Americans.  We loved it and would go back if the $ ever gets stronger.  All and all this is a very comfortable hotel.  It is not a luxury hotel but felt very homey and safe there.",3,2007,10,07
105,This hotel is great!,"This hotel lived up to the expectation.... Everything about it is great, especially the service!

I strongly recommend it to everyone!",5,2007,10,07
105,Can't wait to go again,"For a romantic break without the children we booked this hotel for a lovely five days of luxury, shopping and dining and it exceeded expectation. The upgrade to a suite was highly appreciated, the room was divine. The restaurant serves lovely food (I recommend the hight tea for a wonderful afternoon), at breakfast  there is so much to choose from, it was a great way to start every day. The hotel is so very well situated for all the shops in knightsbridge and oxford street, that we walked nearly everywhere.
But the best bit of the whole experience was the wonderful staf, especially in the bar, they always had time for you and made very nice cocktails.
The next time we are in London, this is where we will be staying.",5,2007,10,03
105,Fabulous Chesterfield,"Flew to London for a party and stayed at the Chesterfield. Super to find a London hotel with such personal service.  Second to none, attention to detail, fabulous breakfast.  Loved the dog paintings in the restaurant!  Great service.  Really made our trip.  Cant wait to go back!  So nice to not be disappointed for a change!!!!!

105,Loved this hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights in September 2007.  We can not say enough about this hotel: the staff was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful, the breakfast cannot be beat, and the location is perfect.
Our weekend package was upgraded from a standard double to a superior upon our arrival.  The package included one English tea, a bottle of champagne, and full breakfast each morning.  Breakfast was unbelievablel there was a full menu from which to choose.  My favorite was the Scottish eggs Benedict (that is a muffin, poached eggs and Scottish smoked salmon).  The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Green Park tube station and about a fifteen minute walk to Piccadilly.  The hotel is lavishly decorated; we felt as if we were staying in a 19th century mansion.  Of course, there were all the amenities: sat. TV, heated bathroom floors and mirror (no fogged-up mirror!).
After traveling in Paris and Zurich, the super friendly staff and the comfortable amenities made the end of our trip a real treat.  We would not hesitate to stay at the Chesterfield upon our next visit.",5,2007,09,22
105,A great hotel,"Over the years we have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London and, from our point of view, this is the best. It's not the biggest or the flashyest but the standards of service from the staff, the general atmosphere, the location and the cleanliness are second to none. We have stayed here a few times and we're looking forward to our next visit.",5,2007,09,21
105,Expectations Exceeded 1-2 September 2007,"To be spoilt was our quest when we went to stay in London for a weekend of sightseeing, and we were not disappointed in anyway.  In fact our expectations were exceeded, from Ben and Darih in Reservations who made the process so straight forward and were so nice,  Chris our concierge, who was charming and extremely knowledgeable, sharing the old joke that  you can even get an elephant from Harrods, and he would try if I really wanted one, to Armand who searched high and low for a cocktail recipe for my friend even ringing the establishment where she had last drank it.  The receptionist was also lovely, unfortunately I did not get her name, but she remembered ours when we returned from our sightseeing and were so tired.  So many hotels talk the talk but very few walk the walk, The Chesterfield walks to walk.  Thank you to all at The Chesterfield  for making our stay so special, from being able to request feather pillows and duvets to lovely club sandwiches from room service.  It was like staying in a lovely country home with old friends as hosts.  Will definitely stay there again.

105,Excellent stay at the Chesterfield,"We chose this hotel, for a two night stay, based on other Trip Advisor reviews and were very pleased we did.
The location is central in itself but is less than 10 mins from the Underground, with major tourist sites then only minutes away.
The hotel was very welcoming and the room, was good with plenty of space for clothes and luggage although a large desk and TV cabinet meant space for easy chairs was restricted.
The en-suite was nice but the design meant water was too easily distributed in the rest of the bathroom, when using the shower. The criticisms however, are very minor compared to the experience as a whole.
We ate in the hotel's restaurant the first evening. This was expensive but very good and came with a complimentary glass of champagne after we had been asked on arrival, at the hotel, if we were celebrating anything and we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We ate early before going to a show and although the staff were excellent and aware of our tight schedule, they took so long to serve the food that we almost missed our show, despite the fact we were their only customers!  On any other night though, the experience would have been appreciated!
The room came with a complimentary english breakfast at the weekend, very expensive otherwise, although you could eat plenty and it was of good quality. A complimentary newspaper was also provided each morning, which was appreciated!
Overall the the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the hotel is quiet and in a good location, a recommended stay!

",5,2007,09,03
105,Not bad,"Wife and I stayed here 8/20/07 - 8/25/07.  Very centrally located.  Closest tube station is Green Park which is less than 5 minute walk.  Tube was our primary mode of transportation - would have liked it to be closer, but it's not bad.  Green Park is on multiple lines so it's convenient.  There's a Sainsbury market along the way which allowed us to pick up food/ supplies.  Service was very friendly and appeared to be very responsive even though we didn't take much advantage of it.  Initially received a room towards front of hotel but there was noise from construction in nearby buildings.  Got moved to a quieter room which was towards back of hotel.  Having been used to American/ Asian standards, my biggest complaint is that the room is on the small side as is the bathroom, but kept clean.  Did not get a chance to try the on-site restaurant nor did we take advantage of any on-site amenities. (Not really sure what amenities there were.)  Room could have used a mini-fridge.  For the price, it should also include internet access.
",3,2007,08,31
105,Fabulous Hotel,"My wife and I just returned from a 7 night stay in London. We chose the Chesterfield based on online searches and the clincher was the high rating on Tripadvisor. We were NOT disappointed!!!

The hotel is located just off Berkeley Square in the Mayfair district. This is one of the best features of the hotel since if you like walking, you can get to almost all the major attractions on foot. There is also a tube station (Green Park) just a short walk away.

The hotel staff are extremely eager to please. We booked a promotion which included full english breakfasts every day as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne and one classic engish tea.

The breakfasts were excellent as was the service. The tea was fun too although they serve so much food you can't possibly finish!

The rooms are exactly as they appear on the website as are the common areas of the hotel. Unlike other hotels, their website is not edited to look better than the real thing.

Our room on the 7th floor was not huge, but was very comfortable(see the picture below). The small feature such as the turn down service and bottle waters, etc. show a level of service that matches the price of the room. The hotel is not cheap, but was well worth the price charged.

I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family and would definitely return.

",5,2007,08,30
105,Lov-er-ly!,"This is a ""boutique"" type hotel that my husband and I booked quite randomly. It was an unexpected delightful surprise. If you like everything about beautiful hotels except their assembly-line size than this place is for you. It's just the right size for more personal service and the location is unbelieveable. It's a nice walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace and Mayfair is the Beverly Hills of London. Full English breakfast was included in our room rate and it was excellent. There are high end shops on Bond Street (a couple of blocks away) and cute small cafes all around.  Bus and tube stops are a few blocks away. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly!

",5,2007,08,24
105,Fantastic!! Stay here!!,"We stayed here for our 1st wedding anniversary for a romantic weekend away. I had completed one of the preference forms before going and told them it was our anniversary as it asks you on the form. As soon as we checked in we were wished a ""Happy Anniversary""  and were told that we had been given a free upgrade to The Music Suite. The room was small but fantastic with a huge four poster bed and the most amazaing bathroom I've ever seen. The bath was a stand alone one that could have fitted 4 people in it! 
Because we were in a suite we got canapes delivered to our room early evening and chocolates left on the bed at night which was a lovely touch.
The staff couldnt do enough for you and took an interest in you. Breakfast was fab. There is nothing bad I can write because the hotel was ace!!

105,Chesterfield Mayfair - Best hotel in London,"My teenage daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights in July.  This is an excellent hotel in a classy, lovely residential neighborhood (Mayfair), convenient to everything. The rooms are generous and the bathrooms are beautifully appointed and spotless.  The hotel staff are just fantastic - very helpful and pleasant in every respect. I was very wary of London hotels, having read many with bad reviews on hotels.com.  I chose this hotel because it had uniformly good reviews on tripadvisor.com.  I booked my stay on hotels.com and got an excellent price (for London!), including a ""full English breakfast"" every day (in the room or in the restaurant).  Overall this was an exceptionally good value in every way.  Next time I go to London, I am staying here - no need to look any further!

",5,2007,08,13
105,"Superb Value, Fine Location","Stayed for 6 days in this small, elegant hotel on a quiet Mayfair side street.  Superb, personal service; impeccable room maintenance, easy walk to dozens of restaurants, pubs, delis, tube, and central London landmarks.  Rooms are compact.

",5,2007,08,12
105,Unique experience,"In July this year I stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine. We were looking for a good hotel and got the name of the Chesterfield from a travel agent brochure. We checked out the hotel's reputation on tripadvisor before booking. 
I must say the hotel has a lot to offer: next to its excellent and quiet location, the staff is extremely friendly and very service-oriented; rooms, restaurant and lobby are very well maintained and very clean. Breakfast is superb. We didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel though.
A bit on the downside was the size of the room we stayed in as well as its wallpaper: the deep blue vertical lines all over the room felt very unrelaxing to say the least. Still, this is a detail and probably related to personal taste.
As the price / quality mix is quite right, and the hotel is very well located, I'd definitely advise it to other travellers, especially to Business travellers.

",5,2007,08,10
105,Unbelievable Service at the Chesterfield Mayfair,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  We were there for three nights, business related but Sat. and Sun. we toured London.  The Chesterfield was recommended to us by our travel person at work, a colleague, and tripadvisor.com reviews.  Many of the trip advisor reviews note the high levels of service at the Chesterfield, but you cannot imagine it until you experience it.  

I would like to highlight the staff, we arrived at 7:30am on a Saturday, and we were treated extremely well, given our king room, Flavio helped us with our bags, Anthony the concierge was excellent, and the restaurant staff were exceptional.  The breakfast crew, Fe, Carolina, and the other ladies whose names I cannot recall, were wonderful.  The food was excellent.  The dinner staff was similarily exceptional, Tara, the sommelier, the host (can't remember his name), Aldo the meat carver, and all of the wait staff were amazing.  The food was delicious.  We ate breakfast every day and dinner every night in the restaurant because of the service and the food, we did not care to try any other restaurants in London.  

The location was excellent for touring, many spots are within a short 5 minute walk such as Green Park/tube station, the Big Bus stop at the Ritz, Picadilly Circus, Hyde Park, Regent Street shopping, and it's only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel through Green Park to Buckingham Palace.

If I could offer any constructive feedback, the shower was not so good, the shower heads are too diffusive, my wife opted for baths as she is short and could not enjoy the shower, and the water goes everywhere in the absence of a complete enclosure or shower curtain.  A minor issue when compared to the exceptional level of service.   

We'd stay there again and recommend it to all of our friends.

",5,2007,08,10
105,"Great location, helpful staff, wonderful food...","My wife and I stayed for just one night - next time it will be longer! Rooms are tastefully decorated and furnished, the staff are extremely helpful and courteous, the food is excellent - all in all excellent value for money and a special experience! The location of the hotel could not be better for visiting London and i have no hesitation in recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair.

",5,2007,08,06
105,A class above,"In an age where it is all too easy for Hotels to take your money and not offer much in return it was a breath of fresh air to walk into the Chesterfield and be greeted with the friendliest staff I have come across in my travels so far.

Both my wife and I had a truly wonderful time where staff were at our every beck and call and no task or request was too small. I particularly enjoyed sitting in The Terrace enjoying fine whiskies whilst my wife caught up with old girlfriends.

As  a seasoned traveller I believe the ambiance of a Hotel can be sensed upon immediate arrival and in the case of the Chesterfield all i could sense was warmth.

This is a truly outstanding Hotel where if you require a little love and tenderness, as opposed to a fake smile and a hand requesting your credit card, I fully recommend the Chesterfield.

If only Sydney would take a leaf out of their book.

Thank you once again.

",5,2007,07,31
105,Service with a smile,"The service during our stay was impeccable. Not only helpful but genuinely friendly. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!!, A nice quiet street yet close to everything. Would definately stay there again.

",5,2007,07,30
105,Unbelievable,"This hotel is by far and away the best hotel we have stayed at. We have travelled around the world to most major countries and we were blown away by the quality of Chesterfield. The service and friendly staff made the stay something we will rememeber for ever.

105,Great Hotel,"From some Aussie travellers. Had a great stay - staff have tremenduous value of customer relations. Nothing was any trouble.  Restaurant and food fabulous. Could be considered expensive by what we are used to in Australia but what the heck treat yourself to being pampered. Rooms not overly large by our standard but nothing out of place, rooms practical and well appointed. Room service terrific - no sooner off the phone and there was a knock at the door. Well positioned and quiet. Thank you to our NZ friend Cameron who took our bags on the first day - a very pleasant and excellently presented young man. All the staff made it a great experience. My wife and I will certainly stay here again. Thank you.

",5,2007,07,30
105,Tiny rooms.,"The service at the hotel was excellent but the rooms were so small that you couldn't walk around without tripping over yourself.  Only one person at a time could squeeze into the bathroom.  Great location.  The concierge was fantastic.

",2,2007,07,18
105,Much better than corporate hotels,"I have stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair a couple of times whilst on
business in London. Whenever I have stayed, the service has been excellent. The last time I stayed on my own, I was greeted at reception and asked if I would like a complimentary drink in the bar - how could I refuse! All the staff are extremely friendly and polite, room service is quick and food still hot when delivered. The room I had last time was quite small - but was spotlessly clean and had everything I needed. Staying at the Chesterfield is a much more pleasant experience than staying in a larger 'corporate' hotel.

",4,2007,07,04
105,I'll Be Back Again!,"I love this hotel.  It’s above my budget, but in a year’s time I hope to be back for another short stay.  I felt so pampered while I stayed there.

The management and staff are bursting with pride in their facility, and it shows.  The place is immaculate.  Everything that can be polished, has a high sheen.  The rooms have everything that a hotel guest can be anticipated to need.  In my room, everything worked well, from plumbing to air conditioning to lights.  (I can’t tell you the number of times I have stayed in a hotel and found light bulbs out, or balky A/C.)  When I had a bit of trouble with the in-room safe, I called for assistance, the engineer came within 5 minutes, and in another minute the safe was working.  The guest toiletries were worthy of a spa and were renewed daily.  The bed had the perfect balance of cushiness and firm support.  The restaurant employs highly competent cooks who turn out perfect meals, and wait staff who ensure you are happy with your meal.  There is Internet connectivity in the guest rooms.  For those traveling without laptops, the hotel has a high-speed Ibahn Internet portal.  If you don't use all the Internet minutes on the Ibahn card, you can expend the remaining minutes in the next 12 months.  I expended mine at an airport hotel later in my journey.

I found the staff had a highly-developed service ethic.  Any help I needed, I only had to ask.  I was astonished to be able to have my room by 9:30 AM, although I had assured them I didn’t expect a room to be available at such an early hour.  (My good luck.  No one should expect that.)  Even before my arrival, the concierges had patiently corresponded with me by email to find a “good” seat at a West End play, and they endured my fickleness with absolute courtesy.  (“No, that seat is behind a pillar.  No, that one is near the end of the row and has a poor view.  No, I want the Royal Circle.”)  In the end they booked me a great seat.  They booked my pick-up and transport from the airport.  To my surprise, they didn’t send me a Black Cab, but a chauffeured Mercedes, for only a few pounds more.  After clearing immigration and baggage claim, I presented to the arrivals area.  Although I was a half hour late, the driver was waiting for me, holding up a sign-board with my name on it.  What a welcome sight for an exhausted traveler at 5:30 AM.  That same excellent driver was available later to take me to my play and whisk me back to the hotel afterward.  The concierges helped me to locate specific stores on a street map and gave me clear directions that made it easy to accomplish my shopping.  Each time I returned, shopping bags in hand, they asked me if I had found everything.  At all times during my stay, I was treated like a VIP.

As a lone female traveler, I felt extremely safe at this hotel in the lovely Mayfair district. It is only a 5-minute walk from Green Park tube station, convenient to any number of Central London shopping areas, and within walking distance of some theatres.

In summary, yes, the prices in Mayfair are high, but you’ll receive value and service for your money at this hotel.  In the past, at other hotels, I have paid more and received far less. If you are a female traveler coming alone to London and want to treat yourself, do shopping and take in a play, I highly recommend you book at the Chesterfield Mayfair.

105,Loved the Chesterfield,"Great hotel in a great location.  We spent a week here in January and couldn't have asked for a better location and hotel.  We paid a little over $200 a night and included breakfast.  The location was convient to everything and the staff was very accomidating to us being our first time to London.  If we go back to London we would definately stay there again.

105,Yet another wonderful stay - home from home,"We have been visiting London 4 or 5 times a year on business and pleasure for about twenty years. Around ten years ago we discovered the Chesterfield - there was such a warm and personal welcome. Compared to other London hotels where life is anonymous and the service sometimes 'not so good' the Chestefield was a haven. Its location is so convenient for both business and leisure, its restaurant must be one of the best in London.
Despite being gold card Hilton members we always choose to stay at the Chesterfield when in London. It has become our home from home and the odd thing to do would be to go anywhere else. Sadly we do not visit as much now as we are retired but we would not think of going anywhere else. Our recent visit took in the Chelsea Flower Show and the Sound of Music and with the help of the Chesterfield our short visit to London was just magic. VM & PM MBE Edinburgh UK

105,Perfect in Every Way,"I was traveling alone and wanted a safe and comfortable hotel.  Being familiar with the Mayfair area, I found the Chesterfield and will return there whenever in London.
The hotel is small and lovely, the dining room and bar area are inviting and the staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  You will love your room and bathroom!  I had coffee in my room each morning and it arrived within minutes.
The ladies room on the lower level is worth a trip :-) !!
About a block away is Half Moon Street and Shepherd's Market.  This is a quaint area, little shops, cafe's and popular with the locals.
You can walk to Buckingham Palace, through Green Park, in about 15 minutes.  You can hop the #14 bus and be at Harrod's or The V&A in 10 minutes.  It's a perfect location.  Go and enjoy!

105,Great hotel in a FANTASTIC location!!,"We chose the Chesterfield Mayfair for our first trip to London based on trip advisor reviews.  We liked the location because the hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the Green Street tube stop.  There isn’t too much around the hotel but if you walk a few blocks you’ll run into tons of  things.  We walked very easily to Piccadilly Circus everyday.  So the location was fabulous.  We had access but none of the fuss!  Our room was very nice as well. It was very, very clean.  Housekeeping does a great job.  I liked the bathrooms too.  Both were just the right size for my husband and I.  The staff were very nice as well.  They fall over themselves trying to help you.  It rained out while we were there and they were always ready with an umbrella or a taxi.  We didn’t eat in the restaurant; it seemed expensive.  We had a few drinks and a dessert in the bar and it converted to almost $50 US.   There are two pubs a block away that were fantastic – Red Lion and the Punch Bowl.  The hotel was lovely; we’d return, if only for the location.  One plus – we left (by accident) some money out on the dresser.  It was there when we returned.  I’d highly recommend this hotel!

",5,2007,06,12
105,A bit disappointed,"I chose this hotel for my parents, my husband and myself as it was number 1 on the TripAdvisor website, and we were coming to stay in London for the first time. Certainly the helpfulness of the staff more than lived up to expectations. They were courteous and attentive.  The bedrooms were quiet and well equipped, but in our bedroom the TV didn't work, and they were unable to repair it.
The real disappointment was the meal in the restaurant. It was expensive even by London standards, and we were brought our main courses which went cold while we were waiting for the vegetables. I would advise that if you use this hotel you go out to eat.

105,Great Mayfair Hotel,"We stayed 6 days in June. This is a wonderful Mayfair hotel. Check in
was efficient. We accepted an upgrade for a reasonable price(remember
reasonable in London is expensive). The staff were gracious and welcoming. The room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping was spotless. One special  comment is that the piano player in the bar
was outstanding. Ask him to play Cole Porter and Duke Ellington. You can trust all the great reviews. The photographs are accurate. We would definitely return.

",5,2007,06,09
105,Where 'Have a Nice Day' really means 'Have a Nice Day',"Okay, this is not a cheap hotel but never have I been made to feel so welcome by the staff at any hotel. Reception, Door, Housekeeping and Breakfast people were just so genuinely friendly and welcoming. Great location, terrific breakfast selection and a mean Mochito in the terrace bar though this bar is for winding down, not catching the London buzz.  

Will be back when next in Town.

105,Excellent value in the heart of London,"Just left the Chesterfield after 2 wonderful nights. What makes this hotel stand out in London is the staff. Nothing is too much bother and if they say they will do something, it gets done. An obvious comment you may think, but this just doesn't happen in lots of London hotels. Rooms are small but deliciously furnished and the hotel as a whole feels intimate and welcoming. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone if they wish to stay in central London

105,Great Hotel,"Remembered from previous visit and greated by name by reception staff.  Quick and efficient regristration.  Very comfortable and well equipped room.  Very good restaurant and bar.  All staff very friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble.  Location - walking distance to Oxford Street and Green Park - is excellent.

105,Great service and lovely hotel,"My partner and I were having a night out in London and decided to book into a nice hotel for the night (even though we live in London).  Booked a room at the Chesterfield via their website which seemed to give the best prices.  Booked a Superior room as there was not much difference between that and a standard room.  At the weekend full english breakfast was included.

The Chesterfield is in Mayfair on a lovely quiet street - yet moments away from Bond Street, Park Lane etc.  As soon as you arrive the service is great.  Doorman opens the door and you are greeted by the freindly reception and concierge staff.  Special thanks to one of the recpetionists Cindy who was charming.  We were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite and checked in and were taken up to our suite.  It was fantastic  a separate living room with TV and then a large bedroom and huge bathroom.  The Chesterfield is a traditional english hotel in that the furniture is mainly antique but it has been decorated in a very stylish way.  We had a call shortly afterwards to check the room was OK and we had everything we needed.  We ordered afternoon tea in the lounge of our suite and felt thoroughly spoilt!

Returning back to the hotel at night it is in a safe area and it was very quiet so a good night's sleep.  Breakfast was served in the restuarant with an a'la carte english breakfast to order form as well as a buffet continental breakfast.

Overall a lovely experience in a grand old hotel in Mayfair and we had only paid just over £150 for this so well worth it.  Definitely a good hotel.  Upgrading to a Superior room would seem well worth it.

105,Exceptional Service,"My boyfriend and I stayed just for just one night and I can’t say enough just how exceptional the service was.  The décor of our room was quite old fashioned and not very big for a superior king room but it had everything you could possibly need; air conditioning, iron, ironing board, tea/coffee tray (with cafetiere), fluffy bathrobes and slippers, hairdryer, plenty of mirrors and plug sockets, even a stationery kit!

The queen sized bed was lovely and comfortable.  So much so that I slept like a baby and missed breakfast which is a shame as the reviews on here suggest it was worth having!  All in all, a great hotel and very friendly efficient staff.

",5,2007,05,15
105,A more nuanced view,"While unqestionably the hotel has many endearing qualities as enumerated in most other reviews, the guest rooms are most certainly not among them. We had booked a junior suite for 4 nights in late April on the basis of it accommodating a third person, but after 10 minutes in the room decided to splurge and upgrade to an executive suite. The latter had two rooms with a pull-out sofa bed in the larger, almost living room in size anteroom that led to the separate bedroom. But back to the junior suite. While it had a super-size king bed, about two feet from the foot of the bed was a rectangular or oblong structure,  close to 4 feet in height and about the same length, that's sole purpose was to contain a pop-up television set. Not only was it an obstacle but it had the effect of sub-dividing an already smallish room. Why the TV was not placed on the glass-topped table a couple of feet behind it  was a mystery to me. Moreover the two matching high-backed armchairs to the side of the table could have been right out of a 1930's stage set.  Badly in need of recovering and most uncomfortable to sit in, they should have been consigned to a garage sale a long time ago. Really, the room had a distinct tired look to it, and judging by its size I would have to assume the regular rooms must be, say, quite compact. On a more positive note, the staff was unfailingly attentive and friendly and the hotel's location, near Berkeley Square, couldn't be better. While the dinner we had one evening in the hotel restaurant, Butler's, was excellent, the breakfast buffet was nothing special (e.g. little variety of fresh fruit). As to whether I'd return, it's tough to say. If I did, it would more likely be for dinner in the restaurant preceded by a cocktail in the quintessentially English bar, a delight in itself.

105,Loved the Chesterfield,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Chesterfield Mayfair for 5 nights in May 2007.  As our room wasn't quite ready on arrival we were invited into the Club bar  for complimentory drinks. It was here we had the great pleasure of meeting Loris Lucchini (the Hotel Restaurant Manager). Loris was typical of the experiences we had with all the staff at the Chesterfield, he was a most charming wonderfully talkative gentleman. Loris's  enthusiasm to enquire about our trip and ourselves turned us into dedicated repeat customers on the spot. Rarely in todays hustle and bustle does one come upon such genuinely delightful experiences.
Our room was all we expected of it, it was a good size and beautifully furnished and decorated. This Hotel is more like an old world gentlemans/gentleladies club, it has plush leather sofas everywhere and the Club Bar is furnished much as you would expect from such a luxury boutique Hotel. But the Chesterfield Mayfair experience is most definately about the wonderful staff, from the check-in to the room service  to the bar staff and to the door men I can honestly say that they each not only met my expectations but each and every encounter I had with the staff left myself and my wife smiling and delighted, well done to them all.
As far as the location of the hotel goes, it is perfectly situated, walking distance to Trafalga Square or Buckingham Palace or Houses of Parliament or many other tourist attractions. A hundred metres (or yards in England) down the road is the quaint very typically English pub The Running footman, I dont know where they got their chef from but on the two occassions we ate at the pub, the chefs creations must have been guided by an angel. The meals were both exquisite masterpieces and I'd consider returning to London just to eat there again. If you only get to do one thing while in London, make sure you eat at the Running footman (assuming the chef is not lured away to another restaurant in the meantime).
For a typical and cheap English breakfast you can't go past Katies. Katies is just around the corner and a couple of hundred metre's away. For an expensive cocktail there is the Ritz Hotel , also just a couple of hundred metre's away.
After my wonderful experiences in London I am most definately a lifelong Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel guest and I would recommend the Hotel to anyone who values not only luxury at a sensible price but more so  being treated genuinely as a valued customer. Well done to everyone at the Chesterfield, and a special thanks to Loris.

105,"Great location, great staff, great hotel","It’s the 3rd time we have stayed at the hotel and each time it seems to get better and better. The staff are fantastic and the location has to be one of the best in London. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have everything you could ever wish for.

We ate in the restaurant on one evening the food was outstanding, I had the Dover Sole and my wife had the rib of beef from the beautiful silver trolley. Breakfast each day was out of this world, even the pastries are warm! The bar is also great and somewhere you can relax and soak up the atmosphere.

A little tip is book on the hotels website as it seems to be £1 cheaper than other sites and from time to time they have special offers, such as a bottle of wine as an added extra.

105,"Great place to stay in London. Trip advisor member, Bangor, Co. Down","This was our second visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair and, as on the previous occasion, everything was excellent from the moment we arrived until our departure 3 days later. The standard of service is top class and it appears nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Everybody is friendly and polite and more than willing to help. Our superior king room was very comfortable although not really all that large, and the bathroom is rather on the small side but well supplied and used towels were changed twice daily.
The food is of a high standard and afternoon tea was beautiful, well presented and delicious. Highly recommended.
Breakfast is excellent and freshly cooked and hot. Scrambled eggs and smoked salmon very tasty although the scrambled eggs were not as nice this time as previously.
One morning at breakfast a mouse scuttled from under the curtain and ran across the carpet. My wife reported it to the restaurant manager who was most concerned and he said he would report it right away ( which he did ) so that the rodent experts could be brought in to investigate. 
We will be back again and look forward to our next visit and I am sure we will enjoy it as much as we have done in the past.

105,Good value for money considering the location and facilities.,"Upon entering this hotel my heart sank, as the reception was very dark and decorated in what could only be described as old fasioned  english pub style. I feared for the state of the rooms. However thankfully, check in was polite and friendly, which helped relax me somewhat. Our room was small but well laid out, the bathroom was even smaller, so small i marvelled it as a small feat in engineering, that they had managed to fit a bath, toilet and washbasin in it. Thankfully aside from the horrible swirly carpet, the room fittings were tasteful and the bathroom bright and nicely appointed. We slept well which must say something for the quality of the bed and in the morning we enjoyed a mouthwatering breakfast in the restaurant. All in all, considering the price we paid and location, i feel this hotel offered excellent value for money.

",4,2007,05,07
105,Just an okay stay,"Booked the Chesterfield after reading the many glowing comments on Tripadvisor.  It is a well-kept small British hotel in an upscale area.  My king bed room was well-appointed and bathroom amenities were of good quality. Most of the staff was cordial and helpful.

However, here are the negatives I experienced during my stay:
- The front desk was willing to cash my traveler's checks with a  very high fee, but could/would not, on 3 separate occasions, break a 20 pound note.
- The Tea Tray in the room was a wonderful surprise but when I took the lid off the teapot to fill with water I was met with a horrendously foul odor.  It obviously had not been cleaned in some time.
- My room was located on the 2nd floor and a noise which sounded like a banging door permeated the walls/windows.  Thank goodness I had earplugs.
- Bathroom is very tiny but workable. Shower did not have a curtain but rather a partial glass panel that no matter how careful I was, there was always a pool of water around the tub. 

Don't know if I would ever return to to Chesterfield.

105,Wonderful stay,"To celebrate my 60th birthday decided to stay at the Chesterfield again.   Not disappointed at all.   Just as memorable as our stay last October.  Our room, although small, was absolutely spotless and elegantly decorated.  The bar was equally impressive but rather expensive (this is Mayfair though!) Staff extremely courteous and helpful from arrival through to the point of leaving.  Hotel is well located for theatres, shopping in Oxford Street and Bond Street nearby and within easy walking distance of Hyde Park.  Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in London - good position, friendly staff and a wonderful experience overall.

",5,2007,05,01
105,Great experience,"Stayed here for the St Patrick's weekend and we really loved it. Booked the room via the Chesterfield Mayfair website and received a complimentary bottle of champagne, English breakfast every morning, afternoon cream tea and a 6pm check out for the same price that hotels.com offered the stay not including any extras. Papers and magazines are provided in the room. All the staff is very attentive and professional. The location is second to none. It is located a couple of blocks from the Green Park tube station. A quiet area, but close to both Leicester square and also close enough to Buckingham Palace and the West End. Great value for money!

",5,2007,03,25
105,Wonderful,"I have stayed twice and several friends have also stayed there.  All agree that it's excellent.  Annual (at least) travellers to London, we have all tried various hotels around the city and this is the best so far.  Room size is decent and efficiently used although small by US standards (it often isn't in London especially compared to average US hotel room).  Staff all speak very good English, even maids etc. (in some hotels in London only a couple of staff seem to be able to do more than say hello).  Great neighbourhood - short walk to Picadilly, Regent Street and theatres.  Covent Garden and Seven Dials also walkable (but you can always get a cab within a minute or two at most and the tube is close).  Staff very helpful.  Very nice formal Chinese food in modern setting across the street.  After a series of London hotel disappointments spanning years, this was a delight and the second time was as nice as the first.  Have three friends who have also stayed there and all agree.  Too bad the pound is so high against the dollar or I'd go more often (have to wait for the company to send me again next year).

",5,2007,03,22
105,Great hotel,"Stayed here for St. Patrick's weekend.

The room was not massive but what it lacked in size, it made up for in everything else. 

The location is top notch. I have never been as impressed with the local cars. If you fancy spotting Rolls Royce, Porsches and Ferraris then this is the area.

Every morning, a newspaper was left hanging on the door. On the newspaper was a little sticker wishing a pleasant stay and details of the weather forecast.

In the evening there was a turndown service with a nice bit of fudge and the tv was pulled out on its stand and angled towards the bed.

The bathroom was nice with robes and underfloor heating, good cosmetics (speaking as a man), bath, shower and hose.

I couldn't recommend the place more. Breakfast is £19.50 and an Irish whiskey to celebrate St. Patrick's day was £8 so be aware that it is not cheap but there were better deals on the hotel's website than on hotels.com",5,2007,03,20
105,Charming Chesterfield,"This is a charming hotel set in the heart of Mayfair in a quiet road leading onto Berkeley Square yet only 7 minutes walk from Green Park Underground Station which is perfectly situated on the Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee Lines.
For Theatreland, the two next eastbound stops on the Piccadilly Line are Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, although you can walk to Piccadilly Circus in 15 minutes. One stop westbound is Hyde Park, or a pleasant 5 minute stroll across Green Park takes you to Buckingham Palace, or a 10 minute walk north from the hotel takes you to Oxford Street, so it is very well placed with also a plentiful supply of black cabs using Charles Street as a through route. Not only that one stop south on the Jubilee Line is Westminster for Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye. Did I mention it was well placed?
Previous reviews are all correct about the friendly and attentive staff; these people are very well selected and very well trained, they are a credit to the organisation. The hotel is very well maintained and is large enough to have a good restaurant and bar yet small enough to be friendly and intimate.
We stayed for 3 nights in a Junior Suite which amounts to a large (by London standards) very well appointed luxury room with plenty of space. Our specific room was Number 427, the Chesterfield Suite overlooking Charles Street, and I have uploaded some photos of it. The television is operated by a remote control scissor lift and rises from a cabinet at the foot of the bed; the room looks much larger when the television disappears. The bathroom is compact with a small Jacuzzi bath tub and shower, a small elegant flat screen television and also a separate walk-in shower.
I booked the room directly with the hotel just 48 hours before the weekend and was very pleased with the rate quoted which I thought was reasonable and included Champagne in the room and an afternoon cream tea in the very smart restaurant. This approach means you have to take pot-luck with availability but, on this occasion, it worked out very well for us and we enjoyed every minute of our long weekend. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the Chesterfield Mayfair and will stay there again if I can using my high risk late booking strategy.

105,The Chesterfield was just right!,"I stayed at the Chesterfield for 7 nights just last week.  My double room was perfect for me - not gargantuan, but I didn't expect that.  But superb bed, comfortable chair and table, pristine, elegant bathroom and storage galore!  As hard as I tried, I couldn't fill up all the closets and drawers!  :)   Quiet is very important to me - nothing annoys me more than voices, TV, music through the walls - and I might have been alone on my floor (but was not!).

Make sure you get a rate with breakfast included - it's a deal - was my main meal of the day and couldn't have been more delicious or the service more impeccable.  I was greeted by name in the morning after the first day or so.  You order anything cooked you want off the menu, as well as help yourself to beautiful buffet with anything you could want as far as fruit, cereal, juice, pastries, cheeses and meats, etc.  The best Eggs Benedict I have ever had and I've had 'em everywhere!

I had room service every evening after my long (great) days of sightseeing and it always (7 nights out of 7) arrived before they said it would, and was graciously served and just right.

Had a martini each late afternoon in the fabulous bar - comfortable seating, great munchies and people watching supreme - you get the feeling that this is one of the most popular gathering spots in Mayfair for local business people - oozes class, but very warm.

I could go on and on.  Reception and door staff friendly, kind and helpful.  You can't pass an employee in a hallway without a courteous hello.

You simply cannot go wrong.  Only place I'll ever stay.

",5,2007,03,06
105,Charming and totally satisfying,"I have just returned from a business trip to London, having stayed at the Chesterfield.  My company had a preferred rate at the hotel, and after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to try it.  My experience was completely positive, and I know I will be back.  My room was on the small side, but beautifully decorated and had a very functional desk with high speed internet access for using the computer.  There was no small table or reading chair, so if using the computer is not a priority, I would ask for a room with different furnishings.  In contrast, the bathroom was surprisingly large, with tub/shower, and nice vanity space around the sink.  The hotel is a converted townhouse on a quiet street, so there are no views to speak of.  This is more than made up for by the intimate atmosphere of being a guest in a large private home, and the hotel's proximity to Berkeley Square, and Piccadilly.  The staff were all very friendly, and helpful.  I tried the Butler restaurant with my colleague from work, and we had a wonderful meal.  Both of us took the menu of the day as we were heading off to theatre and only had about an hour to squeeze in dinner.  The staff was very helpful in making sure we got all the courses in time, and my only regret was the food and accompanying glass of wine were so good that I would have wanted to linger and enjoy longer.  Green Park tube stop is the closest tube stop, offering 3 tube lines to get you anywhere you need to go.  It is a healthy 5-6 minute walk though, but there are plenty of taxis to be had in Berkeley Square just down the street from the hotel.  There are plenty of people out  in the area until at least midnight, and I felt safe as a single female walking back from the tube from evening dinners/shows.

",5,2007,03,04
105,Excellent little Mayfair hotel!,"We visit London a couple of times a year and this is the first time we have stayed at the Chesterfield. It is in Mayfair in a quiet street away from the tourist crowds but very close to Hyde Park , Green Park tube station and the West End for the shops. Slightly farther away from theatreland, but not inconveniently so. There are a number of small restaurants and pubs around locally at various price points so plenty of choice. Also there are a variety of local shops in the area so everything is very convenient.

Having stayed in many mid market London hotels, we were very impressed. Our superior room was slightly small but packed full of all you could possibly need for a weekend in London. It was immaculately clean and in very good order. Staff are extremely friendly and courteous - almost scarily so at times, but that's a fault we could put up with! The bar area is welcoming but somewhat smoky although our laws will sort that out in July when there will be no more workplace smoking....and there was one or two entertaining incidents with guests and their lady guests to people watch! It was quite a soap opera with various non resident ""friends"" arriving to join a group of men much to the consternation of the Chesterfield's staff! The rest I will leave to your imagination - but I have to say they handled it all very well!

Breakfast is very good - I have had better but not in London! Freshly cooked hot food not left buffet style on hot plates, and an excellent cold buffet set us up well for our days of fun!

So what more to add - would we go back , yes definitely and there is no question for what we paid ( £180 ish a night at the weekend)  this was excellent value for money for this part of London. We stay in Radisson Edwardian group hotels usually ( eg Mountbatten, Hampshire etc) and whilst this is of similar style and approach it definitely pips them at the post!

",5,2007,02,27
105,Great hotel,"What a nice hotel! Compared to some other hotels in London, which are as expensive (Thistle hotels for example), the Chesterfield has real class. 

The decor is really special.
Rooms are lovely (although quite small), and the staff is wonderful (they are all well trained and focused on customer satisfaction).

The only small thing which is wrong is that they charge £4.50 for each little bottle of water (33cl) they put in the room, and you don't know anything about it  until you pay your bill. Can be a nasty shock if you stay for a few days!

I strongly recommend their afternoon tea, their scones are fantastic!

Bar and restaurant are expensive: £9 for a G&T, and £12.50 for a glass of champagne... but what else can you expect in Mayfair ?

Overall an excellent hotel. Will definitely go back for my next stay in London.

105,Superb Hotel... sheer luxury,"My husband & I stayed at the Chesterfield in November for his 30th & I can honestly say it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in ever! The room, although on the small side was superb & had a huge bathroom. We didn't have dinner at the hotel but the bar was very luxurious (as is the rest of the hotel) & breakfast the next morning was lovely. The hotel staff are very polite & proffesional & the hotel is in an ideal location for visiting the sites in London, 2mins to green park & buckingham palace & 5mins to new bond street & shopping heaven!

We will definately stay at this hotel on our next visit to London.

105,Nice stay,"We spent last weekend at the Chesterfield in celebration of our first wedding anniversary. We arrived to our room which was pleasant but perhaps not as luxurious as we would have imagined, but never the less clean and comfortable. Awaiting us was champagne on ice along with some chocolate dipped strawberries, yummy!  All the staff that we encountered were very friendly and made us feel very welcome.  We had our evening meal in the Butlers restaurant which unfortunately we were disappointed with and it was very expensive for what it was, there is also a higher than average service charge added to your bill (12%) but again all the staff were very nice warm, friendly and welcoming.   Breakfast was lovely with a buffet style continental, lots of fresh fruit, pastries etc and freshly cooked hot food to order which was delicious.  The chesterfield is in a lovely part of London, extremely quiet and close to many of the attractions.  I think it was good value for money and I would consider returning, we did have a very nice romantic weekend and came home feeling relaxed and refreshed.

105,Our 40th wedding anniversary.,"We chose this hotel from a shortlist prepared by my eldest son
(who works in London) and tripadvisor comments by previous guests, for a special break to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. We would like to thank previous reviewers in guiding us to make such a rewarding choice. We had a superior king room on the second floor in a quiet non-smoking location and we were not disappointed. We stayed four nights and the service we received was excellent throughout, there was a genuine friendliness from all the many staff we met (a credit to staff selection and training). The quality of the breakfeasts were superb, freshly prepared food, in unlimited quantity and plenty of choice. Due to other committments we only had one meal in the evening, this was also superb but somewhat expensive,although I did note that there is a 20% reduction if you have your evening meal a little earlier,( perhaps before most people would want 5.30-6.45pm). We saw The Sound of Music, an excellent show,we returned to our room to experience the hotels excellent turn-down service,we were delighted. The location for us (I am not too mobile) was again a good choice since it enabled us to walk to a number of famous attractions nearby. However we did hire a number a London cabs during our stay, many from just outside the hotel and without exception they were friendly and informative. All in all a wonderful experience throughout and a big thankyou to all concerned.",5,2007,02,06
105,Excellent Hotel,"I arranged a trip for several customers to London for a one night stay at the Chesterfield and and a visit to see Cirque Du Soleil. The reception area was very impressive and reception staff upon arrival were attentive and very efficient, having all my party booked in within 15 minutes. The evening meal was booked at the restaurant and due to our tight schedule I asked the Maitre D to ensure the service was prompt. This was no problem at all , the service was superb and although unhurried allowed us to meet our other date. The standard of  the common areas as well as the bedrooms was very good with all the usual extras you associate with a quality hotel. If i had one slight moan it would be this. Knowing that over the weekend my company would spend on rooms, food and drink in excess of £1400  I enquired as to a free room upgrade on that basis only too be asked for a further £160 per room upgrade fee. Call me tight if you like but I thought that was a little short sighted. Had that request been met I would have had no complaints whatsoever.

105,Polite Mayfair Hotel,"This hotel really does seem an incredible deal in upscale Mayfair, with the Ritz, the Connaught and Claridge's all nearby neighbors.  My partner and I checked with the hotel directly through their website, and got a great rate including an English breakfast for under $350--that with the exchange rate so terribly bad these days.  The front desk service was incredibly efficient and polite; the maid service was prompt; the turn-down service a nice touch; and the very nice inclusive breakfast was the perfect way to start a day of sight-seeing.  As a tourist visiting for four days, the Chesterfield really offered a glimpse into what a sophisticated, upscale, hospitable city London can be.  The hotel is convenient to the Green Park Underground stop, and with Shepherd's Market offering a variety of shops and cafe's nearby, and Bond Street and Oxford Street also within easy walking distance, one could spend an entire day shopping very close to your hotel.  And while you're staying at the Chesterfield, go ahead and have dinner nearby at The Square--one of the best dinners we have had anywhere. Just a great experience in this part of town, staying at the Chesterfield.  We hope to be back someday.

105,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed for one night at the hotel on a theatre break, and it was perfect.  It's immaculate, beautifully decorated in a traditional style, and the staff are friendly and attentitive.

My mother and I were in one of the standard twin rooms, which although quite small was very comfortable, and had all the standard amenities and then some.  The bathroom was also fantastic, with an excellent shower.  The breakfast was delicious, with lots of choice - continental, full English, pancakes, etc...

If you want a luxury hotel that's close to the West End and only a short walk from a tube station, you can't go wrong with this one.

105,Absolutely Lovely,"We thought this hotel was absolutely lovey, the staff were friendly, helpfull and very poilet.  We stayed in a double delux room and whilst we expected it to be small (we had been warned) it was quite adequate and furnished beautfully in traditional theme.  The bathroom was nice, clean and good hot water and presure.

The restaurant was excellent, excellent food and service.

The location of the hotel was excellent, within walking distance to major streets.

We would not hestiate to recommend this hotel or stay here again on our next visit.

105,Fantastic ..... and there is a totally smokefree real English pub close by....,"We often stay in London and while we previously enjoyed the flash decor of the Soho, Charlotte Street and Covent Garden Hotels we had been less than pleased with their pricing and in the latter two - their lack of service so on the advice of Tripadvisor contributers we decided to try Chesterfield Mayfair.   What a fantastic find.  Thankyou everybody!  The hotel is centrally located  in classy Mayfair not far from Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.  If you are a keen jogger it is in close proximity to Green and Hyde parks.  I would describe the hotel decor as English and in a style that was very welcoming.  Our room was very nice although maybe not as nice as the ones pictured on their website.  The bathroom was excellent and the all important shower worked beautifully.  The staff were attentive and friendly (special mention  to Walter the Italian waiter) and the food at breakfast and dinner was excellent.  They quietly dealt with our non-smoking request in the dining room (I have a lung problem).  There is a bar but it was far too smoky for us to enter.  Fortunately we found a wonderful real English pub (The Running Coachman) just two minutes down the road which is totally smokefree......so we dropped in for a pint or two and some classy food and wine at very reasonable prices. Overall our stay at Chesterfield Mayfair was excellent and we will be back.

105,Good Experience at the Chesterfield,"Just got back from a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield.  The room we were given on the 4th floor wasn't quite what I expected and at my request they moved us to a room on the 7th floor.  Small room but, this is London.  The staff were all very nice.  I was a bit bummed that for roughly $400.00 a night breakfast wasn't included.  We arrived on an early flight and only had to wait for about a half an hour for our room to be available.  The concierge desk was sub-par.  Very vague with directions...got us lost quite a bit and they failed to mention a virtual trove of restaurants hidden down a nearby alley...my husband found while taking a stroll so my way of thinking says they had to know about it.  Not very knowledgeable about restaurants, prices, etc.  Next time i'll do more research on my own.  All in all a wonderful time though.

105,A bit of heaven in the heart of Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a bit of heaven tucked away in the heart of busy London.  On a quiet corner, this charming hotel is well-appointed, has a friendly and helpful staff, and is a wonderful place both to stay and to dine.  The decor of the rooms is elegant and yet not flashy. We stayed twice on our visit, on our way and returning from Scotland. Both rooms were beautiful and very comfortable.  The service by all staff members was especially noteworthy.  As an example, we wanted to try to get tickets to see Billy Elliot on Saturday night but all seats were sold. Our concierge, Ian Travis, not only secured two seats but they were center front orchestra.  By the way the play is highly recommended.  We would definitely stay at the Chesterfield again and would be glad to suggest it to others.

105,The Staff Goes Above and Beyond,"The amazing staff at the Chesterfield made our stay truly wonderful.     After we booked our stay on the hotel website, they sent us a preference form for us to request what special ammenities we wanted in our room.   That alone had us excited about our visit.  They arranged for a private car to pick us up at the airport (and return us at the end of our trip) - a splurge I would recommend to everyone traveling with luggage.  We arrived at 9:00am London time, a good 3 hours before check in, intending to request that they stow our luggage.  Instead, they checked with housekeeping and had them make up a room right away for us while we waited in the bar and they brought us refreshments.  We loved our room.  Very warm and comfortable.  The bathroom was bright and very clean and had a very special feature.  A heated floor!  I want one at home now.  The room was always clean when we returned from being away, and the turn down service every night was more than just chocolates on your pillow.  They pull the TV out, turn down the bed, open the TV guide and put the remote and room service menu out for you. They made sure you had full bottles of water and clean glasses.  One night the assistant manager had left a bottle of wine for us for our anniversary.  Every detail was seen to  beyond our expectations.  We had dinner in Butlers one evening and the food was wonderful.  The restaurant manager and our server were fabulous.  We really enjoyed them and didn't want to leave.  My husband planned a special secret day for our anniversary and the concierge and assistant manager of the hotel helped him plan and execute every detail including hiring a private car to take us to Waterloo station to send us to Paris on the Eurostar and have lunch in the Eiffel Tower.  They were just as excited about it as if it was their own special day.  They were more concerend that we have a fabulous time and everything turn out perfectly then we were.  Normally we like to try new places and don't go to the same place twice, but the Chesterfield is very special.   I can't imagine coming to London and not staying here.  Thank you so much for a great vacation friends!

105,romantic weekend stay,"My wife and I booked the Chesterfield based on recommendations gleened from tripadvisor and other web sites.  We were very pleased with our stay from the moment we got off the underground stop (green park) and found ourselves in a nice area of london not far from picadilly circus, buckingham palace and other attractions.  The hotel staff was very professional, attentive and courteous.  The room, smallish by American standards, was comfortable and very clean.  The bed was turned down every night, with a piece of fudge left on the pillow, bottled water on each night stand, and the tv remote/tv guidebook neatly left on the bed .  For what we paid to stay here I expect nothing less than what we got, and we got what we expected!

Would recommend this hotel without reservation to anyone.  Its central location was helpful and we ended up walking to nearby attractions instead of spending money on taxi service.  Check out the little breakfast cafe just down the street to the right of the Mayfair (near Starbucks) its called Katies and had a very good full English breakfast for only four pounds....great way to start the morning!

105,We'll return to the Chesterfield!,"My husband and I enjoyed a four night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair in the middle of September, and we would love to return. I have stayed in many wonderful properties in London, and always prefer to stay in Mayfair whenever possible. The Chesterfield is a superlative combination of location, service, and value. When we arrived at the hotel (in the car that the concierge had arranged to pick us up from the airport--an unusual splurge for us), we were met by a very gracious staff. Our room was upgraded to a ""theme"" room, and as many other reviewers have mentioned, the theme rooms have a great deal of quirks and character. We were in ""The Library"", which is fitted out like a lovely old reading room lined with books on one wall--lots of dark paneling and appropriate accessories. While the room was a bit smaller than some London hotel rooms in which I have stayed, it had ample storage. The bathroom was wonderful (clean and spacious), and the shower was a delight! From check-in to our departure, the cleaning and turn-down service was top-notch, and indeed all of the hotel staff was always pleasant and efficient. I would echo the comments about the restaurant--wonderful food and considerate service. One evening we ordered the pre-theatre 3 course meal, and were too full to eat dessert. They actually allowed us to come back and have our dessert after we had been to the theatre, which was a very gracious touch!

Another great thing about the Chesterfield Mayfair is the location. It is just around the corner from Shepherd's Market, which is a haven of sandwich shops and restaurants that are reasonably priced by London standards. There are many places close-by to grab an inexpensive breakfast if you do not have a breakfast option with your room (from full breakfast to a continental at Caffe Nero), and there are quite a few places for snacks and refreshments. From the Chesterfield Mayfair it is a short walk to Piccadilly for the theatre or Regent's Street shopping, and just minutes to the Green Park tube. Perhaps my only complaint with the Chesterfield Mayfair was the very high cost of internet access, but I suspect that is going to be true of London hotels in general these days. All of the options for connection were terribly expensive, and priced by either 15 minute or 1-hour increments (15 minutes was 3 pounds, I believe--on their computer; 1 hour was 12.99 for broadband connection in the room). I thought that I had read about wifi being available in the lobby and public areas of the hotel, but when I asked about this, I was told that I had to pay for the security key as per above. Ultimately we were able to work through this little obstacle, and will know what to expect next time we take our laptop to London. 

In summary, we heartily recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair, and look forward to our return visit. However, I hope that enough other folks decide that they want to stay somewhere else when it is our turn to go back so that we can get a room!

105,Could Not Have Been Happier,"We stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair from September 25, 2006 through October 4, 2006.  There were four in our party, so we booked two rooms.  I have made many previous trips to London, and have stayed in B&B's,  Le Meridien, The Marriott, The Grosvenor House, and The Savoy.  After this trip, there is no question where I will stay on my next trip.  I will definitely return to The Chesterfield Mayfair.  The service was the best that I have experienced in London, the food in the restaurant (Butler's) was wonderful, and even the tea in the Chesterfield Mayfair Conservatory was super. Their scones were much, much better than the ""famous scones"" served at The Wolseley.  The only thing they could improve on would be the firm beds.  I found them a bit too firm, and would rather have a softer pillowtop mattress.  I did sleep well, so it was not a major problem.

105,A Very Comfortable Stay,"Stayed here for one night in late September and was very happy with the hotel. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived and the check-in was very efficient. We had booked a Superior King Room on the hotel website and, as we were staying on a Friday night, we were able to select a Full English Breakfast inclusive weekend deal from the options available. This cost us £139 plus taxes and was good value when one considers that we could have paid the same amount for the room without breakfast if we had chosen another option or booked through another website. The room was very comfortable, with fresh fruit, slippers, bath robes, bottled water and magazines provided and the CD player, iron and ironing board and internet connection meant we wanted for nothing. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent and the breakfast options were varied and of high quality. The location of the hotel was also great and I will certainly stay there again when next in London. I just wish we could have stayed for more than one night this time...

105,Excellent Service!,"I booked the Chesterfield Mayfair based on it's location and Trip Advisor rating. After a 3-night stay the week of September 11th, I would certainly agree it deserves an excellent rating. If you are ok with a hotel that is like a pair of ""comfortable old shoes"", you will really like the Chesterfield. I certainly did! If, however, you are looking for huge rooms with a view in a contemporary large hotel, this may not be your first choice. Personally, I liked the ""clubby"" feel of the old Chesterfield and especially it's tremendous customer service. As mentioned in a previous review, Chris truly epitomizes this wonderful customer service. During checkout, I was thinking out loud about how I forgot to bring along some bottled water. Before I finished my checkout, Chris appeared with a glass, fresh lemon, and a liter of bottled water! My favorite was Loris Lucchini, the hotel's Restaurant Manager. Not only is Loris skilled in the art of excellent food service, but he has a terrific sense of humor, a real knack for making each guest comfortable and ""at home"" in the restaurant. I would hire him immediately if I were in the hospitality industry! By the way, I dined in the Butler's Restaurant three times and agree with other reviewers that the Dover Sole is worthy of it's high rating. Regarding the hotel itself, the keys are cleanliness, customer service, and convenience (the Chesterfield is in a perfect location in fashionable Mayfair). London is, of course, currently the 5th most expensive city in the world. With this in mind, I would enthusiastically recommend the Chesterfield to my friends as an excellent hotel and a real value.

105,Superb service,"My wife and I stayed here back in June largely based in the reviews here.
I have to say the staff could not have been better. Extremely attentive without being intrusive. At check-in we were upgraded to a suite - as there was a wedding taking place and all the standard rooms has been taken   this was a good start.

Although classed as a suite it was quite small, but very nicely decorated (old Library), very clean and quiet.

The hotel has an excellent bar, which although looks fairly formal, did not mind informal dress (hot day so shorts being worn).

Breakfast the next day was included in the rate and was delicious. With a huge choice from the buffet and the English breakfast, hot and freshly cooked.

Although the rooms are not the largest, it's the staff that set the Chesterfield apart. Location is also excellent, although only two minutes walk from Picadilly it was very quiet

105,"Tiny, highly decorated expensive rooms and superb staff","Of course hotel rooms are tiny in London, but the hotel makes an effort to overcome the problem with exquisite decorations.  Still...at the start of a long trip, finding places to stow luggage for me and my husband was a bit tricky.  The best part of the hotel was the staff.  They were truly outstanding.  After a long flight from Chicago and the trip from Heathrow to Mayfair, we walked in the front door and the reception woman greeted us by name!  The location of the hotel is perfect . . . walking distance from all sorts of things yet on a quiet street.  My only negative comment, except for the size of the rooms, is the irregular turn-down service, which never seemed to happen.  The beds are great and the bathroom was first class.
",4,2006,09,23
105,Excellent hotel in quiet area,"My wife and I stayed at this excellent hotel near Berkeley Square in late August.  We found the multilingual front desk staff very friendly and helpful.  No problems with checkin and there was plenty of staff to handle the people checking in quickly.  The room condition was outstanding, very clean and neat.   The complementary bottled water was greatly appreciated.  We often stay at the Rubens, a Red Carnation hotel, and found our room at the Mayfair a bit larger than the ones we usually get at the Rubens.  The hotel is in a very nice, quite residential area only a 5 minute walk from the Green Park tube stop.  Groceries can be bought a store between the tube stop and the hotel and there are several restaurants along a pedestrian street also between the tube stop and the hotel.

105,"Great hotel, great value, great location","I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my teenage daughter for eight nights in July of this year and we used it as a base for sightseeing in the wonderful city of London.  I  have only good things to say about this place.  I will try to cover each of the bases.  

Location:  could not be better.  It is in the heart of elegant Mayfair on a quiet street that is only a 5 minute walk to the Green Park tube stop (where there are 3 central and frequent lines that converge here making it very easy to get anywhere in London).  Also, if you are a walker, you can walk to many of the great sites and shopping from here as well.  Also, the hotel is around the corner from a very convenient area called Shepard's Market, where there is always a choice of restaurants and a few shops.  It was great to have this close by.  We did not always want to be tied down to a dinner reservation, and we would walk back from the tube after a long day of sightseeing, and just pop into any one of these casual restaurants.

Atmosphere:  this is an elegant and very British hotel without being stuffy or snooty.  The decor is elegant and it has the look of a five star boutique hotel without the five star prices.  It is a small and intimate hotel -- so pleasant compared to some of the big chain hotels with their cavernous, busy lobbies.  Everything is very well appointed and comfortable.  One thing we were thrilled about is that the air conditioning always worked well (and good air conditioning -- in fact  any air conditioning -- is a rarity in London).  This was particularly important to us since the temperature was well into the 90's the whole time we were there.  The only reason I have not given this hotel the ""excellent"" rating is that our room (and in particular our bathroom) was very small.  I came to London prepared for this however -- this is par for the course in a London city hotel.  The room was very quiet and the beds were extremely comfortable.

Value:  This is an excellent value.  When I researched hotels for our trip, it seemed like everything in a comparable category was double the rate that we paid.  This place is a find in a city that is outrageously expensive for Americans at this point.  Also, since we were staying for an extended period of time, our full  breakfast  for two was included in the rate, and this was a huge savings ($72 per day to be exact).  

Service:  is very personal, friendly  and excellent across the board from the housekeeping staff (impeccable cleaning and restocking of the bathroom supplies, etc.), to the restaurant staff, the porters, the front desk, the doormen and the concierges.  Ian, the head concierge, is very knowledgeable and  was very helpful to us in planning our trip.  I found that some of the staff who worked under Ian were not as knowledgeable, though always very polite and friendly.  I had e-mailed several sightseeing questions to the concierge staff before my trip, and they were always prompt in responding.  The reception staff kindly let us check out late on our last day which was tremendously helpful to us.    One of the nicest little touches about the service at the Chesterfield is that they send you a preference sheet before you arrive with everything from the type of pillows you like to the date of your birthday.  

The Chesterfield is a wonderful and special find.  I will definitely stay here when I return to London and recommend it to anyone.

105,superb!  top notch! classy!,"I booked the Chesterfield as a treat for my dad and his fiancee for his birthday.
They were overwhelmed with the hotel.  I was a bit worried about the location and hotel as I had booked it but they said that I couldnt have picked a better location, they walked everywhere, its literally a stones throw to Buckingham Palace.  We also booked them into mamma mia on the Saturday night and they walked there too.  Their words described the Chesterfied Mayfair were - classy, top notch, luxury, a hotel in a bygone age, stylish.  Staff could not do enough for them, plenty of staff and they all went out of their way to help them.  The bar was lovely with a piano player on the saturday night, chocolates and water on their pillow on the turn down service.  Breakfast was excellent (full english) which was included in the price of the room. 

 They  were really blown away by this hotel and they thought it cost me a fortune (although I got a really good rate direct with the hotel).

They have already planned to return to London again and will not want to stay anywhere else.  I would certainly recommend anyone to this lovely hotel.

105,First Class Stay in London,"My wife and I recently had a 5-night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London and had a wonderful (if expensive) time.

The location was good for our needs.  A 2 or 3 block walk takes you to Green Park station for the underground.  Green Park, and of course Buckingham Palace are also nearby.  There is a terrific pub (Red Lion) just 3 blocks away for probably the most reasonable food we had in that part of London.  There are also many other pubs and restaurants in nearby Shepherds Market 1 block from the hotel.

The standard room was supremely well-equipped and quiet, if small.  The double bed was two smaller mattresses on a double box-spring, but very comfortable nonetheless.  The bathroom was elegant, with nice features, but quite small.  It did suffice however.  I had to remind the staff 3 times about a water issue to do with the shower, but it was no big deal.  The AC was good even with the very hot weather we had.

The hotel has many places to eat, all of them expensive.  Everwhere in London is expensive when it somes to food, but this hotel is not by any means a food bargain.  It is very easy to spend hideous amounts of money here even if you don't drink.  We ate in once and were pleased, but it was nothing special.

There was no included breakfast.

The staff, and there are many of them (lots of guys in uniforms standing around everywhere) were very efficient and friendly.

Re value for money, it depends on what you want.  We wanted a hassle-free stay and we got one and paid dearly for it.  If you like to hang around the hotel and soak up the place, then it would represent good value for many.  If you just want a place to sleep as you tour the town, you might do better for your dollar elsewhere.

I would stay there again if I could afford it.
",5,2006,09,05
105,"Elegance, quiet, and convenience","We stayed at the Chesterfield 20 years ago and hoped that it would as good as we remembered. It was! The room was very nice of a good size for London, the lighting was the best of any hotel I have ever stayed, the bathroom was bright in blue marble, there were two closets so that we were able to stash all our luggage. We overlooked the lovely terrace of the English speaking socielty next door.

The staff were fabulous, courteous and even funny. On making our reservations we were sent a preference sheet for type of pillow, bedding etc. You could order in advance any amenities. We requested that a car meet us at Heathrow. The hotel arranged it for a charge of 55 pounds which is close to the cost of a taxi which we would have taken. When we arrived at the Arrivals Hall the driver was there with our name on a card. We walked a few feet to a garage and a lovely gray Mercedes.

The location is near Shepards Market and Berkeley Square, both offer exceptional opportunites for dinner. We ate at the hotel for breakfast which was terrific and for dinner which was very good as well. We stayed for two weeks and were able to walk to dinner every evening with great variety.
We recommend this hotel without hesitation. Please note that we stay in hotels over 25 nights of the year for pleasure.

105,Fantastic .. hard to imagine better,"Stayed here 19th August for a trip to see Mamma Mia at Prince of Wales Theatre.

What can I say?  A gem!

A quiet location - absolutely NO traffic noise or loud interruptions.  We had a letter in our room when we arrived about a nearby party that night - very thoughtful - but if they were noisy we didnt hear them!.

From arrival to departure everything was perfect.  Desk staff were courteous and efficient not to mention downright friendly.

Hotel was amazing .. really different in the boutique style .. felt like you were walking into a town house 100 years ago .. everything elegant and plush.

Restaurants and bar areas were first rate and the food on offer for breakfast, lunch and dinner was simply top draw!

Our room - Superior King - was really unusally decorated in a 'safari' style but tastefully so and as with everything else it was excellent in quality, cleanliness and design.

In a nutshell, great hotel and will definitely return on my next trip to that part of London!
",5,2006,08,22
105,Good Hotel,"Our stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair was for a week. The concierge was very helpful and gave good recommendations for restaurants. The front desk staff was always very cheerful and friendly. The restaurant staff was talkative and made sure you had everything you wanted. But they were pretty slow at getting your food. The continental breakfast was good. All in all everything seemed nice. A very down to earth quiet hotel.

105,"Great hotel, even greater service","We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 nights at the end of a 3 weeks tour of England and Europe.  We loved all of our hotels, but the service at the Chesterfield is beyond anything you can imagine.  We arrrived a little early and one of our rooms wasn't ready so we were offered complimentary tea and cookies in the bar while we waited.  All staff were always going above and beyond in anything they could do for us.  

We were in a Junior Suite which was very beautiful, spacious and comfortable.  Our traveling companions were in a Superior King and it was also exceptionally nice.  Bathrooms were large and clean with the usual amenities. 

Breakfast consisted of a buffet and also items you could order.  We had their afternoon tea and were amazed at the selection and quantiy of items.  Again, great service.  We did eat dinner there once and it was also very good.  

Location is perfect, with Green Park Tube station within a short walking distance.  Piccadilly Circus and all the theaters of West End a short walk also.  Would definitely stay here again.

105,Look no further for a wonderful experience,"What a find for a London Hotel.  Everyone member of staff we met was exceptionally friendly and courteous, from the moment we arrived we had first class service.  We have stayed in many hotels in Mayfair but this has been the best.  I agree that the rooms are not large, but everything you would want is catered for.  We loved it and when we book again, which we shall, we will look no further, you cannot beat the Chesterfield for old fashioned English service, which is hard to come by these days.  Well done!

105,Quiet and discreet,"We stayed at the Chesterfield on 10th July for two nights. The hotel met all our expectations. A very quiet and discreet location within easy reach of the west end and the parks.
The staff were excellent and very obliging, especially in the restruant for breakfast, wich was an experience both in choice and quality.
Our room was very clean and comfortable.
The Chesterfield is a gemstone of a Hotel tucked away in Mayfair.

105,Highly Recommended!  Would stay again,"We stayed at the C.M. for two nights following a long flight from Los Angeles.  We could not have been more pleased with the hotel.  The room was a bit small, but that is to be expected from European hotels.  Everything was immaculate, well appointed, and the staff was absolutely fantastic.  As one other reviewer said, we were treated like important guests from the moment we arrived.

Location is perfect - quaint, quiet street, and we were near Shepard's Market, a small cul de sac of neat little restaurants, as well as within walking distance of Buckinham Palace, St. James Park, and the Thames (that's a bit of a trek, but certainly doable).  Green Park tube station very close.  Sorry, no good photos of the room.  The others on the site do it justice.

Our rate was 250 GBP total for 2 nights, including VAT and breakfast.  This is their summer weekend special, and since breakfast is very expensive, I highly recommend getting it included in your rate if you can.  Exceptional value for that price.  You can get them to book a car to pick you up from LHR for about 50-60 GBP, I would use that service (although our guy had a hard time finding us at the airport).

One note - we booked through Active Hotels, and there were two issues with that - 1) they got the arrival date wrong, and good thing I called ahead to confirm; and 2) each morning, the restaurant had to be convinced our rate included breakfast, but they fixed it pronto once they checked with the front desk.  So maybe the restaurant has some issues.

We would definitely stay again.

105,Even more than perfect !,"We spend our 5th wedding anniversary at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and they made it an unforgetable moment for us!
Everything was just even more than perfect!
Everybody was so kind and helpfull.  We have got a lot of little extra's and attentions.  It is a very stylish hotel, nice room, beautifull restaurant, delicious food, cosy and comfortable bar, excellent service and most off all, superfriendly staff!
The difference which makes the Chesterfield Mayfair, is that the people who work there do not only do their job for which they are paid to do, but they really put their heart and soul in their work to make your stay something special to remember.
Congratulations to the general manager, the managers and the complete staff of the Chesterfield Mayfair, and many thanks!  
 
Next time we come to London, we will certainly stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again!

105,wonderful service,"We had a lovely stay on a Saturday night in June. True, our corner room had quite a lot of traffic noise and wasn't huge, but it was immaculate and the service was impeccable. The staff at all times were attentive without being irritating, and the room was cosy and comfortable. coming back to a well turned-down bed after a days gigging in Hyde Park, then ordering reasonably priced room service at midnight, was just great. Breakfast was fab and it's in a great position. We'd definitely stay there again, but may ask for a room at the back next time to avoid the traffic noise.

Ps we liked the quirky decor, maybe not our choice at home but suited the hotel :-)
",5,2006,07,27
105,Classy and Friendly,"I had the pleasure of staying for 3 nights on a business trip, along with 5 other colleagues, and enjoyed the experience.
As I was unfamiliar with London and arriving at 7am in the morning I booked the room from the previous day and the hotel arranged a car to pick me up at a cost of 55GBP. As soon as I arrived the staff were helpful and attentive. The room was available upon arrival and had actually been held as the bed was still ""turned down"". 
The room was a Superior King at 180GBP plus VAT and did not include breakfast (18.50GBP for full english) so it looks like I paid a premium price even when booked via the hotels website. Others paid far less but were also in lesser rooms.
The room was adequate in size but well appointed and with CD/Radio alarm clock. The TV controls are overly complex and it takes 10 to 20 key strokes on the system just to get a normal channel. The room was clean but the king bed was two singles joined and you could feel that they were at two different heights and had a severe ridge in the centre.
Despite a couple of annoyances I enjoyed the stay and was greeted by name whenever I came in. The staff were unobtrusive but very helpful when required. It is in a great location and you can walk to many of the sights in London. Easy access to the tube at Green Park. I would recommend and revisit this hotel.
Hope this helps.

105,An Excellent Weekend Break,"Just spent the weekend at this hotel with my wife for her birthday. Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor I was really looking forward to staying and it didn't disappoint.

The location was spot on in Mayfair and was a very convenient location for seeing London with the tube station 5 minutes walk away. The main shopping areas of Bond Street and Oxford Street were only 10 minutes, walk, and due the the fantastic weather we were having, that's what we decided to do.

Our room was not the largest I've ever stayed in, but, it was the size you would expect and was certainly not cramped. My wife and I had plenty of room, for ourselves and all of her shopping (he, he he..). It was clean and well kept, and the evening turndown service was an added bonus.

We found the room very quiet (2nd floor) and did not encounter any traffic noise. In fact, my wife did comment on how quiet is was considering we were staying in the centre of London.

The Staff were very friendly and polite and where always around in the background, ready and waiting to help, whatever it may be.

Our Room rate included breakfast and this was excellent. We certainly didn't go short and there was plenty of choice. With a selection of fruit, pastries, yoghurts, cereals and a traditional english cooked breakfast.

In the evening after seeing a West end Show we retired to the bar, and enjoyed the cool relaxed atmosphere, whilst the pianist played in the background. It was a lovely end to a fantastic weekend break.

A little tip: We booked via the hotel website which was the same price as other internet hotel booking sites, but included was a free bottle of wine. This was remembered at check in by the desk clerk and we were duly asked when during our stay would we like the wine.

105,Chesterfield Mayfair recommended highly,"I choose the Chesterfield Mayfair from July 5 – July 8 with family during 2.5 week vacation in Europe. 

The Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel.  Rooms are on the small side – no surprise.   The most important thing for my wife and 2 teenage girls however, is cleanliness and comfort and the C.M. scores high in both categories.   We were given rooms across the hall from one another (as requested) and though there was no view it was, at least, very quiet.  Besides, we did not choose the hotel for its view.

An odd design flaw in the shower, however, is the partial glass enclosure.  I would like to meet the designer who put this together; it simply doesn’t work well and it took careful planning and aim to keep from having large puddles on the floor because of this stupid enclosure!  A minor inconvenience when considering the overall quality.  Don’t forget, the English don’t place wash-cloths in their hotels.  Pick up a pack at Wal Mart and simply use and discard as you travel.  Our Paris hotel did not have these either.  Yes in Switzerland.

We found the hotel staff to be exceptional without reserve.  We were treated like important guests from our arrival with our large bags to our early departure.  Though not able to check in at noon as requested, we were able to do so at 1:00.  We were always greeted with a smile wherever we saw a staff member.  Excellent recommendations for travel about London and finding what we needed locally.

There is an internet access point (computer) on the lower level and time can be rented.  I took my laptop and my teenagers were able to keep up with friends by the in-room DSL access points (Around 15 GP per 20 hours.)  Sullivan’s market is no more than one block away with access to several small restaurants, pubs a “post office store,” and small pizza place.  A few steps further  is a Nero’s coffee shop (like Starbucks) and a small market store where we purchased wine, water & breakfast food including fresh bread each day.

We highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair and should we return to London, will likely stay there again.

105,Boutique hotel without bragging about it.....?,"We arrived on the hottest July day in London in nearly 100 years and the pavement was sizzling. The cool classy cosy reception area was very welcoming. However, we were disappointed that at 10 past 2, having checked the day before by telephone what time we could check in, we'd been told ""any time"".  

In fact our room was not ready and we were asked to wait 15 minutes as the last occupant had only just vacated! In the end, our room was not ready until 3pm, which was annoying as we had a packed afternoon and would have preferred to have had a cooling shower before setting out again into the hot city streets. 

However, the apologetic receptionist offered us a complimentary drink while we waited in the bar which we initially refused, but as the wait continued, we accepted and ordered two cuppacinos, which then took a futher minutes to arrive! In fact they arrived just as we were told our room was at last ready for us! 

We only had hand baggage but we were not asked if we wanted any help with our bags - but to be fair, the staff were wearing formal attire and  were probably even hotter than we were.   

So we were not off  to a very auspicious start. However, without being asked (and even before the delay ) we had been up-graded to a ""themed room."" 

We were delighted to be shown to the Music Room, which is exquisitely decorated - an absolute peach of a room and bathroom.  

The staff were all delightfully friendly and reflecting on the unfortunate first impression, it is only because they were so laid back  in the first place - presumably telling the previous occupant of ""our"" room he too didn't have to vacate by any particular time, that we weree slightly inconvienienced. Given she managed it in about 40 minutes, the maid did a great job! 

This aside, we would definitely stay there again and found it very restful, and slap bang in the heart of Mayfair. I am now looking for a loo seat  in the shape of a cello!  On the way out, laden with shoppijng bags, we were not ioffered a hand to the taxi either - but then it was the second hottest day and they were still in their hot suits while we were in shorts and tee shirts.

Barbra Streisand had signed the guest book two weeks earlier -  don't know if she really did stay here but  lots of Americans do and you can see why they really rate it. Classy and  classical and very understated. If there were any businessmen here, they kept very quiet !",4,2006,07,21
105,Fantastic Hotel,"Just got back from a four night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my fiancee. It is a fabulous hotel in every way that we experienced. The staff were all polite and helpfull and the concierge was fantastic.

The rooms were absolutely beautiful. No idea what the other guy was talking about. Our bed was extremely comfortable. The TV reception was great, especially for watching World Cup games when we were tired from sight seeing. The cleaning ladies did great jobs and there was even a nightly turn down service which was fantastic. No problems in any way. We even took advantage of getting breakfast delivered to our room and enjoyed that tremendously.

The hotel restaurant is also incredible with terrific service and great food. The Green Park metro stop is just a few blocks away which makes for easy access to all the rest of London.

Really there is nothing negative I could say about this hotel. It is located away from noisy streets in a beautiful area of London. Again, I have no idea how the other reviewer heard traffic noise as there are no busy streets near the hotel for at least three or four blocks. I can't compare this hotel to others in London, but for the price I thought it was totally worth it.

105,Not exactly what we expected...,"My girlfriend and I booked in to this hotel for a special night's break on 23/07/06. We chose it based mainly on the other reviews on trip advisor, booked directly through the hotel and paid to upgrade to a superior double room. I'd advise anyone looking to do the same thing to sort these reviews on rating low to high and have a read (I don't see any exagerations in them).

We arrived and checked in without any trouble and were escorted to our room by a very friendly bellboy. The reception and ground floor public areas looked very nice.

However, the (first) room we entered was very small - there was a 4ft corridor round the bed, a dest at the foot of the bed, small fitted wardrobe and a TINY bathroom. This would have been cosy as a single, but there was no way two people could walk past each other in it. Also the threadbare carpet had bits on it and the 'decor' was many dark portrait paintings of mens' heads.

When we returned to reception they offered to show us two other rooms. Both were the same size as the first, in the same worn condition with varied 'interesting' decor. These suposedly superior rooms (dread to think what the standard were like) were nothing like the website pictures and we really didn't want to stay there anymore. 

Back at reception and the girl was no longer interested in giving good service. If we wanted to leave we would have to pay anyway (which is their policy for one night). Also when we mentioned room size she pretty much asked what we expected for that sort of money in the mayfair area, and didn't seem to care about the trip advisor ratings... not exactly customer service. Also tried to charge £7 for a 45 minute internet card!

I know other people have loved this hotel, but for the cost of a weekend away somewhere, I'd take the weekend over one night here. We ended up leaving the hotel and found a room in the city (twice as big and half the cost) on a last minute booking website in an internet cafe!
",1,2006,07,18
105,What a disappointment!,"I was relieved to read the review dated 15th July regarding this hotel. I have to say that I agree with the view that this hotel is certainly not as great as the previous trip advisor reviews have suggested.

I booked the Chesterfield Hotel following personal recommendations from my family who had used the hotel regularly in the past when staying in London. As I had an event in London, I decided that this would be a perfect place to stay. 

My boyfriend and I paid £159 for a ""superior double room"" which for the money, we expected to be comfortable, and something quite special. When we saw the room, we were shocked. I had expected it to be fairly small as this is normal with London Hotels, however the decor was quite tacky, the carpet was worn and didn't look as if it had been hoovered properly, and you could barely walk around the double bed due to lack of space.

We asked for another room and were taken to a different floor where we were shown a practically identical room (except for a different colour carpet and wallpaper.) We visited reception and asked what our options were as there was no way that we would pay £159 for the rooms we were shown. We were informed that if we were not prepared to pay more to upgrade, then we could of course leave and find another hotel but that there was a 24 cancellation policy, and consequently we would have to pay the £159 regardless.

The receptionist asked us what we expected from a hotel for that money in Mayfair! This shocked me. When I asked if we could have a full refund due to customer dissatisfaction, she held firm and said no, replying ""it's business."" 

As I had also booked a suite in August (costing £250) for my Father's 50th birthday, I informed the receptionist that I also wished to cancel this reservation. The receptionist went to speak to the Manager, and eventually we were able to leave with our money back. 

I do not honestly believe that this hotel is good value for money. I have stayed in many hotels of a much higher standard for less. I have no problem in parting with £159 if I believe that it is worth it, but this hotel is certainly not.

Fortunately I had taken half a day off work which was meant to give my boyfriend and I a relaxing afternoon to relax and get ready for the event in the evening. Instead, we used it to search on Lastminute.com for another hotel! Eventually we found a 4* hotel in The City for £80 called Club Quarters. The room was at least twice the size, the staff were pleasant and we felt that it was good value for money.
",2,2006,07,18
105,Nice? Yes. Overrated? Certainly!,"What can I say? I was so looking forward to staying at this hotel, (with my wife), after reading the many reviews on Tripadvisor.

I can only say that it was a bit of anti-climax.

First the good points:
The staff were brilliant
The location was superb
The price was very reasonable, given the location.

Now the bad:
The room was tiny and tired looking.
The 'double' bed was the old two beds pushed together chestnut. Very uncomfortable - one bed hard - one bed soft.
The room was the noisiest I've ever encountered in a London hotel. A 4th floor room and the sound of the traffic was horrendous. (Yes the windows were closed)
No minibar!
No free internet or wi-fi connectivity. Get with it guys - this is 2006.
Terrible TV picture.

I must add that I didn't eat or drink at the hotel so can't rate this aspect.

I can only sum up by saying that I wouldn't stay here again. There's far better around for much less money. Harsh on the staff, who were as polite and attentive as you could imagine.

Sorry guys but I can't buy that this is, at the time of writing, the second best hotel in London, according to the Tripadvisor ratings. Not even close in my book. Harsh but fair I'm afraid.
",3,2006,07,15
105,Excellent,"A warm welcome, excellent and thoughtful service, comfortable rooms, good bathrooms. A frriendly bar where a woman can feel relaxed on her own. Good nibbles with the drinks, and if you are entertaining friends they can lay on canapes too. From a business point of view, they have various sizes of meeting rooms which can offer more privacy than discussing business in the bar or restaurant.

I cannot fault it. Well done the Chesterfield.
",5,2006,07,12
105,"Very good, but not great...","Just got back from a long weekend after staying at the Chesterfield with my wife, and obviously after reading the reviews here my expectations were sky high !

In reality what you have here is a good quality, well located, reasonably priced (for London) hotel, but which could benefit from a little refurb, routine maintenance plus a liberal sprinkling of tlc.

Yes the staff are genearally pleasant, yes the breakfast is nice, and yes the clientele and ambience are generally agreeable.

However the rooms are VERY small, bits of fittings seem to be falling off all over the place, and the cushions in the bar area are sooooo tacky !

Three quarters of the guests appeared to be North American, whom I expected generally to be more discerning than average. But even the Brits have standards -and I must say that this Brit in particular expected a heck of a lot more !

Thanks for the experience Chesterfield - but there is plenty of room for improvement..
",4,2006,07,03
105,Fine courteous service and posh facility - with quirks,"We stayed 3 nights, June 5-8, our first time to London (1st time to Europe).  We walked to the Chesterfield from Paddington Station, having taken the express train from Heathrow.  We would like to point out, however, we didn't do enough homework: the Metro subway railroad (""tube"") would have taken us from Paddintgon nearly to the hotel door...  We enjoyed the walk though.  Warning to Americans: the British allergens are not to be underestimated.  Both my wife and I got nailed nearly simultaneously near Hyde park -- we recommend pre-loading your systems with decongestant/antihistamine.  At any rate, the Chesterfield staff was friendly and engaged immediately in service to us.  Our room (the music room) was striking but small and busy, so we asked to look at another room.  Staff quickly showed us the 2nd flr postage room -- we loved it.  Plusses have been already documented well by others.  We enjoyed a full English breakfast at the hotel restaurant (our $80 breakfast...).  The restaurant host was 1st-rate all the way.  Throughout our stay he and much of the rest of the staff remembered our names.  This may be because we kept looking for ice!  Yes, we know that is an 'American thing', but ice is ice and it was only to be had from the bar or via room service and we just didn't want to bother folks for such a triffle -- but staff gladly accommodated us.  One other drawback was the lack of free internet.  I'll just say it: I would prefer a room rate to include all the 'little charges': phone, internet, etc.  I'd rather not have mutilple little charges.  We absolutely loved the location.  It is very near the Green Park tube station (day passes work for buses and tube-trains).  All visitors should find the nearby Sheperd's Market: a small cluster/plaza of restaurants, delis, pubs, and more.  We repeatedly went there.  We highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair to everyone.

105,Best Value in London,"We stayed here in May this year and could not believe our luck!  This hotel is fantastic value, absolutely beautiful rooms and is in the most convenient location.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  It is decorated in very English style.
It is only a few minutes walk to GreenPark station, round the corner from the Ritz and only a short walk to Hyde park.  It has an excellent choice of restaurants close by, where we chose to have breakfast rather than the hotel.  Really should have a 5 star rating.
",5,2006,06,13
105,Outrageously Good - especially considering the price!,"Well i was the lucky guy who managed to get a night at this hotel for just over £22 - seriously! It's one of the best London hotels i've visited and knocks the socks off some 5* let alone 4* rivals. It's very traditional and i suppose that isn't to everybody's taste but i couldn't fault my stay.
We'd only been in the room around 5 minutes and the receptionist that checked us in phoned to see if everything was ok with our room and of course it was a very short coversation. Rooms are beautifully decorated and imacculately clean as i expected, the bathroom was excellent and my friend adored the huge, rainshower. Turndown service was also a very nice touch that not all hotels make an effort to do as standard. We didn't get to try breakfast as we had a very late night so i guess i missed out there.
Overall this is a fantastic hotel and very romantic. I thought it would be an ideal place to take a partner for an anniversary/special occasion - i just need to find the partner now!
What can i say that hasn't been said already, if you're thinking about booking this hotel just go ahead and do it, you'll struggle to find better.

105,Deserves a 5 star rating,"I was fortunate to stay at this excellent hotel just a week ago for four nights. I arrived at London after a two week tour in France and was quite tired. This was my fourth visit to London and was lucky enough to stay in many famous five star hotels in the past (thanks to my dad). This time I was by myself and most of those five star establishments can learn a thing or two from this hotel. The Chesterfield sent a driver to pick me up from Heathrow, just as I requested. When I arrived at the hotel they were extremely welcoming and friendly. Every single staff member of the hotel from the doorman to the check-in staff was courteous. The hotel is in a fantastic location and close to most parts of central London. I’m in my twenties so I walked everywhere, the buses and the Green Park station is also close by. The room was very nice and was immaculately decorated. It had all the facilities and comforts you need. The room and bathroom was very clean and well maintained. The room service and breakfast was first class. I really recommend this hotel to anyone, the staff are a delightful bunch. I will definitely stay at the Chesterfield in the future.
 
Great value for top notch service. Deserves a 5 star rating.
",5,2006,06,04
105,What a Great Experience!,"My husband and I had such a wonderful stay in this hotel. The room was clean and pretty, the staff friendly and welcoming, the location was ideal, and they really went the extra mile to satisfy.  The hotel is located on a nice, quiet street (something hard to find in London) in the lovely Mayfair area (famous for great hotels, like the Ritz) and is close walking distance to Hyde Park, Green Park, and Piccadilly Circus.  There's a tube station nearby too (Green Park Station) along with breakfast places and even a pub with pretty good food (as good as you get in England, anyway).  

The hotel is small, but has a very homey feel, and its one of the few hotels that actually allowed us to reserve a King Size bed, not just request one as a preference.  To be honest, the view from our room left a lot to be desired (I think we were overlooking the air conditioning units) but we didn't really care.  What we appreciated was the extra services they provided. The room came with robes to borrow and slippers to keep, and every night our beds were neatly turned down with the TV guide and remote laid out for us and yummy carmels on our pillows. They even put bottles of water by our beds, which we weren't charged for drinking, and when we first arrived delivered a platter of fruit to welcome us.  And their room service menu had a number of affordable snacks you could order 24 hours a day which we definitely took advantage of (their sticky toffee pudding was really good, especially after a long day of sight seeing.)

I would definitely recommend staying here and hope to someday come back myself.  Especially for the price, you really can't do much better.",5,2006,06,02
105,5 Star Service at 3 Star Rates,"It's maybe not fair to write this review now that I'm back in Los Angeles and mourning the end of our trip.  But, the Chesterfield Mayfair was the best recommendation I've ever gotten from tripadvisor, and boy, was it a FIND.  Never would have heard of it or known of it otherwise. The location is excellent.  Just a ten minute walk across Green Park to Buckingham Palace.   A twenty minute walk to the theater district on haymarket.  Ten minutes to Fortnum and Mason, twenty to Harrod's.  Twenty to the National Gallery.  

The hotel itself was very clean, great beds, nice rooms.  But the staff is extraordinary.  We felt we were coming home every time we got back from the day's travels.  We would have a delicious sandwich or fish and chips in the bar, seated in the most comfortable couches and chairs, drink a pint, or have a delicious Belvedere martini.  

We had an excellent dinner in the dinig room one night, fresh roast pork with cracklin', and a chardonnay from the Hotel's vineyard in France, which was excellent.  Our waiter, Walter, was awesome.  

This may be ranked as 2 stars less than the Ritz, and, having stayed at the Ritz, I can tell you, it's not as sumptuous, but the service and food was 5 star.  And at half the price of the  of the Ritz.

Money-saving tip:  Go directly to the Chesterfield-Mayfair website and check the prices against any of the ""bargain"" online reservation places.  We saved about $50 a day by doing that.

Money-saving tip #2:  If you can, ask to have the room charged when you make your reservation as opposed to checkout.  If I had done this, I could have saved myself $1000, due to the falling dollar between the 7 months I reserved the rooms and actually paid for them.

105,genuinely friendly staff giving first class service,"This hotel is a little gem in Mayfair within 5/10 minutes of Picadilly Circus. What make this hotel is it's staff - all very friendly and anxious to help their guests. A conversation in the bar with what we thought was another guest was in fact the general manager enquiring about our day. Help and concern for one of our party who was taken ill was top class and while it was a hotel it felt much more personal. The bar, library, restaurant, lobby are small intimate and tastefully decorated which give them character. The room we had was very well decorated with a relatively large ensuite with heated floors. The common theme of the reviews on TripAdvisor as also of a book in the lobby inviting guest comments was consistent and that it is the staff that make the Chesterfield. This is why it ranks so highly on TripAdvisor and I agree whole heartedly. Thank you TripAdvisor for helping us find the Chesterfield and thank you to everyone in Chesterfield and in particular Alex, Armand,Kayleigh and the Night Manager.

105,"Fab Location, stunning service & staff, Loved It...","We travelled to London for four nights on an Easter weekend break and I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Having stayed in an unmentionable hotel in Canary Wharf for the first two nights ( the worst experience in a hotel in any country by far), we arrived at the Chesterfield in the morning about eleven and although our room was not ready we were greeted by charming staff and were shown to the beautiful piano bar where we ordered a lovely brunch. I had called ahead the day before to see about theatre tickets for the weekend (as it was a busy weekend the show we wanted to see was sold out) and Ian the concierge went to every length to secure tickets for us - he was so professional and from the moment we spoke to him, we knew our stay in the Chesterfield was going to be top class.  Each time we ordered a simple mineral in the plush bar we were given complimentary Olives & Bombay mix to enjoy with our drinks and the Bar staff were so pleasant and professional. While waiting for our room, the manager came over to welcome us to the hotel and all the staff did a little courtsey each time they dealt with us! The hotel was in a perfect location, a five minute walk to Oxford Street and all the best Restaurants and Sights that London has to offer were close by. We stayed in one of the suites, and we didnt want to leave the room! It was beautifully decorated and had all the little extra touches that make it that bit more special - bathrobes, slippers, umbrella, big bottles of mineral water by the bed, Canopys brought in and the bed turned down each evening. As part of our Easter special offer we also had afternoon tea in the conservatory restaurant on Easter Sunday, a lovely experience. We got our tickets to the show in the end and booked dinner in the Restaurant on the last nite, it was the most beautiful meal ever, served with such detail by the most pleasant and friendly staff we've ever come across.
Will stay no where else in London ever again! This hotel should be awarded 5*status.

105,wonderful staff!,"Great hotel - Ive stayed in some fab places in London over the past 12 months.  This hotel has the best staff by far!  very friendly, nothing is too much trouble.

The bar has a feel of an old fashioned ""gentlemens club"", and the cushions of pictures of dogs isnt really my taste!  Ok its not in the Sanderson league of chic, but youre made to feel welcome - the staff offer you plenty of complimentary nibbles!  

Would have got a 5 out of 5 from me, but we stayed in room 608 yesterday and it was really noisy - next door there must be an ice making machine, or air conditioning or something as the hum was quite loud and there were lots of rattles and vibrations.

Normally, I would have given the hotel the opportunity to sort, but we didnt get into our room until 2.30am in the morning and were getting up at 6.30.  Being so tired it meant that it didnt really cause us a problem - but had I been staying there for a few nights or having a sensible (how can you do sensible in London?!) early night, then it would have done.

Would definitely stay there again.

105,Highly Recommended,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Excellent neighborhood. Walking distance to tube station, Green Park, theatres, and much more. Rooms are small but that is typical for London. Prices are not cheap but very reasonable for this area of London. We paid 163 GBP per night. Breakfast was discounted at 10 GBP but we opted to walk down to Berkeley Street and found several wonderful small cafes for breakfast with Londoners for 6 GBP for two. The staff is attentive, friendly and helpful. Thay'll find you restaurants, call a taxi, lend you umbrellas, and much more. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Room was quiet and clean.
Negatives: No view.

105,Wonderful!,"We recently took our first trip to London having no idea where to stay.  Many of our friends and relatives suggested all types of hotels in all parts of London.  We went with the suggestion of a friend whose taste mirrors ours.

Staying at the Chesterfield Hotel, in Mayfair, London, was a great decision.  It's a small, old world, intimate hotel with every possible modern convenience.  The room was beautifully decorated with two phones, TV, internet access, fax, etc.  The bathroom was right out of a magazine.

The staff was very attentive, professional and well informed.

The location couldn't have been better.  It is located a few short blocks from the Underground, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park.

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

105,Cheers From Chesterfield,"My wife and I spend 3 awesome days exploring central London with the Chesterfield-Mayfair as home base.  This hotel was recommended by a friend.  Neither of us had ever been to London.  After arriving at Heathrow we got a rental car and drove to Southhampton and the Isle of Wight for a few days.  Returning we took some excellent advice, ditched the rental car and took the tube to the Chesterfield (Picadilly Line to Green Park).  It was easy, even for newbies.  The staff at the hotel was great.  From the traditionally dressed doorman, the helpful front desk (whom we exercised to upgrade our room), the concierge that got us theater tickets, the woman in the restaurant that got me a ""proper"" English breakfast every morning, to my favorite, Chris.  Chris helped us plan out our attack on London.  I'm afraid we occupied way too much of his time.  Pestered him with tourist questions, asked his advice about this and that.  He was always cheerful and willing to help, epitomizing the English gentleman.  Even when he was off work and walking away from the Hotel, he stopped and chatted.  If you want to do everything in the tourist brochures, the Chesterfield is located perfectly for it.  Close enough to walk to many things.  The subway is easy access.  Taxi's readily available.  Yet it's a couple blocks off the beaten path so it's quiet and charming too.  I can't wait to go again.  I regret not ever using the restaurant, but there were just too many pubs to try.

105,"Wonderful stay, wonderful staff, charming hotel","We have just returned from a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, ending our trip to the Uk there.  It certainly deserves the reviews we read on Trip advisor, having chosen the hotel primarily because of those reviews.  The staff is simply wonderful, could not have been more helpful in planning things to do, making recommendations for dining, transit etc.  The rooms are very comfortable, well furnished and spotlessly clean. We did have a bit of traffic noise with the location of the room, but it was not too bothersome and really cannot be helped. The bathrooms are spotless, well supplied and have lovely heated marble floors.  We had a king room and a twin room down the hall for 2 teens. The rooms are serviced morning and evening, with water placed at the bedside each evening along with the television guide and even a snack menu and slippers placed alongside the bed! 
We dined in Butlers restaurant and the food was excellent, with a fixed price menu option for 2 or 3 courses. Service was again outstanding and the staff was very abundant, professional yet very friendly, taking time to chat with us.  We did find breakfast extremely expensive, we are not big eaters in the morning, so  the continental buffet at 16.95 each was too much for the amount we had, there were a number of small cafe places nearby when we were setting out other mornings for sightseeing etc which suited us a bit better.   We had drinks in the bar which was charming and had an excellent pianist which we enjoyed.
Overall, for staff, location, comfort, we would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again.

105,"Nice hotel, very good service","This hotel is in a very good location on a quiet street.  Easy walking distances to many attractions including Green and Hyde Parks.  We had reserved 2 superior king and 1 single room.  Upon check-in we were notified that we had been upgraded.  The first room was called the ""The Study"".  Though this room was ""cute"" - decorated as a victorian man's study, it was small, very dark and required going down a small flight of steps in the corridor.  We passed and instead took room 319 which we were very pleased with.  This room was tastefully decorated in taupe, fairly spacious and had a nice bath.  The second room was the themed ""Music Suite"".  This room was very attractive if not over the top in its theme.  We loved it initially but if you don't like clutter and prefer a more ""restful"" decor choose the regular superior room.  We got a little tired of the theme in our stay.  The last room I assume was a classic double (420) and was very pleasant though small.  The bath, however, was the largest of all the rooms.  All rooms have modern baths with a ""rain shower"" type head.  Good, powerful hair dryers are also supplied and the air-conditioning worked great.  We also saw room 318 which was similar to 319 but done in a more feminine style.  On our next stay we would want these rooms.  The hotel staff was very accomodating and couldn't have been more professional or nice.  We had one evening meal in the restaurant and thought the food and service was a high quality.  The bar was also very comfortable and the staff great.  In our three night stay the hotel hosted an afternoon wedding reception and a large business gathering.  Both of these events took place in the conservatory so we didn't see much of that room.  The hotel appears popular for local events.  

Overall this is a very nice, small, traditional hotel with excellent, friendly service.

All of the staff members we encountered couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. The little touches such as the daily newspaper with the weather report and daily newsletters from the hotel were much appreciated. My friend and I had a corner twin, which was large by European standards and the noise from the street was minimal. The only glitch, was that my other two friends, did not recieve the twin room we booked. (We booked two twins.) The staff did convert a king into two twins for them and it worked fine. I would not hesitate to stay there again and will recommend it to friends.

Pleasant, professional, excellent dining recommendations even though we didn't have an opportunity to have dinner in their beautiful restaurant. We did have the traditional breakfast daily and it was excellent.
the rooms were immaculate...very important to us as i have a bit of a phobia and my husband gets very picky about hotels as he travels for a living.the beds were made twice daily and the marble bathroom was spotless.
The area was very upscale and great walking distance to many places...piccadilly, buckingham palace, westminster etc...
Also some very nice little places right around the hotel for great Indian food or a cocktail.
This will be an annual trip for us and we will indeed stay here.

105,World class hospitality,"My wife and I stayed for a long weekend to celebrate her birthday at the end of March/start of April 2006. I chose the hotel based upon previous comments here in Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. 

From the moment you step through the door you enter another world, one where  service is exceptional and every member of staff is warm and welcoming. In all my years I cannot recall a hotel offering a friendlier, more efficient service. Nothing was too much trouble.

I had booked a table at a special restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday but after experiencing the excellent breakfast and (again) excellent service, we decided to eat in the hotel on our second night. Once again, the service was impecable, friendly and spot on. The food was excellent and easily equalled that of the night before (and was the better dining experience of the two).

The room had a super kingsize Hypnos bed which gave me my best sleep in a long time (I slept so well, I lifted the sheets to check out the make!). The room had everything you needed and was a reasonable size, larger than some other London hotel rooms I have stayed in.

I cannot fault any aspect of my stay at this hotel. It is run by very genuine and friendly people and I highly commend it.

My only concern in making such a recommendation is that it sets the bar of expectation so high that some people may arrive expecting, nay demanding, the impossible. What I will say is that you will have a more personal, cosseted and welcoming experience than you would if you were staying in any large hotel chain. I do not believe it can be beaten - and, being fortunate enough to be able to spend several hundred pounds on a weekend break, I take no issue at having £1.00 ($1.75) added to my bill and matched by the hotel to go to such a deserving charity. Well done for raising nearly £100,000 ($175,000).

105,Awesome :-),"My girlfriend and I had the privilege of staying in this delightful hotel for one night in early February. Having read all the reviews posted on tripadvisor before booking, I had high expectations of the Chesterfield Mayfair. Even so the hotel managed to exceed my expectations in every way. The staff were overwhelmingly polite, courteous and helpful, the food divine and the room delightful (and, for a London hotel, surprisingly spacious.) 

The only one note of disappointment in a otherwise amazing weekend was that, when we arrived at the hotel early in the morning, we found (as expected) that our room wasn't ready. We left our luggage at the hotel, in addition to a bouquet of roses which I had given to my girlfriend. Upon returning to the hotel in the evening, we were disappointed to find that the roses had merely been dumped in our room, therefore being out of water for several hours. Nonetheless, this is a minor negative factor in an otherwise fabulous experience. To our surprise, when we commented on this upon leaving our feedback at the hotel, a couple of weeks later we received a personal letter from the manager extending his apologies for this oversight. 

Finally....the breakfast was superb!!

105,Chesterfield-A small intimate gem,"After reading London Hotel reviews on this site, I booked a reservation for a family of 5.  We were in London from 4/15/06 to 4/21/06.  This is a very lovely hotel.  Given the size of our family, we had to book both a double and a triple room.  We ran into a snag at check in.  They had promised that our rooms would be next to each other.  One of rooms was vacated before the 2nd one.  This gave us a chance to check into one of the rooms and start to recover from jet lag.  When the second was available, we were told it was on another floor.  I reiterated that the rooms were supposed to be together.  They sent up an manager who kindly upgraded us to a second triple for the same price.  Very accomodative.   This placed the rooms close to each other.  All of our interactions with the staff were positive.  Everyone was cheerful, helpful and engage you in small talk.

As mentioned in many posts the area is beautiful.  I am ready to look for a home on Charles Street.  The cars parked on the street are indicative of the neighborhood.  Ferrari's, BMW;s, Bentley's, Aston Martin's, Lotus and a couple I did not even recognize.  I am sure those residencies are in the multimillion range.  The hotel was close to the tube, probably about a 4-5 block walk around Berkely Square.  It is close to Shephard's Market.   The rooms are snug as we expected, but we never felt cramped.  The hotel is tidy, neat and well appointed.  It is in an English Manor style.   They have turn-down service in the evening.  They provided letters under the door showcasing upcoming hotel and London events.  The rooms have all the amenaties one would expect to see at a Four Seasons including hair dryer, iron, robs, slippers, safe etc.  The slippers came in useful due to a false fire alarm just after midnight one evening.  The staff unecessarily apologized profusely the next morning.

Two things stand out.  We booked directly with the hotel and they included breakfast with our hotel rate.  For a family of 5 this was useful.  It became part of our routine to trudge downstairs in the morning.  The staff were very very friendly especially the Maitre D's.  At first we thought only the continental breakfast was included.  We quickly found out the kids could order anything they wanted off the menu and it was included.  This was helpful given our 3 sons are picky preteens/teens.   It started the days off well.   The second pleasure was the lounge.  Yes, it is London and the drinks are expensive given the weakness of the dollar.  The lounge was quaint and intimate.  It was never crowded.  I can't say enough about the gentleman who played the piano there.  He was very friendly and talented.  My wife and I took a break  there every night.  On Thursday night he returned with a Jazz trio.  This was our last night and we enjoyed it immensely.   The live music in this small setting was engaging.  During the days, we were out and about sightseeing.  We did not have a chance to sample any of the other meals at the hotel  Another aside is the fact that there is a pub down the block called"" I am the Only Running Footman"".  My wife was excited to see this being she is a big Martha Grimes fan. 

 We did all the usual tourist things in London.  We rode the Big Bus tour the first day.  It was an easy way to recover from jet lag and get the layout of the city.   We also did the Londoneye that day.  We visited Covent Garden (one of our favorite things), the Tower of London, St Paul's, Westminster, Hampton Court,  London Bridege, Harrods & the British Museum among other walks. All of those are a ""must see"".   We saw Billy Elliot.....highly recommended.  The kids loved it.  We had tea at the Ritz which was much good fun.  My oldest son had his first champagne there.  The only disappointments were Rules Restaurant which was pricey with poorly cooked meat, perfuntory service and small portions.  Harrods was interesting for the food areas but is also pricey.  The one pleasure there is that unlike American stores, no one hounds you every 2 minutes to ask if you need help.  The English restraint was refreshing.   We had to stop by to pick up some pudding we had promised for some English friends who helped us plan the trip.  One ocaution, we took the London Heathrow Express.  With 5 passengers, it may have been more economical to get a car.  Given five passengers and much luggage we needed 2 cabs from Paddington Station to get the hotel.  The cost was about 18 pounds total.  On the return the hotel called a van for us.  He charged us 35 pounds for an 8 minute ride.  Considering 2 taxis were half that cost, I thought that was excessive.  

All in all the Chesterfield Hotel was a great experience.  We would highly recommend for anyone planning a London trip and looking for a hotel that offers alot compared to other lodgings in London

105,Nice getaway hotel!,"Our Easter weekend getaway was perfect at the Chesterfield.  The room was very British in decoration with a modern amenities & the staff couldn't have been nicer.  Highly recommend this hotel!
",5,2006,04,24
105,Snug twin,"I too booked into the Chesterfield after reading the reviews of others on this site.  I think the problem with London hotels is that alot of people have booked them for a treat and so it was in my case - a night on the town with my mum before seeing Phantom (which is fabulous by the way)!

Not a sniff of an upgrade - never a good sign I think of a high class hotel if one is not offered if they're not full.  They gave us a double to start - now as much as I love my mum we don't want to sleep in the same bed.  They then changed us to a Queen Bed which was basically two singles then made up individually, but not with so much as an inch between us.  All this we were advised for no extra cost.

Now the bar - how depressing and a lost opportunity.  A miserable Spanish speaking waiter who didn't even look up and took ages to take a drink order - dreadful atmosphere only relieved once a young lady took over the running at 6 pm.  Hint - don't go to the bar until the evening shift.

As for quiet - yes, it's quiet outside, but the doors banging in the corridor was a nightmare.  The hotel needs to add those gizmos that prevent them from slamming, it was like a college dorm.

Maybe we're spoilt, but I'm not sure how much you have to pay these days to stay somewhere great, but it's definitely not here.

Along with the hotel industry's new fiddle - making people feel guilty about having their towels changed daily, the final straw was the £1 for charity added to our final bill.  If the company wants to pick a charity and give money to it - do it with its enormous profit.  We all pay inordinate amounts of tax and are sick of being embarrassed into contributing to something we didn't agree to.

105,DELIGHTFUL stat,"I took my husband on a surprise weekend trip to London for his birthday, and chose The Chesterfield largely based on the wonderful reviews it has gotten on this website.  We absolutely loved our stay at The Chesterfield Hotel! The staff is so warm, accomodating and impeccably mannered.  What a wonderful way to start our weekend immersion in English politeness and refinement. Ian at the Concierge desk was so helpful and charming, and Valerie at the front desk was so endearing and sweet.  Our room, although a bit small (as is normal in most European hotels), was very tastefully decorated in true English style.  The marble bathroom was beautiful, large and spacious.  And the breakfast! Ah the scrumptious English breakfast!! I couldn't wait for the morning to go down and have breakfast in their beautifully decorated dining room and conservatory. It was so delicious and fresh every morning we went down. Their cafe latte was to die for.  Finally, last but certainly not least, is the hotel's PERFECT location in Mayfair.  Mayfair is so beautiful and chic and so close to everything.  Plus, the hotel is tucked in on this gorgeous, romantic, winding street. We couldn't have asked for a nicer one. We will never forget our weekend stay in London, and The Chestefield did wonders to make it even more special.  I highly recommend it.

105,The Personel Touch,"I have recently had the great opportunity to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London on a business trip. But I have to say it felt more like a holiday.
The exterior of the building did not do the hotel justis as once inside you are transformed into a tardis of a building like one I had never had the privilege to step into before.
From the moment the door was opened for me the level of service was second to non.
Attention to detail in all areas of both the rooms and the building itself to the attention from every member of the staff (maintance to front of house) and not to mention the first class food which was served at breakfast, evening dinner and throught the conference itself. The quality of the decor throught the building and including the public toilets and lifts is beyoned belief. Each bedroom was unique although I stayed in their standard accomodation, Ihave to say it was more then mere standard to me. There was sence of a personel touch as if the room had just been chosen for you. The fixtures and fittings within the rooms were a delight and sometimes quirky. This hotel had a very relaxed and laid back feel to it with busy London just outside the door inside was a haven to walk into. I loved the whole experence of staying at The Chesterfield Hotel and I will definitely return soon.",4,2006,04,14
105,"Great, Quiet location, Excellent service!","I recently visited London with a friend on our return trip from Italy and stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 2 nights.  The hotel is on a quiet street in Mayfair, only a short walk from the nearest undergroung station and one stop from trendy Picadilly Circus.  The staff was very efficient and helpful.  The room was small but that was to be expected in London.  To make up for the size of  the room, every small detail was thought of from a GOOD hair dryer, stationary supplies (you never know when you need scissors and tape!) down to the handmade toffees left on your pillow during turndown in the evenings. The upscale Mayfair area is home to trendy bars and eateries only a few steps from the hotel.  I would definatley recommend it for anyone travelling to London!
",5,2006,04,10
105,Great London experience!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for 2 nights and it was wonderful.  The service is excellent, the room had pretty much every amenity that you needed, and it's in a great location.  We found an Easter special on their website, which included the room, one English tea, and breakfast for 151 pounds, and it also included the tax.  Not cheap, but I thought a good deal, all things considered.  London is an extremely expensive city, so be ready for the money to fly out of your pocket!  

The hotel is within walking distance to the Green Park tube stop, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park.  Very nice area with restaurants and small shops.  

I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair, especially if you can find a package deal.  I only wish we could've stayed longer!
",5,2006,04,07
105,Fantastic hotel!,"Our family of 3 spent 3 nights here last week, March 26th - 29th.  What a treat!  The room was tight (a King with a cot), but housekeeping kept it top notch.  The bathroom was up to date, with a great shower and tub.  

We found all the staff friendly and helpful.

The Chesterfield's restaurant is terrific!  Breakfast was included with our room:  it was first rate with a choice of food from a menu or a wonderful buffet.  Loris the manager takes great care of his guests!  We also enjoyed Dover Sole here one evening.  It was fantastic.      

The Green Park Underground is a 5 minute walk from Chesterfield Mayfair.  You can also access all the lovely London parks (near Buckingham) from the hotel for a great run.  This is a very safe neighborhood.
",5,2006,04,05
105,"Great Hotel, Upscale Neighborhood","When selecting a hotel for London, the Chesterfield was an easy choice due to its excellent value and high ranking on TripAdvisor.  The hotel did not dissapoint.  After traveling overnight from the U.S., my wife and I received a warm welcome from the top-notch staff, but most importantly, our room was ready for us even though it was mid-morning.  

The rooms are small and traditionally designed.  The marble bathrooms with rain shower heads were nice, but typically small.  Everything was clean and appeared in good working order.  

By far and away, the staff is what makes this a great hotel, as they are very attentive and go above and beyond to help the guests.  Before we left for Paris, the staff offered to investigate the latest on the student protests to see if we had any reason for concern.  (Turned out the stike ended the day before)

Of final note, the hotel is located in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in London.  We saw more Bentleys, Rolls Royces, and Maybachs then we've ever seen before.  About a block away through a small archway is a quaint area with about a dozen restaurants and pubs.  Our only caution would be that London is the most expensive city on the planet, and with the falling dollar it's more expensive than ever.  $8 beers and $15 hamburgers are not unusual, so bring lots of money.   

Overall, it's a great hotel and we would highly recommend it.

105,Fantastic place to stay,"In this deteriorating world of service, this is quite an oasis. The staff are friendly and efficient, standards throughout the hotel are fantastic, with very obviously well trained staff.
Dispite being busy at breakfast, tea, coffee and toast arrived within 2 to 3 minutes of being ordered. Quality of food was great both in the Bar and Restaurant. Bedrooms are small but everything required is present. Go There!

105,Great place and wonderful service!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights. It is in a great location, very close to great restaurants and pubs (Sheppard’s Market is great), and is in a quiet location. The receptionists were very helpful and had our room ready for an early check in. We asked for an electricity converter and we weren't able to use it (the plastic stood out) so they had maintenance saw it off! Now, that is service!! We requested ice and they also brought that very quickly. They also accomodated us by allowing us to check out late on the day of our departure with no additional charge!

The Chesterfield is a GREAT PLACE and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The staff, location, and service is wonderful.

105,Great Stay in London,"We spent 10 wonderful days at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  All of the staff is friendly and helpful, the concierge desk helped with theater tickets, directions, train schedule to Windsor Castle, etc.  Convenient location with simple access to taxis.  Nice neighborhood.  We were upgraded to the African Suite which was fun.  The piano bar is charming, having afternoon tea is nice and the breakfast is good.  Would highly recommend this hotel.

105,The Chesterfield Hotel - London/Mayfair - Superior Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in room 707. This hotel is magnificent. The front desk and the concierge were extremely courteous and just went out of their way to help us anyway that they could.
The location of this hotel is excellent. Walking distance to Buckinham Palace, Saville Row, Piccadily Circus; just great!
Our room was quite spacious and the cleanliness was wonderful!  Our stay here was truly spectacular.
JUST A TIP:  There is a Pub/Restaurant just up the road called the Red Lion that our concierge referred us to:  Excellent food and delicious ale! Try the John Smith Extra Smooth Ale - A tasty delight!

105,Service complete,"I wrote a review last Feb 21, 2006: ""Great location""
...at the end I was explaining that:
""I've forgot my scarf in the room and asked at the reception to send it back to me. ...actually I'm still waiting..""
Well, after the review I've been contact by the Management of the hotel that confirmed that my scarf was in their lost area section and the week after I've received it back directly at my office in Italy. 

So, thanks again to the good professional service of the hotel (excellent would have been if they would have thought to send it to the laundry before resend back to me..). Thanks also to Tripadvisor as well as
it shown that is more and more an important service and community.

105,"Practically perfect, but not quite.","I'd like to echo most of the sentiments expressed in the general reviewers' love-fest over the Chesterfield Mayfair.  The location was lovely, the food very good, the room itself wonderful.  There were a few service/staff glitches, though, that keep it from getting the highest rating from me.  First, our reservations were messed up.  It was a minor thing, and fixed in a half-hour while we had tea in the lounge.  While in the lounge, however, I was actually sneered at by a staff member for putting milk in my tea.  The guy was quite old and crotchety and couldn't gripe at me to get off his lawn because there wasn't one, so he turned on my tea modification choices.  Whatever, it was funny.  There was also a snafu with our billing, however.  It was easily demonstrated that they were in the wrong, and the correction did not take long, but the staff member who did so was very snotty and more than a little argumentative about it.  In the attitude expressed by a couple staff members, and in the careless errors made in reservations and billing, the experience was not up to snuff for a hotel of this caliber.

105,Fantastic luxurious hotel,"We stayed for a weekend break in March. The hotel is ideally situated, in a quiet side street in the heart of Mayfair and close to Green Park tube station. The room was lovely and contained everything you could need. A phone call to the room 5 minutes after we arrived to check everything was OK in the room was a great touch. We enjoyed a delicious evening meal in the restaurant - they do have the best Dover sole in London as their website says. Breakfast in the hotel is also of the highest quality. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They provide the best service of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble and everything they do is done with a smile. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2006,03,13
105,Valentine Weekend Break,"Wendy and Martin's stay at The Chesterfield Hotel on the weekend of the 10th & 11th February 2006.

This is a very smart hotel, the staff were courteous and helpful. Our room was on the 7th floor next to the lift, and we did consider asking to be moved. (We have a reputation for not always accepting the first room offered!) 

However, there was no sound whatsoever from the corridor/lift our entire stay. The room wasn't huge but had everything it should, the bed was very comfortable and we could open the window. There were tea and cofffee facilities and, when we rang for fresh milk on Saturday morning it was with us within 5 minutes.  On Sunday morning we reckon they were waiting for our call and it was there in 2 minutes! 

The bathroom was small but had an excellent shower.

Breakfasts were very good, with a choice of freshly cooked dishes to order.  There was also a buffet which was regularly checked and refilled, with plenty of fresh fruit on offer.

We didn't have the opportunity to try the restaurant, although we did sample a late lunch in the bar and  this was also very good.

This is a hotel we would certainly stay at again.",4,2006,03,10
105,Fantastic Staff,"The service in this Hotel was second to none.All the staff were helpful,polite and efficient and this with the old fashioned ambience and air of quality about the Hotel made our weekend in London one of the best ever.It's not cheap but all the extra touches,such as a demisting mirror in the bathroom,bath robes,and the attentiveness of the staff made it worth while. The public rooms are beautifully presented with wood panelling and red carnations(the hotel's emblem) and the bedroom was very comfortable.We liked the fact that whilst the juices,cereals etc were self service the main breakfast was waiter served so it was fresh and hot.We also had an evening meal in the restaurant which again was superb.We will certainly be going to The Chesterfield again.

105,Charming Hotel,"My 12 year old son and I spent 3 nights at the Chesterfield over the Presidents' Day Weekend.  Taking the overnight flight from NYC, we arrived in the morning.  While our room was not ready, we went and had a full English breakfast in the restaurant, which came with our room rate.  Breakfast was fine, though some of the cooked breakfast items seems to be pre-made, institutional quality, foodstuffs.  The restaurant staff was very hospitable and helpful, which characterizes the entire Chesterfield staff.  The bedrooms are well appointed;  nice sized, although our bathroom did not have heated marble floors.  The non-smoking rooms were indeed non-smoking;  not non-smoking rooms with ash trays, a uniquely European definition of non-smoking.  The hotel is very well located, on a street which leads to Berkeley Square, admidst a number of embassies.  The real selling point for the hotel is a staff that really goes out of its way to help.

We would stay at this hotel again.

105,A great hideaway in Central London,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for one night when we were in town for a party.  It is tucked away on a guiet road just off Berkley Square within easy walking distance of New Bond Street.  The room was small but incredibly comfortable and well furnished - no faceless chain hotel here.  Everywhere was spotlessly clean and the staff were all very welcoming and friendly.  We ate a snack in the lovely bar which was excellent and well priced for a hotel in this area.  The only downside is the cost of meter parking outside the hotel but this isn't there fault!

We will definitely be staying here again and thoroughly recommend it.  Due to it's peaceful location and quiet ambience I would not suggest it would be great for boisterous children!",5,2006,02,26
105,A disappointing experience,"I stayed at the Chesterfield beginning on Thursday, February 16th, and had originally planned on staying several nights.  I picked this hotel based upon the Tripadvisor reviews.  I obtained an initial rate of 178 pounds for a non-smoking king room.  

I arrived in the morning due to an overseas flight.  The women working the front desk indicated I had originally been assigned Room 426, but it was not ready so she assigned me to Room 319.  Room 319 was on the street side above the bar and rather loud (I am a light sleeper).  I asked to be switched to a quieter room.  The manager working the front desk offered to have Room 426 shown to me, which was nearly ready.

Room 426 was quiter and slightly larger, though it only had a queen bed.  I told the manager this would be acceptable, and he offered it to me for only 30 pounds extra per night!  This would have been fine had it not been the same room I was told at reception was originally assigned to me.  The women working the front desk lied and told the manager she never mentioned the other room to me, and he defended her.  He actually cut me off from speaking, which was very upsetting; even if I had been wrong, this was truly poor customer service. 

It was only after I left the hotel altogether, and had mentioned to the manager I would relay my experience on this website, that he came after me several minutes later in the street and asked what he could do to improve the situation.  I was offered Room 426 at no additional charge.

Unfortunately, the room turned out to be extremely hot, and the thermostat did not help.  I called downstairs, and they adjusted the temperature which wound up making the room extremely cold.  I didn't sleep much as a result.

The next morning, at 7am I checked out and switched to a different hotel, the Renaissance Chancery Court.  Unfortunately, the same women who originally checked me in was at reception.  She never bothered to ask why I was leaving, but at that point I didn't expect it.  The Renaissance was not nearly as convenient as the Chesterfield, but the staff made me feel welcome and the service was consistently high quality.

The Chesterfield has an outstanding location, and the bellman and housekeeping staff were exceptionally friendly.  However, given my experience I would never return.

105,Valentine's escape,"I booked the Valentine package, see their website for details, this includes;

- Red rose
- Card
- Selfridges voucher
- Chocolates
- Bottle of champagne
- Disposable camera
- Valentine dinner
- Midnight feast

Upon entering the staff do their very best to welcome you, after checking-in, reception called to see if the room was OK and asked if we needed anything else.

The room was a little cosy (as expected in London), we had a ""classic double"", everything was very clean, the bathroom in white marble, with a heated floor and mist free mirror. There was plenty of storage space, tea and coffee making facilities, hairdryer, plus everything you'd expect of an expensive London hotel.

Dinner was in their resturatant, again the staff were very attentive, the food was great (from a special set menu).

Didnt have time to try the midnight feast, but it sounded great. The only black mark, was the loss of our breakfast order, it was collected, as a newspaper was on the door in the morning, a quick call to reception fixed it.

Overall a great way to spend valentine's day with your special lady.

105,"Very good Hotel, average restaurant","We stayed in the Chesterfield for a short valentines break and we weren't disappointed.  The standard room was not overly large, but clean and well appointed (although a little chilly to begin with).  A courtesy call from reception after 5 mins was a nice touch.  The hotel was quiet and the staff were very attentive.  One disappointment was the restaurant.  We dined there on our arrival night for convinience and the food was distinctly average, and overpriced (£90+ for two starters, two mains, coffee and a bottle of wine).  The wine list was comprehensive, but again, very pricey even for London.  On this basis we didn't have breakfast throughout our stay, opting for the Pret round the corner.
Overall a well located, clean, attentive hotel let down by an average restaurant.

105,Excellent Hotel!,"Excellent.... !!! The staff in the hotel are just sensational. I can not ever remember having such a welcoming and helpful group of people outside of a Japanese hotel - from the check in staff to the maids and housekeeping people this place is totally customer centric. It is a small boutique hotel with a quite good restaurant and a bar that is open 24/7. The rooms are small, but well appointed. And of course its location in the heart of Mayfair just a quick walk from Picadilly, Bond St, etc is not to be beaten. I will stay at this hotel again without any hesitation.

105,Better than hoped for!!!,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair - and did I make points for picking the hotel!!!  Must admit - I made the reservations after looking at reviews on this site - and this seemed like the best value.  I was on business and actually spent one night here a week prior to my wife's arrival just to make sure the reviews were correct - YES.  We do not understand why it is not rated 5 stars - perhaps it is a bit smaller than typical 5 stars.  We took advantage of their Mayfair Weekend special found on their website - check it out.  Anyway - heated marble floors in the bathroom, wonderfully decorated bedroom, clean up service 2 times a day in the room, wonderful, cozy bar, absolutely WONDERFUL Full English Breakfast (make sure you ask for it to be included in your stay).  The Maitre D in the restaurant could not have been more helpful.  Have them deliver it to your room if you like.  I tried to find a staff member who was not in a good mood - unable to - like a cruise - all in a good mood and helpful.  Location is also GREAT.  Located in a quiet area of Mayfair - highest real estate prices in London.  A few blocks off beaten path - quiet.  Walking distance to New Hyde Park (wish I had my bike there), we walked to two plays.  Discount shopping about a 10 minute walk north (mile long set of shops).  Fell in love with a pub two blocks away (Lion something) - take a left out of the hotel and you run into it.  Pub meals are excellent - and great piano player on Saturday night.  Less than 10 minute walk to the tube - and sightseeing bus stop.  I cannot even begin to explain how this hotel's location is right in the thick of things.  It is about 3 blocks from Princess Di's Hairdresser - Nickie Clark.  Careful - the gym that is included in the hotel (a block away) is closed on weekends.  We really cannot wait to go back - hope they don't raise the prices too much with all this great feedback I've read on this site.  Have FUN!!!

105,Helpful staff and warm atmosphere,"My daughter and I stayed just one night at The Chesterfield and took advantage of the promotion found on the hotel's website that included a full breakfast. The hotel was warm, clean, safe and very British. Breakfast was a huge cold buffet as well as  hot offerings from the kitchen; a real treat. Though not the least expensive room in the city, for about $200, it was, for two of us, worth every penny. Plus we got to leave our bags there the next day while we were out exploring.

105,Cozy Little Joint,"Frankly not much to add to what has already been said. Met up with a good friend in London and decided to stay here. It is a very nice property in a upscale part of London, but aside from the attentiveness of the staff (which isn't a bad thing) there was NO snobbiness. In spite of our being there on a ""drinking weekend"" we got no sideways glances or the like. Mind you we weren't in the room with chainsaws or anything, just a few jars of ale is all.

My only even remotely negative comment is that the hotel is a bit further from theatres, main sites etc. But if you want to be close to Green Park and Hyde Park (morning walk or run - lovely) it is ideal. Best of all - the hotel is a tremendous value compared to others of its ilk. Go Chesterfield!",5,2006,02,02
105,The best hotel I have ever stayed in.,"My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for two nights in January. The hotel is wonderfully located for the West End, for shopping and for the major tourist attractions. It can all be done on foot if you are of average fitness. You see so much more on foot. 

From the moment the door was opened for us to the moment we left, the experience was delightful.

We had a standard room and although not huge, it was beautifully decorated and appointed.

We were not able to experience the delights of the dining room as dining for both nights had been pre-arranged but we will certainly try it next time.

The breakfast was excellent with the full English being prepared to order.

However, the thing which places this hotel at the top of my list is the staff. Every member of staff was friendly and highly efficient. Nothing was too much trouble and the attention to detail was exceptional.

The only slight niggle was the prices in the bar with two gin and tonics costing £15.50.

If you are not sure where to stay in London, try the Chesterfield. You will not be disappointed.",5,2006,01,31
105,Friendly hotel,"Very welcoming, nice quiet rooms, excellent food. Honest; my daughter left a Tiffany necklace in her room and the hotel posted it on to us immediately.

105,As close as possible to perfect !,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for a long weekend in mid-December, 2005. The Chesterfield was a fantastic choice. It is located very close to public transportation, which made getting around very easy. Of course, it is within walking distance of many great cafes, pubs, restaurants, shops, and even one of the cities big, beautiful parks ( the name escapes me  ---  it's the one siutated next to the Ritz ). The food was terrific, and the room, albeit not as large as standard North American hotel rooms, was spotless and beautifully appointed, with lots of storage space. The bathroom lacked nothing. Above all else, the service stands out as truly exceptional. From front desk staff, to restaurant staff, as well as the porters, housekeepers, and room service attendants  ---  everybody was extremely warm and friendly, and eager to help. To sum up  ...  for the reasonable price, location, ammenities, and service, one cannot go wrong with the Chesterfield Mayfair. We'll be back.

105,Loved this hotel!,"Just returned from London where we spent 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  I selected the hotel based on Trip Advisor's reviews and was not disappointed.  The January Winter Rate room special was a great deal (110 pounds a night including a full breakfast).  The rooms were small but very functional including all the american amenities like a hairdryer and ironing board.  The staff was efficient, friendly and very helpful.  I cannot say enough about how great our stay was.  I encourage others to check them out!",5,2006,01,18
105,Loved the Chesterfield,"If you're looking for a central London hotel which offers solitude, first class service & fine food in luxurious surrounding, all at a price which won't combust your credit card, then look no further than The Chesterfield.
With attentive staff at all levels it would be difficult to find a better hotel within this 4 star band. A veritable oasis of tranquility and luxury right in the heart of Mayfair. Walk 100 metres to Berkeley Square and, at the right time of night and if you have an active enough imagination, you may even hear that famous nightingale sing!
Highly recommended by this sixty- something year old traveller & his wife.

105,Lovely hotel in sophisticated Mayfair,"So often I meant to write about the truly exceptional Chesterfield Mayfair. Last August, I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for three nights. As a young woman traveling alone to London on holiday, the Chesterfield made me feel completely valued and safe, the staff always courteous and helpful. The location was simply splendid: in the heart of Mayfair, nestled amid the wealthy townhouses and flats on Charles Street. It was splendid to walk around this neighborhood, sip coffee in Berkeley Square, visit the many posh hotels, stroll up and down Park Lane, and converse with the locals at the Red Lion pub--just up the road from the hotel. And for me, it was terribly exciting as I was walking back in the evening to see an exclusive party just next door at a private residence--then to step into the hotel to overhear a wedding reception in the pavillion. 
I highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair to those who appreciate the finer things in life, and hotels.
",5,2006,01,07
105,The pinnacle of service,"As part of a European business trip for my employer the week of 14 November 2005, I had the good fortune to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel at 35 Charles Street in London. There are many adjectives I could use to try and convey the regal service, the smart accommodations, the excellent food and the knowledgeable and courteous staff - but suffice to say it can be summed up in the word ""pinnacle."" 

Everything about my stay - from the confirmation of my hotel room weeks prior to my arrival, to the moment I departed for the airport to continue my business trip - was without question the best hotel experience I have ever had - and I have had many in my day, thanks in large part to the travel demands placed upon me by my current and former employer.

Please allow me to give just three examples of how my expectations were exceeded. Firstly, on the day of my arrival, I was late in checking in due to a flight delay. Not only was the room held for me, but the busboy took the time to explain all of the features of my comfortable room and made sure that I understood everything to his satisfaction. 

Secondly, that evening, I had arranged to have dinner at the home of a business associate and I didn't want to come empty-handed. The hotel restaurant manager showed me two excellent wines to consider. Needless to say, my hosts were impressed with the high quality of the wine I brought to their home. In fact they could not say enough about it, so impressed they were with the bouquet and how well it complemented the evening meal.

Finally, I was having dinner at the hotel restaurant one evening and was unsure of what kind of steak I should have. The head waiter suggested a particular filet that I had never tried before. When I cut into the tender meat and tasted it for the first time, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. This was truly the best cut of beef I have ever had.

As for the room itself, it is cozy and quiet and yet very functional, facilitating one's relaxation after a long day at the office. 

I closing, I can't say enough about the excellent service of the staff. Every one of them was so gracious and accommodating - quite refreshing in today's ""politically correct"" world. I commend the hotel management and staff for an excellent experience, and I recommend it without any reservations whatsoever.
",5,2005,12,27
105,Gem of a hotel,"The Chesterfield Hotel in Mayfair, London is a gem of a hotel.  The service is first class - you are made to feel very special the minute you walk into the hotel.

Everyone is so welcoming.

Food is excellent. 
Bedrooms are very comfortable and clean.

I would certainly recommend this hotel.
",5,2005,12,15
105,A Good Choice In Central London,"One has to start off with the understanding that when it comes to hotel accommodations, you get far less for your money in London than in most major cities around the world. At least that has been our experience over the past 25 years and after more than 20 visits. Having said that, we chose to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair primarily because of its location. My wife and I stayed at the hotel from November 16th - 19th, 2005 and booked a Superior King room. At the time of our booking, we were provided a complimentary afternoon tea and a complimentary breakfast for each day of our stay. As we found out, these were truly nice benefits as breakfast was about $30 per person per day and the tea with sandwiches, etc. was about $15 per person per day. Upon check-in we were also rewarded with a complimentary upgrade to the Garden Suite...a welcomed surprise! The hotel is small and well located on a side street (Charles) in Mayfair. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are very traditionally British decorated. We were happy that we received an upgrade because the suite was an average sized room with a king size bed and a spacious bathroom. Room decoration was average as well. By London standards the room may be considered a suite, but it would have been considered a regular room in most other cities. Nevertheless, it was adequate for the two of us and we were satisfied with the accommodations.

Food. Breakfast at the hotel was very good with a nice selection of items to choose from. I personally thought that 18 pounds was way too much for the breakfast, but since it was included with our room  we did not have to worry about it. The afternoon tea with small sandwiches, cakes and biscuits was also nice. We did have dinner one night at the main restaurant and found the food to be satisfactory...nothing special, but fine for the price.

Service. The service at the hotel was very good and everyone was very hospitable and eager to help. A very friendly staff overall. 

Location. Excellent. We love the Mayfair area and this was one of the main reasons we chose the Chesterfield Mayfair over others in the Red Carnation chain. It is located on a quite street with little traffic noise to spoil your stay. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Mayfair and is very close to Piccadilly, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, and most of the centrally located attractions. The Green Park underground station is about a 5 to 10 minute walk away. 

Cost. Our Superior King room was $300 per night, but as mentioned we were upgraded to the Garden Suite. We felt that with the inclusion of breakfast and afternoon tea, the price was very good for all we received.

105,Applause all round.,"Visited London, to see a show. Using Trip Advisor, I chose the Chesterfield Mayfair, for its location and atmosphere. The hotel did not disappoint. If anything, it had the air of a grand private home rather than a gentleman's club.  It is situated conveniently for shopping in Mayfair and fifteen minutes pleasant walk to the West End theatres. The staff were welcoming and attentive, without being obsequious or intrusive. My room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom spacious. The shower was not a tepid dribble but especially pleasant and refreshing.  Breakfast was delightful, with a wide choice, to suit virtually every taste.
Needless to say, the Chesterfield Mayfair will be my choice in the future.
",5,2005,11,02
105,Outstanding service - can't wait to return,"I am quite fussy when it comes to Hotel Cleanliness.  This hotel could not have been cleaner - it was absolutely spotless; evry surface was gleaming in the bathroom.  The decor was quite attractive.  The room was a decent smallish size, however two well equiped closets and plenty of drawer space made the room seem spacious, with plenty of room to hang clothes and store luggage.  As for the service, the staff is top notch - polite as can be, and truly concerned with our well-being, from supplying extra towels, to cautioning us that we should take the in-house umbrellas because there was a good chance of rain.  The location was ideal and quiet, but the outstanding level of service was something I will not forget -- the most expensive hotels in the States could learn a thing or two about service from this hotel.  I hope to be able to stay again someday.",5,2005,11,02
105,Service With A Smile,"October 22-24, had a great time in London.  I've stayed in much larger rooms and had much bigger bathrooms, however, the great staff makes the difference nominal.  They bend over backwards to make you happy.  If you stay at the Chesterfield, ask for Chris, he was wonderful.
",4,2005,10,27
105,Location and value - the best choice in heart of London,"I am a business traveler and I must say I finally found a perfect London hotel with great location - in the most convenient Mayfair area, near the Green Park.  It is a brisk 5 minutes walk to the tube station, and close to the popular shopping, businesses, theatres, museums and restaurants.  And great value - I booked a ""business traveler's room"" online inclusive of the full English breakfast, the selection was plentiful and sumptious(for only 10 sterlings extra).   The room is in fine condition; it is well appointed and tastefully done, high speed internet connection, basic office supplies in the drawer, and comfortable beddings.  The public areas are beautifully decorated and maintained.  I found the hotel staff are very attentive, courteous and helpful.  You have to pay a whole lot more to stay in hotels in London with similar location and quality.  I would certainly recommend it to both business travelers as well as leisure travelers.
",5,2005,10,26
105,Unbelievable Customer Service,"Just returned from London where we spent 6 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair in London.  This hotel in part of a group called Red Carnation Hotels.  The room was beautiful.  The service was incredible.  The food outstanding.  We have stayed in very nice hotels all over the world...but I have never experienced service like this.  All of the staff treat you like you are the only guests in the hotel.

I would be very surprised to ever read a bad review of this hotel.
",5,2005,10,24
105,Wonderful weekend,"Just returned from a great weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair, it was our anniversary and I had high hopes for this hotel based upon the reviews on this site. I have to say that it met and exceeded all of my expectations. From the staff, to the rooms, the restaurant and bar everything was first class and contributed to a wonderful weekend all round. The staff were very friendly and no request was too much trouble. The hotel was in a great location and I wished I had not paid for my undergrounds tickets in advance as we were able to walk to just about everywhere we needed to go. We will definately return.
",5,2005,10,18
105,Perfect,"The experience of staying at this hotel was perfect from start to finish.  There were 8 of us on a weekend break.  We were able to leave our luggage in the morning and some of us were even able to check into our rooms.  On our return, after serious shopping, we relaxed in a very comfortable bar (the drinks were expensive but then all London hotels are the same).  Our luggage was in our rooms, which had everything you needed.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  We were able to leave our luggage after check out and collect it just before the journey home - you were made to feel totally relaxed.  The hotel was of the high standard you expect of a 4 star hotel and any request (however small) was accommodated.  Excellent and well worth recommending.  We will certainly stay there again in the future.
",5,2005,10,07
105,Comfortable and Classy,"We stayed for several nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair,which is located in a charming and convenient section of London. The staff was helpful but not intrusive, the beds were comfortable, bathrooms pristine and well-functioning. The luxuriously decorated rooms were a bit small, and might begin to feel cramped after an extended stay, or if one needed to spend a fair amount of time in the room, but this should not be an issue for the average tourist; it was not an issue for us. The public areas were also very upscale. Ask for special offers when making a reservation; there may be discounts or packages available.
",5,2005,09,28
105,First Rate Experience,"We have just returned from our trip to London, and are very pleased to have chosen the Chesterfield. We arrived on foot with our bags and were immediatley greeted and our bags taken from us. The reception staff were excellent and the porters / concierge couldn't be more helpful and friendly. We had booked a standard double room @ £139 but the room allocated was at the back of the hotel, overlooking the air conditioning units etc. and it was on the small size so I asked reception if they had anything larger. We were shown two options - a king size and a mini suite - we chose the mini suite and negotiated a supplement of £45 which worked out to a very good rate - and they included breakfast as token gesture. This was all dealt with in a very professional manner. The bar has a 'gentlemans club' feel about it and there is a pianist in the evenings - again service from the bar staff is very good and prices reasonable considering it is a Mayfair location. There is a wide choice at breakfast although @ £18 this is marked up considerably. The overall experience was superb and we only wish our stay was longer.
",5,2005,09,27
105,Look forward to staying again.,"We stayed Aug 13-17 and had a wonderful experience. The hotel's location could not have been better, if you are a walker you can get most everywhere on foot. The out of the way places can be got to by tube nearby. The service was unusually warm and helpful, very genuine and friendly. After the shock of seeing our incredibly tiny room we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the bathroom. The air conditioned room came in handy and we got used to the size, we were hardly there anyway. Freshly stocked with plenty of towels daily and nice amenities. Beware, there is a wedding or party hall right next door to the hotel and the loud music can last until the wee hours. Ask for a room at the front of the hotel, or on the side where the side street is, it might be quieter. We came to really love our end of the day nightcap ritual at the cozy bar in the lobby, more excellent service to be had here.
",4,2005,09,26
105,superb service,"I have just returned from an excellent two nights at The Chesterfield.
 The hotel is located on a quiet street near Berekely Square. It  took us 8 minutes to walk there from Green Park tube station.

My wife and I were thrilled with the hospitality and cordial atmosphere. The check-in was super quick and the concierge extremely friendly and helpful.

Our room was wonderful and the walls appeared to be covered in a soft duvet like material that we presumed enhanced the sound insulation. There was an abundance of toiletries and fresh towels along with his and hers luxury bathrobes. 
During both nights we could not hear anyone else. It was though we were the only ones staying at the hotel! The room had internet connection. The bathroom had underfloor heating and the electronic A/C was surprisingly quiet.
 The service at Breakfast was fast and faultless and never rushed , even on the weekend mornings the restaurant was calm with plenty of spaces for last minute arrivals. . The buffet breakfast was varied and fresh and the fry ups remarkably light.
 All in all I wont be trekking through endless reviews for London hotels anymore. When in London, its got to be the Chesterfield.
",5,2005,09,21
105,Great hotel,"We just got back from holiday in London at the Chesterfield Mayfair. A wonderful hotel. It is about three or four blocks from the Green Park tube station. There is internet service at the hotel; however, thinking it was probably too costly, we opted for the Fed Ex/Kinkos store around the corner which is open 24/7 and has several computers. Berkeley Square, a nice small green park, is about one block away. Many nice restaurants and little cafés within a two-three block radius. One of the major tour bus operators (The Big Bus or something like that) is right across the street from the tube. 

Perfect location.

Hotel room was perfect with fresh towels constantly and big, thick robes. Never heard any of the other patrons.

Would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2005,09,16
105,Mixed Review for the Chesterfield,"I'm afraid that the reviews on this site might have unrealistically raised my expectations.  I stayed for five nights  and had a decidedly mixed experience:

Location: Nice, fairly central to many things.  Not immediately near the underground.

Accomodations: The first room they gave me was very tiny, right next to the elevator and the only view was of the cooling system.  When I asked to move, they were kind enough to upgrade me to a much larger ""theme"" room on a higher floor, toward the back of the hotel.

The room itself was clean, but a bit worn (carpet, bedding, upholstery).  My floorboards creaked terribly, and in turn, I could hear (loudly) every footstep in the room above me.   

Service: Most of the staff was remarkably friendly, efficient and warm.  The concierge who was there for the beginning of my stay was very patient and informative.  However, the concierge who was there for the remainder of my stay gave the distinct impression that he would prefer to be left alone and responded to questions with only cursory answers.

Restaurant: The food was fairly average and breakfast is quite expensive, but the service was very good.

105,Wonderful!,"We stayed at the Chesterfield for 6 nights in July with 2 children, 2 adults and 2 grandparents.  Everyone loved it.  The staff was so friendly. They bent over backwards to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  The rooms are somewhat small compared to American hotels but very average for a European hotel.  The breakfast is delicious and offers something for everyone.  It's location is within walking distance of the Greenpark tube stop and Buckingham Palace.  We would stay here every time!
",5,2005,09,10
105,Good Value,"Excellent value for money. We booked a single room for a relative for £99 through a website and later upgraded it to a double for us as our relative cancelled. The first time we phoned we were quoted £50 to upgrade to a double but I called back an hour later, spoke to someone else who offered the upgrade for £20. Hotel bill was incorrect and they overcharged us by £200. However, this was a genuine mistake we think and we thought the hotel was actually very good with the rooms furnished to a very high standard. Recommended
",5,2005,09,07
105,The best we have stayed in.,"My husband and I stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair for the second time in August, nothing is too  much bother, the suite was first class and it is within walking distance for the theatres, Buckingham Palace and lots of other tourist spots. The staff are friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant which was very good. We would not stay anywhere else but here.
",5,2005,09,03
105,Fantastic Hotel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a gem of a hotel in a city of bad hotels.  The rooms are tastefully furnished and the staff couldn't be more helpful if they tried (and try they will!).
 
It is London so the rooms are not big but they are spotlessly clean and the marble bathrooms are stunning.  Breakfast is amazing but make sure that it is included in your room price as it is very pricey (£18.50) otherwise.

Being only a 15 minute walk from Picadilly Circus, the hotel is perfectly located for getting to the West End and very handy for shopping trips as well.

I found that by phoning the hotel direct I could get a better rate than any web site could offer and they threw in breakfast as well.",5,2005,08,24
105,Delightful Experience Altogether,"My daughters and I stayed at the Chesterfield in late July for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it.  As others have noted, the location is wonderful and all the staff consistently courteous and helpful.  We ate in the restaurant twice - it was certainly the best hotel food I've had in London, with excellent service.  The girls' twin room was pleasant, if just a tad 'cosy' for 2 people, while my double room was extremely comfortable, spacious and well-appointed, with a large bathrooom;  both rooms were cleaned meticulously and turned down each evening.  We got an online rate of £117.75 plus VAT per room (not including breakfast) which I felt wasn't too expensive, given the superb location and great service.  All in all it was a delightful stay and I would not hesitate to stay there again or to recommend it to others.
",5,2005,08,21
105,wonderful hotel,"We loved our stay at the chesterfield in late July 2005. Thoughtful concierge helped plan a theater trip , including dinner. rooms were decent sized and nicely equipped. Lovely breakfast with nice staff (included in our rate). good location a few blocks from tube and buses.the street itslef was quiet, but there were restaurants nearby in Shepherd market (many of them open sunday night, which we did not find in other nearby neighborhoods).
We would stay there again in a moment.

105,Chesterfield Mayfair - Outstanding Choice,"Fm shopping around, London Chesterfield Mayfair was best value, so we booked and held our breath.  They exceeded expectations on everything (note - we knew going in that rooms would be relatively small and London food cost would be outrageous).  Outstanding visit.  Stayed for entire week with wife and a 21 and 18 year old.  Two rooms.  Can't emphasize enough how important location was.  Could easily get to most anything.  Staff was consistently courteous, helpful and responsive.  July terrorist incidents became a distant memory.  Will definitely stay here again upon return to London.

105,"No request is too small, no detail overlooked","We stayed at the chesterfield based on the reviews from this site. Its not the cheapest place to stay in, but is by far the best hotel i've stayed in. The room was superb,quiet,well furnished (Queen sized bed, desk, comfy chairs) and a nice size for London. Bathroom had good water pressure, and the hotel provides superb bathrobes. The location of the hotel is superb, with Picadilly Circus only a 15 minute walk away. But the main reason to stay is the service. I've stayed in good hotels before, but the service at the Chesterfield beats all. From the moment you walk in your treated as an individual, and not just a customer. The staff are gracious, extremely helpfull and always there to help you. The bellhops even remember your name! I would not hesitate to stay there again.

105,GREAT HOTEL,"Stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel during August, for 5 nights.  The hotel was very clean and a good sized room.  Great location, near to most shops and attractions.  A very quiet location, could not hear anything during night time, which is great for being in london!  Staff were pleasant too.  The only thing i would change was the size of the bathroom - very small!  However, it had everything you would need and a nice sized bath.  The only other thing was that the pillows were feathers (just my personal preference that i don't like them) and that the TV played up a couple of times.  However, this would not put me off staying at this great hotel, we will certainly go back to this hotel.  Great hotel!!!

105,A Gem of a Hotel!,"My daughter and I stayed for 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair.  All in all, we had a fantastic experience.  The hotel is charming, clean, comfortable and in an excellent location.  Best of all is the staff that work there.  Everyone was not only so nice but also very helpful in any way he or she could be.  I would not think twice about staying any where else when I return to London.

105,Fabulous!,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for five nights. Their website says they pay attention to detail, and they are not kidding!

The room was one of the most beautiful I have ever stayed in. Truly luxurious. Plenty of space, large comfy bed, immaculate cleaning, new or at least very well maintained furnishings, linens, three phones, huge closets, lovely decor. I was there during the heatwave, and the A/C worked perfectly.

I ate in the restaurant four different times, the service was excellent, and the food delicious.

Lovely piano bar, with great drinks, and friendly service.

The location of the hotel is about as central as you can get.

I have nothing at all that I can complain about, and I will be back on my next trip to London. This hotel is about as close to the Ritz or the Dorchester as you can get without actually staying at those hotels!

Yes, it is expensive but you get what you pay for.",5,2005,08,12
105,"Great Hotel. Great Location, Great Staff","Our family of four stayed five nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair and we were very satisfied with our experience. The hotel is situated in a perfect location for sightseeing. Very close to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly. Mayfair is a charming area of London with many great restaurants and pubs within close proximity to this hotel. We were able to take long walks in the early evening and felt perfectly safe. The staff was particularly attentive and eager to offer assistance with restaurant recommendations and other tips. It is expensive, (particularly since we occupied two rooms) but compared to other London hotels I felt that it offered strong value. The restaurants and bar are pricey, but there are many additional dining options available very close by and the staff is eager to steer you in the right direction.
",5,2005,08,09
105,"Great Hotel, excellent location","I had the pleasure of staying the one night at the Chesterfield and wished it had been longer.
Check in was easy and within 10 minutes of being in the room the receptionist rung to ask if all was well with the room. The room was larger than I expected for a single with a large lit wardrobe. The shower room was roomy with plenty of space for all girlie items.
The area around is full of cafes, bars resturants incuding a Tesco, Express and Sainsburys central all within 5 minutes walk of the Hotel.
The bar was intimate and had a lovely piano player, the drinks a little expensive but this is central London and having said that the drink came with a plate of crudites, dip, queen olives and mixed nuts, enough that I could not contemplate dinner!! The lass serving was courteous, chatty and  initiated a move from some cigar smokers to another part of the bar.
On return to the room the bed had been turned back, blind pulled down, tv turned towards the bed, the remote control, tv programme mag and room service menu had been left on the bed with a couple of pieces of fudge.
I did not sample breakfast so cannot comment on the food.
No problem with checkout.
All in all a very good experience and one I hope will enjoy again on my next trip to London

105,A Hotel with Character,"The Chesterfield has a wonderful location in London; near the shoppes, excellent restaurants, public transport.

The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms bright and full of character. We stayed in a theme suite called the 'Music Room'; a room unlike any you have ever stayed in before. But that is the Chesterfield! 

July was terribly hot in London and we were happy to find excellet air conditioning.

The bar was delightful with an excellent pianist playing favourites long into the night.

The location of Mayfair is one of the best in London, clean and safe.

An excellent bet when when staying in London. We would definitely go back to the Chestefield!

105,Not worth the price !,"Booked two deluxe double rooms for the 23rd & 24th July. Both rooms were on the 3rd floor & were of the same design throughout - very masculine 'chav' type fabric wall covering with matching bedding. Bedrooms were OK size wise but bathrooms had over-bath showers & were very tiny. I used LondonTown (who were very helpful) when searching for luxury accomodation in London & was offered a 'special' price of £134 (excl. VAT) per night, per room - which was probably a fair price for this type of accomodation in Mayfair but I don't think they should charge more. Sadly this price did not include breakfast. If you do decide on this hotel & your booking does not include breakfast, I would suggest that you go down at about 7.30am & stay until they shut & make the most of your very lovely but expensive (£18.50) english breakfast. Bar is vastly overprised - 1 measure of Baileys cost over £6 !!! On the whole it was very nice, very clean but there are better hotels in London.",4,2005,07,28
105,Great hotel,"I was happy with my choice to stay here I made it.  After traveling all around London to look at other hotels I considered, I was even happier.  I would go back there again, and recommend it to anyone I know.  I found out about it from reviews on this website.  A thank you to all that psoted your reviews.

105,Loved the Chesterfield,"I had the good fortune to stay At the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in February with my daughter. The rooms were a nice size and very well maintained. It was convenient to have a restaurant located in the hotel and the food and service were excellant. The staff were very accomodating, making dinner reservations, giving directions and booking tours, always in a very pleasant manner.  The location in Mayfair was great, we were close to the tube when we chose not to walk. If I have the opportunity to return to London I would definetly stay there again.

105,perfectly situated for a relaxing city break,"We booked a theatre break over the internet and chose this hotel for its position,within walking distance of the theatre,close to the many sights of London,and not far from Victoria station;as we had flown down from Manchester and took the Gatwick express train.We stayed for two nights.
On arrival,we were immediately impressed with the attractive hotel lobby and the enthusiastic reception of the staff ,and discovered that we'd got a complimentary upgrade to one of their burberry king rooms, which whilst being fairly small was beautifully decorated with a very comfortable bed and pleasant marble bathroom with fluffy bathrobes/towels.
The hotel was on a very quiet corner of Mayfair but within a couple of streets you joined the hustle and bustle of the city;so you could return to your quiet oasis after a hectic day doing the tourist trail!
We only took breakfast in the hotel which was very good,lots of choice and lots of fresh fruit which we love;so we are unable to comment on any other meals,however the menu looked varied and reasonably priced.We like to experience the local restaurants and would recommend the small Italian bistro,around the corner from the hotel, just down from the Tesco express.
We really enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield and would certainly stay here again,and recommend to family and friends.You always get the occassional niggle wherever you stay and really most aren't worth mentioning so we won't.Any break away is what you make it, so for the people who have made negative comments about this hotel, you must be very hard to please,I suggest you stay at home!

105,London accommodations at its best,"This beautiful and well maintained hotel has comfortable rooms, impeccable public areas, and even gives you a choice of complimentary red or green apples in large silver bowls in the lobby! There is also a decanter of sherry for guests use also in the lobby. 

The hotel is situated on a quiet street in beautiful Mayfair. When you are in your room, there is no sense that you are in a bustling and crowded city. Our room was located facing a beautiful quiet Georgian courtyard. 

Small restaurants are nearby in Shepherd's Market. 
Weekend rates were found on internet sources linked to this site.

105,Outstanding Hotel,"After much research we picked this hotel because of consistently high reviews from multiple sources--we were not disappointed. The rooms were a good size and very well appointed with beautiful marble bathrooms. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The location is great--just a 5 minute walk from the Green Park tube, central to attractions and shopping, and there are 25 pubs and restaurants within a 2 minute walk. I would recommend a room away from the street, as street noise can be a problem, just as in most city hotels. It is well priced and an excellent value. It will be our first choice for a return stay.

105,traditional english hotel,"My husband and I recently returned from our third trip to london having had a fabulous time.  We stayed a the Chesterfield Mayfair, a lovely small (100 rooms) very english style hotel. It is ideally located within walking distance to many of the most popular tourist attraction and SHOPPING. The public rooms are very comfortable and homey, like staying at the home of a good friend. The rooms are small by american standards but the space is very well utilized and the beds are VERY comfortable. The bathrooms likewise are small and the tub/shower we found a little difficult (a high step up into shower which was tight) but they do offer theme, junior and executive suites which we are seriously considering for our next trip.  We had dinner in the restaurant twice and room service for breakfast each day and both were delicious.  The staff are very attentive without being intrusive and I truely felt like the queen of england in a very short period of time.  All in all we had a lovely time, with the Chesterfield our home base exploring a truely wonderful city.  Marge P.

105,A London Gem,"June 2005.
Reviewer: Martin from Isle of Man
I have stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair London on previous occasions for business and have always found it first rate both in terms of service and location. 
My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in London mainly for the Chelsea flower show. Everything about the hotel was first rate from arrival to departure. Service was way above to what one tends to find as the norm for central city hotels. 
The location so close (walking distance) to Buckingham Palace and Green Park Tube station makes it a very central point for easy access anywhere. Harrods/Piccadily & Oxford Circus/Trafalgar Square all just one or two stops away. 
We would certainly return at any time and will happily be able to pursuade friends and family to stay there.
",5,2005,06,03
105,Treated Like Royalty,"The Chesterfield is synonymous with excellent service and royal elegance.  My girlfriend and I stayed here during the May bank holiday weekend.  We took the advice from previous travelers and opted for one of their suites.  The room was charming and spacious.  During our stay we ate dinner in the restaurant, but would probably venture out on a future return to London.  The staff at the Chesterfield were very courteous, catering to our every need.  The hotel is located just a few steps off of the beaten path, which we welcomed.  Car traffic and pedestrian noise was negligible.  The hotel is located near many luxury shops, but you wouldn't know it unless you decided to stroll on the many side streets in Mayfair.  If you're looking to experience London at its best, make the Chesterfield your home away from home.
",5,2005,05,31
105,My favorite hotel in the world!,"I love the Chesterfield. I can't wait to return. The rooms are beautiful and luxurious, the service is impeccable, and the decor is just beautiful. 

We stayed in a king superior room. It was very very lovely, only thing is if you stay in the king rooms they are more designed for business travellers. I would stay in a double or if you can afford it, the themed junior suites. I had the privilege of seeing the Music Room suite which is absolutely intoxicating. (Canopy bed, iron clawed jacuzzi tub, beautiful!) But the rooms are very nice with great beds, complimentary bottled water, bathrobes and slippers and big tubs in the bathrooms with Gilchrist and Soames soaps etc. Plus a newspaper of your choice is left outside your door in the mornings. 

Our rate was £147 including VAT and breakfast. Please note I got the rate by calling the hotel directly as the rates when you call are significantly cheaper than the rates on the website and the earlier you call the cheaper it is. 

The location of the Chesterfield can't be beat. It is around the corner from Hyde Park and Green Park and St. James Park. There is a little alcove of restaurants just around the bend on Curzon Street (including the absolutely delicious french bistro Le Boudin Blanc which I highly recommend). The nearest metro stop is Green Park on the Picadilly and Victoria line. 

The hotel concierge are lovely and everyone in the hotel will help you with anything you need. Their motto is ""no detail too small"" and they lived up to that. They will even drive you places in the hotel's Bentley (costs a bit but how glamorous!). 

We went to the hotel for a relaxing weekend and that's exactly what we got. Loved every minute of our stay at the Chesterfield. It was perfect.
",5,2005,05,22
105,Always a Warm welcoming at the Chesterfield,"As a frequesnt business traveller, a hotel often becomes just a bed for the night and no longer feels special. 

I have stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair 4 or 5 times now and it has not yet failed to impress. Every time there is another little suprise which just makes the stay worth while. No request is ever too much trouble and the service really is second to none.

The staff are always pleased to see you and very welcoming. A good example of a typical experience at the Chesterfield is my last trip to London in May. It startarted with a delayed flight, a cancelled Victoria Express and then a mile long que for a cab, I arrived at the hotel in a foul mood at 1'o'clock in the morning! I was welcomed with sympathy and offered refreshments, while my bags were taken to my room. After a short wind down I went up to my room to discover that I had been upgraded to a superior suite and was able to take full advantage of the most fabulous bath I have ever had the pleasure of in London. So fed, watered and now bathed I went to bed and enjoyed a most superb nights sleep. With a full itinery the following day, I really needed it.

I not only highly recommend the Chesterfield as a business traveller, its location for a holiday to London makes it ideal. You are close to the shops of Oxford Street, Knightsbridge and the Kings Road Chelsea. The sights of Buckingham Palace and Westminster are also a stones throw away. If the theatre is your thing then you are also close to all the major productions and as for galleries are concerned you are spoilt for choice with the larger commercial galleries like the Tate and the National as well as lots of smaller independents showing less commercial works! 

Perfect.

105,Great Little Hotel in Mayfair,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair over the Bank Holiday weekend in early May, and had a delightful stay.  The staff were very friendly and outgoing, but thoroughly professional.  We had a bit of a problem with the rate, as their internet site said breakfast was included, but at check-in the staff said it wasn't.  Make sure you print out your rate and what's included and bring it with you.  

The rooms are a bit on the small side, but are very nicely decorated, and quite sumptuous.  The bathroom was wonderful, with marble tiled walls and a heated floor.  The mirror had a nifty anti-fogging device which was very effective.  The breakfast was superb.

It's our favorite hotel in London, and have stayed there many times.

105,Nice small hotel,"Anyone staying in downtown London can find a nice place to stay at the Chersterfield Mayfair hotel.  It's right down the street from Green Park and with in easy walking distance to the Ritz and other attractions.  We found this place through a local recommendation, when our initial choices were sold out.  The prices in London are a killer ($100 = 46 pounds) which the hotel came in at $350 USD but was cheaper than some of our other choices.
",4,2005,05,02
105,Truly an outstanding experience,"We stayed at the Chesterfield Mafair from April 22-28. I can not say enough about this wonderful property. The experience was a true delight. The rooms were adequate, the bathroom perfect, the breakfast outstanding and the service absolutely perfect. The staff bent over backwards to make our stay as pleasant as possible, from serving us a room service breakfast at 5 AM one morning to booking dinner reservations, nothing was too much. It was the quietest hotel we ever stayed out--we felt we were the only ones there eventhough it was close to sold out. I would not ever consider staying anywhere else when I am in London again.
",5,2005,04,29
105,"Not Mayfair, Maywonderful","We stayed at Chesterfield Mayfair for our second visit during the third week of April, 2005. This is a professional and well run facility. From the quiet location in the middle of Mayfair, a block from Berkley Square, to the polite and helpful staff, to the nicely appointed rooms we can not imagine a better place to stay in London. Yes the rooms are small, and yes the shower could be improved, but there is nothing else that is negative to mention. Our stay included breakfast and the food was good and the choices excellent. If you are looking for a place to stay in London we strongly recommend the Chesterfield.

105,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"Stayed for two nights in mid March and I really could not find any fault with the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff were very polite, helpful and attentive. They genuinely seemed to care that we were happy with the hotel and the service provided.
The room was nice, clean and big enough for the two of us. The bathroom was clean and comfortable and everything worked. The maid provides an early evening turn-down service (with little chocolates on the pillow) which I personally could do without but it is there if you like that kind of thing.
We had dinner in the hotel on the Friday night and whilst the restaurant was very quiet we still enjoyed a wonderful dining experience. Again the staff were friendly and helpful but without being intrusive. The quality of the food and wine was first class. The breakfast the following morning was equally impressive.
The location is also excellent. Hyde Park is within easy walking distance as are numerous pubs and cafes. There is a useful little Marks & Spencer at Green Park Tube station and there are some more lively pubs and wine bars on Park Lane. We are already planning our next stay at the hotel.
",5,2005,04,01
105,Charming and Clean,"Stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair 2/28-3/4 and was very pleased with the charm, cleanliness and friendly atmosphere created by the staff - particularly the front desk.  We did have a little problem with the heat there but they were very accommodating and gave us the option to change rooms or use a space heater (which we choose and it was fine).  Location is convenient with taxis always available in front if needed.  Dinner was very good in the restaurant.  We booked taxi fare from Heathrow to Chesterfield through hotel and it was quite pricey.  We did better booking a taxi on our own on the return home.  Would definitely stay there again.
",4,2005,03,24
105,Fantastic beds,"Stayed at the Chesterfield the week before Christmas. Was greeted by a lovely chap who came to the taxi to take the cases. Reception area very cosy, beautiful tree and lovely reception staff. We were taken to our room by a nice man who explained the times for afternoon tea, his accent was a little more than cut glass and we managed not to giggle until he had left our room to collect the cases. The room was beautiful, a little small but very comfortable. The bathroom is very clean and modern with super little toiletries, the real bonus of it is a heated floor in the night so you don't have to worry about putting on the sweet little slippers they provide. The dressing gowns were thick and snuggly and the bed a large king size I think. (fantastic pillows!)There are tea and coffee making facilities on a tray. 
We went out to dinner that evening and when we returned our bed had been turned down, the lights dimmed, a television guide placed on the bed at the correct date with the remote control and the television turned to face the bed. All of this plus the chocolates on the pillow were so inviting that we got into our lovely gowns, drank coffee and ate our choccy as though we were at home! So romantic. Our room overlooked a square so was very quiet too despite being a Saturday night.
The position of the hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from the Fortnums and the Burlington Arcade and some great restaurants. The only thing that was a let down was the breakfast, whilst ample most dissappointing. The cooked breakfast was luke warm and the coffee stewed, but we had such a brilliant sleep nothing could have spoilt the day. I will definately be going there again this year

105,The Best I have stayed at.,"I have stayed at numerous hotels in London, many in the five star rating and the Chesterfield certainly lives up to them regarding comfort, facilities etc. But what really sets this hotel apart from the others is the quality of their service. This of course only relates to the effectiveness and commitment of the staff which is excellent. I will only be staying at this hotel in the future

The rooms are cosy and well furnished and the restaurant offers excellent food accompanied by the same efficient and friendly service.
Definitely a hotel to be recommended!

105,Found a jewel,"The Chesterfield Mayfair combines courtesy, quality and comfort in a unique blend of hospitality which made us feel extra special.
We would have to go a long way to better the traditional values and atmosphere of the Chesterfield.
Now, it is the only place we would think of when staying in London.",5,2005,03,02
105,Jewel in the London Crown,"Quite and genteel, snuggled away from the bustle yet within a few minutes walk of it if you need it, the Chesterfield in Mayfair provides a high quality service for those who don t mind spending a bit above average. The service was outstanding; the rooms, well decorated but small; for London, though, you couldn t expect much more in size without doubling the size of your purse. Being able to walk a couple of minutes to excellent restaurants and ten minutes to the theatre, and then return to the serenity of the Chesterfield, made our London weekend memorable.

105,Lved the great british feel to this hotel,"My son was going to college in London and we wanted an upscale British hotel to stay in while we visited. This fit our goals to a tee. Rooms were clean and well appointed. The bar with piano player made our evening after sight seeing seem very special. This hotel will remind you of a private club of which you would be proud to be a member. As my daughter will also be going to college in london we look forward to a return visit.
",5,2005,02,18
105,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Stayed in the Chesterfield at the weekend, from jan 13-16th.  It was beyond my expectations.  Met by friendly doormen, booked in by a very friendly young american gentleman who arranged for our luggage to be stored until the room was ready as we were early.  Everything was beyond expectations. The only difference i would say is that a four star hotel in N.Ireland might have larger rooms with slightly better furnishings, however what we did have was perfectly fine.  We were told on arrival we had been upgraded!  Fantastic!  free of charge!

The room was immaculatly clean and tidy with pre packaged slippers and dressing gowns also provided.  Room service was brilliantly fast and not too pricey.  Drinks were a bit pricey tho, a pint of coke worked out at £6.60, however there is a tesco express within walking distance.  What i would say is book online for this hotel the deals are much better!  The breakfast was brilliant, a selection of buffet continential and a cooked english breakfast.  WITH crispy bacon!! something i thought didnt exist in english hotels!!  (well in my past experience it hasnt).  We were most pleasantly surprised when we came in from our days sightseeing to find the bed was turned down, chocolates on the pillows and the telly page open with remote control all laid out for us.  The ladies and gents who do the room servicing really do a brilliant job.  ALL the staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough to make our stay perfect.

The area was nice, not too noisy for central london.  The only thing was that because our trip was mainly for sight seeing we felt a bit out of place in our jeans in the bar.  It seemed to attract a rather smarter attire.  

I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to any visitors.  The area is great, full of little coffee bars, juice bars and restuarants.  Close to Green Park tube and main bus routes.  And just accross the park from Buck Palace!  

We couldnt have asked for more!

105,Couldn't be better,"My sister and I have just returned from a one night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, to celebrate our mother's 80th birthday with a trip to see Mary Poppins and over nightstay in London. We arrived at the hotel to be given a triple room as booked on the net, however the double bed and camp bed was not quite what we had expected. We were then moved to a suite - had to pay more but it was worth it. TV in all rooms - Corner bath, power shower & even our own Christmas tree in the lounge.
We asked for  an early tea as we had to pick up our theatre tickets an hour before the show, the staff were very accomodating , we selected our meals whilst getting ready, so the food was ready promptly @ 5.30 . Food & service was excellent and to top it all a surprise birthday cake for my mum courtesy of the management. Breakfast was the best I have had in a long time, great selection, good quality and again very helpful efficient staff.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the extra little touches and attention to detail added so much to the trip, it was meant to be a memorable occasion for my mother and the Chesterfield certainly made it so. 
All the staff from the housemaids, to the concierge and restaurant managers were all very helpful. I will certainly go back there again and recommend it to my friends.",5,2004,12,31
105,the way it ought to be!,"Spend Christmas weekend there in 2004 -- and we loved it.  Every staff member we encountered -- from housekeeping to head concierge to front desk and maintenance was differential, courteous and treated us like guests indeed.  The hotel itself is lovely.  It is tucked in a sweet Mayfair neighbourhood, yet handy for shopping, tube, and parks.  We felt lucky to be there.  We had booked a special Magical London Christmas package  -- which included several special items like a complementary tea service, a taxi to Trafalgar Square, free gift wrapping service, and the marketing folks must not have told the actual front line staff very much about it.  We had a few awkward moments when we had to ask about the services or explain that they ‘were included’ with our package.  The staff was on the ball when we explained this, but it felt as if they could have been better informed of procedure on the package.  

We have stayed in many hotels in London – both high-end and moderate and consider the Chesterfield Mayfair at the top.  Overall – we really appreciated the special touches such as complementary a.m. newspaper, turn down service, full breakfast, robes and slippers, in a very beautifully kept hotel with attentive and considerate staff.",5,2004,12,27
105,"Stayed here several times, loved all but the last.","The location is great.  Shepards place behind the hotel is a wonderful square to find food and fun.  The Red Lion just up the street to the left is a classic london pub with fun, easy people.  The hotel, small but charming, is on it self, very nice.  Breakfast is included and always fresh.  

I travel on business and always reserve a room for the night prior to my arrival so I can put my head down for a few hours prior to the work day after a long flight from Boston.  I arrived as I always do around 8:30 AM to check in.  I was told I did not reserve a room for the night and that I would have to wait until the afternoon.  I showed them my reservation and they said ""that's not what we see"", basically calling me a lier.  When I asked for the manager she quickly found me a room.  While I love the location, I've book other places for my past several trips.  I would stay there again, but they gave me reason to explore.",4,2004,11,05

105,"Great Hotel, HOME FROM HOME","My partner & I  only live about 25 miles from london but every now and again try and spend a weekend away from home to go see the sights and take in a show and get some time out from everyday things. We love staying at the Chesterfield and now we have found this lovely quaint hotel we would not stay anywhere else. We have stayed in a suite (over valentines weekend) and my partner arranged the seduction package for me. It included rose petals on the bed, champagne on ice and chocolate dipped strawberries and also a selection of lovely gifts all arranged nicely on the bed. The suite was great and did have a minibar, the bathroom had a TV/radio and a spa bath. When we have stayed since then we have had a deluxe double room, although they are very nice if it is a special occasion I will definatly book a suite again. We found the food in the piano bar to be very good but the breakfast was just ok. Breakfast is much better if you go down to the resturant in the morning and don't order it via room service. We found the front desk staff to be very friendly and helpful, the bellboys are great and my favorite member of staff has to be Chris, he is so helpful and friendly nothing is a problem and he makes you feel very special throughout your stay. The staff in the piano bar are not so special you feel as if they are doing you a favour whenever you order things and many times when you are waiting to be served they just vanish which can be a bit frustrating. This would not ever put me off staying at this fantastic hotel but I just think they need to relook at these staff members. This hotel is very relaxing, very english and in no way stuffy. We have stayed at the Four seasons in the past which my partner loved but I found it very informal and very stuffy so i'm very glad that we found the Chesterfield and am looking forward to my next stay in the very near future.",5,2004,10,04

The bathroom is lovely: bathrobes (ver big!), plentyof towels, beauty products, a red carnation changed every day, everything you need. As it was quite hot, we were very pleased to have the air conditioning. Lovely carpet in the room, it was so good to walk barefoot on it after a long day shopping in the heat. The staff was ever so polite, obliging from the first minute we got there. We had the english breakfast which was plentiful, plus fresh fruits, all kinds of cereals...Afternoon tea was as good as in Harrod's ! In short, we had a wonderful stay and we will be back next time we go to London.

105,Excellent hotel.,"My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield hotel from 1st to 4th July. I must say we found the hotel very nice and the staff very helpful. We had the full English breakfast included in the rate (140£ taxes included) for a standard room. The breakfast is abolutely ""full"", you can eat lots of food and directly jump to the dinner. The room has nice furniture and fit for two (not too big, but quite enough for us). We missed the mini bar even if we had one bottle of water free, it was at the room temperature.
We tried the tea in the afternoon. Expensive (20£), but can be compared to a meal and is very good.
The location of the hotel is the best I can image: close to all the most important monuments, parks and the shopping area.
Next time I'll choose it again.

It is close to the Green Park tube station, and in close walking distance to many great areas of interest.  Even though we were there on a weekend and had two nights of wedding parties, the noise did stop at midnight as promised (the party terrace we were told, is NOT owned by the hotel).  The rooms were clean and very comfortable, with all sorts of nice amenities.  We booked this hotel on the internet and got a very good rate.  We will certainly choose to stay here again.

105,Kind and Helpful Staff,"My friend and I stayed at this hotel on the 27th, 28th and 29th of December 2003.  The rooms are London small but nicely decorated.  The restaurant was overpriced, but the 5 minute walk to Shepherds Market with two fantastic pubs with great  authentic English food, the King's Arms and The Shepherds Inn made dining inexpensive.  The front desk staff were kind and very helpful.  They patiently answered every question and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable.  The hotel is right off Berkely Square and about a 15 minute walk to either the Green Park or Marble Arch tube stations.  It is about a half hour walk to Picadilly Square.  The location can't be beat.

105,A Little Slice of Heaven,"My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for six nights, from 5-27-04 through 6-1-04. It was our 1st trip to London. We arrived a few days ahead of our 60th Anniversay of D-Day tour group, tired and grouchy after a nearly 11 hour white-knuckler flight. We were pleased by the quiet location of the hotel, compared to the very busy traffic just a few blocks away. The doorman greeted us warmly, and the front-desk staff was cordial. Half-way through the check-in procedure, we were alarmed to learn that the driver who had brought us from the airport, had driven off with one of our bags...the one with our plane tickets, itenerary, & ALL contact info, including the name of the limo company that picked us up!! The concierge (Darrin I believe) was EXTREMELY helpful during our frustrating attempt to locate the limo company and eventually retrieve our missing bag. 
Throughout our stay, we were greeted by name by hotel staff. We enjoyed our nightly chats with Umberto, the bartender. And although the rooms are very small by US standards, they were clean, and beautifully appointed. The bathroom, though tiny, was gorgeous! We came to really appreciate this later, after experiencing a not-so-nice hotel after leaving The Chesterfield.
Our experience with the food wasn't that great. We don't eat runny scrambled eggs and undercooked bacon (which isn't anything like the bacon we know)...be sure to ask for your eggs and bacon well-cooked!!! We did have lamb (a new experience for me) which was actually good. We found ourselves drawn most mornings to a nearby American bagel place, just across from the Starbucks, which is adjacent to Berkley Square. We avoided starvation by eating twice at the Hard Rock cafe (great nachos!), and by stocking up on snacks, soda, and water at the Sainburys grocery store. Both are an easy 10 minute walk from the hotel, as is the tube stop next to the Ritz, and the pick-up location for the Big Bus tour. (Note: the Ritz is on a busy, noisy street...unlike the charming quaint street that The Chesterfield is located on). 
The only critique we have is that a small refrigerator in the room, and access to an ice machine, would have been welcome. We had medication that needed to be kept cold, and having to call the front desk every morning to ask for our medication, got to be annoying. The staff was gracious concerning this, but we would have preferred to handle this on our own. 
All in all, our stay at The Chesterfield was memorable. We hope to return to London again some day, and we would definately stay the The Chesterfield Mayfair again!!!

105,Wonderful Experience in Mayfair,"This was my first trip to England and several friends warned about the small rooms and high cost. True London is expensive however we had excellent value at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Our room was well appointed and average size for a 2 twin accomodation.  The bathroom was luxurious, turn down service and a full English breakfast was included for about $300.00 per day. The staff couldn't have been nicer and Mayfair is a beautiful neighborhood adjacent to Hyde Park and within walking distance to Buckingham Palace , Picadilly and public transportation. Don't miss the National Gallery and a nearby restaurant Cafe in the Crypt.
",5,2004,06,08
105,Not a good choice,"EXTREMELY disappointed with most everything about this hotel. The hotel staff at the front desk IS, as the other reviewer said, very arrogant. The service staff however, (maids, bellboys) were very friendly.

The RESTAURANT  leaves a lot to be desired for the prices they charge. Room service breakfast was cold 3 out of 4 days. In the dining room one morning, our waiter brought tea and coffee and then never returned to take a food order. For dinner, Chicken bouillibaise that tastes as if it came out of a crock pot is not my idea of gourmet. And sticky toffee pudding with melted ice cream on the side is far from appealing. For afternoon tea, the menu lists the teas available, but they were out of my first two choices. Apple juice was on the menu for breakfast. They were out of that too.

One of the two elevators was out of service most days, leaving the stairs as the main mode of getting from one floor to another.

The ROOM, in this case a suite, was tiny, even by London standards. The shower in the bathroom is not big enough to turn around in and the tub is a serious hazard when getting in and out of. It slopes and is very deep, albeit skinny. The noise from the street was overwhlemingly annoying and the traffic never stops. At all. You will hear trucks cabs and motorcycles all night. Several nights there was a live band playing, the beats of which permeate through the walls. The music will not be over until midnight, and if this is a problem for you, well too bad. The hotel seems to be helpless to do anything about it.

The hotel is NOT a 5-10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace as the previous reviewer said. Even if you are a speed walker you couldn't get there in 5-10 minutes. It is more like a 20-25 minute walk. The closes tube station is about a 10-15 minute walk depending on your pace. There are many hotels closer to tube stops. You should stay as close to a tube stop as possible because you will likely be walking everywhere and that extra 30 minutes to/from the hotel from the tube stop adds up when you've already spent all day walking around London.

105,Wonderful place to stay in London...,"We stayed here for 3 nights/4 days in April 2004.  It is the nicest place.  We have nothing but good things to say about it.  Their service is outstanding!  The staff really goes above and beyond everytime they see you.  Beautiful lobby/entrance area. We had a double room, very nicely decorated, extremely clean.  The room could be considered small by American standards but very comfortably fit my husband and myself.  Windows even opened to let in some fresh air.  A full English breakfast was included with our room and boy do they mean ""full"" breakfast.  You don't need to eat again until dinner!  The food was great, we also enjoyed dinner in the restaurant, the best lamb I've ever eaten.  Room service was also great and quick.  Wonderful fish & chips.  The hotel is within a 5-10 minute walk of Buckingham Palace and an easy walk to the tube.  There is a Sainsbury's (grocery store) just a couple minutes away and also a Boots (drugstore) to pick up any things you might need.  Umbrella's are available at the front desk & they will gladly hire a taxi for you.  A fantastic place to stay.  We booked directly off of their website red carnation hotels.  Can without a doubt say this is where will we stay on our next trip to London.",5,2004,05,22
105,charming little hotel,"my husband and i arrived on the 29 december, we loved the hotel very much, the room we had was very small, but the rest of the hotel made up for it.We will return as the service was good as well as the food, and with in walking distance to the shops and sights",4,2004,01,07
105,Good Choice and Value,"We stayed at this Hotel for 6 nights starting the 19th of November , 2003. Rooms are small but after checking around it is about average for London. Service was good and the price included breakfast. ( we did it vis room service) Location is the best walking distance to everywhere! We will stay there again I think that you get value for your money considering the high prices everywhere in town. One must remember that it is a different kind of vacation. After checking out prices on travel website we found a great deal thru CruiseNerd they work with whole seller the good price did include the Outrages 17% taxes.",4,2003,11,27
105,Arrogant staff,"The Chesterfield could be a really nice hotel if it wasn't for the arrogant staff. I wondered whether some of the staff could be any more disdainful and patronising. It's a pity because the rooms are very plush, the restaurant food excellent. Still, I did not enjoy my stay - simply because of the staff.",2,2003,11,09
105,Loved the Chesterfield,Stayed August 27-31. Room was small but not claustrophobic. Bathroom was lovely. Staff was outstanding. Location is perfect. We will stay there again when in London. The public rooms are like being in an English country house.,5,2003,11,03
105,This is a great choice!,"Fantastic hotel! Great Staff & location! We stayed here for 4 nights and wish we were still there! I wanted a hotel that was very british and this fit the the bill!

105,Nice Hotel with TINY ROOMS,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel September 29 and 30, 2003 in room #503. It is a well run, well maintained hotel with a friendly and helpful staff in a great location. However, the rooms are TINY. I am of average size and build (5' 11"" and 185 pounds) and my wife is petite, we had a difficult time sleeping in their ""Deluxe Double"" room. The ""Deluxe Double"" appeared to be a single room with an extra set of towels. My son had room #504 another ""Deluxe Double"" that was the same size.",2,2003,10,11
105,Top Notch,What a great place to stay everything was outstanding.

It was his first Atlantic Crossing; arrived early am, exhausted from flight and transfer. Were greeted w/a cheery smile by receptionist! Check in expediant. Lobby warm and inviting. After being shown to our room, recieved follow up call, asking if all was well. Room was comfortable, with comp bottle water, coffee/ tea service, hot cocoa, and a red carnation. Staff was always friendly & helpful. They assisted us with directions, restaurant recommendations, tour arrangements. Good location in quiet, upscale Mayfair, near Green Park, Buckingham Palace tube stops. We loved this hotel and would highly recommend it!",5,2003,09,10
105,Great Location,"I stayed at this hotel in August and was upgraded to a superior double from a standard double room. The location above all is excellent. It is hard to find a quiet room in many parts of London, but this hotel is exemplary in this regard. The breakfast was plentiful and included in the room rate. My only reservation is that room service was slow, but the hotel appeared to be virtually full and the staff very busy. I will definitely stay there again.",4,2003,08,30
105,A wonderful hotel!,"We loved the Chesterfield Mayfair! It is a beautiful, charming little hotel. The restaurant is wonderful and we really enjoyed the piano bar.

Incredibly nice, courteous staff. We were at the Taylor Swift concert and received a small gift bag from the hotel with TS sticker, popcorn etc. Such a lovely gesture!
Rooms are appealing, very comfortable beds, the king-size bed is actually also nice and not much too narrow as in other British hotels. 
Breakfast is served ala carte, not buffet.
Location of the hotel is excellent in Mayfair. Restaurants, Pubs, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus etc. Everything within walking distance.

105,evitate il ristorante e starete bene,"L'hotel Che fa parte di una catena che già conoscevamo. L’albergo è stile antico in zona residenziale. Il personale molto gentile e disponibile , molti italiani fra il personale. Le stanze piccole e carine , i bagni avrebbero bisogno di rinnovamento, ciò renderebbe migliore anche la pulizia. Le stanze sulla chiostrina interna improponibili, affacciosu ventilazione e cucina con cattivo odore di cibo. Nel comm’esso Non sarebbe male ma decisamente non accettabile il ristorante pessimo , il cibo pesce e carne proprio malcucinati , anche i dolcetti offerti cattivi. Solo il servizio è accogliente , per quel che serve! Il prezzo alto . Anche il Tea e i biscotti nella dotazione in camera sono di tipo comune e scadente. Seppure apprezzabile la possibilità di farsi un Tea o Un caffè quando si vuole. In altri alberghi della catena  l’offerta è migliore poi nella patria del tea e di buoni biscotti! Quindi nel complesso un 4 stelle da migliorare. Come ho detto l’albergo Eé gradevole e il personale molto efficiente.",3,2020,02,01

Atmosfera rigorosamente inglese come architettura arredamento e servizio. Un encomio particolare al personale italiano, vero valore aggiunto, che con una particolare e squisita cortesia ci ha fatto sentire l'ospitalità ed il calore di casa. E soprattutto ci ha fatto dimenticare in fretta l'amarezza di un piccolo furto ahimè subito in un negozio di Londra. Per questi motivi speriamo di tornare in questo hotel assolutamente consigliato e di ritrovare le stesse persone e la stessa calorosa cordiale e nel contempo elegantemente British ospitalità.

105,Experiencia para repetir,"Es un hotel impresionante, cada detalle que tiene hace que tu estancia sea realmente cómoda. La habitación en la que estuve ""chesterfield suite"" me sorprendió muchísimo. No le faltaba de nada y se creaba un ambiente idóneo.

Resulta destacable el trato de los empleados, todos se preocupaban mucho por nuestro confort, siempre esbozaban una sonrisa lo que te hacía estar verdaderamente agusto. Recuerdo que una recepcionista (Charlotte creo que se llamaba) tuvo un trato especialmente bueno al igual que el camarero que nos sirvió en la cena, se le veía con mucha experiencia y tenía una gran involucración. 

La experiencia en la cena de restuarante estuvo muy a la altura y por supuesto el desayuno también. Nos encanta la comida y sobretodo la comida de calidad y con buena presentación. Bravo. 

La zona nos pareció realmente buena, segura, tranquila y a destacar cerca del centro.

105,Eccellenza british a Mayfair!,"Ho trascorso alcune notti al Chesterfield lo scorso agosto insieme alla mia famiglia. L'Hotel rappresenta un vero gioiello in un quartiere di per sè già particolarmente accogliente e di prestigio. Non per nulla, a pochi passi ci si trova dinanzi a Buckingham Palace! Il nostro soggiorno è stato davvero piacevole, allietato inoltre dal magnifico bar che serve cocktail molecolari in un'atmosfera vellutata ma confidenziale. Tutti i dettagli sono curati ed il servizio è stato eccellente in ogni sua componente anche se vorrei segnalare in particolare il Concierge che, al di là della prevedibile cortesia, ha dimostrato, in un caso specifico, assoluta competenza e professionalità (è riuscito in effetti a tprenotarmi una visita allo stadio di Stanford Bridge davvero all'ultimo istante quando sembrava impresa ardua...). In tutta onestà, se volessi proprio trovare il pelo nell'uovo, devo sottolineare che l'unico punto che, a mio avviso, andrebbe migliorato è rappresentato dal ristorante che, seppure molto accogliente (sembra davvero di pranzare in un magnifico giardino, ma è tutto ""!indoor"") offre una varietà di opzioni non all'altezza del posto ed anche preparate in maniera ""suffuciente"" ma mai ""eccellente"" (ho usato questi due aggettivi solo per sintetica chiarezza). Cionostante, non posso che essere felice della scelta fatta e riconoscente a tutto il personale del Chesterfield per aver reso la nostra permanenza a Londra ""unfogetable"".",5,2019,01,07
105,Una deliziosa struttura ,"Da quando visito Londra questo hotel è una sicurezza per chi è alla ricerca del particolare , per la posizione silenziosa , ma d’élite, per l’elegante sala da pranzo dove si fa anche la colazione. Sala da the a dir poco simile ad Alice nel paese delle meraviglie. Se uno vuole prendere un aperitivo o dopo cena si è accompagnati con la musica di un pianoforte!!!

Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr angenehm und ruhig. In ca. 100 m Entfernung ist das Footman's Pub, nach 200 m ist man am Green Park. Soho, Oxford Street, Westminster, Bond Street sind alle gut zu Fuss machbar.
Es ist unbedingt empfehlenswert ein Angebot mit Frühstück zu buchen! Dieses war phänomenal, vor Ort zahlt man jedoch, wie immer in den Londoner Hotels, Phantasie-Preise.

105,Muy buen hotel,El hotel es de tipo clásico y en excelente estado. La atención es muy buena y cuidan hasta los más pequeños detalles. Cama y baños muy bien y además es muy silencioso. La ubicación en Mayfair es muy buena ya que está en una zona tranquila pero a unos 300 metros de la estación del metro.,5,2018,04,03
105,"Un genuino hotel inglés en Mayfair, con excelente servicio, restauración y habitaciones confortables.","Soy cliente habitual de este hotel, muy bien situado y comunicado, en pleno barrio de Mayfair. Las habitaciones son muy correctas y confortables, a un precio razonable. Tiene un excelente restaurante y un bar inglés con buenos cocktails, música suave en vivo (jazz los miércoles) y, sobre todo, un personal muy atento y servicial.",4,2018,02,09
105,Clásico londinense,"Londres no dejó de sorprendernos, y el hotel no fue la excepción, estuvimos 6 noches, todo excelente. La ubicación es inmejorable cerca de todo, en Mayfair que es una zona rodeada por Piccadilly, Regent Street, Oxford street, creen Park y high Park, es una zona de lujo muy segura y cerca de todo, con la estación de metro Green Park al frente del palacio de Buckingham. Recomiendo pagar el desayuno continental que no es como el continental de argentina, sino que tiene bufete y a la carta con todo el menú de cocina (huevos, etc) con platos bien preparados y presentados, atendido por meseros muy educados al estilo Inglés. En el lobby hay festival de jazz todos miércoles por la noche muy buenos, y puedes tomar la mejor bebida en su bar. Personal muy amable atento servicial y cordial. La habitación es de buen tamaño, no así el baño que si bien tiene bañera es un poco justo, pero con amenities Francesas Fragonard. Nos recibieron con un plato con un mensaje personalizado y dos dulces deliciosos tipo muffins y cóctel a nuestra elección en el bar. Excelente ",5,2018,01,05
105,British Style,"Albergo 100% old british style, se vi piace il genere non vorrete delusi. Posizione tranquilla ed eccezionale! Camera pulita, ordinata, e dotata di ogni confort. Bravissime le persone che si occupano delle stanze che passano più volte al giorno a sistemare e a preparare la stanza per la notte.
Personale in generale gentile e professionale.
Colazione non all'altezza della categoria.
Moquette in camera improponibile.",4,2017,11,04

105,Una bellissima esperienza!,"Sono andata a fare l'afternoon tea in questo bellissimo albergo ed è stata davvero una bella esperienza elegante senza essere troppo imbarazzante.
Ottimi the e infusi, per non parlare dei dolci freschissimi e davvero ottimi. Molto buoni anche gli scones con la crema e la marmellata fatta in casa e anche i sandwiches di molte varietà.
Il prezzo è abbstanza alto (circa 40 euro a testa) ma si può bere e mangiare quanto si vuole e pure portarsi via le cose da mangiare!
Personale davvero cortese e di alto livello!
Assolutamente da fare",4,2017,10,03
105,Muy buen hospedaje y atencion,"Los 5 días que estuve, me sentí muy cómodo, Tal vez un poco de hospitalidad e interés hubiera mejorado la calificación del lugar, Pero en general todo muy bien. Con respecto al lugar y donde se ubica, fue muy conveniente para mi ya que estaba cerca de varios lugares que quería visitar.",4,2017,09,25
105,buon hotel,"classico hotel inglese, personale gentile e disponibile, camere piccole, ma accettabili.

105,Meravilia in stile British,"Hotel eccellente in perfetto stile British.
Eleganza da hotel super, abbinato  ad un ambiente accogliente che fa idea di casa.
Personale molto cortese, che ha risolto sempre ogni esigenza .
Camere perfette e pulitissime, non amo la moquette, ma qui non viene neanche il dubbio sul fatto che non siano pulite ogni giorno.
Bagno non grandissimo ma molto elegante.
Colazione abbondante e di ottima qualità.
A piano terra  è presente un bar e sala dove è possibile  fare the o aperitivo di qualità.
Prezzo elevato, ma ne vale la pena.",5,2017,09,04

105,Romantisches Hotel mit Flair,"Das Hotel ist ideal gelegen. Man erreicht den Hyde-Park, Green-Park und James-Park bequeme zu Fuss, ebenso die U-Bahn Station Green Park. Das Hotel selbst hat seinen Reiz. Es strahlt eine Atmosphäre aus die geprägt ist von einem Gefühl des Wohlwollens, des Daheim fühlen. Der Stil des Mobiliar erinnert an eine romantische Zeit von Luxus, Plüsch, schweren Vorhängen. Die Zimmer sind geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Jedes Detail stimmt, selbst die Nelke im Bad. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist einladend und das Omelette wird frisch zubereitet. Es wird Wert auf eine gepflegte Atmosphäre gelegt.Das Personal ist hilfsbereit und freundlich. Ein Besuch in diesem Hotel lohnt sich...",5,2017,08,23
105,Excelente opción,"Muy conforme con el hotel:
Ubicación en lo que a mi criterio es el mejor barrio ""Myfair"" para estar en Londres, cerca de todos lados y muy señorial
Muy lindo edificio, tipo Boutique, muy inglés como su decoración.
Personal muy atento y bien uniformado.
Excelente desayuno
Muy cerca del Sheperd Market, lleno de lugares simpáticos para comer o tomar algo
En síntesis muy recomendable",5,2017,06,07
105,La mejor Opción en Londres,"Sin dudas me volvería a hospedar allí.  La Ubicación es perfecta, cerca de todo. Un lugar sofisticado pero de ambiente cálido. Me sentí en mi propio hogar. Se nota el entrenamiento al personal y el buen tino en su elección, todo lo solucionan fácilmente con una sonrisa, haciendo que sea un verdadero placer la estancia. Legue sin celular por un percance, y al ingresar a la habitación me encontré con uno que dan a cada huésped del hotel, uno por habitación, el cual se puede utilizar para Internet , GPS, mails. Piensan en todo.
En cuanto a  la habilitación impecable,la cama y almohadas muy confortables, limpieza excelente, silencioso, todo para el buen descanso después de un ajetreado día en Londres.
El restaurante es un paso obligado para los amantes de las rutas gastronómicas, a probar su especialidad en pescado, y el champagne de producción propia, Imperdibles! Como broche de oro su Gerente.",5,2017,05,04
105,Tre giorni fantastici,"Un hotel meraviglioso, tutto ti colpisce con la sua eleganza , tutto ti avvolge con il suo arredamento caratteristico, ti senti davvero coccolato dalla gentilezza di tutto il personale, si ente una bella sensazione di ""casa"" quando si entra. 
La colazione al mattino ti lascia senza parole, trovi di tutto e puoi chiedere di tutto, i piatti sono preparati con qualità e professionalità altissime, non so se il cuoco è uno stellato ma secondo me meriterebbe di esserlo. 
Il ristorante poi è un'esperienza che consiglio a tutti, con la mia compagna siamo arrivati, senza prenotazione e a cucine chiuse, il personale gentilissimo ha rimesso in funzione tutto solo per noi, abbiamo cenato, ed è stato veramente fantastico. 
Un'altra nota, piacevolissima, l'ultimo giorno abbiamo lasciato i bagagli alla reception in prima mattinata, per la classica ultima giornata di shopping, e siamo tornati distrutti, verso le 16:30, il responsabile della sala ristorante, quando ha capito che non avevamo pranzato, ci ha regalato  una borsa con un pranzo take away per due, con relativi dolci da consumare in aeroporto. 
Non ho parole. 
Grazie a tutti",5,2017,04,24
105,FANTASTICO,"Hotel clasico en el centro de Londres. Muy bien comunicado.

105,Tradicion Inglesa en un barrio buenisimo,"Estar alojado en Mayfair le suma mucho a la visita a Londres. Es sin duda uno de los mejores lugares para a partir de ahi recorrer la ciudad. El hotel es chico pero muy lindo en cuanto a mantener correctamente la limpieza, el silencio, la atencion de recepcion y conserjeria. Llegamos antes del check in y dejamos las maletas para empezar a caminar. La ubicacion es spectacular no solo por las cercanias donde encontras todo en un ambiente muy relajado y de nivel sino porque desde alli caminando o en algun medio de transporte se puede llegar atoda la ciudad. Recomendable ya que ademas tiene un bar muy piola para finalizar el dia o tomar una copa antes de la cena.",4,2017,03,20
105,Hotel en Mayfair - Londres,"Estuve una noche en Londres en El Barrio Mayfair. En el hotel The Chesterfield Mayfair. 
Muy bien ubicado. El hotel muy bien, limpieza 10 puntos, mucha onda Inglesa. Mucha tradición en toda su decoración. 
Un bar espectacular. Tomar algo ahí es ""obligado"". 
Solo decir que el tamaño de las piezas es desafiado chico. Veníamos de Asia por lo que traíamos demasiadas maletas y no teníamos donde ponerlas... terminamos dejándolas en el baño...
Recomendable el hotel pero ojo con las maletas....",4,2017,03,04
105,Mi casa en Londres.,"Me he alojado por tercera vez en un año en el Chesterfield Mayfair y me siento como en casa, cada día más.
Me gustan los hoteles tradicionales, con un buen desayuno, un bar inglés donde disfrutar de un Gin Tonic o un malta en buena compañía; servido por Edgar, un joven manager que nos trató maravillosamente.
 Habitaciones con lo que necesito: buena cama, baño limpio, luminoso y fácil de manejar los grifos...
Y, sobre todo, personal amable y que sepa resolver rápidamente cualquier pequeño contratiempo. En este sentido, el Chesterfield es fantástico.",5,2017,02,10
105,Afternoon tea,"Per l'ultimo dell'anno ci siamo regalati un sontuoso the delle 5 in questo meraviglioso locale di grande eleganza con un servizio perfetto. La scelta dei the è molto vasta e per ogni gusto. L'alzatina comprendeva i classici sandwiches e un numero imprecisato fra muffin, paste e torte da non riuscire a finirli.
Il prezzo è spaventoso (38 sterline a testa) però è un'esperienza davvero suggestiva e...si risparmia sulla cena!",5,2017,02,02
105,Jungel .... ,"Das Hotel hat uns sehr gefallen

105,Sehr schönes plüschiges Hotel in guter Lage,"Tolles Hotel im Bezirk Mayfair, nur 5 Minuten bis zur Tubestation Green Park. Sehr traditionelles Ambiente, wie man sich das vorstellt mit Portier und Salon und Afternoon Tea. Die Zimmer verfügen über bequeme Betten, ziemlich geräumige Schränke, nagelneue Flatscreen-TVs, neue Bäder, abends wird das Bett aufgedeckt. Superfreundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Preislich höher als die typischen Touristenhotels, aber das ist es wert.",5,2017,01,10
105,Per chi ha la finezza di apprezzare il vero hotel inglese,"Sono anni che ritorniamo in questo hotel ... perché si trova nella zona più bella di Londra , contornato da casette che tolgono il fiato, fuori dal traffico della strada principale, ma vicino a tutto se hai voglia di fare 2 passi. Entrando in questo hotel si respira subito aria inglese... accolti da personale vestito di tutto punto e con tanto di tuba( 🎩), che si fanno in 4 per soddisfare le tue esigenze!. Stanze  con moquette ( come tutto nell'hotel), mega tendaggi di velluto, bagnetto con marmo e rubinetteria in ottone , manca il bidè( 🤔)  . Colazione nel ristorante dello stesso.. incantevole tutto... ( consiglio di prenotare la camera comprendendo l' english breakfast) .. praticamente pranzi 😉. Ospitano anche un'incantevole sala da the ( rito inglese un po' caretto , ma favoloso). Alla sera se si vuole prendere un aperitivo o un dopo cena , c'è un bar al piano terra con comodi divanetti e barman simpatici , il tutto accompagnati da un sottofondo di pianoforte. Prezzo? Non è poco, ma a Londra ce ne sono di più cari e sono sicura che non ti offrono tutto questo.",5,2017,01,05
105,"Seconda volta al Chesterfield, ma sicuramente ci ritorno....","Sì, è stata la seconda volta al The Chesterfield Mayfair e non siamo rimasti delusi. Anzi. Già pensiamo alla prossima volta.
L'hotel è piccolo, ma curatissimo in ogni dettaglio e veramente confortevole (lo staff poi è gentilissimo). Camere piccole, ma lussuose e dotate di ogni confort.
Colazione spettacolare.
La zona, Mayfair, è molto bella  e comoda per girare Londra (a pochi passi da Buckingham Palace e vicina a Piccadilly). Fermata della metro (Green Park) vicina. Molti ristoranti/locali ""di un certo livello"" nella zona (credo di non aver mai visto così tante Rolls Royce in vita mia!)",5,2016,12,12
105,Excelente ubicación,"La ubicación del hotel es excelente, está a 5 minutos caminando de Piccadilly Circus, dispone de una parada de metro muy cercana. El trato del personal es exquisito. El barrio es de los más exclusivos de Londres, las calles más importantes para ir de compras están a un paso. El último día tuvimos en problema con la habitación y nos cambiaron a una suite superior al instante. Te arreglan la habitación dos veces al día, te dejan la prensa cada mañana, así como agua, café y té. Las instalaciones son muy lujosas.",5,2016,12,07
105,"Schönes,typisch LondonerHotel","Mitten im wundervollen Stadteil Mayrfair gelegen.Viele Atraktionen zu Fuss zu erreichen.Sehr freundliches Personal. Zimmer nicht sehr gross, aber schön englisch eingerichtet.Schönes helles Marmorbad.Alles sehr gepflegt und sehr sauber!!",4,2016,10,15
105,Confortable,"Realmente en unas de las mejores zonas de Londres ,pero sobre todo la calidad y el servicio que ofrece todo el personal del hotel ,la habitación clásica como es habitual en Londres muy clásica y por supuesto felicitarlos por la limpieza en todas las instalaciones ,recomendable sin dudar",5,2016,09,24
105,Top Location mit Flair,"Das Hotel liegt optimal in einer der ruhigeren Seitenstrasse im Herzen von Mayfair. Von der Paddington Station benötigt man ca. 15 min mit dem Taxi. Man findet alles in der Nähe was man braucht. Das Ambiente und der Service waren erstklassig. Das Personal ist besonders freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war klein aber funktional, sehr sauber und in britischem Stil eingereichtet. Ich komme gerne wieder.",4,2016,09,09
105,Afternoon tea da sogno,"L'accoglienza inizia ancora prima di entrare, arrivando in taxi un portiere in livrea con cilindro ci aiuta a scendere e ci prende i bagagli. Veniamo indirizzate verso la sala dove si vive la magia del te' delle 5. Veniamo accolti da camerieri attenti, in particolare Sergio e Lorenzo che ci coccolano per tutta la durata del nostro breve soggiorno al Chesterfield. Willy wonka in persona ci dà il benvenuto e da lì in poi tutto e' perfetto: Te' e infusioni, tramezzini e dolcetti! Un tripudio. Complimenti, le aspettative sono state confermate! Un lusso che una volta ogni tanto bisognerebbe concedersi. Il prezzo è altino.. 36,50$ escluso tasse ed escluso il servizio.",5,2016,08,24
105,Delicia Londinense,"El Chesterfield Mayfair es un hotel extraordinario. Tanto las instalaciones, ubicación y servicio son excelentes. El personal se pone a disposición permanentemente para hacer sentir a los huéspedes como reyes. El desayuno es completo y de excelente calidad.

Volveré sin dudarlo en mi próximo paso por Londres",5,2016,08,14
105,Britisches Hotelambiente in ruhiger und Zentraler Umgebung.,"Wir haben bekommen was wir gebucht haben... ein sehr nettes und britisches Hotel mitten in Mayfair. Das Ambiente entsprach unseren Vorstellungen und der Service am Empfang war sehr gut. Auch das kleine Standardzimmer war sehr ruhig, gepflegt und vollkommen ausreichend. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten wir Buckingham Palast, Piccadilly oder auch Covent Garden sind per Fuss zu erreichen. Um die Ecke gibt es nette Pubs und kleinere Lokale. Auf jeden Fall bei Gelegenheit wieder.",4,2016,08,11
105,Excelente hotel lo recomiendo,"Si lo puedes pagar hazlo! Está ubicado en una de las mejores zonas de Londres, para mí la mejor en la que se pueden ver las mejores marcas, y lugares exclusivos de londinenses. Si quieres ver ingleses este es el lugar Mayfair!. La atención del hotel es impecable están siempre dispuestos para atenderte y resolver cualquier problema o pedido que tengas me sentí súper bien. Podes comer en la habitación por un precio que para Londres y la calidad de la comida está muy bien. LO RECOMIENDO!",5,2016,08,08
105,camere piccolissime,"L'hotel è ubicato in una posizione favorevole per gli spostamenti a piedi anche se per chi usa la metropolitana bisogna camminare un po' per raggiungerla ( circa 5-7 minuti).L'atmosfera è british...polvere compresa, le camere sono molto piccole e soffocanti con il soffitto non molto alto, i bagni ancor più stretti e  anche i corridoi che ti portano alle camere con il soffitto basso.
Per avere una camera di dimensione normale bisogna prendere una junior suite, che in altri hotel invece corrisponde alla grandezza di una camera superior. Unica nota positiva ti offrono l'acqua sul comodino la sera prima di andare a dormire.
Il personale della colazione è gentile,  la sala della colazione è buia, a parte i primi due tavoli all'entrata che danno sul cortile interno molto carino, é davvero anche un po' cupa. Il cibo è nella media anche se manca la varietà di frutta fresca di stagione... niente fragole, ciliege, ananas, melone che normalmente in tutti gli alberghi a 4 stelle si trovano: qui solo macedonia o banane e mele. Costa troppo per come è, a meno che non troviate un'offerta a basso costo.",3,2016,07,20
105,Muy buena ubicacion y servicio,"En pleno centro de Mayfair, Pegado a Grosvenor Square y Piccadilly. Rodeado de restaurantes. Las habitaciones, muy clásicas, tienen un tamaño apenas justo y las standard carecen de frigobar para quien le interese. Tienen buena insonorizacion y tal vez necesiten algun ligero mantenimiento. Es de destacar el buen nivel de atención de todo el personal, tanto de recepción, bar y restaurante como de habitaciones. Lo observo muy recomendable.",4,2016,06,05
105,vivere una esperienza molto british in un hotel al centro di un bellissimo quartiere,"l'hotel chesterfield si trova  a mayfair uno dei quartieri più centrali e chic di londra . quello che colpisce appena messo piedi in hotel è l'atmosfera assolutamente british old england non facilmente rinvenibile in altri hotel della stessa categoria . arredamenti in legno e pelle, personale della reception gentilissimo cosicome i concierges attenti a  ogni richiesta . Abbiamo soggiornato 4 notti in una bellissima camera a tema, music room, tappezzata in tessuto con ampi armadi a muro, grande bagno con vasca stile impero con moderna doccia e rifacimento camera almeno due volte al giorno. Colazione ampia e soprattutto piatti caldi preparati al momento. Stazione metro a 5 minuti cosi come la più ampia scelta di ristoranti stellati inglesi,cinesi,indiani ecc nel raggio di 200 metri.",4,2016,05,27
105,Afternoontea,"Volevamo provare un afternoontea come si beve a Londra e siamo venuti in questo hotel . Prenotazione via internet. Avevamo letto che era uno dei locali migliori di Londra.
Tutto confermato. Hotel spendido con sala da pranzo vecchio stile inglese, camerieri gentili, ci hanno portato una alzata con tramezzini, paninetti, biscotti, barrette cioccolato ecc..  Un buon assortimento , prodotti dalla loro cucina, ottima qualita' , splendido il te servito in foglie intere. 2 calici di champagne per chiudere. Prezzo un po' alto ma a Londra c'e decisamente di peggio.",4,2016,05,16
105,Due giorni di lavoro a Londra ,In pienissimo centro a pochi passi dalla metropolitana Green Park sulla linea Piccadilly. Ottimo per appuntamenti di lavoro in centro. Personale cortese e attento. Camera ben ordinata e pulita. Prezzi in linea con hotel simili in centro a Londra.,4,2016,04,05
105,Tradition in Perfektion,"Tolles, sehr altes Haus mit allem was das Herz begehrt.

105,Ein wenig Rosamunde Pilcher,"Das Chesterfield Mayfair ist zentral gelegen und ruhig zugleich. Ein paar Gehminuten entfernt von der Tube-Station Green Park, von der man direkt zum Flughafen Heathrow fahren kann. Das Hotel hat wahrlich britischen Charme; vom Portier, über Porzellanfiguren bis hin zu Stofftapeten. Jedes Zimmer ist anders gestaltet, alle aber sind für den Puristen etwas zu überladen und kitschig, bieten aber jeden erdenkbaren Komfort. Es gibt Himmelbetten, auf dem Nachttisch stehen kleine Porzellanobelisken, die Badezimmer hingegen sind sehr modern. Kostenloses W-Lan gibt es auch, im Untergeschoss Computer und einen Drucker (praktisch für den Bordkartendruck). An der Bar spielt abends ein Pianist und überall gibt es die wunderschönen Chesterfield-Möbel. Das Personal an der Rezeption ist exzellent. Insgesamt ist das Hotel mit Preisen von über 300€ pro Nacht jedoch recht teuer. Noch ein Wort zum Butler's Restaurant. Das Frühstück (Englisch und Kontinental) ist sehr gut, beim Abendessen im nicht vollen Restaurant war der Service (nicht das feine Essen) eine Vollkatastrophe. Die Kellner waren nicht aufmerksam, extrem langsam und mussten mehrfach an die Bestellung erinnert werden.",4,2015,11,18
105,Uno de los mejores que he estado en mi vida.,"Hotel precioso, con una localización perfecta para visitar Londres y hacer compras, ya que esta muy cerca de Oxford street y de Picadilly. Decoración clásica. Aunque las habitaciones no son muy espaciosas tampoco son pequeñas para ser Londres y la cama es muy amplia y comoda. A destacar por encima de todo el servicio, que tiene multitud de detalles, y la amabilidad de los conserjes. El desayuno esta muy bien, con productos de calidad y muy bien servido.",5,2015,10,02
105,"Gut gelegen, aber eher teuer","Top Lage in Mayfair und in Gehminuten der London Branch meines Arbeitgebers, aber eher teuer. Weiss nicht ob der Preis saisonal so hoch ist. Immer hin 10 Tage früher gebucht. Knapp 10 Minuten zu Fuss ab Subway Green Park. Sehr freundlicher Empfang. Leider war aber zuvor gewünschter & mitgeteilter early checkin nicht möglich, da kein Zimmer parat war. Obschon Hotel in altem englischen Stil schon älter erscheint, schien Zimmer Superior King renoviert zu sein. Elegant und dekorativ. Ruhiges Zimmer zu Innenhof. Zimmer komfortabel in englischem Stil eingerichtet. Betten mit qualitativ hochstehenden Matratzen. Gratis WIFI, gute Verbindung. English Breakfast war im Preis inbegriffen. Gute Auswahl am Buffet mit qualitativ hochstehenden Speisen. Zusätzlich schöne Auswahl ab Karte an warmen Speisen, wie zum Beispiel köstliche Egg Benedict. Auch hier sehr freundliche Bedienung und rasch. Tolle Bar für Schlummertrunk in angenehmen Ambiente mit Pianist. Ein Drink aufs Haus offeriert und reichhaltige Cocktail Karte. Alles da für perfekten Aufenthalt. Auf Kritik wir nach Abreise umgehend via Email eingegangen. Werde wiederkehren. Auch für longweekend mit Gattin.",4,2015,09,26
105,Comfortabilidad en uno de las mejores zonas,"Hotel de pequeñas dimensiones, localizado en el tranquilo barrio de Mayfair y muy bien comunicado, si bien es posible ir a pie a muchos sitios de interés. Muy confortable, y servicio correcto. En mi caso, la habitación resultó un poco pequeña, pero me sentí muy a gusto. Toallas y sábanas de excelente calidad. El bufete del desayuno resulta un poco pobre si no se acompaña con algo de la carta.",4,2015,09,14
105,Un clasico,"He ido varias veces y nunca decepciona

No busques nada moderno.....el Londres que todos tenemos en la mente esta aqui",4,2015,08,26
105,Excelente ubicacion muy segura el hotel muy colonial,"Esta es la mejor zona diria yo para quedarse en Londres.  Queda a corta distancia de todo, tienen el metro ( under ground ) a 4 calles, bicicletas para rentar a 2 calles .  El hotel en si es muy bonito pero como en NY los cuartos no son los mas grandes.  OJO el cuarto no tiene refrigerador.  Decidimos este por el del de pague 3 noches reciba  una gratis lo que lo hizo tentador.  Existen otras zonas mas economicas pero no se si sea muy seguro.",5,2015,08,17
105,Excelente hotel en Mayfair,"Me alojé por tercera vez en el Chesterfield Mayfair. Altamente recomendable, el hotel, las habitaciones y la increíble ubicación en pleno corazón de Mayfair.
Excelente atención del personal del hotel.",5,2015,07,18
105,La mejor ubicacion,"Estuvimos 5 dias en Londres y nos llevamos una muy grata sorpresa con este hotel, el staff siempre atento a nosotros muy amables, muy limpio todas las areas, tanto el cuarto que tambien fue de buen tamano para ser Londres y la ubicacion en la mejor zona de Londres para hacer compras y los mejores restaurantes, la mejor opcion calidad/precio",5,2015,06,02

Baño, productos de higiene y sesayuno perfectos. Muy buena wifi!!!!!
Volveria",4,2015,05,31
105,Perfecto,"Excelente , condice con las fotos , todo es perfecto, y sobre todo la ubicación es inmejorable en un barrio muy lindo y elegante , con 3 líneas  de metro cerca.  Si no toman con desayuno incluido, hay muchas opciones cerca para desayunar , también esta una plaza muy cerca, Berkeley Square de lo mas linda !! Recomiendo este hotel",5,2015,05,25
105,Perfetto!,"Abbiamo soggiornato al Chesterfield Mayfair per 3 notti durante il weekend di Pasqua 2015, dopo averlo scoperto quasi per caso tramite le recensioni di tripadvisor.
Che dire.... bellissimo!
Il quartiere è strepitoso, tranquillo con bellissime case e tutte le comodità (fermata della metro ad un paio di isolati, un paio di starbucks altrettanto vicini....). Diversi locali notturni/ristoranti in zona, con clientela sicuramente di un certo ""livello"" (diverse Ferrari, Maserati e Lamborghini parcheggiate in prossimità dei locali!)
L'hotel è piccolo, ma molto curato. Il personale gentilissimo.
Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione (non prevista dalla nostra tariffa) in quanto ci sembrava un po' cara. Non essendo soliti fare una colazione particolarmente ricca, ci siamo accontentati (ma con gusto!) di un vicino starbucks.
Camera perfetta! Molto piccola, ma con ogni confort (asciugacapelli, set caffè/tea, prodotti bagno di ottima marca, candidi accappatoi e ciabattine...). Arredamento di lusso, stile british, con letto comodissimo (King size).
Pulizia ineccepibile.
Da tornarci sicuramente!",4,2015,04,13
105,Nos sentimos como en casa,"Visitamos Londres por vacaciones con mi esposa. Nos hospedamos por 10 noches en este hotel y nos sentimos como en casa. La atención del personal fue siempre excelente. Nos gusto que el hotel se siente pequeño y tranquilo lo que permite descansar después de un largo día. Las habitaciones son muy confortables y la limpieza excelente. EL área en donde esta ubicado, Mayfair, es una de las mejores de Londres y es muy conveniente para acceder al transporte publico.

Al llegar nos recibio un chofer en el aeropuerto y al arribar al hotel recibieron con rapidez. Todo el personal parece esforzarse por atender bien al huésped. La habitación la encontramos lista y con 2 cartas de bienvenida de parte de gerencia general y otra de recepción, en español, lo cual nos pareció un buen detalle (Gracias a Natalie de recepción por la amabilidad). 

Otro gran detalle fue que todas las noches llegaba una señorita a abrir las camas y dejaba un spray hidratante, chocolates y sales para el baño, así como dejaba agua en las mesas de noche.

Finalmente el Bar: el hotel cuenta con un bonito bar que resulta muy cómodo para ir a tomar una copa y comer algo al final del día. La atención es sumamente buena. Agradezco a Edgar y su equipo por el excelente servicio. 

El Wifi fue gratuito lo cual era indispensable para nosotros.

Cuando regresemos a Londres nuevamente nos hospedaremos en este hotel.",5,2015,03,23
105,Tutto molto bene,"Hotel molto carino, curato e ben tenuto in pieno centro a Londra, in posizione decisamente strategica. Reception veloce, accogliente con personale molto cortese. Stanze piccole ma molto ben arredate, bagno con tutto ciò che serve. Pulitissimo. Colazione non molto varia ma con prodotti di ottime qualità. Decisamente consigliato. ",5,2015,03,20
105,Exzellenz auch beim 10. Besuch,"Dieses Hotel liegt einerseits so günstig, dass viele Ziele zu Fuss erreichbar sind, andererseits findet sich das alte Mayfair mit ""Dorfkern"" in unmittelbarer Nähe. Das Hotel selber aber ist der Inbegriff englischer Kultur. Die Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll, die Betten garantieren guten Schlaf und die Gastronomie braucht keine Vergleiche zu scheuchen. Herrlich das englische Frühstück, dem keine Attribute fehlen und das Eggs Benedict wie auch Porridge mit Whiskey und Sahne auf der grossen Karte aufführt. Das Personal ist durchwegs freundlich und hilfsbereit. Kurz: Ein eher kleines Haus, doch ein grosses Angebot.",5,2015,02,15
105,ottima posizione,"Ottimo hotel , molta cordialitá e vera gentilezza. 
Io e la mio marito abbiamo trascorso un breve periodo a Londra ed in questo hotel ci siamo sentiti coccolati dal personale 'misto': inglese e 
italiano.
Stra-accessoriato, veramente non manca nulla. Pensate che nel nostro bagno c'era addirittura il bidet!!
Anche il ristorante è di buon livello ed il quartiere è tranquillo pur essendo centrale.
Lo consigliamo.",5,2015,01,19
105,Stadthotel mit British Charme,"Das Hotel ist ein optimaler Ausgangspunkt für Sightseeing, Shopping usw. In ca. 15. Minuten sind zu Fuss Museen und Einkaufsstrassen zu erreichen. Zudem ist in ca. 3 Gehminuten eine UBahn zu erreichen. Die Gegend ist leise, leider sind im Hotel die Geräusche der anderen Zimmer sehr gut zu hören. Das Frühstück ist typisch englisch, ganz ok.",4,2015,01,14
105,come sempre piu di sempre,"Che dire in questo hotel le piccole cose fanno la differenza, basti pensare che appena arrivati per le bambe cerano due regalini sotto l'albero di Natale, poi nell'attesa hanno offerto the e dolcetti. Il personale è sempre super gentile e premuroso pronto a indicarti le cose da fare o dove andare a mangiare. Le camere hanno il tipico arredamento inglese forte ma nel complesso armonioso. La colazione non è abbondantissima ma su richiesta e compreso nel prezzo ti fanno qualsiasi cosa. 
Questo hotel lo consiglio a chi vuole una sistemazione in centro, ma in una zona tranquilla, ama il confort ma anche la privacy, se passate per Londra andateci anche solo per dare un'occhiata.",5,2015,01,07

105,Stupendo hotel tipicamente Inglese,"Stupendo, bella la reception e molto cordiali al check in. Vicinissimo alla stazione di Green Park (5 minuti a piedi). Camere standard un po' piccole. Ambiente molto ovattato. Ottima pulizia e confort delle camere.",4,2014,08,22
105,Por fin un buen hotel en Londres,"Por fin hemos ido a Londres y hemos descubierto un hotel decente, los hoteles asequibles de Londres son malos y caros, el Chesterfield Mayfair esta muy bien situado para hacer turismo, en un barrio elegante y tranquilo, el personal es encantador (novedad en Londres), lastima que sea algo caro.",4,2014,06,29
105,Sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel für eine Städtereise nach London,"Wir würden das Hotel wieder für eine Städtereise nach London wählen. Es liegt ruhig und doch sehr zentral. Wir wurden überall sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend bedient. Das Zimmer war angenehm gross, gut eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Unser Zimmer lag zwar unmittelbar neben dem Lift, was zwar hörbar war, aber nicht störend; von anderen Zimmern hingegen haben wir nichts gehört. Unsere Erfahrungen im Chesterfield waren durchwegs positiv; das Hotel ist seinen Preis wert. Das Restaurant haben wir übrigens nicht benutzt; es gibt in Gehdistanz verschiedene Verpflegungsmöglichkeiten, z.B. auch für ein einfaches Frühstück; der Concierge hilft gerne weiter.",5,2014,06,11
105,Esperienza eccellente,"Ottimo hotel ubicato nell’elegante quartiere di Myfair.

Stanza silenziosa e finemente arredata completa di tutti i comfort prevedeva anche il servizio wi-fi veloce e gratuito. 

La colazione, servita in una location elegantemente British, è stata molto soddisfacente. Prevedeva sia il servizio al tavolo che il buffet con cibi dolci e salati di ottima qualità merito anche del Food Manager Sig. Biagio che ci ha proposto i tipici piatti della colazione inglese.

Tutto il personale è stato professionale ed impeccabile.  

Speciale menzione per il responsabile del Concierge dal quale ho ricevuto preziose e puntuali informazioni turistiche con affabile simpatia.

Se dovessi tornare a Londra, sicuramente ci ritornerò volentieri.",5,2014,05,09
105,Más de lo que esperábamos!,"El hotel nos sorprendió, la amabilidad de todo su personal es destacable. La ubicación resulto muy apropiada, el barrio es tranquilo y silencioso, ideal para descansar bien después de un día ajetreado. La habitación es cómoda, la amenities del baño excelentes, no faltó nada. La cama es excelente aunque podría ser más grande. Para el desayuno hay varias opciones, desde £9 en adelante, de lo contrario, hay varios bares muy lindos alrededor donde se puede desayunar más barato y muy bien. Tuvimos oportunidad de disfrutar del 5 o clock tea en el salón del hotel, excelente experiencia, gran variedad de tés y la pastelería riquísima. Todos los medios de transporte están muy cerca, con lo cual su ubicación fue estratégica. 100% recomendable!",5,2014,05,07
105,Excelente trato,"Hotel absolutamente recomendable, muy bien situado, en el barrio de Mayfair, cerca de los más importantes puntos de interés turístico de la ciudad, en una calle muy tranquila.  Las habitaciones confortables, con set de té y café, así como agua y algunas galletas, todo gratis.  Albornoces y zapatillas.  La cama extra grande.
El trato del personal absolutamente exquisito, extremadamente amables, educados y complacientes, uno de los dias de nuestra estancia llovia y no dejaron de insistir en que tomáramos suficientes paraguas de la recepción.  Siempre te recibian con una gran sonrisa, conseguian que te sintieras realmente bien.
Habia estado varias veces en Londres pero era la primera vez que iba a este hotel, sin duda repetiré y lo tendré en cuenta para recomendaciones.
Si hay que ponerle una pega, diria que se encuentra a faltar que el desayuno no esté incluido en el precio.  El importe del desayuno es un poco excesivo para la senzillez del mismo, si estuviera incluido seria correcto.  Pero esto no será óbice para que, como he dicho, vuelva a alojarme allí en mi próximo viaje a Londres.",5,2014,04,24
105,I dettagli che fanno la differenza !,"Soggiorno avvenuto dal 10 al 13 Aprile scorsi. 
Hotel 4 stelle trovato tramite recensioni di Trip Advisor.
Che dire, un'esperienza indimenticabile, difficilmente potrei cambiare hotel la prossima volta che torneremo a Londra e penso che questa recensione sia riduttiva rispetto a quanto vale veramente la struttura e, soprattutto, il personale che lo gestisce.
Posizione strategica (uscita metro Green Park) a cinque minuti a piedi da Buckingham Palace e pochi di più da Piccadilly.
Il quartiere di Mayfair, dove si trova l'hotel, è di alto livello e tranquillo anche la sera.
L'interno dell'hotel è arredato in stile tipicamente inglese, con mobili in stile, tessuti e tendaggi sontuosi. Al nostro arrivo il personale si è preso cura dei nostri bagagli e nel frattempo la reception ha velocemente fatto il check-in, fornendoci alcune informazioni riguardo gli orari della colazione, la possibilità di cena al ristorante e i luoghi di interesse attorno all'hotel. Avendo intenzione di provare la colazione inglese la ragazza alla reception ci ha gentilmente suggerito cosa poter assaggiare.
Consegnato a nostra figlia una borsina contenente materiale informativo dedicato ai bambini e due omaggi consistenti in una collana con ciondolo e sacchetto di caramelle.
Una mezz'ora dopo l'arrivo in camera la reception spendeva una telefonata per sapere se avevamo trovato la stanza di nostro gradimento (prenotato 'Mayfair Suite').
Nella stanza non mancava mai niente, la cura del dettaglio ha fatto la differenza: frigobar, vassoio con vari tipi di the, biscotti e bollitore. Ciabattine morbide (anche da bambino), due cabine armadio (una con asse e ferro da stiro, kit pulizia scarpe, sacchetti per eventuale servizio lavanderia, phon per capelli (non quelli che non asciugano), telecomando tv con sacchetto igienizzato,  ottima biancheria da letto, 3 cuscini a testa, morbidi ed ampi asciugamani.
Nulla da ridire sulla pulizia.
Ogni sera un'addetta ai piani ci faceva trovare preparati i letti per la sera, con le coperte rimboccate e cioccolatino.
La sera del 12 aprile, al ritorno in camera, abbiamo trovato una piacevolissima sorpresa: essendo a Londra per l'anniversario di matrimonio (e la reception lo aveva saputo!) ci hanno preparato due cupcakes al cioccolato e cannella e di cui allego fotografia, accompagnati da un biglietto di auguri sul quale ogni addetto alla reception ha scritto una dedica ! Ci ha emozionati molto e non ce lo aspettavamo proprio. Hanno saputo raccogliere le informazioni date trasformandole in un gesto veramente apprezzato.
Ottima colazione, indimenticabili gli 'eggs Benedict', bacon, salsiccia, pancakes, french toasts, pane tostato con varie marmellate e comunque anche la colazione internazionale era molto ampia e ottima.
Il giorno della partenza abbiamo avuto la possibilità di lasciare i bagagli nel deposito, così da goderci l'ultima mezza giornata prima del rientro a casa.
Qualche giorno fa abbiamo ricevuto a mezzo posta una lettera di cortesia da parte dell'hotel e, se già l'hotel e Londra ci mancavano, con questo ulteriore ultimo gesto si è saldato un filo che ci porterà sicuramente a tornarci.
Grazie ancora e a presto !!",5,2014,04,24
105,"Elegante.  Magnífica atención antes, durante y después de la estadía","Estuvimos allí de vacaciones en Noviembre 2013.   Después de hacer la reserva debimos cambiar las fechas de entrada y salida.   Para ello bastó una comunicación.   Antes de llegar pedimos que nos compraran desde el hotel entradas para el Royal Ballet.   Para ello bastaron 2 llamadas, la primera para pedirlo, la segunda para aprobar la compra.   Tuvimos una bella suite.   La atención fue excelente, tanto el servicio del concierge como la de los bell boys y todos.   El desayuno muy bien surtido, presentado y servido.   El hotel no es grande, es hermoso.   El barrio es refinado y seguro y con actividad nocturna que no esperábamos.    Desde el hotel se puede caminar a varios de los lugares céntricos de Londres, tiene el metro a 3 cuadras y taxis a la puerta.   Después de dejar el hotel, al llegar a casa vimos que se nos habían quedado varias pertenencias en a habitación.   Bastaron un par de llamadas para que el concierge se encargara de enviarnos todo por courrier a nuestro país.     En resumen un hotel refinado muy bien ubicado y con excelente atención.",5,2014,02,27
105,Very old british - aber top,"Das Chesterfield ist ein typisch englisches Hotel par excellence! Es ist zwar schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber es ist liebevoll, individuell und vor allem sauber! Tolles Frühstück, nette Bar, supernetter und hilfsbereiter Service - was will man mehr! Und die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt!!",4,2014,02,17
105,Ottima posizione,"Posizione davvero buona per esplorare il centro. L'albergo si trova a 5 min a piedi da Green Hill sulla linea blu. Piccadilly circus è a 15 min a piedi. L'albergo è nel vero stile British - le camere sono davvero piccole, con poco spazio dove appoggiare le cose (tolti tutti cuscini dal letto, il copriletto e non c'è più spazio per valigia). Il bagno invece è molto spazioso, con pavimento riscaldato.
Colazione nella media, nulla di eclatante. Per chi non gradisce english breakfast c'è poca scelta a buffet. 
Da notare la gentilezza e cordialità de personale, la stanza veniva sistemata ogni volta che uscivamo dall'albergo.
In ogni caso costa troppo per quello che vale.",3,2014,02,03
105,Buona posizione per visita turistica,"Sono stata ospite di questo hotel  nella prima settimana di dicembre e  mi sono trovata mediamente bene.Vicino a Piccadilly era  molto  comodo per  raggiungere tutte le  mete turistiche che io e i miei figli ci eravamo prefissati.Le  camere  erano piccole,arredate  in stile inglese naturalmene e pulite.Il riscaldamento era  fin troppo eccessivo, ma le finestre aperte lasciavano  entrare smog e rumore.Personale preparato e professionale,colazione  nella  norma , qualità prezzo  non economica.",3,2013,12,25
105,The quality at the top,Dopo un anno sono ritornato in questo british stile hotel. Personale sempre molto cordiale e pronto ad esaudire ogni piccolo desiderio. Camere pulite e sempre dotate di tutto il necessario dal caffè al pasticcino. Colazione al top con ampia scelta. Quando vado a Londra è un piacere passare al chesterfield ti senti a casa.,5,2013,12,15
105,Tradición Inglesa.,"Llegué al Chesterfield por un a tarifa corporativa que hizo más economica mi estadia.. Pero la verdad es que la experiencia va muy bien..  Me quedé en habitación 501cama Queen y pequeña para estándar latino pero comda y limpia.. Lo mejor el servicio de la gente. Siempre lista para ayudar.. Ojo. El ascensor esta un poco antiguo y aunque el primer día no funcionaba,  lo repararon y trabajo bien el resto de la semana.. ",4,2013,11,06
105,Fascino britannico,"Posizione centrale ma tranquilla nell'elegante quartiere di Mayfair,hotel con standard elevati e personale gentile e disponibile a soddisfare eventuali richieste.Merita le 4 stelle senza ombra di dubbio.Stazione della metro Green Park a circa 300metri.Ho alloggiato in camera superior ben arredata, come il bagno.Raccomando il ristorante interno Butlers che offre ottima cucina britannica ed internazionale ben presentata e con servizio impeccabile.Esperienza indimenticabile è di sicuro l'afternoon tea presso la sala con giardino sullo sfondo ( Conservatory ),svariate miscele di tea accompagnate da scones,tramezzini e prelibatezze varie.Hotel di classe,mediamente costoso ma, Londra si sa è cara.Il fascino britannico, come da titolo,ammanta tutta la struttura e per chi ama la old england ,questo albergo è da consigliare senza indugio,",5,2013,10,29
105,Teuer für Nichts,"London ist ein teures Pflaster, das weiß wohl jeder...aber dafür bekommt man auch meist einiges geboten...leider nicht hier. Zum Positiven: Besatzung ist wie überall äußerst freundlich und zuvorkommend und der Standort ist auch ganz ok, free wifi hat es auch. Mehr gibt es leider nicht zu berichten in dem Kapitel. Zur Schattenseite: Zimmer sind winzig, Einrichtung alt, Bad uralt, Teppiche müssten ersetzt werden und lösen sich vom Boden. Hellhörigkeit ist auch ein Thema und das alles ab ca. 350 Eiern aufwärts, Frühstück für 30 nicht inbegriffen. Na dann Prost...aber nicht in der Hotelbar.  ",2,2013,10,16
105,Gutes Stadthotel,"Schlechte Geräuschisolierung zwischen den Zimmern wie nach außen. Wir haben uns für ein Zimmer über Klima-/Lüftungsanlagen statt an der Straße entschieden.

105,Very British,"Negli ultimi 20 anni sono stata ospite diverse volte di questo delizioso hotel. Si respira l'atmosfera british in ogni dettaglio: dall'arredamento delle camere, alla stanza da bagno, alla reception, al ristorante, al bar. Il personale è discreto ed efficiente, la colazione è ottima e il ristorante offre una cucina internazionale molto accurata. E' situato al centro di Mayfair, quindi in una zona centrale molto tranquilla. Mi sento di consigliarlo a chi ha voglia di vivere Londra nella sua essenza.",5,2013,09,04
105,"Molta apparenza, ma buono.","Hotel in buona posizione a 200 mt. dalla stazione metro di Green Park che garantisce collegamenti con le zone più turistiche dalla città in pochissimi minuti. Quartiere silenzioso e tranquillo anche se non ideale per trovare un buon posto in cui mangiare (l'hotel ha, comunque, un buon ristorante). Ottima la vicinanza ai parchi per chi ama andare a correre o rilassarsi in tranquillità.
Le stanze non sono molto grandi e nella nostra era particolarmente scomodo l'accesso alle prese elettriche vicino al letto; non mi è piaciuta, inoltre, la libreria con volumi finti...la stanza, peraltro, era rumorosa: in particolare, ad intervalli regolari (3-5 min.), si sentiva il rumore di un ""motorino"" che si avviava, ma non siamo riusciti a capire da dove provenisse (forse il refrigeratore, perchè l'aria condizionata era spenta). Non c'è un frigo bar ma uno scomparto nell'armadio che dovrebbe tenere in fresco le bevande...
wi-fi ottimo e gratis, acqua e giornale gratuiti ogni giorno.
Il letto è comodissimo, la stanza è luminosa ma la presenza di dirimpettai costringe alla chiusura delle tende.
Lo staff è estremamente cordiale e disponibile e tutto è molto pulito e in ordine.
La colazione è buona ma non è quello che ci si aspetta da un hotel di questo tipo: manca il pane fresco, la frutta non è di prima qualità e neppure gli affettati sono speciali. La pasticceria, inoltre, è buona, ma ridotta al minimo. La cucina, comunque, è disponibile per quasi ogni richiesta.
Nel complesso molto buono ma, secondo noi e considerate altre esperienze, non abbastanza per il prezzo che si paga.",4,2013,09,01
105,Cena British....e servizio impeccabilmente fantastico!!!,"Eccoci quì....di lunedì sera, ma non un lunedì quasiasi per il Regno Unito e gli Inglesi, il lunedì in cui è nato il Royal Baby!!! e allora festeggiamo pure noi. Entrè per festeggiare con ottimo Cava Spagnolo, fresco e appena stappato, 3 antipasti che ci ha consigliato il Signor Loris Lucchini (a cui va una standing ovation per cortesia, efficienza, ottimo servizio e simpatiche chiacchere!!!! grazie)...gelato di Foie Gras, Salmone Scozzese e Irlandese, Capesante.Fois Gras accompagnato da confettura che si presenta alla vista e al gusto davvero ottimo, Selezione dei 2 salmone tagliata al tavolo e condita con piccoli capperi, bianco e rosso d'uovo, cipolla tritata finissima con accompagnamento un pane tostato e imburrato fragrante e gustoso, capesante al forno che l'unico difetto che avevano erano che finivano subito tanto che ci son piaciute! Poi per tutti Agnello (sempre sporzionato al tavolo) servito converdure bollite e saltate e accompagnato da salsa di ribes. Il vino consigliatoci molto azzecato, Pirata dalla Spagna. Uno spettacolo vedre ancora oggi lavorare alla lampada in sala alcuni dessert, carrello dei distillati ottimamente fornito e bello, location piena di fiori freschissimi e con arredamento tipicamente britannico di ottima fattura  e buon gusto.
Complimenti al simpatico Sommelier Ungherese per i consigli sui vini.
Grazie per averci fatto sentire delle Regine in un posto da Principi.",5,2013,08,01
105,Professionalità e cortesia,"Posizionato in un elegante quartiere londinese, l'hotel è arredato in stile old british. La suite che ho occupato con la mia famiglia aveva due  bagni, piccoli entrambi, ma dotati di ogni conforts ed estremamente utili anche per ridurre i tempi di preparazione. Ottima colazione, servita in una sala molto elegante, con cornetti, panini, frutta, salumi e piatto caldo, la tipica english breakfast.
Abbiamo provato anche l'afternoon tea, un po' caro, 32 sterline, ma molto buono.",5,2013,07,31
105,Excelente,"El hotel es sobrio y elegante, muy buena ubicación en el centro de Londres. El barrio de Myfair es uno de los mas elegantes de la ciudad y tiene a su alrededor todo lo necesario para el turista, desde un cómodo supermercado a un par de cuadras con varios restaurantes de variados menús y abiertos hasta tarde. El hotel cuenta además con un típico pub muy acogedor y tranquilo.
A pasos de Bond  y Oxford St. También muy cerca de estaciones de Subte de la esplendida red londinense.
En síntesis por su calidad de hotel, servicio y ubicación lo considero muy recomendable.
pero como siempre ""bucear"" su sitio web dará más precisiones al gusto de cada viajero.",5,2013,07,18
105,sehr britisch - altmodisch - perfekt,"Was für ein liebenswertes Hotel in Mayfair. Die Lage top, der Service sehr zuvorkommend, die Zimmer typisch für London, klein-aber fein. Zimmerservice perfekt. Super sauber. Unbedingt den Atfernoon tea im Hotel nehmen, lohnt sich wirklich. Man kommt gleich richtig an auf der Insel. Frühstück sehr gut. Man kann Continental oder Englisches Frühstück haben, daneben Buffet. Concierge aufmerksam, super freundlich, hilft mit vielen kleinen Tips. The Babbel ist gleich in der Nähe, 3 minuten rechts halten, kann man nicht verfehlen. Sonst auch viele kleine Pubs-eben typisch britisch. Das 3 für 2 Angebot wählen, dann spart man gleich ein wenig. Geld ist gut investiert für eine Unterkunft in London.",5,2013,05,29

105,Validissimo hotel in ottima posizione,"Durante  le festivita' pasquali ho soggiornato qualche giorno con la famiglia in questo relativamente piccolo hotel situato nell'elegante quartiere di Myfair, in una zona tranquillissima a 4/5 min. dalla fermata metro Green Park. Volendo si può raggiungere a piedi Piccadilly Circus in 15/20 min. L' hotel si caratterizza per lo stile (arredamento, ambienti, atmosfera.) tipicamente ""british"". Le camere standard sono di dimensioni contenute ma comunque assai confortevoli e ben pulite ( la moquette in questo caso va capita ed accettata). Ottimo ed abbondante l' english breakfast. Da provare anche il tè del pomeriggio. Assolutamente all'altezza anche il personale, gentile e disponibile.",5,2013,04,27
105,Un afternoon tea di qualita',"Siamo stati in questo hotel per il loro afternoon tea. Lo abbiamo scelto perche' pluripremiato come Tea Guild Award of Excellence nel 2011 e 2012.

105,Vintage,"A dicembre abbiamo soggiornato per alcuni giorni in questo bellissimo hotel vecchio stile. Bellissime le camere arredate vecchio stile british , la colazione ottima e abbondante.

buone le mele sul bancone del ricevimento...",4,2013,02,07
105,"Buon Hotel, ubicazione super tranquilla (ok gluten free!)","Abbiamo soggiornato una settimana con trattamento bed&breakfast.

Note positive:
- la posizione è incantevole, una zona davvero tranquilla e ""lussuosa""
- ottimi negozi e ristoranti in zona
- se avete problemi di celiachia...al Chesterfield sanno di che si tratta e garantiscono a colazione il pane senza glutine oltre a vari menù
- tutto l'arredamento è in tipico stile british, datato ma ricercato
- la pulizia è buona
- discrezione dello staff

Uniche note negative, a parte il prezzo un pò alto (in rapporto alla qualità), sono alcuni dettagli come la moquette (macchiata) e la mancanza del firgobar nelle stanze.

È vicino alla stazione metro GreenPark (5 minuti a piedi).

Tutto sommato è un Hotel che consiglierei !!",4,2013,01,07
105,Bel hotel e buoni servizi ma un sorriso un più non guasterebbe!,"Sono stato in questo hotel 4 giorni per lavoro, l'hotel è una buona scelta, ottima posizione centrale ma allo stesso tempo silenzioso e in zona tranquilla (residenziale di lusso), servizi vicini come bar, ristoranti, bancomat etc..ma cmq siete a due passi dalla regina.. quindi non vi manca nulla!
L'hotel e il soggiorno mi sono piaciuti, sarebbe auspicabile un sorriso in più dallo staff dell'hotel al desk. Sempre troppo seriosi. Ad ogni modo hanno esaudito tutte le mie richieste senza fare nessuna storia, quindi la sostanza cmq c'è!

A parte il discorso prezzi: gli hotel a Londra sono decisamente troppo cari, costa meno un 5 stelle in un altra capitale europea.. siamo all'inverosimile.. ma purtroppo è un malcostume di tutta Londra.. anche i ristoranti carissimi e spesso si mangia male..

In generale lo consiglio caldamente, ora sotto Natale poi era tutto decorato ed era una gioia entrare nella Hall col suo albero di Natale.

Evitate il primo piano interno, ci sono i condizionatori che sono un pò rumorosi all'interno del cortile (credo valga sia per l'estate che l'inverno).

Un plauso al letto, comodissimo, credo il più comodo che ho mai provato all'estero.. forse più comodo di quello di casa mia! pieno di grandi cuscini :-)",4,2012,12,08
105,"Super Hotel, hat aber seinen Preis","Wir buchten das Hotel Chesterfield Mayfaire für unseren viertägigen Trip nach London. Gebucht hatten wir das Suitenangebot 3für2. Daraus resultierte ein effektiver Zimmerpreis von ca. 330 Pfund pro Nacht.
Die Juniorsuite überraschte uns dann doch ein wenig mit ihrer geringen Grösse. Dafür war sie aber absolut sauber, schön hergerichtet und super ausgestattet.
Am Abend vor der letzten Nacht ergab sich ein Problem mit unserem Abfluss im Bad, woraufhin wir ein kostenloses Upgrade in die Duchesse-Suite erhielten. Diese war dann unvergleichlich grösser und Luxuriöser, kostet normalerweise aber auch fast 1000 Pfund pro Nacht.

Das Frühstücksbuffet war mit hochwertigen und frischen Zutaten bestückt. die Speisen, die man sich dazu bestellen konnte, waren ebenfalls alle sehr lecker.

Alles in allem kann man sagen, dass man für viel Geld auch viel geboten bekommt. Das Hotel ist gut gelegen, hat schöne und saubere Zimmer, dazu ist es ruhig, man schläft gut und das Personal ist sehr freundlich.",5,2012,11,20
105,"Eleganza, classe, posizione !","Siamo stati 10 giorni al Chesterfield Myfair, che abbiamo scelto per la posizione, per lo stile “british” e soprattutto per le ottime recensioni su Tripadvisor.
Questo hotel appartiene alla stessa proprietaria degli alberghi più quotati di Londra ed è gestito con massima cura e professionalità 
La nostra stanza King size era attrezzata con asse e ferro da stiro, oltre le prese inglesi c’era anche una presa standard in Europa (non occorreva l’adattatore). 
Oltre questo, nella stanza c’erano un bollitore, bustine (per farsi il thè, caffè, cioccolata calda), biscotti, acqua minerale (gasata e naturale)…
Quasi ogni giorno siamo stati coccolati con delle piccole sorprese che trovavamo al nostro rientro : frutta, cioccolatini, una scatola con caramelle, sali per il bagno…

105,MERAVIGLIOSO NEL QUARTIERE PIU' ELEGANTE DI LONDRA,"La nostra vacanza è iniziata stupendamente, perchè quando il taxi ci ha accompagnato all'Hotel Chesterfield Myfair di Londra, i nostri occhi brillavano dall'emozione nel vedere questo meraviglioso hotel ubicato nel quartiere più elegante di Londra.
Subito, è giunto un signore in uniforme rossa ad accoglierci e prendere i bagagli. Ovviamente con un eleganza e gentilezza che contraddistingue la popolazione inglese. Alla reception personale elegantissimo e genilissimo, subito pronto a darci qualsiasi informazione utile alla nostra vacanza. La hall veramente bella ed elegante, arredata con divani chesterfield, cassettoni antichi e dipinti davvero belli, ogni minimo particolare curatissimo, dai tendaggi alle composizioni di fiori strepitose. Una sala bar con pianoforte con divani e poltrone stile inglese, dove poter bere il the in perfetto stile. Una sala lettura arredata anticamente, con divani chesterfield color biscotto. Tutto curatissimo, poche volte mi capita di vedere hotel cosi perfetti.
La nostra camera era una Suite, che dire.......un gioiello di camera, con un letto oversize e un piumino morbidissimo, con una testata in legno antico, comodini e cassettone antichi con ripiano in cristallo, lampade in ferro battuto e cristallo, tendaggi molto pesanti in velluto giallo, oro e blu...due poltrone in cavallino nero con un tavolino in legno e cristallo. Un bagno enorme, con una vasca da bagno idromassaggio, un lavandino in marmo giallo  e un enorme specchio ubicato sia di rimpetto alla vasca che al lavandino, con una cornice color oro. Ripiani in cristallo , e rifiniture sia del bagno che della camera lussiosissime. Nella camera abbiamo trovato al nostro arrivo frutta fresca, cioccolatini e un teddy bear sul letto , una cabina armadio enorme, illuminata da faretti, calzascarpe e spazzola per la pulizia delle stesse, ferro da stiro con annessa asse, set da ufficio, tastiera pc, lettore ipod, tv lcd con internet tv, riviste, block notes e penne, un mini bar un set cortesia da spa, salviettoni di 4 misure , accappatoi, ciabatte imbottite ricamate, che dire.....una favola...La colazione servita in un salone enorme con tavole rotonde, tovaglie bianche e posateria in argento. Dal dolce al salato, uova con bacon e pomodori grigliati, fagioli con salsa, briosc, pane burro marmellate di ogni frutto, prosciutto cotto e salame, yogurt, frutta fresca, bibite, e per finire barattoli enormi con caramelle di ogni colore e gusto. Un hotel davvero elegante e unico nel suo stile, lo stile inglese...inconfondibile. Ci ritornerò sicuramente, e lo consiglio a tutti coloro che vogliono vivere una favola londinese.

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und hilfsbereit; man hat das Gefühl, dass keine Bitte zu viel ist. Die Zimmer sind schön und gut ausgestattet, und es wurde auch an Dinge, wie Tesafilm, Schere und Hefter gedacht. Die Betten sind sehr bequem, und man schläft gut.  Das Restaurant, in dem man alle Mahlzeiten einnimmt, hat eine angenehme Atmosphäre. Es ist - so wie alles in den öffentlichen Bereichen - stilvoll, und man mag sich dort gern Zeit für ein ausgiebiges Frühstück nehmen. Das Frühstück, eine Mischung aus Büffet und à la carte (für die warmen Gerichte) ist reichlich und abwechslungsreich. Leider sind die Kellner sind alle gleich gut, sprich gleich aufmerksam, aber das ist nur ein kleiner Wermutstropfen. Fürs Abendessen würde ich allerdings dort nur hingehen, wenn man ein entsprechendes Package gebucht hat. Die Qualität ist gut, aber wir finden es etwas überteuert. Die nächste U-Bahn-Station, Green Park, liegt zu Fuß ca. 8 Minuten entfernt, und man sollte sich vorher unbedingt auf einem Stadtplan den Weg anschauen. Das Hotel ist nicht schwer zu finden, aber man muss schon wissen, in welche Richtung man gehen muss. Ich bin nicht häufig in London, würde aber jederzeit wieder dort übernachten.",5,2011,11,26
105,"Klassisch, angenehm, englisch wie es sein soll","Ein Hotel, das die Atmosphäre eines englischen Landhauses mit der modernen Metropole in Einklang bringt, das dürfte selten zu finden sein. Schöne und gut ausgestattete Zimmer, herausragendes englisches Frühstück und ein Personal, das auch ein persönliches Wort zu sagen weiss, wer will mehr. Die Lage ist ideal, die Parks liegen in der Nähe wie auch Ladengeschäfte für alle Ansprüche oder - wenn auch etwas versteckt - der shepherd market  mit seiner dörflichen Anmutung.",5,2011,10,27
105,Sehr passendes Businesshotel im Old Style,"5 Gehminuten von der Station Green Park in einem ruhigen Quartier ein Hotel, welches sowohl für Businessreisende wie auch Privatreisende für ein gewisses Budget in Frage kommen kann. Keines dieser modernen und grossen Hotelbunkern, sondern fein, ""old Fashioned"" und gemütlich. Klar, nicht jedermanns Sache aber empfehlenswert. Anständiges Restaurant im Hause und an der Bar bekommt man auch kleine Dinge ...bemerkenswert die verschiedenen Club-Sandwiches und Burger Sandwiches.",5,2011,08,18
105,Un soggiorno favoloso!,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia per 3 notti al Chestrefield Mayfair: Meraviglioso! La posizione è invidiabile: nel quartiere centrale di Londra ma in una via bella e tranquilla. Appena entri respiri subito l'atmosfera tipica inglese. Arredamento classico inglese di gran gusto e molto caldo. L'albergo non è grande e molto accogliente. Il personale gentilissimo. Tutti elegantissimi. La camera (Duchesse suite) era splendida e con tutti i comforts (meglio che a casa). I letti comodissimi. Il ferro da stiro, gli ombrelli, la kettle e il the e caffè in camera, i candies per le bambine, il phon professionale.
Unico piccolissimo appunto: la lentezza del servizio al ristorante.
Per il resto tutto superlativo!",5,2011,05,30
105,La mejor atencion,"Nos alojamos con una amiga en  2 habitaciones de distinta categoria y en ambas apreciamos la calidad de este hotel.
Todos los detalles están previstos y son de la mayor calidad, incluido los desayunos.
Se respira una atmósfera de tranquilidad y relajación fuera del bullicio de ciertos hoteles americanos por ejemplo.
El barrio Mayfair es inmejorable en cuanto a seguridad y buena comunicación, a pocos metros de parques y avenidas muy concurridas como Oxford.
El hotel está pleno de buen gusto y categoría premium.",5,2010,09,06
105,Ein kleines Juwel,"Das Hotel Chesterfield ist ein kleines Juwel in Mayfair. Untergebracht in einem Townhouse wird man schon von der Athmoshpäre in der Lobby beeindruckt sein. Das sehr stilvolle Ambiente schlägt  sich auch im gediegenen Frühstückraum/Wintergarten nieder. Das Personal tritt sehr diskret und kompetent auf. Die Standardzimmer sind aufgrund der baulichen Gegebenheiten indidivuell groß und mit allem ausgestattet. Zu Fuß ist man sofort im Green Park, New Bond Street, aber auch die Oxfordstreet ist gleich ums Eck.",5,2010,07,04
105,Altenglischer Stil,"Wem der plueschige Stil eines Ritz Carlton gefaellt, der wird das Chesterfield Mayfair in London lieben. Es ist geradezu das Original, das vom Ritz (vielleicht verbessert) kopiert wird. Ueberall Oelgemaelde, Teppiche und antik anmutende Moebel. Dazu aufmerksamer Service und ein gutes English Breakfast. Die Lage in der Naehe der Park Lane ist sehr zentral.",4,2010,07,01
105,Super zum Übernachten,"Erster Besuch in diesem Hotel auf Empfehlung, und wir waren - abgesehen vom Afternoon Tea und Dinner - sehr zufrieden. Ausgesprochen freundliches und aufmerksames Personal an der Rezeption und beim Gästeservice; in London habe ich seinesgleichen noch nicht erlebt.
Zimmer ausreichend dimensioniert und gut ausgestattet, sehr sauber und gepflegt, ruhig und gemütlich. Sehr gute Matrazen und Kopfkissen.
Frühstücksauswahl gut. Es gab eine Auswahl vom Büffet und diverse Speisen auf Bestellung. Super Porridge!
Afternoon Tea: Durchschnittlich.
Abendessen: Qualität des Essens wird dem hohen Anspruch nicht gerecht, Service war durchschnittlich und eher unaufmerksam. Wir fühlten uns gehetzt, weil wenig zu tun war; Hauptgang kam fünf Minuten nach der Vorspeise.
Das Hotel schreibt sich Umweltschutz auf die Fahnen. Dennoch werden die Handtücher gewechselt, auch wenn man diese wieder aufhängt und nicht in die Badewann legt. Außerdem wird, auch wenn man nicht im Zimmer ist, die Klimaanlage eingeschaltet, und das bei geöffnetem Fenster, auch wenn man sie zuvor ausgeschaltet hat.
Übernachten würden wir dort wieder, aber nicht mehr essen.",4,2010,06,13
105,"Erstklassig, typisch ""british""!","Sehr familiäres Hotel mit klassischer britischer Atmosphäre. Ich kann das Hotel in jeder Beziehung empfehlen. Die Standartzimmer sind zwar, wie halt so üblich in Central-London, ziemlich klein. Ich hatte ein Wochenendarrangement gebucht und erlaubte für mich und meine Frau eine Suite. Wir genossen es sehr. Ideal ist natürlich auch die zentrale Lage.",5,2010,06,02
105,Bellissima la location a due passi da...,"Bellissima la location a due passi da Piccadilly. Io sono arrivato di notte e diciamo che l'accoglienza non e' stata così eclatante come descrivevano, diciamo standard. Di buon gusto gli arredi anche se un Po pesanti. La camera singola era davvero piccola. La pulizia era perfetta ed in generale l'hotel molto ordinato e pulito.",3,2010,06,01
105,splendido e perfetto,"Mia figlia ed io siamo state veramente fortunate a scegliere il Chesterfield. Raramente abbiamo trovato un hotel così perfetto in tutto, dall'arredamento delle camere alla pulizia, alla gentilezza e professionalità dello staff.  Ristorante ottimo e colazione abbondante. Il famoso ""five o'clock tea"" classico inglese è stata veramente un'esperienza deliziosa e consigliamo assolutamente di provarlo.Tutto al Chesterfield è perfetto e curato nei minimi particolari. Sicuramente ci ritorneremo con grande piacere!!!!",5,2010,04,17
105,una colazione strepitosa,"Sono in partenza per Londra domani .
Ormai è la terza volta che vado in quest'albergo e finora non mi ha mai deluso.
Le camere eleganti e molto curate non sono grandi ma  linea con quelli che sono degli ottimi standard londinesi, così come il bagno fornito di tutti gli accessori e con meravigliosi accappatoi  ed asciugamani.
Che dire della colazione ?  Eccellente con grande varietà di piatti a buffet ed alla carta  .
Il tè offerto dalle 14 alle 17 è in realtà un pranzo.
Entrambi serviti in deliziose sale
E' situato a Mayfair a cinque minuti a piedi dalla fermata Green Park.  
Il personale della reception è sollecito e gentile e per la prima volta ho trovato qualcuno all'estero che si sforzava di parlare italiano.
Il concierge Darren è persona di grande disponibilità, pronto a risolvere ogni problematica inerente a prenotazioni .
Il general manager Mr . Raggett  si addirittura è reso disponibile a riservarmi  un trattamento ""speciale"" in occasione del mio compleanno a marzo quando ho fissato un certo numero di stanze per me ed i miei ospiti.
Difetti finora non ne ho trovati.
Forse l'unico appunto che posso fare è che il servizio al ristorante (usufruito per una cena) è decisamente troppo lento.",5,2010,04,14
105,Il week end perfetto!!,"Andiamo spesso a Londra per fare shopping e normalmente soggiorno in un altro Hotel.Devo dire che tornerò di nuovo al Chesterfield perchè ci siamo trovati benissimo.Albergo molto bello, classico ma molto chic!!!La nostra stanza tutta in gessato cammello e beige era semplice ma al tempo stesso fantastica!Servizio impeccabile, pulizia, comfort e tranquillità!!!Abbiamo trovato tutto ciò che cercavamo!!!Torneremo presto!!!",5,2010,04,01
105,"Bell'albergo, splendida posizione","Ho scelto questo albergo dal sito web prima dal nostro viaggio a Londra.

La posizione è perfetta; si trova in un tranquillo qurtiere residenziale, vicino a Green Park Metropolitana e numerose attrazioni.

La camera era molto gradevole e pulitissima con decorazioni interno tradizionale Inglesi.

La colazione è anche ecellente con varie opzioni e molti piatti caldi.

Un vantaggio ulteriore è l'acesso gratuito a internet.

Sicuramente consiglierò questo albergo",4,2010,01,17
105,bell'albergo in buona posizione,"ottimo soggiorno, camere ampie, ci siamo trovati molto bene! bella la hall e le sale comuni... ci tornerei!
Anche lo staff e' stato disponibile e cordiale.",5,2009,12,24
105,So british!!,"L'ideale per tuffarsi nella magica atmosfera londinese.
Le stanze sono accoglienti, il personale disponibile e qualificato e Myfair è indubbiamente il quartiere più elegante della capitale britannica.",4,2009,10,27
105,Indimenticabile soggiorno al Mayfair,"Siamo Aldo e Rossella, una coppia di Torino. Il nostro soggiorno al Mayfair nel settembre 2009 é stato indimenticabile,
Abbiamo trovato personale estremamente cortese e disponibile in tutte le occasioni a venire incontro alle nostre richieste. La camera, assai spaziosa ed elegantemente arredata,  era del tutto corrispondente alle nostre aspettative; meravigliosa sia la sale della prima colazione, sia la colazione stessa. In quanto alla posizione: siamo a due passi da Hyde Park e da Piccadilly...
Torneremo presto in questo meraviglioso hotel, che consiglieremmo a chiunque ma sopratutto a chi ama un ambiente a nostro modo di vedere assai ""British"" e lontano da possibili ""omogeneizzazioni""  degli alberghi di catena.",5,2009,09,27
105,Very british!,"Abbiamo soggiornato al The Chesterfield per una settimana, ed è stata un'esperienza che ripeteremmo anche subito: l'albergo è molto bello, specie la nostra suite, la ""Grosvenor suite"", dove siamo stati trattati da re! Lo staff è gentilissimo ed ha sempre cercato di metterci a proprio agio, nonostante il nostro inglese non fosse proprio fluido...
Da ricordare anche la nostra cena al ristorante dell'hotel, dove si mangia benissimooo!!
Anche grazie a questa location la nostra vacanza londinese è stata indimenticabile.

105,Per un Weekend Romantico: 5/5,"Situato in una zona strategica  - Mayfair, a soli 3 min a piedi dalla stazione metropolitana più vicina (Green Park - sulla jubilee e victoria line ), a 5-6 da piccadilly circus e per i sushi lovers a 2 minuti da Nobu - e in un quartiere molto tranquillo, questo albergo è quanto di più riservato si possa trovare in città.
Ho soggiornato dal 7 al 10 dicembre 2006 per un weekend lungo in una superior double room. La stanza è comoda e spaziosa per due ospiti, dotata di scrivania, televisore (purtroppo non flat screen) e due poltrone. La toilette è dotata di vasca con doccia; il pavimento riscaldato ha senz'altro costituito una gradita sorpresa, così come gli accappatoi e le pantofole a disposizione.
Consiglio di prenotare un soggiorno con colazione inclusa, abbondante e di ottima qualità (due le opzioni personalizzabili, full english breakfast - uovo al tegamino, bacon, sausage e a scelta funghi, hashbrowns o baked beans - oppure continental): a buffet la scelta di brioches calde non si conta! (nota di merito per i muffins). 
Il prezzo è in linea con le tariffe degli alberghi della zona, ma la possibilità di prenotare diversi pacchetti di offerte direttamente sul sito e la cortesia di tutto lo staff fanno sì che questo albergo spicchi rispetto ai vicini Hilton e Park Lane Hotels.
L'unica segnalazione riguarda il ristorante: il setting è affascinante e  il servizio molto buono, ma il prezzo è elevato. Nella zona si possono trovare decine di destinazioni molto più consigliate.

105,te gusta que te hagan la pelota ????,"Clásico sitio en el que te recibe un portero con chistera, y a la hora del desayuno te sientan y te colocan la servilleta para que no te manches.
Pagas un huevo y la yema del otro, pero en Londres no te la puedes jugar. Hay hoteles de 150€ la noche que no están siquiera limpios.
Está bien situado para compras y salir de noche (Mayfair, justo detrás de Picadilly).
Si puedes reservar directamente desde la página del hotel, hay buenas ofertas con desayuno incluido. Posiblemente el mejor desayuno inglés al que yo haya tenido acceso jamás, de película.
Si te quieres permitir un capricho, es el sitio ideal. Si habitualmente viajas en hoteles de lujo, pues enhorabuena, otro más, supongo.
