142,Misgender,I just wish that they wouldn't assume a person's gender based on their names. My name is Lance and I am female. One staff called me sir maybe because he based his assumption on the name (stereotypically male). Maybe next time they could check first the gender of the celebrant and not assume based on the name.,1,2024,10,17
142,Wonderful stay at the Stafford,"Last month before embarking on a Viking Ocean Cruise of the British Isles, we stayed two nights at The Stafford on a pre-trip extension that we planned ourselves with the help of our travel agent.  He recommended three hotels for us to consider for our stay, and The Stafford was one choice.  We were very pleased with our choice of The Stafford.  From the greeting by the doorman upon our arrival until we left two and a half days later, we enjoyed our stay.  The staff was professional and friendly.  The concierge was very helpful.  We had asked for some recommendations and guidance on tours and restaurants before we arrived, and we were not disappointed in the recommendations that we chose.  

Our room was pleasant and comfortable.  We overlooked the entrance to the hotel on the second floor.  The hotel was very quiet.  The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job with our room each day. 

We had breakfast included in our plan.  The service was good, and the food was wonderful.  I enjoyed the best eggs benedict one morning.  The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, and the eggs were prepared just the way that I like them.  My wife had dinner there one evening on a voucher that the hotel gave us.  She enjoyed her meal very much as well.

The location in St. James was a plus also.  We were only a short walk from a stop on the Piccadilly line which made it easy to get around London.  We were only a fifteen to twenty-minute walk to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.  The lovely Green Park is adjacent to the hotel (through a walkway), and Buckingham Palace is only a short walk as well.

We wanted to stay in a hotel that would give us a taste of a British hotel, and The Stafford provided that to us.",5,2023,06,28
142,Excellent,This is our favorite hotel in London. In a great location. Convenient to everything!  The rooms are wonderful. Great bathroom and so clean!  Staff is amazing. The American  Bar is so nice. We love it. Coming back in December for daughters wedding. We always stay here when visiting our daughter.,5,2024,10,15
142,Finally!,"Faultess and first class in every respect.
Old world charm and comfort in a modern world is a rare thing, but The Stafford has achieved this in abundance.
The floral centrepiece is a wonder, the rooms and amenities a delight, the restaurants and bars joy and the service throughout make for a truly five star guest experience. 
The Stafford is withour doubt our hotel of choice in London.",5,2024,10,13

We have stayed several times over the past ten years, and it now feels like going home. 
Total luxury , without the glitz . So tastefully decorated.",5,2024,10,07
142,Quiet Luxury and Elegance,"My wife and I stayed at The Stafford London (room 322) as part of our 40th anniversary European tour from the U.S.   The hotel came highly recommended by our travel agent and it exceeded our expectations in every possible way.  It’s tucked away on a side street in the very fashionable Mayfair area, so it’s extremely quiet and secluded, yet close to everything you would ever want to see in London.  The staff could not be nicer, and treated us like we had been there many times before, despite it being our first visit.  The concierge, Alan, in addition to be being a fellow Arsenal fan, was phenomenal at offering helpful hints and advice.  The valet, Sergio from Ukraine, and our housekeeper from Lithuania could not have been nicer people, along with PK, the maitre-d’hotel in their five-star restaurant.  Personally, I don’t think you’ll find a better hotel experience within the heart of London!  (Tip:  ask for a tour of their 400 year old wine cellar).",5,2024,10,02
142,A Perfect High Class Hotel,"The Stafford was truly a 5 star Hotel.. It was beautiful beginning with the Lobby, dining area, and rooms.. all the way to the bathrooms with $5000 Toto Japanese toilets. The service at the front desk and the dining room was perfect, friendly and did whatever you asked of them . I would absolutely come back to this hotel.",5,2024,09,28
142,Our Home when in London,"The Stafford has maintained its high standards as in our past stays and is how we measure other hotels on our travels.  The staff are friendly, welcoming, helpful and attentive.  The location is quiet and excellent for walking to London sights, restaurants  and museums.  Room amenities are of very good quality.  Our meals (breakfast and at the American Bar) were very good.   This is the only place we will stay when in London.",5,2024,09,26
142,A very pleasant stay at the Stafford.,"The Stafford is a very well run hotel and is justifiably quite popular.  Our recent stay of twelve days gave us many opportunities to interact with the staff and use hotel services.  Responses to our requests were consistently prompt, courteous and competent.  We also enjoyed The Game Bird restaurant and the ever popular American Bar.",5,2024,09,25
142,All Around Five Star Experience,"Everything about The Stafford was impeccable.

142,The Stafford is our home away from home,"As always The Stafford does feel like home. Beyond the quality of the rooms and all entailed there and the outstanding food and beverage in all venues the staff is so warm and friendly and always looking to help or just have a nice conversation. We love the location as it is within walking distance of great shopping, touring, and Green and Hyde Parks. It will remain our first choice every time we come to London.",5,2024,09,21
142,Fabulous.,"Staff friendly and very attentive.Food and drink fabulous.Every time we stay it's like coming to our second home.Rooms are clean, spacious and have all the facilities we expect from a 5 star hotel.Tucked away in a quiet spot away from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly.",5,2024,09,20
142,London's Hidden Gem!,"We’ve found our new favorite hotel in London – a true hidden gem! As the saying goes, ""location, location, location."" This hotel is nestled on a quiet, historic street just steps away from St. James's Place and Clarence House, the residence of the Royals. You can even slip through a private entrance into Green Park and get to Buckingham Palace. Plus,  it's only a 15-minute walk to Piccadilly and the theater district! Right across the street, you'll find Spencer House and Winston Churchill’s former residence. Incredible!

The hotel has a rich history—it was once home to Earl Spencer in the 17th century. The rooms and accommodations were impeccably clean and luxurious, exactly as we had hoped. The staff was warm and welcoming, and we ended up enjoying several meals at the hotel—the food and service were that outstanding.  Don't fight the crowds at other hotels...The Staffords's Afternoon High Teas is amazing! We can’t wait for our next stay.",5,2024,09,17
142,This is the place to stay in London,"There are hotels you walk into in London that take your breath away.  The Stafford goes beyond that because the welcome, the rooms, the bed, the service will actually make you breath easier.  Everything about this hotel is ""just right"".  The location, the understated luxury, the breakfast service, the warm greetings from the doorman, the quietness of the street (just one block away from the bustling city), the great vibe at the American Bar, the secret tunnel to Green Park, the accessibility of public transportation from Green Park Station, the easy walk to incredible shopping and restaurants, the short walk to Buckingham Palace and other tourist attractions.  This is the place to stay in London.",5,2024,09,15

142,Excellence in a Hotel!,"The service is top-notch at the Stafford. When we arrived, our room was ready as they had asked for our specific arrival time. The staff member walked us to our room and proceeded to give us a full tour of our room and technology. The room was luxurious, and the beds supremely comfortable. Every staff member was nice and helpful, and the hotel itself is very quiet, yet in an amazing location just next to Buckingham Palace. I hope to visit again soon",5,2024,09,04
142,Great place to stay,Great hotel in the heart of London. Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Rooms are quite comfortable and the service is great. Would be nice if they had a pool but definitely not an issue. The in house restaurant is quite good and convenient. Highly recommend this hotel,5,2024,08,19
142,Wonderful stay at the Stafford,"Our experience was outstanding.  Excellent staff and location.  We had a pre-theater dinner at the American Bar—great recommendation from the concierge.  We were a large group and congregated in the American Bar  most nights after dinner.  They were very accommodating and drinks were top notch.  I’m a big fan of water pressure in the shower and the Stafford had that, but I wish the shower was a little larger. We will definitely return!",5,2024,08,17
142,So warm & cosy  and yet polished,"This hotel stands out , it’s what a hotel should be. Welcoming & friendly yet efficient and polished .  The rooms are lovely , we had a master mews suite, it was so spacious and well equipped, with attention to detail  It’s  luxurious in an unpretentious way

But I want to point out that the service, food and specially the staff were impecable!  They were there for our big family in every possible way and in the best attitude !

Staff was courteous and accommodating.  Had room service which was wonderful, but looking forward to trying the restaurant at our next visit.",5,2024,07,14
142,"great staff, we would eagerly return","We stayed at the Stafford last month, and what an experience. From the moment we arrived me and my wife felt like we was part of the Stafford family. The staff are incredibe.
We had a small hiccup with the air conditioning in the room, and as hospitality workers, we understand that these things happen and often times cannot be avoided. What we appreciated the most was the professionalsm and kindness of the staff, they was genuinely concerned for us! Once we alerted them to our discomfort, kelsea and another receptionst (that i sadly did not get the name of) sprung into action and moved us right away. They even had multiple different options in different parts of the hotel to suit our preferences! 
We ended up having a lovely remaining couple of days at the Stafford, we had great recommedations from the concierge paul for dinner, and actually the hotel has a great American bar on sight, but it does get busy so perhaps worth pre booking.

A fantastic hotel, with top quality staff. We would eagerly return if we are in London again.",5,2024,07,09
142,Birthday Celebration at The Stafford,"My wife and I took a trip to London to celebrate her birthday, and we are so glad that we chose The Stafford for our accomodations! Kelsea and the rest of the concierge and guest relations teams went above and beyond to ensure that my wife had the best time and felt super spoiled! They baked a Victorian sponge cake and had it waiting in our room, which they also upgraded for us free of charge as a surprise! We were so stunned!

The room was spacious, stylish, and comfortable, and our bathroom was very luxurious - hard to find in London! The bed was also very comfortable as well. 

In addition, the American Bar was a delightful surprise with a huge list of crafted cocktails and high-end spirits. Great place for a pre-dinner drink!

The breakfast was well-priced and delicious. I especially recommend the french toast!

Thank you to everyone at the Stafford for making this such a special trip! We look forward to staying with you again!",5,2024,07,04
142,Best of Old and New,"We stayed at the hotel many years ago. They have kept the quality and style of old while touching up the physical aspects. Restaurant is lovely, the courtyard is a fun place to hang out, and the bar first rate. the location is good for walking about town. Unqualified recommendation.",5,2024,06,30
142,Wonderful stay at The Stafford,"We loved staying at the Stafford. We had a very well appointed accessible room and the staff were a wonderful help. They went beyond the call to help my husband when needed. Both the Game Bird and the American Bar had excellent food and great ambiance. Afternoon tea was elegant and room service prompt. The location is marvelous and walkable to many sights, yet on a quiet street so we hardly knew we were in the city. Check out Spencer House on a Sunday, just down the block. We stayed at this hotel many years ago and can say that it is still where we would choose to go again.",5,2024,06,23
142,Superb!,"Once again, we enjoyed world class service in elegant surroundings.   Our home away from home whilst in London is always a highlight of our journey.  We have stayed at The Stafford London many times over the years.  Be assured that we shall return!",5,2024,06,17
142,Nice stay,"We were at the Stafford for 3 nights in a deluxe room. Nice venue, very quite, quite comfortable. Very attentive reception and door staff. Pleasant stay. Very close to Green Park, the tube and plenty of cafes and pubs in the area. Very pleasant bar, but not that cheap.",4,2024,06,16
142,Exceptional stay at The Stafford,We had a great experience at The Stafford Hotel. Everything was first class from the staff to the accommodations to the food and service. The Stafford is elegant and sophisticated yet cozy and charming. The personal touch was discernible. Gunter welcomed us and acquainted us with the hotel. He made sure everything was just right.,5,2024,06,09
142,Absolutely Fabulous!,"What an absolutely lovely hotel! 

We really did love every minute of it. The Reception and Guest Relation ladies really are a treasure… 

The Afternoon tea is also very nice, and The American Bar is stunning.

We have recommended the Hotel to all of our friends, and family and cannot wait to go back! 

Thank you all!",5,2024,06,09
142,"Highly recommend, great bunch of staff!","From the moment we walked in we were greeted and treated exceptionally. From the Porters, to reception and guest relations, to restaurant staff….Special shout out to Kelsea, Katerina, Gunther and Jiacomo. 
What a fantastic hotel, will be returning!",5,2024,06,08
142,Inauspicious beginning overcome by the best service.,"We have stayed at The Stafford many times over the years and have always found it to be a “home away” in London. But this trip started out so poorly. We arrived just before noon, greeted by name by the doorman, and we met up with a front desk clerk. She had obviously not read our guest record and proceeded in a lengthy scripted speech to inform us about our the hotel and our reservation. The room was not ready and she said that she would call or text when it was. So, we retired to the American Bar for a delightful lunch to and get reacquainted with staff we had know on previous stays. 14:00H arrived without a call - so we returned to the front desk and met up with a different lady who in a most unfriendly manner informed us that check in time was 15:00H but that she would see what could be done to accelerate room availability, that we should wait in the small lounge and she would advise when the suite was ready. 14:55H came and having heard nothing we returned to the same lady and were then informed “Oh your suite is ready.” All this for a Virtuoso rate booking on which the hotel assigned in writing “early check-in and late check-out priority”. There was no priority, there was indifferent communication and there were other than welcoming attitudes on the part of two members of the front desk staff. We were so affronted by the manner of treatment that we told the friendly front man whom we have known for a long time, when he delivered the luggage, that we were seriously considering not returning - he must have kept the information to himself. The remainder of the stay was the usual efficient, delightful and friendly service , a clean, well appointed and comfortable suite and what one would expect of a five star hotel. To us it highlighted an issue of hospitality management that the behavior and attitude of a small number of staff can taint the reputation of an otherwise impeccable hotel.",4,2024,06,08
142,"A fine hotel, well worth the price","Having just completed our second stay here, the Stafford is now our favorite hotel when we visit London. Located on an untrafficked cul-de-sac a block from Green Park, the hotel is quiet and exudes old-world elegance.  Staff is always ready help with recommendations or arrangements. We spent four nights on our most recent visit and would gladly do the same again.",5,2024,06,01
142,Superb Hotel with a great manager and staff!,"Great hotel and the staff is superb! Having stayed at the Stafford a few times before, we decided to make a last minute reservation online and on arrival found that we had neglected to indicate our preferences.  The hotel manager, Gunther, jumped right in and did not stop until he found us the perfect accommodation. He even had flowers delivered to our room.",5,2024,05,22
142,"Fantastic hotel since 1912, with a superb location","Fantastic typical “English style” hotel, with an amazing location and perfect rooms with a/c. Great bar including outdoor courtyard, the bar staff was outstanding. I’m sure we’ll return. If I should mention one thing that could be improved is the breakfast setup. Á la carte FWIW, and £1.50 for a single slice of toast… get B’fast included in the room price or make it a fixed price. I’m sure it keeps some guests away and the restaurant is very nice.",5,2024,05,22
142,My favourite London Hotel.,"The Stanford doesn’t disappoint.  The location, amenities and service are excellent.  Once again, I enjoyed this Chic Hotel.  The American bar is memorable experience.   The staff are very helpful and professional.  I love the close location to Green Park and Buckingham Palace",5,2024,05,15
142,"Great hotel, shame about the admin","The Stafford is a great hotel, having stayed a few times I’d recommend it to anyone staying in London looking for a quality hotel in a great location.

However I’ve been left a little disappointed recently as my credit card was charged by The Stafford TWO YEARS late without any notification. 

This caused me a lot of stress as I assumed it was fraud - and despite me sending multiple emails to the hotel manager I have not even received a response, let alone a satisfactory one. 

It’s really poor admin to be charging guests years afterwards.",3,2024,05,07
142,"Without question, best Hotel, best Bar and a great restaurant","I have stayed several times here over the past few years. I have eaten in the Game Bird many times. At one point, the American Bar was a second home to my lager associate and I. 

The Stafford is classy, understated. The staff are superb. I can’t stress enough how good this place is. The courtyard is amazing; thankfully we are getting back to summer so it can be enjoyed. 

If you want to show a friend, colleague, or partner, that you are stylish with a bit of money, this is the place to be. 

AWESOME.",5,2024,05,02
142,Sleepless night because of machinery noise,"Pros: it’s a great central location and no right on the street so theoretically quiet. We walked past this hotel for years before we moved out of London on our way to 67 Pall Mall, the fab wine club. 

Cons: we had a terrible night sleep because of continuous machinery noise. At first we thought it was a helicopter outside but it continued all night. We were in room 603 on the top floor and I guess it was air conditioning condenser units on the roof. There was a low frequency vibration all night and it sort of started and changed, presumably as different units started and stopped. I tried using my apple noise cancelling earbuds but it didn’t help much.  Both my wife and I had the same experience. Based on this experience we could not recommend this hotel. A good nights sleep is the minimum requirement for a hotel, especially in this price range. It was also a bit disappointing that, despite reporting the issue in the morning, the hotel hasn’t responded to us.",2,2024,04,24
142,The Stafford Continues to Impress,"We returned from a week in London at the end of March.  Although I can't actually give The Stafford credit for the really lovely weather we had during the week, I can give the entire team full credit for their warmth, their enthusiasm for their profession, and the care and attention they gave us.  This was our 7th stay at the Stafford and it is incredible that they consistently maintain such a high level of service.  We really do feel that we are coming home every time we set foot in the hotel.  The American Bar is our favorite spot to begin and end an evening.  The drinks are creative, delicious, and beautiful thanks to Salvatore and Benoit.  Salvatore taught me how they create a lemon peel origami-like garnish--truly a highlight of the trip for me.  This level of personalization is what makes The Stafford our favorite hotel in the world.  We are always sad to leave, and always eager to return.",5,2024,04,09
142,"Very welcoming, lovely staff","Some people are used to dining in high class establishments. 
We are not!

This was a very special treat for my wife's 60th birthday. We went for Afternoon Tea.

Every member of staff made us feel very welcome. They were all very professional but also polite and friendly. 

At no time did we feel that we were ""intruding"".

Because of the service we received and the friendliness of the staff, we both enjoyed our afternoon tea very much. The food & selection of teas were excellent.

The surprise ""Happy Birthday"" plate was also a very nice touch & much appreciated. The lady who brought it to our table also sang ""Happy Birthday"" which was very kind.

So, thank you to everyone who helped with making the arrangements (Kristina) and for providing excellent service on the day.

We both had a lovely time.",5,2024,04,08

142,A wonderful experience,My stay at The Stafford was wonderful! The staff at reception were kind and helpful; Benoit in the American Bar was so gracious to give me a summary of his experiences and friendship with Nancy Wake; and the time spent with Cesare looking at the wine in the vault and the WWII museum was very interesting and much appreciated. I am so grateful for the effort and time that everyone at The Stafford gave to make my stay there memorable. Thank you.,5,2024,03,04
142,Welcome Home,"Another excellent stay at this wonderful hotel.  When staff say welcome home they mean it!

My husband and I have stayed here regularly if not frequently for the last 10 years and it never disappoints.  From the location, the American Bar to the Game Bird - all are excellent but ultimately what makes this hotel stand out from many other excellent London hotels is the Staff.  Without fail everyone is friendly and helpful and that is what keeps us coming back.

Our resolution for 2024 is to spend more time in London and when we do it will be at The Stafford.",5,2024,03,03

142,Lovely welcoming hotel full of character.,"Just celebrated my husbands 80th birthday at the Stafford. We arrived to champagne and a birthday cake in our fantastic suite which was such a lovely surprise!
Our rooms were comfortable and airy and very welcoming, we had everything we could possibly need there. Ned and his staff are amazing, they went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay, always asking if we were ok and did we need anything. We even got a tour of the cellars from the Sommelier, the history of which was fascinating . The breakfast was delicious, hot and plentiful, served by such pleasant, courteous waiters/waitresses.
This lovely hotel is central to all that London has to offer and is so comfortable we didn’t want to leave. But we will be back!
Thanks to everyone for making it such a special and memorable visit.",5,2024,02,28
142,An oasis of calm,"An oasis of calm in the hurly-burly of central London. It’s been five years since my last visit but I continue to be charmed by this serene and atmospheric hotel. The rooms are well- appointed and comfortable;the breakfasts comprehensive and delicious; the service as always friendly and impeccable despite the hotel being almost fully booked when I was there. And, importantly for me as a solo female traveler, I was treated with utmost courtesy and respect by the staff in all areas. Oh, and did I mention the gin martini……",5,2024,02,24

Will return most definitely!",5,2024,02,20
142,"Perfect, yet again!!","The Stafford Hotel is an incredibly special place.  My husband and I have been celebrating my birthday for the last 10 years by spending 5 days in London and staying at the Stafford Hotel.  Our experience at the Stafford has been exceptional.  It never disappoints!  

Everything about our experience at The Stafford is exceptional.  We book the same (or similar) room every year.  The beds are incredibly comfortable and the lush towels and robes are divine.  When entering our room we are greeted by a celebratory bottle of champagne. Initially there was a mix-up in our room.  Alba, one of the receptionists was wonderful…she changed our room without skipping a beat, and with charm and grace.

The staff is interpersonally gifted.  The moment we entered the hotel we were greeting by Alex saying “welcome home!” setting the stage for a perfect birthday celebration. Every morning we are greeted by smiling – and familiar faces.  (It also makes a positive statement about the staff experience that most of the staff has been at The Stafford for many years.  In the morning we look forward to speaking with Alex (who is Scottish) and Tom, who serves as the concierge.  Tom was incredibly helpful in getting tickets to plays and museum memberships.  Both men always greet us with a smile and a twinkle in their eyes.

The food at the Stafford is excellent.  Breakfast is bountiful and soo good!  We always celebrate my birthday dinner at the Game Bird.  The food is exceptional, and the as is the service.  The waitstaff were thoughtful and attentive.  Francesca’s, the head of the team that served us was truly lovely.  Her smile was so warm and inviting, and we had a lively discussion about the differences between her native Dominican Republic and her experience of now living in London.

Other reviews have mentioned how wonderful the Stafford’s location is…and it is, close to the tube and within walking distance to the Palace, Piccadilly Square, Bond and Oxford streets and many other places of interest.  What is really wonderful about the location is it its hidden down a quiet, beautiful street.

There was absolutely nothing that I would have changed about our experience at the Stafford…AND…we are already looking forward to next year!",5,2024,02,17
142,Looking forward to coming back!,"I had been visiting and importantly enjoying The American Bar since 1980's and used the restaurant for lunches and dinners in the past ten years. Always reliably great and fun. Now I live permanently overseas I had often considered The Stafford as great location to be based when returning to the UK to catch up with friends. I absolutely made the right decision. It is outstanding. The location is perfect for most destinations on foot and the public transport links are immediate and excellent. But the hotel has old London charm with fine service and food. Better than I could have imagined and I have stayed in some outstanding places around the world. 
The Stafford has a great natural energy from the bar and dining room, but also offers perfect  tranquility from its position in serene St. James's. No early morning ( or evening) noise and the cobbled courtyard was perfect for a morning coffee, even in the middle of winter. But it was the staff who made my stay so good. No delays servicing the room, allergies noted and addressed correctly when dining and t is a spotlessly clean and tidy property. I cannot wait to return",5,2024,02,16
142,A hidden gem!,"The Stafford Hotel is a hidden gem. 
A little oasis of calm and tranquillity on the edge of Green Park, a short walk from Green Park Underground Station.
We arrived late in the day and were given a weary-traveller welcome by Ned on reception. His welcome was warm and kind and reflected the warmth, cosiness and elegance of the décor. 
Having  showed us around the hotel and explained a little about the history of the hotel and it's recent developments, he kindly showed us to our room where we were met with considerate gifts for my husband's birthday. It made his birthday and our weekend special in a way that we were not expecting.
Ned showed us the workings of the room and offered advice about the hotel and surrounding area.
We went to a show in nearby Piccadilly and afterwards enjoyed cocktails in the snug American Bar situated downstairs and the back of the hotel.
Our room was really cosy. In the morning we luxuriated in it's quiet surroundings, reading the lovely magazines and helping ourselves to complimentary coffee. 
Personally, within the short stay, I felt revived.
My husband and I have stayed in many lovely hotels around the world. In our opinion, The Stafford ,with it's professional and welcoming staff, has the X-factor.
We look forward to our return visit.",5,2024,02,14
142,The best experience ever!,"The best hotel in London! I travelled with my boyfriend and we both had the most wonderful experience.

first I would like to say something about the staff.. the best ever! They took care of everything and gave the best advice and treatment. 
A special thanks goes to Alessandra for being the one who showed us every way to experience London in the short time we had. The best advice, the kindness, the professionalism are just a few things I could say about miss Sandra. We also had the chance to eat at the restaurant (wonderful also). Alfonso and David took care of us serving some delicious food and Lucia showed us with passion and an expert view every choice of wine the restaurant had. During our dinner we also tasted some cocktails, my boyfriend’s also a bartender and he was very pleased with those drinks! Bravissimi tutti!
 We got the Junior Suite, and it was better than I could ever imagine. The suite was bigger than it looked in pictures and had his own entrance. They greeted us with a bottle of champagne and the room was full of everything you could ever need. As someone born and living in Italy the espresso machine was a MUST! 
The double service bathroom has both a bathtub and a shower.
If you’re planning to visit London, I would definitely recommend to stay at the Stafford London! Bravi!",5,2024,02,07
142,Love the Stafford!,"Our stay at the Stafford was wonderful! Cannot overstate how friendly and accommodating everyone was. The hotel, dining, room, and location were on point — exceptional! Highly recommend the afternoon tea as well. We look forward to returning!",5,2024,01,16
142,What a good hotel should be.,"The Stafford Hotel is simply what a good hotel should be. It offers comfort in its surroundings as well as its rooms. The staff are the most helpful, friendly and cheerful you would wish to meet. The phrase ""nothing is too much trouble"" means just that. I recently had an overnight stay here to meet my son to celebrate my birthday. My room was lovely and warm on coming in from a snow fall. The bed, bedding and pillows were all extremely comfortable. To top everything off, complimentary wine and cake were waiting for me. A really lovely touch, especially as I was travelling alone. I am so glad I chose the Stafford Hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again and would recommend the hotel to anyone. Finally, I inadvertently left an item in the room when I left and mentioned it in the feedback form I wrote out at reception. The very next day, Sadia from the hotel contacted me to offer assistance. What service, but no more than I would have expected from such a lovely hotel. Thank you, The Stafford Hotel, for a really lovely stay.

Mrs Susan Wilson.",5,2024,01,13
142,Excellent hotel and staff,"The staff and amenities are the very best. We felt pampered, yet no one hovered. The concierge staff made excellent reservations for meals, tickets for a show, and a day-long guided tour. Even one of the bellmen suggested that we take a tour of the Spenser House, just down the street. It’s only open on Sundays, and we were delighted that we took the tour! Food, waitstaff, and housekeeping are all  excellent. And the location is wonderful.",5,2024,01,11
142,PROPER 5 STAR LUXURY IN A GREAT PART OF LONDON,"We keep returning to The Stafford London, the phrase by all staff when you arrive ""welcome home"" says it all, every member of staff goes out their way to make sure everyone feels at home and is part of this proper 5 star plus hotel experience. 
The hotel set in the heart of London 250 metres from Green Park Tube Station and Mayfair shops etc but away from the hustle and bustle of city life is luxury and efficiency personified. Lovely personable staff, beautiful bedrooms and public rooms and excellent service make The Stafford so special. We were there for 6 nights over the New Year period and just loved living in ultimate luxury at such a poignant special time of the year. If you're going to London and looking for somewhere special to stay, I highly recommend The Stafford you will like us keep returning. THANKS we will be back",5,2024,01,08
142,Love the location,"This has been our home away from home when in London.
We always have 3 rooms and love this hotel.
Our stay was a bit spoilt  by the reservation manger. She would not help with the four nights being linked and we had to move rooms. We wanted to pay for an upgrade to avoid the room change but there was no help. I called so many times before our visit to try and sort this and spoke to her. I nearly cancelled because of her lack of help. We were hoping on arrival there would be help in person but sadly there was not. I felt very dismissed and her treatment was very rude for this lovely hotel. Also, she did not acknowledge we were returning guests. 
All the other staff were amazing. Loved the concierge and all the other staff we met. They were top notch they all went above and beyond and were all wonderful. 
The location and american bar are amazing a really beautiful London hotel.
Love the hotel though and the kindness of the staff..

142,Yet another first.,"This was another excellent visit to the Stafford. The ambience of the hotel in the run-up to Christmas was super. As ever our stay was first class with excellent service, food and wine. What more can one want ... another stay! We're back in December this year. Perfect!",5,2024,01,03
142,Wonderful christmas time,"My husband and I stayed at the Stafford for our wedding anniversary in December.
The warm welcome we received was lovely, from the doorman to the reception staff.
We were a little early and was offered a cup of tea.
We were then taken to our room, which was a suite in the mews.
It was a beautiful large and very comfortable place to stay.
I told the hotel that it was our wedding anniversary and there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us.
The breakfast the next day was delicious.
The only thing was we had to wait about half an hour and when it arrived my poached eggs were over done.  I could have sent it back but we had a train to catch and I was worried about the time.
Overall it was a 5 * experience.
Thank you ",5,2024,01,02
142,Our favorite hotel when we visit,"We visit London often, and when we do, we stay at the Stafford. We are repeat customers for a reason. Conveniently located in the city, this hotel is a luxurious oasis. The staff is extremely attentive and kind; the rooms have are comfortable and have all the amenities, and the American Bar is one of our favorite spots in all of London. The bedding in our rooms is the most comfortable I’ve ever experienced. We’ve  recommended this hotel to friends and they’ve loved it as well. Would highly recommend staying at the Stafford. ",5,2024,01,01
142,"A hidden gem, perfectly understated…..","We loved our stay at the Stafford. Fabulous location, tucked away, nice and quiet, very discreet. Staff were extremely helpful, friendly, courteous and professional. Do not expect huge rooms, this is central London, it’s an expensive city. But they are very nice rooms, well appointed with all amenities and first class bedding. We were very comfortable. Extensive breakfast menu, you won’t go hungry! Lovely dinner menu and an excellent wine list. And the American Bar is legendary. There was nothing we didn’t like. We went to spoil ourselves for a few days and it may become an annual event! Thank you to the entire team at the Stafford, we work in hospitality and appreciate all the hard work. Happy New Year!",5,2023,12,31
142,The perfect spot for our London Christmas adventure,"The Stafford was everything we hoped for when we planned a whirlwind trip to London at Christmas time. The location within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster, etc. was perfect for nighttime walks to see the lights. We were greeted as if we were old friends, even though this was our first time there. The staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. I was very impressed with our room. The Stafford may be in an old, historic building, but everything was beautifully updated. The bathroom was an absolute marvel of modern fixtures and marble surfaces, and immaculately clean. Our room was lovely, as well, and I especially appreciated the D’Longhi  espresso machine right there in the room. (A tea service is available on request.) We arrived late the first night and had no dinner reservations but the American Bar downstairs found a spot for us because we were hotel guests. We enjoyed the experience there so much we went back for drinks the next night as well.

We are hoping to visit London again in the near future and we will absolutely book the Stafford again.",5,2023,12,28
142,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here on our wedding night - the team were v kind and generous, making a number of small touches to our stay to make it so memorable. Fantastic hotel and service, in such an excellent part of London",5,2023,12,27
142,Excellent holiday stay,"Had an excellent stay at The Stafford while in London for the holidays. The rooms, the service, the amenities and the location were superb. The hotel is very cozy and charming. Will definitely be back! ",5,2023,12,26
142,Another excellent stay at The Stafford,"Simply put, The Stafford can't be beat!  We travel to London several times a year and The Stafford is always our hotel of choice.  The staff, the facilities, the rooms, and the amenities are always excellent. We've tried several of the other ""big name"" hotels over the years but we always come back to The Stafford.  It is simply the best.  I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to London!",5,2023,12,21
142,Excellent Hotel,"My Wife and I have stayed at the Stafford a couple of times before, and it is truly a lovely Hotel, that is why we chose to celebrate Kaye's Birthday here, and again it was outstanding.
From the welcome at the door, the front of house staff, and the waiters, all of whom are friendly and polite.
The position of the Hotel down a quiet side street is perfect, and just a 5 minute walk from the centre and 15 minutes to the Theatre's.
The extra's that were added for Kaye on her Birthday, were very much appreciated. 
We are looking forward to our next stay. ",5,2023,12,18
142,Excellent restaurant,"Review of the restaurant Gamebird at the Stafford hotel. We had a couples dinner for two, and it was superb. Quiet British elegance, with excellent food and service. Call itself is Tucktaway on a side street and very quiet.",5,2023,12,17
142,A wonderful stay!!,"My wife and I have chosen to stay with The Stafford for 7 days due to work commitments in London.  Because it was our way of celebrating her last meeting of the year, we picked a nice place to stay that we could call home for a week after extensive research and browsing reviews.

The incident at the American Bar when a waitress rendered poor service on the first day we arrived in London was not acceptable that's why my wife wrote an honest review here to address the issue.  

However, the incident didn't impact our view of The Stafford and the impeccable service rendered by everyone else who in some way or other made our stay here very pleasant.  The doormen/concierge were a welcome bunch to come back to after a day out.  The front desk staff have been so informative and helpful.  Even the waiter at The American Bar who tried to save the day after that incident was brilliant as he ensured we got a table and bent over backwards to serve us our cups of coffee and food.  

So we are delighted to be here at the Stafford and would make this establishment our home away from home again when we return annually.  

When we came back into the room today, we were surprised by the gesture of a bottle of champagne. Thanks for the service recovery but it was not our intention to get a complimentary bottle of champagne sent up to us.  We just wanted to make sure that that waitress at the American Bar was duly counselled so this unpleasant incident wouldn't happen to anyone else in future.

My wife and I would like to thank the entire team at The Stafford for taking our comments seriously and for making our stay here extra special.
",5,2023,12,15
142,Appalling Service From Waitress At The American Bar,"I just checked in today, and will be staying here for 7 days.  My husband David Ash and I  have been looking forward to this trip for months, finally a holiday after a year of hard work.  
In so far, the minute I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by the most polite doorman who was so helpful and served by a  fantastic reception staff. The  room was great, hotel looked fab and after 14 hours of flight time, we were peckish and headed to the restaurants in-house for some refreshments.  The Game Bird was serving high tea which wasn’t what we wanted, so we headed to the American Bar.
When I asked for a table for 2 where I could get a coffee and some food,  waitress at the American Bar said, “this is A BAR.  It’s the American BAR (stressing on the word BAR as if I couldn’t read or understand English) and we only serve alcohol and cocktails here.”  A waited on hearing this, promptly took over the service, got us a table and said he would get some coffee served, and gave us the food menu, which was a brilliant save.
After our meal, I thanked the waiter for his awesome service, and reminded the waitress that her service standard was not acceptable for a hotel like The Stafford.  She started to argue with me, with the excuse, “if I said yes to serving you coffee at a bar, the rest of the guests would want one too.”  Wasn’t that appalling? I certainly was taken aback.  
Here’s the advice from a Branding specialist.  This is a great hotel, but it takes only 1 staff with an appalling attitude and poor training to ruin your brand reputation.",3,2023,12,12
142,Excellent as always!,The Stafford is simply excellent. My wife and I have stayed there on many occasions and it never disappoints. The staff are superb and nothing is too much trouble. The Game Bird and the American Bar are unique and must be visited.,5,2023,12,12
142,November week in London,"We have stayed here several times and we are never disappointed. The staff are so welcoming and so friendly. The American Bar as always a great place for drinks and cocktails but it is always so busy booking is recommended. The food at breakfast, in the bar or restaurant is of the highest quality. The rooms are well proportioned and very comfortable. However, without the great team both front of house, bar, catering and behind the scenes it wouldn't be what it is! have already booked for 2024.",5,2023,12,03
142,A home away from home,"The Stafford London is a must-stay- a home away from home!  Conveniently located within walking distance to everything one needs from top-of-the line shopping to sights and sounds of British history.  Wonderful spacious rooms, with just ‘delicious’ showers, heavenly beds that make one feel like they can sleep forever; lots of choices to eat right in the hotel - and an amazing hot breakfast to start each day, as well as a hotel staff who treats you like family - paying attention to even the smallest detail so one feels like they are the most important person in the world!

142,Location is the best!,"It is a lovely location for any tourist, stayed in a deluxe king for 3 nights. The decor is amazing and I love this green colour. It was our first trip to London and our anniversary too. Very clean and the bed very comfy. Amazing service and food during breakfast. Will stay there again for sure!!",5,2023,11,24
142,"Small luxury hotel, with extremely friendly staff!","We went on a theater tour and stayed at The Stafford, London, for a week. A group of 30+ and I heard not a single complaint. My room, while small, was well appointed with everything I needed and had a very large shower. The staff was extremely polite and the room was kept so clean! The hotel is on a small side street and is within walking distance of Buckingham Palace. I will definitely stay there again, if given the opportunity. ",5,2023,11,13
142,Lovely hotel with excellent service,"A 2-night mid-week stay to indulge in some theatre and good food. Lovely hotel, the service is exceptional, from reception to housekeeping, bar to concierge, can’t fault it. Our room was quiet, comfortable and well equipped, and anything that wasn’t already there could be provided. Location is great, slightly tucked away but convenient for theatres, restaurants, attractions and close to a tube station. Expensive, but worth it for a treat.",5,2023,11,12
142,Great base for a London weekend,"Stopped at the Stafford again last weekend for a two night stay while visiting friends in London. Shopping, Theatre and plenty of indulging… the breakfasts and the Sunday Lunch will take some shifting! Hats off to American Bar team who are great fun. Will be back again!",5,2023,11,07

142,Best hotel ever.,We chose The Stafford because of price and location. The hotel was so special because of Ned Holder. Ned honestly went out of his way to make us feel like valued guests. We truly appreciate the hospitality Ned extended. Housekeeping was excellent as well. Everyone is friendly and eager to help in any way. We have stayed at some nice hotels in London but honestly The Stafford would be hard to beat.,5,2023,10,29
142,A 5-star experience through and through!,This hotel is so beautiful! It's situated perfectly in the city. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. The bed was really comfy / overall amenities impeccable. Will definitely be coming back to stay here the next time I visit London. Highly recommend!,5,2023,10,25
142,I will return.,"This hotel has the best meet and greet, concierge, food, and domestic staff of any hotel I have visited. No hovering with service when you need it. For me the reason to return is the way we were treated from the time we arrived before normal check in tiome to the early morning departure when we left. This hotel deserves its 5 stars.",5,2023,10,20
142,"Top rate, in all areas","Across the board, staff were incredibly attentive, and thoughtful - often anticipating needs.  Room was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable.  Hotel location is a half-block off the main streets, but tucked in a quiet alcove.  Would certainly stay here again.",5,2023,10,20
142,A lovely English hotel in the finest sense. ,"The hotel is located on a quiet side street in a beautiful area of London. Entering the Stafford you are greeted by the charming staff who are ready to make your stay absolutely perfect. My first room, although updated, was not what I wanted and the staff allowed me to change to a higher light filled room with chintz curtains and the lovely feel of a country cottage. Breakfast was served in the dining room and was delicious and tea by the fire in the afternoon a welcome break. The American Bar is not to be missed, both for casual dining and the amazing cocktails! I prefer hotels that embody the locale and The Stafford is an English hotel in the best sense. Enjoy!",5,2023,10,19
142,Staff is quite well behaived.,"Services are too good, very polite and humble behaviour of all the staff! Heena treated us with very kind behaviour. Overall experience was superb!! Thankyou 🍓🍓

Cleanliness is also up to date, verry verrryyy good",5,2023,10,13
142,"Our ""residence whilst in London""","The Stafford is the standard to which I will now hold all hotels. I simply can not find any faults regarding our 6-night stay. We arrived from the US well before the check-in time, tired and I'm sure looking haggard after our overnight flight. We were graciously welcomed and our rooms were quickly prepared. The staff were delightful. Every question and/or request was met with an obvious intent to meet the needs of their guests. Our rooms were beautifully appointed, very comfortable, and spotlessly clean. The breakfast buffet was ample and any items ordered from the kitchen arrived wonderfully prepared. The location is perfect for walking to many shops, restaurants, and historical sites. We hope to return to The Stafford in the future.",5,2023,10,07
142,Our Home in London,"No detail goes unnoticed at The Stafford and the famous American Bar. I almost regret singing the praises of The Stafford in the past, rather than keeping it a treasured secret. Attentive service. Terrific location. A very unique place to create special memories.",5,2023,10,05
142,Best Hotel Stay in London,"Best stay in London is at the Stafford Hotel. Everything is perfect, the accommodations, the restaurants, the location is fantastic but the best of all is the staffing. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Starting by Sadia, also Alan and Kent at the Concierge desk. Loved everyone. I wish I would have captured all their names. Every time I visit London, I would definitely stay at the Stafford!!!",5,2023,10,05
142,"Elegant, but “old”","I stayed in a deluxe queen room for 4 nights.  From the time I booked until my arrival, the trip advisor rating had dropped by about 10 places. I should have taken this as a sign.

Pros: The staff was extremely helpful.  Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable, and in general the service was excellent.  The hotel has a wonderful old world feel and is beautifully appointed.  My deluxe queen room was small as expected, but well laid out and appointed.  There was plenty of storage space and the bed was very comfortable.  I liked the location.  It was a few minute walk to green park station which serves 3 tube lines.  There were good coffee shops and restaurants near by.

Negatives:  unlike the bedroom, the bathroom was ridiculously small.  The door was on a spring mechanism as if it was left open, you could not access the main door.  This made it claustrophobic.  There was no counter space to place toiletries.  Thankfully, the deck in the room was set up for a blow dryer.  
The breakfast was limited unless you chose the buffet which was pricy.  You could not get yogurt or any kind of cereal except porridge. 
The hotel is small and very “decorated” with lots of wood and fabrics and pattern.  Most of the guests were well over 60.  For me, it was a little too stuffy.  I would not stay here again.",4,2023,10,05
142,"Good food, service, staff and environmental 👍","
1st time i go this place im very excited because i got Good lunch food Good menu for lunch and very delicious and the service is verry good and then staff too so friendly I'm also like this environment 🤩🤩

142,The Stafford earns and deserves its outstanding reputation every day.,"The Stafford is a brilliant hotel in several ways, starting with the friendly welcoming, and outstanding staff. From the doorman's ""welcome home!"" to the reception check-in and concierge helpers with all matters London, we were treated as special guests day after day. The room was spacious and comfortable, the included breakfast was delicious, and The American Bar was a cozy and lively place before or after dinners out on the town; the staff there made sure we even had our own table! On only one day's notice, the concierge staff arranged for a guide and driver to visit Salisbury Cathedral and the old Roman spa in Bath. I had not taken a day trip from St. Pancras Station before and was a bit intimidated by its size and busy-ness; one of the concierge staff told me he was going there himself and offered to make sure I found the right train and its track. And he met us there and escorted us to the track. ""Above and beyond"" kind of covers the attitude The Stafford demonstrates. Jolly well done!",5,2023,09,30
142,Excellent stay! Highly recommend!,"Everything about our stay was outstanding. The staff did everything they could to make us feel welcome. We loved coming back to the Stafford every day during our stay. It was truly our home away from home. Even when I asked the most basic of questions, they answered with a smile. Highly, highly recommend. Would love to stay there again!",5,2023,09,29
142,"We would consider the standard of this hotel to be excellent, the rooms, food and staff were amazing.","In early September of this year, my wife and three children stayed at this beautiful hotel.
I can honestly say without hesitation that this is the nicest hotel that we have stayed in.
The location of the hotel is ideal, being a stone’s throw away from iconic landmarks such as, Green Park, Buckingham Palace , St James’s Park, and Parliament square.
We would consider the standard of this hotel to be excellent, the rooms are amazing.
The Gamebird restaurant is beautiful, the breakfast was out of the world, the quality of the food 10 out of 10.
It was wonderful experience for the whole family, it’s just so nice for everyone to have the opportunity to stay in a top hotel in the heart of London.
One of the highlights of our stay were how courteous, polite, and personable the staff were, nothing was too much trouble, I cannot thank them enough for making our stay so memorable.

142,Good  but not amazing!,"On  the positive side...room was lovely and the bed sooo comfortable.  Nice and quiet, 
and centrally located. 
Most of the staff were brilliant but a few were stuffy. It is a high end hotel and we were treating ourselves. Food  in  the main dining room was nothing to write home about. We actually went to a hotel across the road for breakfast, it wasnt so much about the price but more about the quality.  Food in the American bar  was quite good though.",4,2023,09,28
142,A wonderful stay,"The Stafford Hotel is charming and well located.

142,A consistently excellent experience,"The Stafford consistently exceeds our expectations every time we visit. From the friendly staff in every area of the hotel, to the attention to detail, the Stafford really makes you feel welcomed and at home. It’s also a great central location, in walking distance to a a variety of shops, landmarks, and restaurants. Overall, a great modern, yet traditional, place to stay in London. ",5,2023,09,25
142,Beyond expectations!,"I cannot even begin to describe how lovely a time we had during our week-long stay with you and am so grateful that our first-ever visit to London was made all the more special by your exemplary staff and gracious hospitality. The birthday meal we enjoyed at The Game Bird was beyond phenomenal and I was so touched by the thoughtful gift of dessert and chocolate treats! Beginning every day with a spectacular breakfast in the sumptuous dining room while being spoiled by charming and attentive staff almost made it difficult to leave for our daily explorations. I don’t believe we’ve ever enjoyed a stay more than we did at The Stafford. From now on, you will forever be the gold standard by which we measure all hotels and you’ve quite possibly set the bar almost impossibly high! Thank you for being part of a dream come true! I will treasure our memories for many years to come.",5,2023,09,23
142,As Good As It Gets...Home away from Home at The Stafford,"After my 10 hour flight from the states I arrived at The Stafford for my first time. Even before I arrived, I felt confident in the staff based on the email support I received on reservations, etc. From the time I arrived until I had to fly back home  (4 night stay) I have never felt more comfortable and ""taken care of"" than when I was at Tha Stafford........great room selections, staff is always available to help and handle all of your questions and concerns. The atmosphere , service, staff was so awesome I never wanted to leave the premise !! Thank you Stafford for making my visit be one of the best!!",5,2023,09,21
142,Great stay at the Stafford,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Stafford after a cruise.  All the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  Its hard to single out anyone from the staff, since they all were fantastic, but I have to mention Alessandra at the front desk.  She was always available to assist us, no matter what we needed.  Very nice person!  And the restaurant, The Game Bird was super, for dinner and breakfast.  Would return there for a stay without any question.  ",5,2023,09,19
142,We can’t wait to come back,We stayed here on the front end of our trip traveling through the UK and we made sure we stayed here on the back and also because we had such a wonderful experience. The rooms are decorated beautifully in proper English decor. The staff was exceptional and friendly. We used to concierge twice for tickets and they were great.  Many times we needed directions and they were so helpful. We will definitely be back the next time we’re in London. We specially like the location. It was on a quiet street but so close to everything.,5,2023,09,18
142,home away from home,"I have stayed at the Stafford for over 20 years and the service has been maintained at the highest level.  Food/drink great!  Rooms just like home, if not a little fancier . . . .  My favorite aspect is they know me/us and it really is our home away from home",5,2023,09,18
142,Perfect stay,"Absolutely fabulous stay. All the staff we dealt with were exceptional.
Room was wonderful and can't wait to return.
Breakfast is one of the best in London. Concierge super helpful and arranged taxis in minutes!",5,2023,09,13
142,Afternoon tea,"We had an excellent afternoon tea. Fantastic friendly attentive staff, couldn’t do any more for us. Made a birthday treat very special. They even sorted out my shopping that I left behind. This is a little gem that I will definitely return to.",5,2023,09,09
142,Wonderful stay at The Stafford,"We spent 4 nights at The Stafford London in a junior suite in the Main House. From the welcome at Reception to the service at the restaurants and bar, staff was exceptional. Food was very good as well. Location is ideal, within walking distance to so many sites. Very comfortable suite and overall beautiful property. Would absolutely stay again.",5,2023,09,07
142,My Only Hotel in London,"I just returned from a week at my only ""go to"" hotel in London, The Stafford.  This hotel has it all--a super location in the heart of Mayfair, a great bar and restaurant, and an amazing staff which is dedicated to not only keeping things bright and shiny, but to promptly and meticulously catering to the many and various needs of its guests.  I have been going to The Stafford for several years, and I am always greeted personally by name, and can look forward to a level of care which I can feel has been planned well before my arrival.  I won't go into detail about how much this hotel has to offer, as there are many five star reviews which will tell you that.  I can only say that, consistently, over the years, I know exactly what to expect and The Stafford always delivers.

Tucked into a tiny corner of St. James Place, in the middle of Mayfair, The Stafford is a well appointed, tastefully decorated, quiet retreat to which one can return after a busy day doing whatever you may be doing in London.  As a female, solo traveler, I look for a safe harbor--and The Stafford is that for sure--it exudes both confidence and security--and you will sleep very well there!",5,2023,08,31
142,Best London Hotel ,"Our experience was so fantastic we will never stay in another London hotel, The Stafford is now our Home in London, we just wish we had discovered them sooner. 

The staff were so friendly and helpful, from the first evening everyone called us by name.  
There was never a request that wasn’t fulfilled almost immediately.  When we arrived my shirts needed pressing, 2 hours later they were done!

The American Bar is such a cool place and so many amazing cocktails. 

The location could not be better, we were there 9 days and were never more than a 20 minute walk or train ride from any attraction in London. 
",5,2023,08,27
142,The only place to stay in London!,"WOW!! What a fabulous hotel this is. 

Just spent 2 nights celebrating hubby’s special birthday and can’t imagine why you would ever chose anywhere else to stay when in London.

Our suite was so comfortable and finished to such a high standard. While it is not often still provided, turn down service is a great treat and really makes you feel pampered.

Dining in the hotel whether it’s for breakfast, lunch or dinner is an absolute pleasure. The quality of ingredients and the care with which they are prepared, is obvious.

The American Bar has a great atmosphere with cocktails that are so tempting. Double that up with drinks in the courtyard and it’s truly difficult to leave the hotel at all.

But really the secret to the success of this hotel is the staff and nothing is too much trouble. They are happy to chat and spend time with you despite being busy. Often they had interesting experiences to share and were only too pleased to share with us. 

All in all, a hotel with real character, warmth, charm and atmosphere. 

Thanks again for a memorable visit and we can’t wait to come back again!!

142,Recent two night stay at the Stafford,"100% recommended - superb location and some of the most attentive and caring staff we've ever come across. Diner at the Game Bird is a real treat and the American Bar just feels right.......... we will return I am sure.
Thank you Stafford and all your team.

142,A tucked away gem,"A tucked away gem in St James’s. This iconic British hotel has a great amount to offer. From the moment you walk through the entrance you cannot be amazed at the architecture and lovely decor. I can recommend this hotel for comfort. excellent service and very good food in the Game Bird restaurant. The suite and rooms are tastefully decorated, but most of all it is the luxurious bedding and towels which I feel makes a hotel that extra little bit special. 
Suite 504 👍 on the edge of Green Park, close to Knightsbridge Bond  Street for shopping and Buckingham Palace and other places to visit are close by.",5,2023,08,17
142,A gem in a great location,"We have been here many times as we enjoy the service, location and tranquility. We agree with all of the positive comments other reviewers have made. This time it was my partners birthday so we were greeted with a card and a bottle of wine in the room-a nice touch. The breakfasts are great-especially the 'Full English' which serves up delicious bacon along with eggs, etc. and I was very pleased to see that it still includes black pudding which is a particular favourite of mine that many places do not serve any more. The rooms have every facility possible which includes a very large flat-screen TV. Thank you again The Stafford-we will be back!",5,2023,08,16
142,London visit in early August.,"I was in London staying in the City but moved to The Stafford for the weekend. We stayed at the Stafford for three nights in early August. As always, the service was excellent and the staff superb. 
Two nights in the American bar after dinner rounded out our stay and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you Stafford Team.",5,2023,08,15
142,Perfect in every way,Excellent location. Good value . Spotless  room . Stayed one night while in london. Great breakfast. Good American bar. Our bathroom was a bit small but apart from that a very enjoyable stay. Definitely will return. ,5,2023,08,10
142,Magnificent ,"What an amazing place.
We booked for a romantic weekend away and we couldn't be happier to have chosen the Stafford Hotel.
From the beginning of the process we felt like we were at home.
Iolanda from the reservation team was delightful, knowledgeable and offered us great customer service.
On arrival we were greater by the reservation team with Caterina, which confirmed our booking and with surprise we got upgraded to the Junior Suits in the Manor House.
Alessandra took the time to explain everything to us and gave us a tour of the Hotel, always with a smile in her face and the most calm and polite voice. Magnificent, probably one of the most beautiful hotels I have seen in my life.
The breakfast was high quality and there was so much of it, could choose from the menu and also had a nice buffet.
We got served by the most cheerful person I'm the world  unfortunately we did not catch is name, but I'm sure he was Italian.

Overall we had a great weekend and we couldn't be happier with both service and accomodation.
Thank you team Stafford , look forward to visit again very soon 
",5,2023,08,07
142,Make sure to make your room request early,Please please please make sure to make your room reservation early and well ahead of your visit.  I do not recommend you staying in the Carriage House rooms in the nice months as it becomes very loud with the lunch and dinner crowd outside your room.  Ask for a room in The Mews or new section.,3,2023,08,06
142,Home away from home!,"This is our favorite hotel in the UK!  The rooms are always perfect, the staff is amazing, and they go out of their way to make you feel at home.
The hotel is a short walk to the tube and near many tourist destinations.  The hotel has 2 restaurants and the food there is delicious.  Our bartender whipped up the best French 75 that I’ve ever had. 
Nearby are my 2 favorite restaurants… The Wolseley and Franco’s.  
You will not be disappointed with a stay at this wonderful hotel!",5,2023,08,01
142,A London delight!!,"The service at the Stafford is beyond compare.  Benoit and his crew at the American Bar provide an unparalleled experience in the artistry of craft cocktails, and the hotel and its staff make me feel more comfortable than at home! The food is consistently excellent.  Christmas at the Stafford is an especially memorable affair.  I recommend the Stafford to anyone visiting London for business or pleasure.",5,2023,07,29
142,Understated Elegance,"All the things Americans love about our mother country - impeccable manners, sense of tradition, cozy ambience in what feels like a grand country home in the city.  Try that NYC! 
We are a family staying in three rooms that feel like home.  Lunch on the outdoor patio today - lovely.  Concierge managed our delayed luggage.  We’re here for another 3 days and couldn’t be happier with this choice.  A splurge but worth it!  ",5,2023,07,28
142,Birthday weekend,"Second to none! This London institution of a 5-star hotel is absolutely on point . From the moment you arrive and are greeted out front, to the check in process, to the beautiful  rooms.
You could not ask for a better location, and the fantastic game bird  restaurant & glamorous American Bar only add to the experience ,the cocktails were delicious .We didn’t want to leave!! Would definitely recommend!!

Can’t thank the staff enough for making our visit so enjoyable.

142,AVOID,"We were excited to stay at this 5 star hotel for 3 nights. Bed and breakfast was £835/night, so it is only reasonable to expect an outstanding experience. Things started well with a welcome note from NED the customer services director.

We had three separate in-room noise issues. All were reported and nothing was done nor were we contacted. Specifically,
1. You shouldn’t hear people coughing (& everything else) in the next room
2. When someone uses the plumbing elsewhere, there shouldn’t be loud noises
3. At random times during the night (think 4am) a loud humming engine type noise kicked in.

On the day of departure, I actually wrote a 2 page letter to NED expressing our disappointment and explaining the issues. I waited 9 days before posting this review , but there has been no contact. Arrogance on top of a disappointing experience leads us to conclude that the message to fellow travellers is AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1,2023,07,24
142,First class at the Stafford,"We had a delightful stay at the Stafford!  Family of 3, first time to London!  Location was absolutely perfect - walking distance to most of London and steps away from the tube station.  Although it is a central location, hotel is on a side street and extremely quiet at night.  The hotel is very ""posh"" and historic, classy without being pretentious. 

We stayed in a suite in the Mews building- king bed and pull out couch were perfect for 3 people.  The room and bathroom were both very spacious and very nicely appointed. We took advantage of all the complimentary water as we walked about 10 miles a day while in London.  Room service and turndown were much appreciated (as were the warming towel racks).

The staff at the Stafford were all first rate.  The two doormen provided great insights on how to get places and local favorite pubs.  Breakfast was delicious with tasty a la carte options as well as a generous buffet.  Off-site dinner recommendations provided by the Stafford were spot on.  We also enjoyed a first-rate meal for dinner at their flagship restaurant The Game Bird.  The service in the restaurant was outstanding- friendly and professional, knowledgable.  

I would recommend the Stafford without hesitation to anyone visiting London!  ",5,2023,06,30
142,London at its best!!!,"History + Service + Warmth

We are regulars at the Stafford and always feel truly welcome, how on earth anyone can write a negative view of this place is beyond belief. 

The Stafford is full of history and the location is exceptional: we have made many friends and find the pace and quietness of this hotel delightful. 

The staff are what make this place exceptional with a knowledgeable and exquisite concierge team that make life in and around London all that bit easier. 

The rooms are not huge and the decor is traditional but that’s the magic of the place: it just works. 

I hope that the many visitors ahead: achieve the many magical moments we have had as a couple",5,2023,06,27
142,Above and beyond,"Fantastic Hotel in an excellent location. When we arrived we were greeted by the doorman and he immediately had a bellman take our bags for us. The front desk and concierge were more than helpful, we were shown to our room and given all pertinent information necessary. The maid service was impeccable. There were small touches like a weather card to let us know how our forecast looked for the next day that put this hotel as one of the best Ive stayed at.  
The American bar is an additional feather in the cap. The manager Benoit Provost has done an outstanding job by making people feel appreciated. I went so far as to leave an SD hat for the bar and he promised it would be on the wall  before I return. 
We have decided that this is our go to hotel every time we visit London. It has what the best hotels require, service, elegance and location.",5,2023,06,22
142,A great place to stay in London!,"My 5-night stay at The Stafford could not have been better. I think most reviews on here sound a bit cheesy, but I'm not overexaggerating when I say this is the nicest and most welcoming hotel I've ever stayed at. ",5,2023,06,17
142,Wonderful Hotel,"A wonderful hotel no doubt, we stayed one night. The team are friendly, the hotel is spotless, amazing decor and fantastic location. Our room was a double and was wonderful, lovely bathroom, comfy bed, excellent coffee machine. A lovely card for my partners birthday was added. Excellent pre stay questionnaire, excellent check in. The issue we had in room 414 was the noise that began at 6.45am, we really were looking forward to our one morning of late wake up. Like everyone we get up early everyday and our one night stay I was super excited to get the all important lie in! A strange motor noise emanating from the floors below the bed began and woke us up and continued until 9.15am, what a shame! It wasn’t the extract as we opened the window and whilst a small noise as you expect comes from these systems; this whirring was similar to maybe a loud washing machine or jet washer being on. Who knows what it was and perhaps we should have called reception to hear the noise but we thought well it will likely stop soon. Netherless it did stop at 9.15am. Gutted to not get that all important sleep in! We did raise this with front desk who were courteous and apologised however, didn’t appear to know what the noise was or took much interest. I’m sure other guests below us and perhaps above may have reported it. Anyway, a good nights sleep is really important and hopefully it was just a one off but the rooms on our floor were 10-16 I assume this is the same for 1-3 so I’d suggest booking 1-9 if you can as that’s the other side ! Anyway stay here it’s lovely and if you rise early my comments are irrelevant but your your looking for a lie in avoid 10-16 rooms . 
One last suggestion is perhaps fresh milk could be added to the fridges UHT pots are not very nice and lots of packaging not very environmentally friendly.",3,2023,06,15
142,Wonderfully Located Boutique Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Stafford with 3 of our friends. It was great location for us and we had a lovely suite in the Mews, Staff was very attentive and helpful.  Our friends had booked  in Carriage House but changed  to the Mews as they had to negotiate through the restaurant in courtyard  to get to their rooms.",5,2023,06,14
142,Great Stay,"Great location close to everything we wanted to see and do. Stayed in a Junior Suite, could not believe the size of the room…massive. Spotlessly clean. Only had lunch the once in the American Bar and it was really good, can’t comment on the restaurant. All the staff were wonderful, nothing too much trouble. We will definitely be back.",5,2023,06,13
142,Fabulous stay for the weekend,"Another fabulous stay at The STAFFORD LONDON.  Two nights in a Junior Suite very luxurious, beautiful room and bathroom with extremely comfortable bed and lovely bed linen.  Helpful and efficient staff and delicious drinks outside at the American Bar, the perfect spot on a sunny evening.  ",5,2023,06,12
142,"The Stafford, one of London's very best.","Magnificent hotel, well located near Green Park and the Green Park Piccadilly line stop (perfect for non-stop train travel from LHR).  Hotel is lovely with a delightful British ambiance.  Rooms are spacious, and well appointed.
Staff goes out of its way to ensure all your needs are met.  We've stayed at several top of the line hotels in London and this is now our number one choice on return trips.",5,2023,06,09
142,London Treat,"This is my third time to stay at the Stafford.  Located in very nice St James area of London, close to Mayfair area, St James Park and Buckingham Palace.  Cannot say enough good about the place.  Hard to call it a Hotel as the staff and accommodations are first class.  Options to stay in the main area or the Carriage House area I chose the Carriage House rooms.  Beautiful area with access to St James street for dining or shopping.  American Bar is a traditional stop for me.  Great crowd with added patio seating.  Beautiful entry and dining facility.  Hotel is a boutique and not the large commercial chain but truly London style.  All this being said, you are treated with first class gloves by all employees which is much appreciated.  Not cheapest route but location and accommodations makes your visit special.  ",5,2023,06,06
142,Gastro pub experience,Food was good was really expensive for what it was. Service was excellent good atmosphere. I didn’t stay just visited the restaurant. However the rooms were ok but a bit of maintenance needed in a room my friend stayed.,3,2023,06,02
142,Perfect location for a visit to London,"The Stafford was located perfectly for sightseeing in London.  We took the tube from Heathrow to the Green Park Station and the Stafford is just a short walk from there, taking the back entrance which is right off of Green Park.    My husband's passport was stolen and the staff went above and beyond to help us make arrangements to get a provisional passport.   The hotel is just as charming as can be and the food in the restaurant is magnificent.    Everyone there is so accommodating.  I highly recommend it.",5,2023,05,29
142,Staff at maldon whether Spoons ,I would like to say that Sarah Coates is the most polite and friendly and helpful person  and I think she would go far so she needs  to be recognised as a great member of staff and think she would  go far ,5,2023,05,29
142,More than just a cuppa,"OK, let's be honest. Not a full review, just a casual visit.
We had been visiting the Spencer House (Amazing) and just wanted a cuppa. 
Also, maybe living near Stafford itself was a factor.
But what a treat. Everyone could not have been friendlier. Yes there is a 'proper' way of treating guests. But the very smart young lady, and young man with the blue waistcoat and beard, could not have done more to make us comfortable. They were excellent and more than a credit to the hotel. 
The tea itself was excellent. As I say we are from Staffordshire and hence very familiar with Wedgwood tea tearooms, but this was just as good. 
Even so, Loose tea + strainer is good, but with the appropriate set of 3 egg times to use accordingly would be even better. Such colourful tea is a lovely part of the variety width, maybe in a glass tea pot next time ?  To have 4 cups from the teapot is unbelievable, it is just a bit too heavy / hot to lift. 
But 5* for an excellent experience",5,2023,05,27
142,This is a superb hotel in all respects.,"The Stafford is a first class hotel that makes you feel that it is a privilege to have you stay, not the other way around. It is welcoming, personable, extremely comfortable, in a super location and good value. It's up to date, but grounded in its own traditions and history. If you are in London for a special occasion, the hotel will accommodate you accordingly and with enthusiasm. There's nothing not to like about this excellent hotel.

Beginning with the welcome by the Front Desk staff, to the gracious farewell by the attentive doormen, this property is superb.

142,Stafford -- your home in London,"Our stay in the spring of 2023 with grand-children was wonderful. Highly recommend. I can't think of a single fault.

The Stafford is located in close proximity to shopping and great restaurants, an easy journey to tourist sites.",5,2023,05,18

I had room service every morning and night, the food was exceptional and the room service staff were lovely. I will definitely be staying here again.

142,A brilliant few days in London,"My stay at the Stafford with my partner was fantastic from start to finish. The staff were all very welcoming and attentive during the entirety of our stay. The room was beautiful with nice touches throughout. We were well looked after during breakfast and dinner, we were made to feel like VIP’s even with a full restaurant. A brilliant couple of days made all the better with special thanks to Ned for making sure my partner, who is pregnant, had a pregnancy pillow in the room as well as plenty of decaf coffee and also made sure to buy in some particularly good non alcoholic champagne too.",5,2023,05,17
142,Stafford Hotel  London —pluses and minuses,"Great location and  very nice quiet suite in the mews. Helpful and responsive concierge  staff and door men. They all get high marks.
AmericanBar is a must stop.  But bar  staff and restaurant hostesses are not very Attentive or friendly.  Restaurant Wait staff is very good.
Will try it again  because location is superb.
 ",4,2023,05,17
142,If you want to feel like royalty in an unstuffy perfectly located home from home,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly by the doormen who took our bags, the concierge who introduced themselves and the front desk staff who checked us in promptly explaining hotel arrangement and facilities. A little card left during turndown service stating the weather for the next day is such a simple but lovely detail - the weather in England is hardly predictable. 

The decor is a mix of traditional and contemporary perfectly matched bringing the old into the 21st century without that stuffy feel you get in some places. It really felt like a home from home. 

Our room was luxury comfort at its best. Beautifully decorated with everything we could have asked for and more. 

The hotel was aware that I am pregnant and honestly the extra special details of decaf pods for the coffee machine and the pregnancy pillow on the bed on our arrival meant so much and to me really sets The Stafford apart from other hotels we’ve stayed at. 

Our separate lounge with the fresh fruit and selection of movies was very welcome but the real winner for me was the marble bathroom. The heated toilet seat and built in bidet was easy to use and a luxury I didn’t know I needed in my life. We both enjoyed the large luxury bath and the rainfall shower. There was no scrimping on toiletries, which smelt divine. The front desk were quick to find me a plaster when I needed one and if you forget anything they are on hand. 

We were spoilt with a bed so large and total comfort of the mattress and the fluffy pillows which were very welcoming after a day exploring. 

The food was another level again. We had booked dinner in advance and the menu made the choice very difficult. David spent time taking us through his recommendations and the bar staff suggested drinks to match our food choices with a special mocktail and alcohol free wine for me. Whether at breakfast or dinner, our glass was never empty, the staff were so attentive, polite and approachable. The food itself was divine and I recommend to anyone that appreciates creative, quality dining. Breakfast set us up for the day even when I requested a strange combination of foods the staff accommodated. The pastries were huge and everything from the French toast to the eggs Benedict was made with care and served with a smile. 

Another gem for the hotel is the beautiful courtyard outside with the green and purple foliage attached to the American Bar. It was so peaceful you wouldn’t tell you were in central London. The location really is second to none. A few minutes from the tube and 10mins from Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus to name a few, we’ll definitely be returning. 

Thoroughly recommend! ",5,2023,05,17

I loved the flowers in the hall and in the restaurant. We stayed in one of the Suites. The room is beautiful. Housekeeping tidied up our room after we left for dinner, they placed slipers and water on the sides if the bed.  We had dinner in the restaurant, the staff was warm and efficient, the suggestions for wines and dishes made it an unforgetable delicious dinner! The bed and the pillows were very confortable, was like skeeping on a cloud. The breakfast is a la carte, the continental buffet has plenty options. We loved the full experience.

It really is a Home away from Home.

We cannot praise this hotel enough; and then you consider its situation in St James and the fun of The American Bar-Total Heaven!!",5,2023,05,09

142,Very comfortable stay in the heart of London,"We were welcomed warmly and our room was upgraded to a Deluxe King Room. The room was very well equipped and the bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable. We enjoyed cocktails and snacks in the American Bar where the service was extremely attentive and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was very good with quality ingredients, my only slight negative point was that the cooked breakfasts could have been served hotter. Again, the restaurant service was friendly and attentive. We will stay here again on our future visits to London.",4,2023,04,26
142,Great Stay! Great Location!,"Be prepared for a great stay. This trip was for our Anniversary. It started with our arrival. We arrived in a famous Black Cab and were greeted by the Doorman staff as soon as we arrived. They assisted us in getting out of the cab and with our luggage. They were very friendly and incredibly helpful and professional. 5 Stars right off the bat. Once inside to check in we were met with a warm smile and a sincere greeting. Very professional, friendly and down to earth. The staff was very accommodating and we were checked in within minutes and taken up to see our room. The room was very traditional and comfortable right from the start. Another 5 Stars. Since we had a long day of traveling we decided to eat at the hotel. We ate at The Game Bird which is the hotel restaurant. We had the Duck Pie and the Chicken Kyiv which along with the service was excellent. 5 more Stars. The next day after experiencing London we ended our day at the hotel to eat. We went to the American Bar at the hotel. This bar is very popular and gets quite busy. Since we were guests of the hotel we were accommodated right away. I had the Stafford Burger which was excellent along with the staff. 5 more Stars. Every time time you enter or exit the Hotel or just walk through you are always acknowledged with a smile and a sincere greeting. Don't worry about the rain as umbrellas are available for use. There is even a walkway in front of the hotel that gets you to Green park in a flash. The Hotel staff are excellent. The Hotel location is excellent and the Hotel restaurants are excellent. This was our first time at The Stafford London and we will make it our go to for trips to London. Thank You Stafford and your Staff for a 5 Star stay.",5,2023,04,23

142,Simply the best in London,"“Simply the best, better than all the rest”.
Maybe a music lyric but this small beautiful hotel just off the vast expanses of Green park is as good as it gets. Great location, a well run friendly staff and an upgrade to a junior suite (533) which was fantastic. 
So nice to have a quiet hotel in such a busy part of town. An easter flower theme was as always stunning and we hope to be back very soon.",5,2023,04,10
142,Hoped For More,"This review should be between 3 circles and 4 but that option is not available.  To fellow travellers who might be considering booking a classic queen – please note the room is very small.  We enjoyed our stay at The Stafford London overall but it could have been so much better.  We booked a ‘classic queen’ room category knowing it was a smaller room.  However ... the website indicates a range of rooms in this category from 18 - 23 sq m. which is significant.  The room we were given (#407 in the main building) was approximately 19 sq m.  We had been travelling for 3 months with luggage.  I requested one of the 'larger' classic queen rooms in the category if possible and we made the booking in November for a March booking so there was ample time for reception to allocate a larger room within the category.  We were not local travelers coming for a weekend with a carryon, we were coming for 5 nights and London was part of a much bigger travel itinerary.  It was disappointing to receive the room we were given.  When I called reception after the bellman showed us to our room, we were then shown another room on the 6th floor and the room was even smaller.  Given that travelers from overseas typically have several large suitcases vs. a guest visiting locally with a carryon bag, it would have been nice to have been given one of the ‘larger’ classic queen rooms.  There is no counter space for anything either.  I trust the website is accurately portraying the size of rooms available(?).  My photos depict the room and its size.

The bathroom for room #407 is very small, and because of the layout of the tub and shower with a partial piece of glass as a shower door, water inevitably is on the floor.  What was a safety concern and should have been fixed long before I needed to bring it to reception’s attention is the loose marble floor tile in front of the bathroom sink that was soaking up the water.  All day long as you stepped on the tile in front of the sink water squished up from underneath.  I was constantly with a towel wiping the water.  Once your slippers are wet it is easy to slip on the wet marble and is a safety concern that management should take seriously.  For a 5 star hotel in Mayfair of this caliber this was unacceptable.  Another problem that room  #407 has is the occasional odor of sewer gas in the bathroom.  It wasn’t all the time but it was more often than either of us cared for during our 5 nights.  Again, not acceptable for a hotel like this.

For the positives … the location is excellent in Mayfair.  The amenities are very nice, this included wonderful thick plush bathrobes, slippers, coffee in the room and tea when asked for.  The wi fi was excellent and the air conditioning worked very well.  The staff were always friendly.  Service was excellent.  The bed was comfortable and the linens changed daily and of quality.  Bottled water was provided during turn down only.  The buffet breakfast was enjoyable along with items from a menu. 

Unfortunately, we would not stay again at The Stafford.  We have enjoyed other 5 star hotels in the area and like to try different hotels, but this is one we would not return to.  ",4,2023,04,09
142,Absolutely loved this hotel,"I absolutely loved this hotel. Our rooms were very nice, the hotel is well located in Mayfair, and the service was impeccable.  The staff was great. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable.  The bathroom had a heated floor. The hotel has two nice restaurants.  We loved the decor of the American bar, and we had an excellent Afternoon Tea at the other, formal and lovely restaurant (where breakfast is also served).  The hotel is also good value for the excellent service and room quality provided.  Other 5 star hotels with well known names are far more expensive. 
One of my favorite city hotels anywhere.

142,Birthday lunch,"Booked this on recommendation. It was my birthday weekend. My husband booked a lunch. 
The Sunday lunch was beautiful service attentive and discreet. We had a lovely bottle of wine with our meal. 
Starter, main were all served hot. Main course was roast beef and portion sizes were good. Dessert was lovely. We requested coffee but, was informed due to afternoon tea now been served, they couldn’t do this. This was the reason I did not give this a full five star rating. We headed to the bar and had a cocktail. We would return again. We also felt £50 for Sunday lunch was a good price.",4,2023,04,08
142,Highly recommended!!,"We recently stayed at the Stafford for 9 nights and highly recommend this hotel.  It is located in a relatively quiet safe dead end street and is only two short blocks to Piccadilly. Green Park is also accessible via a private “secret passage” right outside the hotel entrance.  In my opinion you will be hard pressed to find a better more centrally located hotel than the Stafford.  We rarely used a cab since located was so central to all the best attractions.  

We stayed in a Main Building Deluxe King Room. It was room 605 and was bigger than we expected. It had a walk in closet and very large soaking tub and separate shower.  You have a nice view of the London Eye and the Shard.  There is also a skylight in the bathroom which is a nice touch.  The bath floors and toilet are heated which is something that you come to appreciate on a chilly day or night.  

The real stand out here is the service.  Everybody at this hotel will bend over backwards to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.  It is definitely the hotel with the best service we have ever stayed at.  

We ordered room service and it was never more than 10-15 minutes which is impressive.  Water pressure and temperature was awesome and the walls are solid so you do not hear your neighbors.  

I would definitely stay here the next time we visit London.  If you stay here you will not be disappointed!",5,2023,04,03
142,Excellent ,"The pillows were the fluffiest, we ever felt, we stayed for work purpose and we had and upgrade as we hold a platinum Emaar Card, like one of the frequent guest and we were upgraded to the diplomatic suite, the diplomatic suite was awesome, it is spacious, we had business meeting and on timely bases were supported with help from humble and  professional staff - Rameez, Sarita, Emmanuel, they kept checking on our needs, as and when we approached them, amazing staff, they made us feel comfortable, we look forward for many more such experiences with you'll each time we will come.  
",5,2023,04,03
142,A great afternoon tea,"I visited The Stafford last week for their Afternoon tea and we had a fantastic experience: the scones are divine, the sandwiches variety was great (they were also very accommodating with my dietary restrictions) and the choice of cakes is very cleverly shaped as products of some of the flagship shops in the area.

Besides the delicious tea ( I recommend the Queen’s blend), we had the chance to sample two cocktails each, very delicate and tasteful. 

The service is very curated, overall I recommend the Stafford for a nice, relaxed afternoon tea that still retains a very luxurious touch.",5,2023,04,02
142,Amazing experience,"I've stayed for a night with my best friend Carmen  to treat ourselves, and we haven't been disappointed at all!
Since our first step into the hotel hall to the check out time all the hotel staff we have had the pleasure to meet have been  warm, friendly and very attentive, making feel us always special. Katerina at the reception helped us with the check in, and Julia escorted us to our room, we felt like VIPs.  Our Mews Junior Suite was immaculate, and so luxurious that we were sad to leave the day after! We have been surprised with a chilled bottle of bubbles as a welcome, how lovely! We decided to have dinner in the Game Bird, and everything has been superb, as well as our rich breakfast the day after.
We hope to visit the Stafford again soon, and we will definitely recommend it to all our friends!

",5,2023,03,29
142,Would definitely stay here again!,Wonderful hotel in an excellent location.   We had a deluxe room in the main building 2nd floor.  Not a large room but comfortable and attractively decorated.  The staff were very welcoming and helpful.   Lovely doorman in a bowler hat always ready to give directions or lend an umbrella.  Game bird had wonderful breakfast and the American Bar had good drinks and fish and chips.  Located very near the Greenpark Metro and St. James Palace to watch the beginning of the changing of the Guard.  Would definitely stay here again.  This is not my first trip to London and by far my favorite place to stay so far.,5,2023,03,29
142,The Stafford London,"The Stafford London is an exceptional hotel that provides a luxurious and comfortable stay. The staff is friendly and attentive, always willing to go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are spacious, well-appointed and clean. The location of the hotel is excellent, with easy access to many of London's top attractions. The only downside is that it can be a bit pricey, but the quality of the experience is worth it. Overall, I highly recommend The Stafford London for anyone looking for a top-notch hotel experience in London.

142,Return visit,"Staff , rooms and service excellent as always 
Our room was fantastic. The American bar is so unique , nothing like a hotel bar ! It’s a great atmospheric venue with really good bar food
It’s always a pleasure to return it really is like going home such is the welcome",5,2023,03,18
142,Cocktail at the American Bar,"We visited the American Bar. The setting was really nice and relaxed, and the cocktails were very different and delicious! It was a nice addition having the snacks as well. The staff are very attentive and always seem to be on it.",5,2023,03,12
142,A really nice hotel in an excellent location with fantastic staff. Our new London home!,"This was our first stay at the Stafford Hotel, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel is located in an excellent location in Mayfair close to Buckingham Palace, Green Park Tube Station and within 5 minutes walk of Fortnum and Masons and all that Bond Street has to offer. The hotel is really nice with fantastic staff who were so lovely throughout our 2-night stay. Our room, a Deluxe King Room in the Main House of the hotel was immaculately presented and well maintained by housekeeping throughout our stay. We had breakfast each morning at the Game Bird Restaurant which was well prepared and a very pleasurable dining experience. We now consider the Stafford Hotel to be our home whenever we are in central London and are very much looking forward to our return during this Summer.",5,2023,03,10
142,WOW,"From start to finish it was an out of this world experience.  Nothing is too much for any of the staff, they do everything to make your stay so special.  We felt very valued & so well looked after.  All the staff from the front of the property, reception, concierge, in the American Bar, The Game Bird, everyone is friendly & make it a wonderful experience.  I didn't want to leave, a little slice of heaven.  I could just go on & on about what I love about the hotel but would be here forever. I will be returning for sure",5,2023,03,01
142,Home Away From Home,"I've recently returned from a 9-night stay at The Stafford, and I can't recommend the hotel highly enough.  Why?
The location is perfect - just minutes from world-class shopping, Buckingham Palace and other must-sees, but tucked away on a secluded side street. 
My suite in the hotel's Mews building was the size of a small apartment and beautifully furnished.  Although the Mews building is separate from the main building of the hotel, it's literally five steps away.  Don't miss the chance to stay there because you think that having to go outside between the two buildings will be a nuisance.  Those five steps are historic cobblestoned ones, though, and could present a slight mobility challenge.
Most importantly, every single person I dealt with during my stay - reception, concierge, restaurant and bar staff, housekeeping, doormen -  was an absolute pleasure to be around.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they do all they can to make you feel at home.
I'm very much looking forward to my next stay at The Stafford.  ",5,2023,02,28
142,Wonderful experience from beginning to end,"From the welcome at the front door all through out stay to the wave goodbye, everyone made us feel at home and looked after all we needed. At no point did we feel that we were asking too much and it was great to feel like we were at home. The hotel was busy being a Friday night but we were always well attended and not forgotten. As excellent ratio of staff to customers kept everyone happy.",5,2023,02,28
142,Not enough superlatives to describe the Stafford London,"Starting with our interactions emailing directly with reservations all the way through to a follow up email when we returned home, all communications at the Stafford were warm, friendly and professional.

Upon our arrival, we were surprised with an upgraded room.  The junior suite that we stayed in for 5 nights was large and comfortable and a perfect place to settle in.  So many amenities: two closets, two sinks, a large walk in shower, a table and chairs, plenty of outlets, coffee maker and tea kettle, mini fridge, robes and slippers, plus! We had a couple of small issues with our room. We brought them to the attention of the front desk and they were fixed immediately.  The rooms AC and heating worked very well . . . once we figured out how to run them!

The breakfast was a bit confusing as there were prices on the menu, however after confirming breakfast was included in our rate, we were free to order anything off the menu.  So many options from eggs (any style), pancakes, omelets, fruit, porridge, cereals, coffee drinks, champagne and pastries.  One certainly won't walk away hungry from breakfast

The Stafford London is located on a quiet street, within a 5-10 min walk from Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and a tube stop.  We found the location perfect for our time in London with lots of really great restaurants within walking distance.

The hotel restaurant, the Game Bird, was a great dinner option on our first night.  The food was amazing and the wine pairing suggested was spot on. We appreciated the tour of the wine cellar and the personal, attentive service.  We visited the American Bar on our last afternoon and although drinks were on the pricey side, this is true of most places in London.

We are so happy that we discovered the charming Stafford London.  It is a hotel that has a small boutique feel to it and it will be our ""go to"" place for when we return again.",5,2023,02,25
142,Boutique Oasis in Heart of London,"I visited London for the first time in February 2023. The Stafford London is a perfect tranquil location in hear of London. I’m well traveled internationally and this was my first trip post COVID. The hotel room was lovely, well equipped, with comfortable bathroom (I had great walk in shower). I began my visit solo and felt very safe in the area to walk alone, and location was very convenient to Tube station. The staff at hotel were friendly, efficient and accommodating. The concierge staff were incredibly helpful when I wanted to find local restaurants and helped get me theater tickets to Moulin Rouge on West End. I dined at Game Bird and my halibut was so delicious and staff ensured my dinner was timed just perfectly so I could make it to the ballet. The American Bar was fun, lively yet also relaxing. I was so impressed with hotel, staff, room and location that I will definitely return and this will be my home away from home while visiting London.",5,2023,02,25
142,Charming friendly hotel in the heart of Mayfair.,"A lovely and charming hotel.Very well maintained and comfortable. It is in a fantastic quiet position. 
All the staff are exemplary. They are efficient and friendly and make you feel very welcome. Nothing is too much trouble. 
My wife and I enjoyed our stay in The Stafford and we would most definitely stay there again. ",5,2023,02,21
142,My London Favourite,"I love everything about this hotel and it has become my favourite place to stay when in London. The location, stylish rooms with fabulously comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms, super breakfast in The Game Bird restaurant but above all, the staff make this hotel stand out. Doormen, porters, reception staff, waiters and housekeepers - all so friendly and professional. Simply first class, thank you!",5,2023,02,17
142,MY FAV IN LONDON,"The hotel was beautiful.  In quite little corner yet so close to everything. Hop on and off bus station just 2 mins away. The staff are wonderful no exception, everyone was so friendly helpful and nice. Reception, housekeeping, in room dining Everyone will definitely stay here again",5,2023,02,17
142,First Class Hotel Experience,"This is a very elegant hotel, superbly situated for various sites (eg one minute from Green Park) and logistics whilst being ""tucked away"" to the point you'd not know you're in the hustle and bustle of London. Lovely staff; nice comfortable room , especially the bathroom; good bars with a great ambiance. Well priced given what and where it is. All round a very nice experience. In the past we've stayed in many London hotels, several of which we could happily return to, but in the case of The Stafford we've now found one we would actively look to use as our base on any future visits.",5,2023,02,14
142,The Stafford---My Home in London,"I have stayed in various hotels in London but have made The Stafford my home whenever I am there.  It has everything necessary for a first class experience!   It is a beautiful property in a great location, with a staff dedicated to the care and comfort of each guest.  Their meticulous attention to detail (in all areas) guarantees that you will be well pleased and content.  The restaurant and bar are over the top and always deliver--whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner --or just a tea or coffee in the afternoon.  Surrounding the hotel are the beautiful parks of London, along with great shopping and historical sights.  And the Green Park tube stop is just a few paces from the hotel door.  
You will LOVE it there as much as I do, I am quite sure!!!",5,2023,02,09
142,AMAZING STAFFORD,"For our 32nd anniversary my wife and I decided to take our first trip overseas. My wife picked  the Stafford London because it looked like a good location as we were not sure if we could figure out how to use the tube and buses. The hotel lined up a van to pick us up at Heathrow and the driver was waiting when we arrived, very friendly!! When we arrived at the Stafford we were once again greeted with smiles from the Doorman and front desk staff. The room was amazing and the bed was like sleeping  on a cloud, AWSOME!!! We had breakfast and tea at the hotel and it was great! The hotel was perfect for us and we are planning to return next January for our 33rd anniversary! Can't say enough how friendly everyone at the Stafford was to us.",5,2023,02,06
142,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Staff are excellent, amazing location and super comfy bed. My only gripe  was the shower temperature which was lukewarm. When you pay premium for a hotel the showers should be hot. If this wasn’t an issue it would be 10/10",4,2023,02,02
142,Feel at home at the Stafford!,"It’s really a home away from home. Kind staff, cosy atmosphere and great breakfast. 
It’s just off picadilly but in a calm and quiet street. The room was good and the American bar has a great vibe. 
Highly recommended!! We will be back…",5,2023,02,01
142,A gem in St. James,"This hotel stands out as an exceptional discovery even amongst a number of stellar hospitality options in the St James area. 

The American Bar is an education in the art of the cocktail, a high end restaurant and cellar will impress, while quietly luxurious bedrooms and suites almost guarantee a relaxed stay. 

What makes the extra difference at The Stafford is the team who are genuinely committed to meeting and exceeding their guest’s expectations. Many hotels claim to do this but The Stafford delivers. 

I don’t normally form attachments to the hotels that I stay in however I found The Stafford hard to leave.",5,2023,01,31
142,Fantastic stay,"We stayed there for the weekend and it started with a warmdul welcome, very professional and careful staff that are really looking after you and making sure everything is going perfectly for you. The room was perfect: clean, spacious, well equipped. Well, our stay was just fantastic. Honestly, the attention we received, the professionalism and very good care we got was even more that what you could expect. Definitely recommending this hotel! And coming back as soon as we can. Thanks a million time again to the whole Stafford’s team! Xx",5,2023,01,29
142,Loved it!,"What a fabulous hotel! Mum and I visited for a night to celebrate her birthday… we loved every minute! Fantastic situation, fabulous bar with delicious cocktails and great staff, beautiful bedrooms and bathrooms with everything you could need. Thank you to all the staff… you truly made our stay so special. We will be back in a heartbeat!",5,2023,01,27
142,A Devine Experience,"Prior to COVID my husband and I would go to London and stay at the Stafford yearly to celebrate my birthday.  We returned there this past week and our experience was (as usual) SUPERB.  In anticipation we spoke with Tom, the concierge – who was exceptionally helpful (and in person, charming, and extraordinarily helpful).  When we arrived at the Stafford the staff said “welcome home”.  That was the beginning of a perfect 5 days in London.  When we entered our lovely room (the bed and comforter made sleeping really cozy) a bottle of champagne was waiting for us with a lovely welcoming note.  The restaurant serves fabulous food.  Breakfasts are unbelievable, and dinners superb.  We took our bottle of champagne to the Game Bird and had a most wonderful dinner.  I had the quail which was fantabulous.  The maître d’, Alfonse, was wonderful and enhanced our experience.  Having High Tea in front of a cozy fire was an elegant experience. I cannot say enough good things about The Stafford.  The ambience was wonderful, the service and the service, excellent. But what really makes the Stafford so special is the staff.  Everyone greeted us with a smile, knew our name, and went “the extra mile” to make our stay feel like both an elegant, and family experience.  My husband and I look forward to returning next year for my birthday – or even sooner!",5,2023,01,26
142,Lovely stay,"Thank you Stafford for a lovely stay.The welcome was very warm and rooms equipped very well, partnered with lovely beds and a large marble bathroom. The only down side was we told, not asked to pay a 'discretionary' charge on check out which I think should be asked rather than told. ",4,2023,01,24
142,Home away from home,"We have been to London many many times over the last 30 years for both business and pleasure and lucked into the Stafford about  6 years ago and will never go anywhere else. Location is fantastic, hotel is quiet and tucked away with great rooms and dining but the best part by far are the people. It can seem cliché but they truly do treat you like family. They remarkably quickly remember your name and preferences and greet you warmly every time . Checkout is all hugs and see you soon  Fantastic hotel in all respects",5,2023,01,21
142,Great hotel for business meetings,"Great hotel, good for business meetings. Central location means it’s easy to get to for all parties. The hotel has a great outdoor dining area for summer evenings and lunches. 

Menu can be quite expensive but the quality outweighs the cost and the service is second to none.",5,2023,01,20
142,"Lovely hotel and staff, excellent location.  ","seeking a truly british experience, The Stafford didn't disappoint.  it is a beautiful hotel, the room was absolutely lovely, and the staff professional and very gracious.  I highly recommend everything but the room service.

142,A Lovely Stay at The Stafford,"I recently enjoyed a lovely stay at The Stafford with two of my business associates.  Located on a quiet street in the heart of St James, the hotel is discreet, quiet and beautifully maintained.  The food in The Game Bird and the drinks in The American Bar were excellent.  Prior to our trip, the concierge staff arranged seamless airport transportation for us and two fantastic days of private tours.  We even enjoyed a private tour of the hotel’s underground wine cellars.  But the very best part of The Stafford is the staff.  Every member of the team was kind, helpful and went above and beyond to answer our questions and provide guidance.  I will definitely return to The Stafford on my next trip to London!",5,2023,01,19
142,Fantastic,"We chose to stay at The Stafford for my 40th Birthday and we were delighted we did. Great communication prior to our stay, very helpful in answering questions and welcoming upon arrival. Having never stayed in London, the location was very important and having been to visit a few times, selected this hotel. Very convenient and some lovely restaurants not far away. The room was great. Traditional but very well equipped and a good size. The American Bar was excellent for an after dinner drink and staff fantastic throughout our stay from concierge to the reception staff. Very pleased with our choice and can’t wait to go back:)",5,2023,01,16
142,Amazing hotel in the center Mayfair,"The hotel is right at the center of everything, close the all the sites of central London as well the Underground. The facilities at the hotel are top notch, both restaurants (The Game Bird & American Bar), and the rooms are large and well appointed. But what will bring us back is the amazing service, just an example of the support and attention to detail was they’re providing Christmas Crackers for Christmas Day. We were flying in Christmas Eve and would not have time to procure. We reached out ahead of time and they provided us options and went to Harrod’s for us. Can’t thank the STAFFORD staff enough for a delightful holiday. We will return again.",5,2023,01,15
142,Cannot be beaten,"The perfect place for a few days post festivities.
The location never fails to impress me it’s so central but so quiet.

142,We were welcomed home,"Outstanding hotel,  our second stay and it won’t be the last.  All of the staff made us feel welcome.   The service and food in the game bird was outstanding, try the pigeon pie.  American bar is amazing!  The staff, drinks and music combine to create a wonderful vibe.  
The location, from our perspective, is perfect, central location with easy access to the tube.
Well done, didn’t want to leave",5,2022,12,31

142,Pure joy to stay there,"We had a fantastic three night stay at this hotel  during the first week in December.  What a treat to stay there.  The staff were fantastic and so welcoming, and nothing was too much trouble.  We had a deluxe double room which was large and spotless.  The room had been so well designed and really felt like a home from home.  From the moment we arrived and checked in (receptionist was so friendly and Ned Holder came over to introduce himself) to the time of departure we were looked after to a legendary degree!  Had lovely cocktails in the American Bar and a superb dinner in the Game Bird restaurant.   Breakfast was excellent and again the service was impeccable.  Housekeeping were on top of the game and our room was kept absolutely as you would expect in a five Star hotel.  Would have no reservation  in  recommending this gem of a hotel and we look forward to returning as soon as possible.  Would not stay anywhere else now.",5,2022,12,26

Fantastic food and the American Bar is the best place for speciality cocktails! Always feels like home when we visit the Stafford, you will not find a more welcoming establishment.",5,2022,12,16
142,One night in the Stafford hotel,"A perfect location for the area around Green Park. 
On arrival the staff are very helpful, friendly, and 
Efficient.
My wife Jane and I were shown to room 106, in the main building, which we found spacious enough for one night and comfortable.
It wasn’t until later in the evening that I looked out of the window to see we were overlooking a dirty looking lite well area. Obviously this was rather disappointing,  but it  was made much worse by the constant noise from 4 or 5 air conditioning units which made an  irritating droning sound. 
As a light sleeper I found this droning noise in the quiet early hours very disturbing. Had it not been for this noise I’m quite sure the room would have been perfect.
I’m always surprised that no effort is made to ensure 
a first time visitor leaves with a good impression enough to hopefully encourage another visit. 
Sadly I can’t say I had a wish to come back again soon, even after a very enjoyable breakfast.",4,2022,12,15
142,Stellar Service and Experience,"Popped into the Stafford for drinks on a Saturday hoping to get into The American Bar. Although it was fully booked for the day, Ned and Luka took excellent care of us! We ended up coming back on Sunday for Sunday Roast and enjoyed drinks afterward in The American Bar, both activities were stellar. The hotel is stunning (it was decorated beautifully for Christmas) and the service was top notch. Would definitely recommend popping in for lunch, dinner, tea, or a cocktail. We plan to stay there on our next visit to London! ",5,2022,12,10
142,The perfect London getaway,A truly excellent hotel with lots of old world charm with all the modern amenities. Perfect location with almost all the main attractions and shopping areas within walking distance. Excellent service and food at the restaurant and bar; the staff really make you feel at home. Would definitely love to go back,5,2022,12,02
142,Amazing staff created a warm and memorable experience,"Traveled to London with a friend, and we popped into The Stafford for cocktails at the Game Bird. The staff was very warm and welcoming - they gave us great tips on what to do during our visit. We ended up coming back to the Game Bird for a traditional Sunday Roast that was delicious and left us very full and happy. We followed up the Sunday Roast with cocktails in the American Bar. They have an impressive selection of craft cocktails as well as classic cocktails. It's a must-visit on your trip to London - it's especially nice to stop by for a drink after sightseeing nearby.",5,2022,12,01
142,Magical visit - unmissable experience!,"Words simply cannot do justice to the fantastic location, wonderful building, and truly excellent and professional staff at The Stafford. The rooms are immaculate and the very height of comfort. The restaurant and bar serves the finest food and drink. However for me the staff are the real standout at The Stafford. Warm and welcoming whilst closely attending to your every want and need, you really couldn't ask for any more.

If you are planning to stay in London, The Stafford should be your first and only hotel.

142,A  wonderful  stay at this excellent hotel,"My wife and i spent a wonderful evening at the Stafford Hotel this last Monday. 
Everything about our stay was just perfect, from the welcome we were given at reception, to being shown our suite and the whole experience of The Stafford.

This hotel manages to deliver elegance at a level not often experienced. The staff are so well trained and make you feel special, as though you are the only people they are looking after.

I would highly recommend this hotel in the lovely quiet St James's Place.",5,2022,11,30
142,THIS IS A MUST READ REVIEW ," ANOTHER AMAZING STAY - The Stafford is the ONLY hotel I consider heaven in London. The BEST rooms are in the courtyard! HUGE BATHTUBS and if you lack bath products boots is a drugstore that has EVERYTHING you could want to have an amazing bath experience. The staff is simply TOP NOTCH!!! The American bar there is quite nice.....I love the breakfast in the am with champagne......best way to start the day. There is a lovely park near by for a great walk. This hotel is especially lovely during the spring and summer........they have a ""grill out"" if you will in the courtyard. If you don't stay here you are missing out!!!!!! Thank you Stafford!

142,Traditional elegance and excellent service - right in the heart of town.,"The most elegant of traditional English hotels. The Stafford London is ocated in a peaceful cul-de-sac in St James, but just a 5 minute walk from Piccadilly.  The staff of the hotel are superb - professional, courteous and super-efficient.  The hotel is large enough to be able to offer a first rate restaurant, bar and room service, but small enough to be personal and to make you feel very welcome.  We're looking forward to our next return stay.",5,2022,11,23
142,Outstanding In Every Away,"I typically grade 4-of-5  (or 9-of-10)  for outstanding stays so that I can reserve a top grade of 5 or 10 to those rare experiences that truly are A+ Superb.  Stafford gets my top mark because everything and everyone was exceptional.  EVERY person I encountered was pleasant and professional, the facility is superb in every way, service and food was consistently great and my room was perfect for rest and for work.  Because of the attention to detail displayed by the entire staff at the Stafford I have no doubt that the wonderful experience I had is typical.",5,2022,11,21
142,Second home,"The Stafford truly is our home away from home. Nothing compares to it and to us it’s the only place to stay in London. 

We want to thank Ned for taking care of us from day 1, Alexandra for securing us our favourite room, Benoit, Salvatore and their amazing team at the American Bar, Pankaj and his team for the outstanding service at breakfast and afternoon tea (best afternoon tea in London, such a treat!), and just everyone for giving us such a warm and heartfelt welcome. We consider you all friends, and always look forward to seeing you.

Outstanding service, location and people!

Thank you for giving us yet another special stay - see you soon again!",5,2022,11,21
142,THE BEST OF THE BEST IN LONDON,"The Stafford is simply amazing, I can't find any other words to describe it!

Being involved the hospitality industry this hotel really exceeded my expectations once again.

From the moment of check in, where I was welcomed with a friendly smile from the receptionist I knew it was going to be a wonderful stay, and so it was! 

The room was spotless, I was lucky enough to have a beautiful junior suite in the mews building which was facing towards the famous courtyard. The room had all the amenities I needed, from a nice and relaxing sitting room to a walk-in shower and bathtub in a massive bathroom. And I need to mention the bed, the bed might be the most comfortable one I ever slept in! 

Breakfast in the game bird restaurant was the best way to start the morning! Luca always greeted me in friendly yet professional way and always made sure that I was looked after.

Thank you to all the team, I cant wait to come back to the Stafford once again, it is really a home away from home!",5,2022,11,21
142,Cannot wait to return to The Stafford!  ,"At every turn, the Stafford exceeded expectations.  Each person we came into contact with was friendly, service minded and excellent.  The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, the bathroom large.  Breakfast in the buzzy coffee room was delicious and fun.  The doorman went above and beyond to find a taxi for us when the rain had most taxis occupied....and did so with an infectiously happy attitude.  The location is perfection.  It's like a well kept secret.  Absolutely delightful!   ",5,2022,11,19
142,The Best!,"We were in London for three days for a special occasion.  We couldn't have found a better place.  Everything about the hotel was superb, including the low key location in an otherwise bustling area.  The room was welcoming, well appointed and quiet despite overlooking the street. The staff was warm and worked hard to address our every need. The restaurant and of course the American Bar helped to make us feel right at home. The next time we are in London we will definitely choose The Stafford as our base of operations.",5,2022,11,10
142,"Perfect, as always!","Calm, discreet, personal and picture perfect- everything a luxury London hotel should be, but often is not! 
This hotel is a gem with as close to faultless service as it's possible to get. Staff are excellent- professional, welcoming and unfailingly pleasant. The rooms are a delight, especially the Mews Master Suites- perfect when you need a little more space to relax in. The food is innovative and excellent quality and the American Bar is an institution with some of the best martini's to be had in the capital.
We stay in many luxury hotels each year but this is certainly one of the best you are likely to experience.",5,2022,11,08
142,Simply superb Stafford,"For us probably the Stafford continues to be the very best hotel in london. Very friendly and efficient staff,small enough hotel to have 5 star customer care and quiet enough to become an oasis of calm in the centre of a busy city. 
Whoever does the fresh flowers is so creative with a beautiful and stunning pumpkin theme running through breakfast area. Those little touches are so important. Breakfast staff and food top class.
Fleeting visit but we will be back.",5,2022,11,04
142,Simply the best 5 stars in London,"The Stafford is definitely the best 5 stars hotel ! The staff, the rooms, the breakfast, everything is perfect ! It's a big family and you feel like family. The breakfast is the best we had ever, please try the hot chocolate and the delicious waffles ;) 

We tried a lot of hotel in London and now we found the best one for us. As soon as you arrived you can feel the British feeling and the warm welcome.
Tips : Try their afternoon tea !!!!

Lovely friendly helpful staff 
Nuts / snacks complementary 
Perfect light beers gorgeous chilled wines and fizz! Ummmmmmy 
We will return and probably stay here next London visit",5,2022,10,24
142,Unique service,"We really enjoyed our stay at Stafford, location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and eating out. But the service level of the staff was the best - something extraordinary happened when we left the hotel with a taxi. Our son left his mobile phone in the lobby while we were waiting the taxi to arrive. We got into the taxi, the taxi started driving and when we were two blocks away from the hotel, one member of the hotel staff stood outside the taxi while it was waiting in the traffic lights with our son's mobile phone with him. And it was raining heavily!!! Superb service!! We will stay at Stafford again when in London next time.",5,2022,10,22
142,Weekend Getaway,"Spent Friday and Saturday nights at The Stafford in July and it was amazing. I would definately come back.
The hotel facilities and the great service i received from staff were superb. See you all at Christmas!",5,2022,10,21
142,great  people make the difference,"the staff are just fabulous. they really do help with  everything. we needed help with transport, printing boarding passes, recommendations about local places. I also needed to be away from the smoke of their cigar lounge and they were excellent and successful in making our stay smoke free. i the rooms are better than the pictures. the location as fantastic as the maps suggest.   
i booked on the Stafford website and then weeks later realized i got my dates wrong. they very nicely worked out a change of dates. even though the website said no. ( not setting an expectation here)  we worked out a split stay that fit my schedule. I always use a hotel's website if i can having seen third party reservations fail on two previous vacations.
Very gracious stay.",5,2022,10,20
142,Exceptional Hotel with Exquisite Service,"From the cocktails in the American bar to the delicious Game Bird fare to the attentive and uncompromising staff, this was one of my best hotels stays ever. Not only that, but my traveling companion had forgotten her medication in the US. The hotel concierges went out of their way to assist us with DHL, who did not handle the shipment properly. We cannot say enough good things about the Stafford.",5,2022,10,20
142,Beautiful hotel with great service,"This is quite a delayed review but I wanted to share my appreciation for The Stafford hotel, and more specifically Brett at the concierge, for their kind service and hospitality. The hotel is beautiful and quaint, is very centrally located and has lots of beautiful shops around it. Thank you to Brett for helping me through a 5-alarm fire to get my COVID test back in time for my flight. he went above and beyond in his service. 

a must-stay!",5,2022,10,18
142,A Perfect Small Hotel in London,"We spent a week at The Stafford to celebrate our anniversary and everything about our stay was outstanding. The Mews room was large, airy and very comfortable. Housekeeping kept the room clean and tidy. Breakfast served is a varied menu and delicious, brought by warm and friendly waitstaff. The concierge team was very helpful. And tea time was delicious. The hotel has a warm and comfortable atmosphere that gives an inviting British feeling. I highly recommend staying there.",5,2022,10,12
142,A fantastic return visit,"We stayed here again recently and it really is like returning home ! 
Staff are amazing , very efficient but very friendly . 
From food to bar to housekeeping everything was perfect 
It’s also in a great location, beside the tube station and within walking distance of Hyde park and great shopping 
I totally recommend The Stafford as a place to stay ,",5,2022,10,11
142,Exceptional hotel in Green Park,"We spent 2 nights there with my best friends. We had an incredible time. The people are so nice and the service is amazing. Rooms are big and clean. 
Regarding the service, Zelia is especially caring. 
I recommend the breakfast which is delicious and full of choices. Test their dark bread, it's exquisite.
The location is also just perfect. You can have a nice walk in Green Park and walk around London easily. It's very easy to reach from St Pancras too.",5,2022,10,06
142,Trip of a lifetime,Staying at the Stafford is better than home away from home. The service is exceptional; it’s spotless. We stayed in the Mews and the suites were spacious with a grand bathroom (with 2 sinks) and great shower pressure. The concierge will steer you in the right direction for restaurant ideas and activities. The American Bar has amazing food (and drinks!) and breakfast was a treat daily. So much is walking distance and the tube is super close by. Amazing location and outstanding customer service. Oh and the bed is so comfortable. We can’t wait to go back.,5,2022,10,02
142,Truly a Fantastic Hotel,"From the accommodation to the food, this hotel is wonderful. We ate at both restaurants and enjoyed in-room dining. It’s clean and well appointed. I’m a returning patron and will definitely be back. The location is quiet and convenient.",5,2022,10,01
142,Great spot …secret passageways make it even more convenient.,Great spot….tucked away so quiet but secret alley to St James and Green Park tube make it even easier. Room a little dated but very comfortable. Bar/restaurant/patio set up is terrific…like an oasis in a quiet neighborhood. Staff  very helpful. Crowd seemed to be 100 percent American.,5,2022,10,01
142,Hotel restaurant drinks and food,The bar and restaurant at this hotel is a gem find tucked away behind St James st. Food service and ambiance are just perfect. The staff are just on top of their game and it shows. Pricey but worth it and definitely reserve a table for the weekend .,5,2022,09,30
142,"Superb hotel, exceptional staff","Our second stay at The Stafford. The staff are friendly, professional and exceptionally welcoming. The American Bar is fabulous and the Game Bird never disappoints. Thanks to all of the staff who made our 3 night stay wonderful. Looking forward to our next time. The Turner’s.",5,2022,09,27
142,Best Hotel in the Best Location,"We had a three day getaway at this lovely London hotel recently. Everything about this place is 5 star. Friendly and efficient staff at check-in and check-out. Fabulous team in the restaurant & American Bar where we had a great breakfast each morning. Lots of choice and well-prepared. The room service was exceptional too. Always bottle water on bedside, turndown service each evening. It's so nice to leave the hotel for the day and come back to a beautifully clean and welcoming room. Great location only short walk to Green Park.
Well done The Stafford - you are a class act.",5,2022,09,22
142,A true gem in the heart of Mayfair,"As the title suggests, this hotel is an absolute gem in the heart of Mayfair.  The history of the hotel makes this a very special treat in itself.  This was my first stay at the hotel on a personal level and it was nothing short of perfect.  The level of care given by the hotel is exceptional.  It truly is a personal service to each and every guest.  The service across the whole hotel from the reception, the bar staff, the restaurant staff and the management is first class .  For our overnight stay we were in a Junior Suite which was simply luxurious comfort.  So much thought has gone into the design of the rooms which gives you everything and more.  Little touches like nightlights strategically placed around the room and bathroom providing safety and comfort and silent aircon which meant a completely undisturbed nights' rest.   Breakfast in The Game Bird Restaurant was just delicious.  Plenty of choice and eggs perfectly cooked.  This truly was an exceptional and memorable stay and if you are looking for somewhere special, I would not hesitate to recommend The Stafford as the ultimate place to stay in Mayfair.",5,2022,09,21
142,"Service, Service, Service","The Service provided by the staff is remarkable.   The hotel is centrally located, near Buckingham Palace and an underground station.   The room was pristine, and the food was delicious.   The interior of the hotel has the old-world charm that matches the exterior.",5,2022,09,18
142,Another amazing stay,"My family and I stayed at the Stafford for the second time and what a treat it was! What sets this hotel apart is its quaintness, hospitable staff, great location and knowledgeable conceirge team. They were so very thoughtful of us, especially Ned at the check-in desk who was very kind and helpful in contacting a store to see if they had a shoe in stock for us.  The bell staff was also very attentive, especially in arranging transportation to the airport. We will definitely be recommending the Stafford to our friends and family!",5,2022,09,12
142,Simply the finest hotel in London,"Our third stay here at the Stafford and yet again we have been blown away by the incredible service, style and sophistication of the hotel all delivered in such a warm and homely way.  

Stuart’s team are without doubt the best in the business with impeccable professionalism with a friendly smile ! 

Our room was stunning, stylish, comfiest bed ever and beautifully appointed.

We ate in the Game Bird which was lovely and relaxed but again professionally run.  I would highly recommend the scallop tempura. 

Thank you to you all for making what was a memorable weekend anyway with the passing of HRH Queen Elizabeth even more special.  

Kindest regards the Morison family x",5,2022,09,11
142,Exceptional - better than the best,London has a good number of excellent hotels and we have stayed in many. Nearly all seem to manage every comfort and luxury we can think of. The Stafford is somehow just better. More personal. More individual. Very classy. Amazing location. We were genuinely welcomed and shown real hospitality by everyone we came into contact with - all the employees at The Stafford understand hospitality. Genuine hospitality is hard to cascade down through an entire hotel team but the leadership here has done it. Thank you.,5,2022,09,03
142,N&M,"We stayed for five nights. There is only one word to describe the Stafford, it’s facilities,  it’s staff both in terms of efficiency and friendliness, comfort, food and everything else one associates with a fantastic hotel - SUPERB",5,2022,08,24
142,Home away from home,"This was our second stay at the hotel and also a stay to celebrate our 25th anniversary. This hotel is outstanding and unique, and what makes it so is very much the staff who feel like family and friends. We want to thank every single one of the wonderful staff, and in particular Ned, who arranged a beautiful welcome and stay for us, Salvatore and everyone at the American Bar, Eugenio for the amazing and insightful tour of the wine cellar and wine tasting. Everyone at the Game Bird for brilliant and kind service. This hotel is such a gem made from its people, service, location and homely, yet luxury feel. Thank you so much for making this stay so very special to us - we will be back soon and we look forward to seeing you all again. A 10 out of 10 recommendation from us!",5,2022,08,20
142,Feels like our second home,"We have just returned from another stay at the wonderful Stafford hotel. It feels like our second home.

From the minute we arrived we were very warmly welcomed, with lots of friendly and familiar faces.

The hotel interior is beautiful and the American bar is decorated with British and American memorabilia which makes it fun and interesting. There is an amazing selection of new and classic cocktails and the bar staff are always happy to help with your choice. They also have a good selection of single malts and champagne. The Game Bird restaurant serves a fine selection of traditional and contemporary food, always served beautifully and it always adds a special touch to your stay.

The courtyard is a fabulous relaxed place to have a drink and a meal; the triple cooked chips are a triumph.

The staff work very hard and will go the extra mile to make your stay a very pleasant one.

The rooms are always spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated.

We are looking forward to our next visit at Christmas and we know we will have a lovely stay.

Many thanks to Ned and all the team.

 

Best regards from Paul and Carol",5,2022,08,13
142,Such a awesome stay!,"We had a lovely stay at The Stafford London. Great location. The staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The meals in both Game Bird and American Bar were delicious. Hopefully we will return soon",5,2022,08,01
142,I can’t imagine staying anywhere else.,"My family of four stayed here over the weekend and truly enjoyed our visit. From the decor, modern amenities, food, top-notch staff, and unbeatable location, it is not to be beat. 3-minute walk to Green Park and Buckingham Palace, minutes from the shops and restaurants of Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street,  yet still a quiet and secluded hotel. We traveled across Scotland and England over a 10-day period and this was hands-down our favorite lodging. ",5,2022,08,01
142,Not a great stay,"I stayed at the Stafford in early July -- and had very high hopes given the reviews. I was travelling alone in London for two nights and wanted to try some where different. First the positives: location is wonderful, very central; room was clean and well equipped. 

Now my cons: i booked a carriage house room which sounded like it would be lovely as was described on the website.  (""chic and private oasis"" ""overlooking a quiet cobbled courtyard""). When i was escorted to the room, the ""quiet courtyard"" was a bustling restaurant with patrons sitting right outside my window and door. I mentioned this to the staff escorting me -- who didn't react only said that the restaurant closed at 9:30 (it didn't). I had to keep my curtains shut -- and i realized there was not an extra lock on the door - which made me feel quite insecure. This came to pass as the maid walked in on me sleeping on the first night (around 9 pm -- early i know but i was jet lagged). I couldn't get out of bed to stop her as there were people sitting right outside my door and i was in pajamas.

I mentioned this to the front desk the next day -- who said they would pass along to management but i didn't hear anything. 

I can't comment on the other rooms -- but for the carriage house -- i would not stay there again.

couple of other notes - the hotel sent a pre arrival questionnaire asking if there was anything in particular needed such as an ironing board/iron. I checked that off -- but it never appeared even after mentioning to the front desk.

And in case you are thinking -- maybe just grab a table and sit in the courtyard? no -- those were all reserved and apparently i should have reserved when i booked my room.

All in all -- not the 5 star treatment i would have expected. I will explore other options next time.",3,2022,07,28
142,Its been a while,"The Stafford is a small 5 Star and used to be the ""sister hotel to the Ritz"". It was forced to close during Covid on a number of occasions so we haven't visited for 3 years. If anything it's even better now than it was  - quite a feat. We were given a Deluxe King on the third floor, a nice room with a view over the terrace/courtyard. My lady who is quite small found the bed quite high to get into (as usual, they really are quite high) but one of the most comfortable of any hotel we've stayed in, ever. Room service is precise and speedy and the Room service menu ranges across both the Restaurant and American Bar menus - we'll give a name check to Mahir who went over and above on a number of occasions. We decided to eat outside where possible due to Covid so the American Bar Terrace hosted by Viviana looked after us splendidly. The food is splendid. The Hotel has lost its ""Super Doorman"", Charlie and Head Concierge of years, Frank, but has replaced them with excellent and very personable staff. In all a wonderful 8 day break and it was good to be back 'home'. Highly recommended for those who like smaller luxury hotels with traditional 5 Star service where nothing is too much trouble with no corners cut.",5,2022,07,20
142,Anniversary weekend,"This gem of a hotel in a prime position ticked all the boxes! Excellent staff, extremely helpful and caring. Suite was perfect, bed so comfortable and all room facilities excellent. Room service was prompt and delicious.",5,2022,07,16
142,Not as good as we had hoped,"We decided to stay here after eating in the Game Bird last year. It is in a nice quiet location. The staff were very friendly and helpful. But what let it down was the room service side. Bottle drinks, but no bottle opener and on over hearing we were not the only room requiring one. The minibar and bottled water were not topped up enough. 
Hand towels disappeared and we had to ask for two more.
The air conditioning in the room worked and really helped at night.
But the prices!! One whisky was £20 a measure, when a bottle could be bought from a well know supermarket for £25.00! 
We will not be staying here again, there are better hotels at more reasonable prices. We do not mind paying, but for the price, we do expect better housekeeping.",4,2022,07,14
142,Lovely Hotel!,My mom and I stayed at The Stafford recently and had a very lovely stay. The staff is very accommodating and genuinely friendly. We stayed at the hotel at the beginning of the week and returned later that week and it felt like coming home. The hotel itself is very charming and located on a quiet street with a private courtyard. We will be visiting again!,5,2022,07,12
142,Never fails to impress,"This was our second stay at The Stafford, and on this occasion we travelled as a group with three room reservations. From even before we arrived the staff were unfailingly helpful, assisting us in securing a restaurant booking and a table in the American Bar. Their courteous, attentive service continued throughout our stay: all staff seemed happy to help regardless of what was asked of them and did so with a smile and to the highest standard. I must give a personal mention to Mr Ned Holder, the Guest Relations Manager whom I contacted prior to our stay to help arrange certain aspects. Mr Holder is an absolute credit to the hotel and the wider hospitality industry: nothing was too much trouble for him.

Our room was spacious, spotlessly clean and blissfully quiet.  We enjoyed the most fabulous meal in The Game Bird and a superb breakfast. If a business is built on the people it employs then The Stafford has the most solid of foundations as I couldn't find fault with any of them.

The hotel was busy as our stay coincided with the Wimbledon Championships, but despite this the levels of service and professionalism we received were never compromised. I cannot be emphatic enough in my praise for The Stafford - personalised perfection.",5,2022,07,07
142,Quaint British hotel,"A beautiful London hotel off Piccadilly that is the art of English quaint hotel, we stayed in a suite in the mews block, the room was lovely with a lounge, two toilets and large bedroom, however it was not clean, there was finger marks all over the wardrobes around the toilet doors was drip marks and pencil and pen marks in the cloakroom. Attention to detail was lacking. The coffee machine only had 3 coffee tabs for two people ?? and what I could not understand was why there were no tea making facilities I always have a cuppa before bed and I am not going to ring room service to bring me a cup of tea that late at night and have to wait. We asked for two extra glasses for the room as we had friends who were also guest joining us before we set off for the Hyde Park concert they never appeared we ended up drinking fizz from tumblers 

The breakfast the next day was muddled one staff member did not seem to know what the next was doing seemed like a lot of management but not many doing. 

The hotel is fabulous I have stayed in many five star hotels but this was let down by attention to detail, maybe a lack of staff but was a shame as would have got 5 stars",3,2022,07,05
142,Why book anywhere else?,"My London home. I travel A LOT and adore this place in every way possible, mostly because of the people. They truly understand service. No amount of decor, fancy dew-dads, cool music can make up for unbridled joy in serving others. That, at its heart, is true hospitality and it is baked in to the culture of this place. Go! Tip generously! And, maybe, tell your friends. (Don’t want it to be too hard to book a room, after all).",5,2022,07,04
142,Dreadful Breakfast / Restaurant Service,"When we first arrived at the start of our 4 night stay we thought we had uncovered a gem of a hotel tucked behind the Ritz, well received at reception and the room was ready early, got to the room which was clean and of the quality of a London 5 star hotel. Light lunch at the American Bar Terrace was good, however £120 for a bottle of Sussex Sparkling wine and £9.50 for a small bottle of lager was over the top in my view.
Note; The American Bar closes at 11pm and you will not be served in any other part of the hotel, you have to be seated in the bar as the bar manager says ""we have not got enough staff to serve you"".
Unfortunately I have to say our experience at Breakfast on all 4 days was dreadful, our pre-booked table was not available on 3 of the 4 mornings, the translation from order take to receiving the food was almost comical, it seamed in my opinion that when the waiters ticket got to the kitchen that either the chef could not read the writing or could not read English! On Monday 27th June a lady from the neighboring table waked out after waiting 1 hour for her cooked breakfast that eventually turned up incorrect! I personally had a cooked breakfast 4 times and there was something omis on 3 occasions, also everyday one of the 4 of us would have something on our plate that was cold when it should have been hot. The second night we had pre-booked (email confirmation) the Restaurant, when we arrived there was no record of our booking. In my opinion there is something seriously wrong with the senior management of this hotel to let the hub of the hotel, the kitchen, self destruct every morning.
Nice Hotel, great location, American Bar short staffed, dreadful kitchen.",3,2022,06,30
142,The American Bar,"It is coming home.
It had been too long since my
last visit to the hotel and to this bar.
It’s a true find and worth a real visit.
Cocktails are revered here and why not.
Glazed Prawns and Cobb Salad had
lovely a touch. Fresh and imaginative.",5,2022,06,26
142,An elegant home at the Stafford,"The Stafford Hotel is our number one choice when visiting London.
Not only is the location brilliant - perfect for all shopping museum hopping, enjoying the sunshine in St, James, but it it is easily  accessible to theatre.
The Staff are expedient and courteous, and wil go overboard to make your
stay enjoyable and comfortablel
Don't miss the charm of St James, or the Game Bird restaurant and avail yourselves of The American Bar, which floats into a lovely mews courtyard
Classy and elegant - and goes beyond the mile to earn its 5 star reputation.",5,2022,06,20
142,Still superb,"If you ever need a 5 star service and 5 star accommodation in central London then come here. 
Superb location by Green Park the smiling staff make staying here a joy. Comfy beds ,great rooms just off the beaten track.
One slight niggle is the odd cocktail in the American bar consists of a lot of ice for the money but the smiling staff expertly deal with the demands of the guests with such charm.",5,2022,06,15
142,A delightful stay!,"Attention to detail, no request too big, fantastic staff and beautifully located. A true delight to stay in this central location where everyone is friendly, helpful, and a joy to be around. It could not be more conveniently located right in the heart of London.",5,2022,06,06
142,Just lovely,"We came as a family with 2 children (6 & 2) the service was impeccable! 
Our front of our house member, Luigi, couldn’t do enough to be attentive and also entertain the children with a small gift and tasty sweet treat! 
The setting is fabulously smart, but relaxed at the same time, with cocktails and snacks to die for. Highly recommend and will be back",5,2022,05,31
142,Wonderful service and comfort,"We love The Stafford and now enjoy an annual trip for a birthday and anniversary. From the moment we arrive, staff are friendly and attentive, wanting to make our stay the best experience. We like the suites overlooking the courtyard, they are beautifully appointed and well equipped. The beds are so comfortable as well. 
This time we didn’t eat main meals there but we enjoyed cocktails, drinks, small plates and late night drinks in the American bar. It’s our first choice for a London stay.",5,2022,05,29
142,Excellent hotel,"It is very nice,the staff are friendly and the front desk was v cooperative. All and all, i loved the experience.

They offer breakfast also. The croissants are delicious but the eggs are not that good.
I recommend it and i enjoyed my stay t👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼",5,2022,05,26
142,"The Stafford Highly Recommended. If I could give 10 Stars, I would.","The Stafford, I often don’t give such praise for excellence, however, The Stafford deserves such praise. From the warm welcoming of the front desk, to the concierge assistance, to the dining room and American Bar wait staff, all have done an amazing job to make our stay here at The Stafford, worth it. Rooms are very clean with both morning and evening service. The hotel itself, very pleasing with English ambience. One of us is celebrating a birthday on this visit and a slice of cake and card were delivered to the room. If I could rate this a 10 on Trip Advisor, I would. We are staying in the Carriage House and very happy with the room selection we made. I can think of no negative comments on this hotel. Highly Recommended.",5,2022,05,22
142,Weekend in town,"Excellent location, well equiped bedroom and good facilities.
Staff were excellent  very helpful and made you feel welcome, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was very good and relaxed.
Will definitelt stay again at the Stafford.",5,2022,05,18
142,Perfect Anniversary!,"This hotel is the nicest hotel I’ve stayed at in London and I’ve stayed in a lot! The whole experience was perfect from start to finish. We visited for our anniversary and we had a wonderful meal at The Game Bird followed by fabulous cocktails outside in the sunshine. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and the service is outstanding. We made our reservation with Ned and he’s the loveliest person to deal with. He made sure everything was brilliant from start to finish! Thank you Ned!
The hotel is down a very quiet street near Piccadilly. You’d never believe you were in the heart of London! You can walk through passageways to the hustle and bustle of London near Fortnums and the Ritz or the opposite way to Green park and Buckingham Palace. I can’t wait to return!",5,2022,05,16
142,Touch of class,"Great hotel that I use for business trips. 
Staff are fantastic from check in, to the America bar and Game bird. I often arrive early from international travel and they always make a plan to get a room for you.

Rooms are well laid out and in both my last trips I was upgraded to the stables rooms upstairs. Great showers and a decent size for London. 

Love the quick access to green and Hyde park especially as a runner.

One idea would be to have a complimentary gym laundry bag - for gym gear each day - becoming a standard in the US.

Look forward to my next visit next week. ",5,2022,05,13
142,Great stay at the Stafford Hotel,Wonderful stay at the Stafford Hotel! Great service and great amenities and great location. Very close to the Green Park tube. Everyone went out of their way to make us comfortable and provide great information and help on what to go and do. I will always stay at the Stafford when I’m in London.,5,2022,05,12
142,Anniversary stay,"We stayed at the Stafford may 2022 for our 11 year anniversary and what a fantastic hotel, the hotel it’s self it’s beautiful on every level and the rooms 😱 so comfortable with the most amazing beds UNREAL !!! 
All the staff at the Stafford are super nice and very helpful especially Natalia in the American bar she really made our trip extra special (thanks Natalia) also the doorman john was very helpful and couldn’t help us enough. 

Would highly recommend a visit to the Stafford, we for sure will be coming back see you soon guys 

Mr eddison",5,2022,05,08
142,Game Bird,"Apparently the Restaurant is being refurbished. Wasn’t told this in advance -limited menu which was poorly executed.

Rooms in the hotel small but comfortable. Service is what you would expect from a Five star hotel…",3,2022,05,05
142,The only place I'll stay in London!,"The Stafford was delightful as always. This was Carolyn's first stay at the Stafford (my birthday present to her).  Everything about the Stafford put a huge smile on her face...the luxuriousness of the bathroom...her first Pimms sitting outside at the American Bar...the Mercedes AMG sedan ride to Heathrow. By the time we left, she understood why I'll only stay at the Stafford. Moreover, the wonderfully accommodating and helpful staff helped set up the necessary Covid tests for our return flight to Colorado and went out of their way to find a sweater we left behind.",5,2022,05,03
142,Great weekend,"First of all, when you arrive you are greeted by the kindness of the doormen Andrew  and Brett , they really make your trip memorable. I think  the staff at the Stafford  are what sets this hotel apart from the rest. Everyone is incredibly kind and helpful. It's a level of service that is unsurpassed, and such a pleasure to experience. 

The hotel itself is fabulous.
The rooms are very nice and spacious , I stayed in a Mews suite with beautiful  views over the fantastic courtyard,

We tried several different meals off the room service menu and everything was delicious. I am now officially overwhelmed with what is actually possible to do with a cauliflower steak .. simply delicious .
Also the cocktails in the American bar are outstanding  making for a  a superb cocktail experience, although take it easy on on the “One fall All” .  

If you are looking for a beautiful , centrally located hotel in London where you will be treated with the highest level of service , I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. The attention to detail and the kindness of the entire staff really make the Stafford. 
 
We will be back.

Thankyou so much 

Joanne  & Joseph",5,2022,04,25
142,Superb as usual,My wife and I have just spent another weekend at this wonderful hotel. Visiting here is truly like returning home with such welcoming staff. We have stayed many times and we are never disappointed. On this occasion we enjoyed a meal with friends and the staff in The Game Bird restaurant and The American Bar were fantastic. This is a 5 star gem and we look forward to our next visit.,5,2022,04,25
142,The Stafford provides first class Bank Holiday weekend,"A three night trip planned several months in advance hoping that COVID had given way and wouldn’t ruin an occasion. IT DIDN’T and the hotel and team on duty were first class.

Originally contact was by way of emails looking at rooms, booked the room plus the Game Bird. We’d had lunch in the American Bar numerous times this year but it would be our stay. 

On arrival we were expecting to leave our luggage and go lunching as it was Midday but the room was ready and was upgraded to junior suite so thanks to Alexandra on reception. 

We lunched, we Game Birded twice and Davide the sommelier provided a tour of the cellar as we’d mentioned interest in wines.

There was certainly no perceived lack of staff that has blighted the industry since early 2020 now and the staff on hand were all (to a man and woman) fantastic. I wish I could remember more names but the Polish waitress in the American Bar and Benoit Provost were helpful and full of enthusiasm plus Davide who took a trip through The Ritz wine list for me without being asked.

The room was quiet, aircon worked, safe worked, the lift was fast and breakfast was good including a lovely French omelette. A pricey weekend but we both have the view we’ll be back! 

Top, top marks team Stafford",5,2022,04,21
142,A fantastic family experience,"Everything was perfect about our stay at The Stafford London. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was luxurious. Alexandra went above and beyond with our children, in particular--she arranged for chocolate Easter eggs to be made by the pastry chef and delivered to our room for the holiday! Truly incredible.",5,2022,04,21
142,Would give 10 Stars!!,"They say first impressions are important , I very much agree.  

We were greeted with a smile when we entered reception, checked in and whisked up to our suite which was a Mews suite.

When the lady opened the door for us, I think the look on our faces said it all.  Stunning!!

We have stayed in some luxurious hotels around the world,  this was on another level.

The suite was massive, immaculate and with fine attention paid to every detail. 

Everything one could possibly need for a superb stay was waiting for us.  From luxurious bath robes to lovey fluffy towels and of course gorgeous Floris toiletries.

We popped down to the American Bar and had a drink . We chose to sit outside in the lovely courtyard seating area.

The staff are wonderful without exception.  They are attentive but not intrusive.  

We dined in the hotel restaurant, The Game Bird.  A lovely welcoming environment with fabulous food and again superb service.

A hearty breakfast was served the next morning, again in the Game Bird.  A very large choice and cooked perfectly to your liking.  Again, the staff looked after us exceptionally well.

A wonderful stay in a fabulous hotel, made extra special by the staff.

Superb.",5,2022,04,21
142,"Look no further, The Stafford is it!","Thank you to the Stafford Team for such a wonderful few days in London. The location is just perfect, the staff are so kind, friendly and their hospitality is 10 out of 10. 

There really are few hotels who do everything well and the Stafford is one of them.",5,2022,04,14
142,Exceeded every expectation!,"We have stayed at the Stafford a few times before, some years ago. It was good then but this time we were blown away, primarily by the staff. 

The room was fabulous, a Master Suite on the newly renovated 5th floor. Everything you could wish for in a room and bigger than found in most London Hotels. I must say we were throughly spoiled as it was a celebration and we were given a wonderful upgrade so huge thanks to Alexandra and the team on reception. 

The concierge and all FOH staff were perfect, I couldn't pick a fault however hard I tried, not one! Patrick made us laugh (the fox story) and made it feel like a home from home. 

We ate on the first night in the restaurant. WOW! Now we are foodies and know what we are talking about in this regard... it was all fabulous but my Venison Wellington and Bramley Apple dessert (pics below) were out of this world. I can't imagine you could eat much better anywhere in London. 

At the end of the day, a hotel can be luxurious and furnished and decorated beautifully, but that doesn't make it a great hotel. It is always the staff who do that. The staff here were faultless and I don't think I've ever said that before about a big hotel with so many staff! From beginning to end of our stay we were made to feel special and valued and nothing beats that experience. 

So, we will be saving our pocket money so that we can return as soon as we can to experience it all over again!",5,2022,04,14
142,A warm welcome,We can't speak too highly of the wonderful stay we had at The Stafford and especially of the staff in the hotel and The Game Bird restaurant who made our wedding anniversary extra special with all sorts of little touches. The location is perfect for strolling around some of the most scenic parks and streets in London. We had a great weekend and can't wait to return.,5,2022,04,11
142,Staff with a passion for the hotel,"Perfect location, quirky rooms with easily controllable heating, which is very important for menopausal me, so many hotels get this wrong. Great bathroom (loved the rain shower), Floris toiletries and the American Bar to top it all off 

What really makes this hotel is that the staff care about guests and their opinions. I had a couple of issues which were taken on board and responded to personally by management to resolve without any of the usual platitudes. The other staff we interacted with also had a can do attitude, it does make such a difference.",5,2022,04,06
142,The Stafford Hotel London,"The hotel is one of our family favourites. It is ideally situated for both shopping and site seeing. The staff are attentive, professional and efficient. 
On each of the occasions that we have visited, we have spoken with guests who have been returning to The Stafford for many years. Indeed, on this trip we spoke with an American couple who had first frequented the hotel in 1954.
I have posted about our stays in The Stafford Hotel before, however, every time we visit I am reminded why we keep coming back. It is the warmth, consideration and the personal touches from the staff members who are the best we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Special thanks go to Ned and his team.",5,2022,04,06
142,The Gamebird Restaurant.,"Firstly i would like to thank all the staff at The Game Bird restaurant at The Stafford Hotel, they are all amazing. We started our fabulous meal with 4 Pyefleet Oysters, amazingly fresh and perfectly prepared. For main, I had 'The Game Bird' (of course) which consisted of the Roast Squab Pigeon, Buttered Turnips, Apple Puree, Bacon & Garden Herb Barley Risotto all of which was absolutely beautifully cooked and looked amazingly presented on the plate. My daughter went for the Tomato Consomme which looked and smelled amazing, so pretty on the plate and then the Steak and Ale Steamed Suet Pudding with Triple-Cooked Chips! I went for the Purgatori red wine from Catalonia, again gorgeous and fruity although my palatte is not as educated as most. Dessert i always go for the cheeses as im not really a sweet tooth. Again a lovely array of British Cheeses carefully selected accompanied by seeded crackers. A big thumbs up to all the staff under the direction of the Executive Chef Jozef Rogulski fanatstic job as always and always the finest attention to detail. Fine dining at it's highest level!!!",5,2022,03,30
142,The hotel Hotel quality,"The hotel is in a very good location, the staff are very friendly and always in a good mood!  It was my wife's birthday, the staff was super kindly leaving a surprise in the room for her, SUPER!!! The room is spacious and comfortable! They have an excellent bar, with great drink menu!   A great choice! I hope to be back soon!",5,2022,03,30
142,"Brilliant Staff, noisy, smoke-filled courtyard","We had a four night stay at the Stafford and booked a suite in the ""tranquil courtyard"" but it was anything but.  The outdoor patio for the hotel's bar was under our suite, with music playing and people partying until 9:30 pm. The patio was also where guests went to smoke cigars and cigarettes so our room always smelled like smoke.  To get to our room we had to dodge clouds of smoke.  For the price we paid for the room this was unacceptable. The front of house staff, however, were really exceptional, the best service I've had at any luxury hotel in London.  The service at breakfast was spotty however.  Definitely a weak point.  It's difficult to rate this hotel fairly since if we'd not had the noisy, smoky courtyard room I think we would have had an exceptional stay.",4,2022,03,25
142,Belated Wedding Anniversary & West End Show,"Fantastic hotel with probably the best welcome we have ever had from staff at any hotel. The room was amazing the staff we only to happy to assist with anything we asked for. We will be going back…
I also have to say where its situated is great as its really tucked away and quiet =, yet so close to all the shops and theatres.",5,2022,03,23
142,Business trip with comfort in mind,"The Stafford is a hidden gem in Mayfair.  It is elegant and relaxed with warm welcoming staff.  The amenities and accommodation are first rate and the hotel is ideally positioned for business and pleasure.

The Stafford is ideal for any type of London stay, whether for business or leisure.  I cannot recommend it enough!",5,2022,03,21
142,Can’t wait to go back!,"My first stay at The Stafford. We stayed with friends on their recommendation; it did not disappoint. Everything was top notch from luggage handling and check-in on arrival to the efficiency of check-out.
Our rooms were comfortable, spacious and nicely appointed. The bathroom was exceptionally nice. We asked for a shower only and they accommodated. The pillows and beds were very comfy. 
Food services were excellent. We ate breakfast and lunch there several times and were very pleased. Burger is great at lunch. We particularly enjoyed cocktail hour at the bar and night caps as well. Drinks were great, and staff were friendly and engaging. 
All personnel were extremely helpful and friendly. The Concierge staff can handle just about anything you can come up with.
Conveniently located, quiet and private. You can walk to most shopping, attractions and lots of great restaurants.
For me, real bonus was being able to have a cigar at their outdoor courtyard which has heaters and some covered areas. While they have a nice cigar list, there also 2 shops nearby.",5,2022,03,18
142,True grand damme,"Could have paid twice as much for the big names but that would have been a bit mad.                                                                Lovely stay with mum, thanks to Ned for the beautiful flowers. Really is a hotel that has been improved over the many years without losing its original character which befalls many hotels.                                 Proud to have a few drinks in the great American Bar raising a toast to Nancy Bird, what a lady. Had her autobiography on the table which I'm reading so a lovely  Australian lady came over and explained how important she was down under. Part of the school curriculum I believe.                  Dinner in Game Bird was delicious albeit value for money I'm not so sure. Breakfast great too, best tasting tea I've ever had.                                                            Staff lovely, credit to the hotel informal formality  super nice, shame one of the well heeled guests (I hope not staff) could be so rude to me when minding my own business having a smoke outside.                                                               Thanks for a lovely couple of nights with mum, would love to return one day.        ",5,2022,03,17
142,Waiting to return,"Definitely our favourite hotel in London, very welcoming and friendly staff, great location, excellent beds, absolutely quiet; although breakfast service is a bit slow, the only real downside is that you have to leave again ...",5,2022,03,17
142,Lovely hotel,The Stafford was recommended to me by a friend in the hotel trade as it had not been on my radar before. The staff were top notch and could not have been more helpful. The rooms were really comfortable and my only regret is not having more time to spend there. I will definitely look to stay again,5,2022,03,17
142,Above and beyond,We booked the hotel for our Wedding Anniversary. The hotel contacted me prior to our stay to ask if we had any particular requirements.  On arrival the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  This friendly and courteous manner was there throughout our 2 night stay.  We only used the American bar which had a great range of Cocktails and Wines.  It's was nice on ordering a glass of wine that the bottle was always brought to the table so you could taste before making a decision.  The rooms were very comfortable and clean.  The breakfast was excellent.  The location is ideal for shopping and sightseeing.  Would highly  recommend and we cannot wait to return.,5,2022,03,13
142,Another good stay,"Another wonderful stay at The Stafford which is fast becoming our go to base when spending a night or two in London.

I only gave it four stars this time as service although as friendly as ever was slightly slow.  We waited 25 minutes for our drinks order to be delivered at the American Bar on Friday night and over half an hour for breakfast the next morning.

Despite the above we will definitely be back as you can’t match the location of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff.",4,2022,03,13
142,A lovely treat,We love the Stafford hotel. Our family gave us a Sunday lunch gift voucher which we finally got round to using. Everybody was incredibly friendly and made us most welcome. The stater was superb the pudding to die for however the main course was not the best. I understand that people like roast beef pink and bloody however it was a look of horror when I said to our server I did not. He continued to slice as if he had not heard me and I ate some as I hate complaining. The rest of the dinner was superb and my partner loved her beef although she did have the end slices. Yes I know I should of made a fuss but I/we had a lovely day which of been ruined by complaining.,4,2022,03,11
142,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is the best we’ve ever stayed at. The room, service, ambience - everything is seamless, perfect and thought through and the location is spot on for shopping, parks and sightseeing. A very special shout-out to Ned who made sure our stay was extra special. We’ve already booked again for July and can’t wait to come back!",5,2022,03,10
142,Luxurious and personable,"The Stafford is the place to stay if you are looking for a quiet intimate luxurious stay in the heart of London 
Conveniently located to historic sights, restaurants and shopping.  The staff is there for your every need and question.  The rooms and beds are comfortable with so many extra luxuries.  This will be our go to stay when we visit London!",5,2022,03,09
142,Highly Delightful Hotel,"This was our first stay at the Stafford Hotel and there was nothing we could fault during the period of our stay.  All staff we came into contact with at the hotel, across different functions, were very professional but equally so very approachable, helpful and they were a pleasure to speak with.  I cannot say anything detrimental about this hotel and can only highly recommend it.",5,2022,03,04
142,Class is Permanent,"From check-in to check-out I was treated as if I was the only customer in the building. Super attentive and helpful staff across the the board, nothing was too much trouble. Ultimately you get what you pay for and in this instance, that's never been more true.
Happy to thoroughly recommend!",5,2022,03,02
142,My favorite hotel in London,"I spent last weekend at the Stafford Hotel, this was my second stay. It was a fantastic base to pop around London from, such a good location. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere as you walk round it, the hotel staff are friendly and helpful. I can recommend afternoon tea and the bar which is very cozy. Our room was divine (mews suite) it was quiet, clean and the pillows were perfect. I can't fault this hotel I will definitely be booking it again.",5,2022,03,01
142,"Overall a nice stay, but premium price tag","A nice hotel in a central location, but for the premium price tag, we felt a similar experience can be found at more moderately priced hotels in London.

Luggage service was good, having arrived early and heading out for the day as our room wasn’t ready, our bags had been delivered to our room when we returned.
The doorman was particularly friendly, but other staff were just polite rather than really welcoming.

Our room keys didn’t work on first try, but was quickly sorted by a visit back to reception and we were accompanied back to the room to ensure they worked the second time.

The introductory level pricing of room gave us a reasonably sized room for a short stay and the bed was very comfortable.
The bathroom was a particular highlight with heated floor and Japanese style toilet, but a modest sized bathroom overall.

We were made to feel we were significantly late for our reservation at the American Bar - we were 10 minutes late arriving due to an overrunning theatre show. Table wasn’t actually cleaned ready for us to be seated though. Email confirmation of booking indicated the bar closed at midnight, however last orders were being called at 11pm.",4,2022,02,28
142,I should say it’s terrible to stop everyone finding this gem,"New favourite hotel in London. Really loved our stay here for 5 days. The ambience of the whole hotel is so homily and friendly it’s a delight to stay here. The bedrooms are cozy and a decent size with all the finishing you’d expect of a five star hotel. The general feeling throughout is similar with staff that make you feel welcome without the usual English formalities. Davidov the sommelier was superb and even gave us a tour of the old wine cellars that were also air raid shelters. We also had dinner here in the main dinning room and it’s well priced for Lindon with excellent food we also had bar food one night and ate equally positive about it. The American bar is cozy with a massive amount of cocktails available. 
The concierge and front of house staff were all exemplary and we will defo be back.",5,2022,02,19
142,"Once again, perfect!!","This is our third time staying at The Stafford and each time it just gets better. We had our children (7 and 11) with us and they were treated like royalty which they of course thought was brilliant. The room was beautiful, spotless, the perfect temperature and so quiet. We had lunch in the American bar and breakfast in the Game Bird and both meals were lovely. We were staying for a theatre trip and this was just the perfect end to a fabulous day. A special mention to Ned, the front of house manager who was incredible throughout our stay. I can’t wait to go back again.",5,2022,02,17
142,Quality of service from staff,"It was heartening to stay once again at The Stafford. Wonderful to note that in a sector which has been badly hit by the pandemic and staff shortages, the familiar faces of the staff were there to meet,greet  and provide the high standard of service excellence that is a cornerstone of the Stafford.It is a true reflection of a quality business to maintain the staff retention levels of my favourite hotel in London.Well done to all.",5,2022,02,16
142,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff, wonderful weekend","From making the booking to leaving the hotel we had an amazing time at The Stafford.  My parents used to frequent the hotel in the 60’s and 70’s so it was a sentimental trip especially for me.  The staff were first class, helpful and considerate, the room was lovely, the food (breakfast) was amazing and the hotel location for lunch at The Ritz and theatre-land perfect.  
We thoroughly enjoyed our special weekend in London at The Stafford Hotel.",5,2022,02,14
142,Wonderful staying,I had the best time at Stafford Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everything was as expected. The food was excellent and all precautions were in place to protect everyone. Thank you for your good work,5,2022,02,13
142,Great service & quality hotel,"I stayed here for my girlfriends birthday, the service was outstanding and the reception was very helpful. They even prepared a birthday treat & champagne, this hotel exceeded all my expectations! Would definitely visit the next time I'm in London.",5,2022,02,13
142,Great place,"Me and my wife we spent our valentines weekend at the Stafford.. everything was amazing , from the moment we did the check in, until the time of departure we felt extremely happy from the service provided..

142,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff, amazing location","Very pleasant stay, the staff were very attentive and positive.The breakfast we had was great!  We had amazing time at the bar which is now one of our favourite bars in London.
The room we had was extremely comfortable.",5,2022,02,13
142,So bad it seems like a 2 star hotel !!!,"I booked this hotel as part of my monthly “try a different london hotel” every trip. But I wish I hadn’t. £800 a night  for a room in literally an old stable room in the courtyard. 

It was Cold, noisy, there was an alarm clock going off continually in a room 4 rooms away which nobody turned off! 

There was no porter to carry bags, no concierge on duty  the few times I needed one. And the staff just not very welcoming or friendly at all. Not rude - just not friendly. 

I often get a massage in my room in hotels - this room couldn’t actually fit the massage bed so had to have the massage on my actual bed!!  First world problems I know but when you’re paying that much per night without breakfast even...

It was super noisy in the morning with bin men pushing bins over the cobbles direvtly outside. I’m sure there must be double glazing but it doesn’t sound like it!!

The bath was nice. I hear the bar is great, I went for one drink With friends around 5pm before a show and it was super packed and I could barely get a table despite being a resident. Just no personal touch and there seems to be nobody senior in charge. 

Only positive is that the flowers in the rooms were excellent!

Would never ever go back.",1,2022,02,07
142,Fantastic can't wait to go back!,"We stayed here as a treat for my stepdaughters birthday after a day out in London &  afternoon tea at the Ritz & it was absolutely fantastic! 
The staff were amazing & a special big thank you to Ned for such a lovely welcome & for making my step daughter feel so special on her 16th birthday celebrations. Lovely card & delicious cake in the room & an upgrade to a suite, just perfect! 
The staff in the bar were also fabulous & the breakfast in the room on the Sunday was wonderful! The bed was unbelievable I did not want to get up! Cannot fault this place, we will be returning again soon!",5,2022,01,28
142,Superb Stafford,"We love this hotel. Despite covid and all the chaotic issues the industry must be facing this gem of a hotel carries on. The impeccable high standards of service, cleanliness and quality of food remain. The location is superb for exploring central London and the hotel is situated in a little cul de sac so there is no noise despite being in the middle of a city.
All the staff from cleaner to manager could not be more helpful and charming and we will definitely be back soon to the hidden gem.",5,2022,01,27
142,Luxury,"Stayed for a night at the Stafford with my mum and what a wonderful treat it was. The service from everyone at the hotel was brilliant, from concierge, reception, room service, housekeeping and wait staff. The food at breakfast and lunch in Game Bird was wonderful, and the American Bar is my favourite bar in London. Thank you for a brilliant experience.",5,2022,01,25
142,Lovely Stafford,"We have now stayed many times at the Stafford and on our stay last weekend it continued to delight. We love the quiet yet handy location as you can walk to many of the  sights in London.
We had a lovely welcome from the doorman who took our bags to our room so that they were there when we arrived in the room. Check in is always easy, quick and pleasant at the front desk. We were very lucky to have been upgraded to a Junior Suite on this stay-overlooking the courtyard. The room was lovely, furnished in traditional style with 2 sinks in the large bathroom as well as a large walk-in shower. There is twice-daily housekeeping with a full 5 star turn-down.  
Breakfast is fabulous with a very good choice-on the first morning we both enjoyed the Full English breakfast which I am very pleased to say still includes black pudding! The service in breakfast was prompt and friendly-just right.  On our second day I enjoyed Eggs Benedict for breakfast while my partner had a tomato omelette.
We also delighted in taking drinks in the American Bar which is such a historical place with all the memorabilia. There is also a large heated terrace adjoining the American Bar where many people were enjoying drinks and snacks.
This traditional, quality hotel is truly a gem that maintains very personal service in a fabulous location.",5,2022,01,21
142,Thanks to Iolande and all of her colleagues.,"The Stafford is a traditional  style hotel.
On inspection the maintenance is exemplary.
Many things set this hotel apart from its competitors.
It is exceptionally comfortable in all areas.
The food and beverage options are unique for a small hotel.
There is good all day dining in the Game Bird which is now overseen by Michelin star holder Lisa Goodwin Allen, this can only be upside from now on.
The American bar is busy and vibrant but for St James’s the outside seating and dining area is incredibly spacious.
The staff are exceptional and many are long serving.
We were travelling with a twenty month old child and the efforts to give us suitable accommodation at a fair price were superb.
The owners have recently acquired the Northcote Manor in Lancashire, a brave move but U am sure it will be a successful thing for them. Certainly as a joint customer the rates are to be lauded.
This really is one of London’s best and realistic pricing makes this a no brainer.
I really enjoy staying here.",5,2022,01,14
142,Wow! A fabulous gem in a fantastic location,"Before Covid, my job involved staying in a lot of hotels around the world. As travel restarts, I just found The Stafford by chance and stayed there last week, with a group of colleagues for meetings. It has now shot to the top of my list of all time favourite hotels.

Tucked away in the heart of St James's, just a minute's walk from Green Park, it is simply wonderful and I almost feel like keeping the secret to myself.

They manage to do what I have been seeking for decdes, a luxury hotel at a sensible price, balancing charming classical decor with simplicity and modern faclities, homeliness with professionalism. I have stayed at the Ritz around the corner and much prefer The Stafford - less grandiose and pompous and infinitely more friendly. (And less than half the price). I was mildly irritated by their formulaic greeting ""Welcome Home"", but over the five days I stayed, the impeccable staff truly delivered - it is one of the very few hotels I could imagine living in for a few weeks, more even than my club down the road, I am sorry to say.

It is a perfect size, too, big enough to have everything you need, including outstanding meeting rooms and an excellent restaurant, but small enough for you really to feel at home and, well, pampered. The rooms are excellent, room service food is way above normal hotel fare, and the ""American Bar"" has the best cocktails I've had outside New York. Great hotels are found in the details and there wasn't a single detail that any of seven of us found wanting - that is an amazing achievement at a decent price.

My only regret is that I never found The Stafford before and wasted all my London stays elsewhere.",5,2022,01,11
142,Wonderful 3 night stay over christmas,"We had an amazing 3 night stay at the hotel over christmas. There was a slight miscommunication at the beginning with regards to our reservation but the staff were super helpful and we had the most relaxing stay in a mews suite and a lovely dinner at the bar. The staff there were so lovely and were able to decant a 50 year old port we had been saving for our holiday. I can't recommend enough the room which was perfect haven for a staycation and being able to watch lovely black and white movies and have room service.  From the housekeeping to the restaurant, bar and front desk, we'd just like to say thank you for making the end of 2021 the most stress free time for us.",5,2022,01,08
142,Game Bird,"A fabulous restaurant set inside The Stafford Hotel. We had dinner, which exceeded our expectations and was simply superb! A lovely intimate setting, excellent cuisine and service, well worth a look. Its a ten from me!",5,2022,01,08
142,Best hotel in London,"We stayed for 4 nights over the New Year. 
The Stafford staff were all wonderful and attentive.
Rooms were wonderful, we had 3 rooms as we have adult children. We could not have been happier with our rooms.
The location is the best in London.
The food was superb.
The  hotel was amazing. We will return and stay here when visiting London.
Thank you to the Stafford for a fabulous stay x",5,2022,01,04
142,Great Two Day Break.,"A lovely hotel with fantastic staff and excellent food.  The Game Bird restaurant is a must, the squab pigeon was exquisite.  If you get the chance, take a tour of the wine cellar, it’s a fascinating look at the history of wine at the hotel.  If you’re looking for a London break, this is just ideal.",5,2022,01,03
142,Perfect customer service.,Another 10 days of blissful vacation at The Stafford.  This is our 5th stay at this hotel and it was perfect.  Every request was met with amazing speed.  Plus the location is central to the delights of London all at a reasonable price for such nice accommodations.,5,2022,01,01
142,A wonderful hotel,"I’ve stayed at the Stafford on more than one occasion and both experiences have been special throughout.

From your welcome to your departure I’ve found the staff to be friendly and exceptional all round. No request dismissed…including obtaining a bubble bath substitute in the middle of the night!

Food is lovely, well, breakfast. I regret that I still haven’t currently eaten in the Gamebird due to other obligations in previous stays but will be an excuse to come back for another stay.

I’m a big fan of the American bar. Drink selection, ambiance, the terrace.

Cleanliness is not in question, the rooms I’ve been provided are immaculate.

Honestly one of my favourite hotels in London",5,2021,12,29
142,Christmas Delight,"It is not a secret I love The Stafford.....

I have stayed twice in the last 4 weeks for 7 days and 6 days at a time.... It's just simply exceptional. They care about the guests and get everything right.... Nothing is left to doubt at The Stafford. They care about every single guest. Its a culture and one thats owned by every member of staff.... 

I had two colleagues staying on trip one in early December and both said the hotel was exceptional and a real secret. This made me super happy that they felt the culture and care as I do every time I stay.

Fast forward to a cancelled trip to Paris and an early arrival at The Strafford for my wife's birthday and a couple of days business... nothing to say except it was as always 'faultless'..... American Bar to Concierge to Reception to Housekeeping - The Stafford is an exceptional hotel....

Bravo as always 

Faultless!!!!!",5,2021,12,23
142,Avoid room 401,"We booked two nights in a deluxe room to celebrate our anniversary, and requested a light, quiet room.  I realise it's not always possible to accommodate guests' special requests, but was disappointed to find ourselves in a room that was positively DARK!  Lots of harsh overhead lighting was available but this room desperately needed a couple of warm low level lamps.  Even worse, one of the windows was single-glazed so every sound from the street found its way to our room - at 2 in the morning and again at 6am: taxi doors slamming, bottle recycling,  groups of smokers chatting outside - you name it, we heard it.  

Bathroom was well appointed and nicely lit but absolutely tiny.  Husband knocked things over every time he went in there.  Difficult not to.

The staff were charming, professional and very helpful but a 5 star hotel room in St James's should feel like a sanctuary, and ours didn't.  Won't be returning.",4,2021,12,09
142,Reopened to the same exacting standards,"Returning after having not stayed at the property for about two years, my wife and I found to property to have again attained the same exacting standard as before COVID appeared. We occupied in a mini suite in the adjacent building and the room was beyond expectation, with the utmost attention to design detail to meet the needs of guests. Dual voltage razor outlets in the bathroom, mirrors that could be adjusted to the different heights of individual guests, a make up table equipped with magnifying mirror, a work desk with dual voltage power outlets for PDAs and IPads, stationery and envelopes for that forgotten form of written snail mail communication, and so on. The room attendants kept the room immaculate and managed to tidy each day the mess we had left behind. The oversized and most comfortable bed allowed one to get full benefit from the exceptionally quiet environment and battle jet lag. We have stayed here many times over the years and it was simply a great feeling to return to the same environment that ownership, management and staff had managed to preserve through the rigors of COVID.",5,2021,12,04
142,"Post Covid Visit Reflects Same high Standards & Friendly, Helpful Staff","Our return visit showed despite Covid the operations and staff have not missed a beat. Excellent suite and excellent staff made our visit a pleasure. We again dined at the Gamebird, which also continues to present fine cuisine. As always. The Stafford is highly recommended.",5,2021,11,25
142,Fantastic Anniversary Break!,"We had a great stay in The Stafford for our special anniversary- first time in this hotel it has now become our favourite in London. 
Nothing was too much troube for the staff, and they really looked after us, we even had a welcome bottle of bubbly in our room which was a lovely touch,
The hotel retains much of its original character while being modern enough  to be very luxurious. Our room was very quiet and spacious, but above all it was quiet which was great for us as we are light sleepers.
Bed was amazingly comfy, and there was an old style bath which was big and comfy enough to unwind in.
Breakfast was delicious and there are some wonderful dishes on the menu-i was spoilt for choice.
The American Bar is also well worth a visit, a nice place to relax with a great atmosphere and the staff are amazing.
A perfect location for exploring, close to all the main attractions, and the main shopping areas and oly a few minutes walk from Green Park tube.
we cant wait to visit again!",5,2021,11,22
142,A Must!!,"Really looked after from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The staff were so friendly. 
The Sunday lunch in the Game Bird was amazing! Hand carved meat at the table along with a fantastic bottle of decantered wine. A must for anyone visiting London!",5,2021,11,22
142,60th Birthday break!,"A wonderful 2 night stay at this Hotel. Excellent location, particularly for shopping, theatre etc. Parking nearby (Arlington St RCP), recommended by Hotel which we used for our stay. This is a lovely intimate and cosy hotel, with staff that could not be more helpful or welcoming. We were treated to a room upgrade in the Mews overlooking the courtyard. A wonderful room, very quiet and with excellent facilities. Breakfast was superb with plenty of choice in lovely surroundings (The Game Bird restaurant). Do have a cocktail (or two) at The American Bar - we had lunch there which was excellent - take in the history that surrounds you there! A lovely touch was a card and cake for my birthday - a lovely touch. We thoroughly recommend this hotel - it is most definitely 5 star and we think very good value for money.",5,2021,11,19
142,Brilliantly placed for a huge number of attractions,"We booked a Classic Queen Room at The Stafford Hotel in Piccadilly for our annual trip to London.   Room was perhaps a little small but very comfy bed and nice shower so it did us nicely.  The man at the check out desk advised a Classic King on the 6th floor (bigger room and a rooftop view) if ever we decided to return.  Classic Queens, he suggested, were better for single travellers (the fifth star in our rating would be for a Classic King).  

The Stafford was our base for walking just about everywhere, including Ole and Steen for breakfast, The Wallace Collection for lunch, the Royal Academy for their Summer Exhibition, the National Gallery for Poussin and the Dance, Scully of St James for dinner on the first night, Margot for pre theatre meal on the second night followed by Cinderella at the Gillian Lynne theatre.  All highly recommended and all not more than 30 minutes on foot from the hotel.  We took the tube to the Imperial War Museum but could have walked there too, though it might have taken 40 minutes.  

So, the Stafford is brilliantly placed for a huge number of attractions.  And at the end of a day of walking everywhere, the hotel has a lovely American Bar for a well earned nightcap!",5,2021,11,15
142,A Wonderful Stay,"The hotel is beautiful.  The location is perfect.  The staff are wonderful.   The breakfasts were delicious.  The bed was so , so comfortable.  The American Bar was a great place to visit after a long day sight seeing.  Many thanks to Camille who took the time to show us the layout of the hotel on our arrival.  An absolute pleasure to stay here and will most certainly stay again.",5,2021,11,09
142,Nice hotel,"This was our first stay and whilst we enjoyed it, it was far from perfect as many reviews have said. 

Placed in a nice quiet location the outside space is a big plus. A very lovely building. 

We enjoyed a suite which was kept immaculately clean. 

There were a number of shortcomings. Phone in room never worked, despite promises to fix, so we had to call the switchboard from mobile for any room requests. Annoying. 

The bar was a buzzy fun place. However upon arriving after dinner at 11:05 pm, we were told that the bar was closed! Explaining we were residents we were served drinks. The explanation given for such an early ‘closure’ was ‘Covid’. That old chestnut. 

A number of people were turned away. Seems crazy in these times when business is needed.  Moreover all the time that we were at the hotel, no staff in the bar wore masks. So how can Covid be an issue, does it only begin work at 11:00 pm?? 

Service was generally ok but the ‘discretionary service charges’ made were not justified. 

So in conclusion, nice but not great.",3,2021,11,02
142,Great in every way,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left - we felt so at home  The staff are excellent - friendly & efficient.  The atmosphere and décor is lovely - very calm and lots of great artwork around. The bed was so comfortable and the sunken bath was great to lie back in. The American bar is a must - the  staff are fun and friendly
we will definitely be returning on our next visit to London",5,2021,10,10
142,Weekend break,Another fantastic visit to the Stafford. This is our fifth stay and the attention to detail is amazing. All of the staff make you feel at home and are really attentive. It was the first visit for my grown up children and they haven’t stopped talking about the experience. I’ve stayed in hotels all around the world and can honestly say this is my favourite. The courtyard at the rear of the hotel is a lovely place to relax and the food is outstanding.,5,2021,09,22
142,September stay,The staff are amazing the quality of the food and drink is excellent and the atmosphere is great in the American Bar. All the staff are so friendly and genuinely pleased to make your stay as good as possible. They're human but they've never yet dropped the ball thank you one and all.,5,2021,09,22
142,Really good experience,"This was our third attempt to stay due to Covid.
It was a lovely break, a great location, and a classic high-quality hotel, excellent staff, and service. Dinner in the GameBird was first class as were the drinks in the American Bar.",5,2021,09,21
142,Super attas with British class!!,As a Malaysian would put it.. “super attas”. Guess for the price one would expect premier quality and service delivered with British class. Very very pleasant experience. The American Bar is a nice place to wind down the day. A bit difficult to find as it’s nestled in between buildings but that gave it is feel of mystery right out of an Agatha Christie novel..,5,2021,09,21
142,Perfect stay,Hotel is located next to green park and is charming. The room was perfect. Nice beds. Very clean with a lot of attention to details. Staff was helpful and made our stay amazing. The restaurant is worth trying as well and the bar is now in the garden.,5,2021,09,18
142,Incredible Staff and Lovely Rooms,"We recently stay in The Stafford London for our wedding. It was a small wedding and it couldn't have been made more special for us by the staff. All of the staff were very friendly and really helpfully with all of the wedding arrangements. The Stafford Hotel even made us a wedding cake (which taste great) that we could bring to Corrigan's Mayfair with us, which we really appreciated. Our room was amazing and breakfast was great! I couldn't have asked for a better hotel to have our wedding at! We had a great day and night and we will definitely be back again.",5,2021,09,15
142,Don't stay anywhere else in London.,"We wouldn't stay anywhere in London now apart from The Stafford. It is a lovely hotel in the perfect location - walking distance to so many parts of central London but hidden away on on a quiet yet charming cul-de-sac in St James. Our room was superb, the bar areas and restaurants couldn't have been nicer and the service was so good it was almost a surprise. We loved it and will definitely be back.",5,2021,09,10
142,This is a first class hotel in every respect,"We have stayed at this hotel several times over the last few years and it is always a superb experience: excellent service, polished attentive personnel, unrivalled location, spacious well equipped bedroom, delicious breakfast and lunch etc..  Perfect.  Thank you.",5,2021,09,09
142,IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS - 5 STAR PLUS LUXURY & PROFESSIONAL  SERVICE,"This was the first time we have returned since COVID lockdowns and once again rave about the fabulous experience and professionalism of all staff who are so upbeat considering what they have been through over the last 18 months. Our stay was made extra special by the professionalism and person attentiveness of reservation staff, reception staff, bar staff, restaurant staff, conciege, room service staff and of course the management team under the management of the CEO Stuart Proctor and his PA Sarah who were always there making sure things were going well for all guests.  The Stafford Hotel and American Bar really made us feel special and treated us like VIPs, nothing is too difficult for them THANKS for such a special stay, we will be back and have already recommended it to others.",5,2021,09,08
142,Our little haven!,"This was our 2nd stay this month, both times were perfect in all aspects. We live in London so don’t have too far to go, but  as you step through the doors you feel at “home”.
 So peaceful although being in central London, a lovely setting.
All the staff are delightful and so professional.
The restaurant is small but perfect.
We have booked to be staying again very soon!",5,2021,09,06
142,Our favourite London haunt,"Tucked away at the back of St. James's Place with a back entrance right into Green Park. The location is quiet yet wonderfully central to the best of London - a short walk takes you to places as different as the exquisite shopping on New Bond Street at one extreme to the bars, restaurants, and those other places of Soho.

The American Bar at the hotel is unique, as are the mews rooms converted from former stables. This is a top-class haven and respite after a busy day and evening. The wine selection will leave you breathless and a shorter of cash than before you sampled its delights - but worth every penny.

This is the only place we stay in London",5,2021,08,28
142,Absolutely Fantastic!,"Our stay at The Stafford London was phenomenal; our concierge team truly made us feel special, going above and beyond at every chance (especially Zelia & Paul). If we ever come back to London, we will absolutely call this home. Great neighborhood, walking distance to everything, and beautiful rooms!",5,2021,08,25
142,Luxurious evening ,We had a fantastic experience. We are a family of four and we were made to feel so welcome. This is a truly luxurious hotel with the most friendly of staff. The restaurant in the hotel called the Game Bird really made our night.Thank you all for a lovely time. ,5,2021,08,20
142,The Stafford Hotel is sublime,"The Stafford Hotel is an oasis of serene luxury. The hotel is ideally positioned. The team at the Stafford are excellent. They are attentive and professional, and they combine this with a warmth which is so welcoming. We highly recommend a stay here. Once you have sampled the experience there’s no going back. It’s the Stafford Hotel every time!",5,2021,08,16
142,Exceptional level of service,"The Stafford Hotel is located in a quiet locations, with a 10-15min walking distance to Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. The hotel is a perfect experience of a 5* place with a very pleasant and experience team.

From the entry to the hotel right to the housekeeping the team makes You feel the highest level of customer service.

Make sure You have time to visit one of the best American Bar's where You can choose from their widest selection of drinks and cocktails.

The Game Bird will offer You a outstanding dining experience with everything what You need to taste classic English dishes in a modern style.

The room. We had a opportunity to stay in one of the Junior Suites located in a Mews building. Again the luxury and 5* experience is something which will make anyone to revisit The Stafford London Hotel, the size and luxury design of the room, classic but modern, bathroom with option of the shower or bath, slippers and dressing gown will make feel like home and fully relaxed. Even small things like evening message from the room service about next day weather and pleasant sleep.

Yes it is a 5* luxury hotel which You need to stay at when You visit London - ideal for shopping experience, ideal for sightseeing London.",5,2021,08,08
142,"Amazing Hotel, Great Location, Highly Recommend!","My partner and I have just returned from a wonderful stay at The Stafford Hotel. 

We had a truly memorable experience, the staff were very attentive and friendly, the hotel was beautifully clean and full of charm, amazing spacious suit with a huge comfy bed. The breakfast was the best we've ever had (highly recommend the French Toast!). The hotel is located in a quiet street yet has everything you need on your doorstep.

We will most definitely be back soon!",5,2021,08,03
142,Weekend Stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it is definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed in. It does give you a cozy homely feel because it doesn't seem to big. We had won the stay in a charity draw and they gave us an upgrade to a Junior Suite. All the staff we  met were very friendly and always offering help if needed. The breakfast was fantastic and being from up north, I thought the black pudding was incredible (supplier please?) The room was very clean, spacious and the bed was incredibly comfy. We can not thank the staff enough for making our stay so enjoyable. A special thank you to Marianne who looked after the many changes to our booking dates because of various factors. We only hope we get chance to stay there again.",5,2021,07,27
142,Family break,A very friendly and warming hotel. The staff were excellent and a nice touch that they remembered your name ! The rooms were well appointed with even a heated toilet seat. Wifi was good the the decor was of a high standard. Good outside bar area in the American bar which was perfect for a warm summers evening. The location is amazing if you want to be in the west end but with a bit of privacy rather than being on a main thoroughfare,5,2021,07,25
142,A Gem,"The Stafford is a small, comfortable luxury hotel superbly situated for the nicer parts of London with an attentive, helpful and friendly team.  We spent four nights here and found our room to be exceptionally quiet, blessed with a superbly comfortable bed and effective air conditioning.  The ‘Full English’ breakfast is not to be missed - quality ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The lounge and American bar ooze relaxed charm. We will definitely return; in fact, we won’t stay anywhere else as and when we return to London.",5,2021,07,25
142,A Fantastic first stay!,"Although we’ve been to the excellent American Bar many times, it was the first time my wife and I stayed at the hotel. And what a stay we had! In every sense our expectations were exceeded in terms of service, comfort and that feeling of ‘being home’. Can’t recommend it highly enough.",5,2021,07,22
142,One of my favourite chefs and place in London,"The quality of food here is exceptional. I would thoroughly recommend the roasted cauliflower and salmon from the bbq. In April I was eating best octopus in my life. The staff are very friendly and efficient. Chef Slavco showed us how to use a green egg grill and gave us some tips for a good barbecue, waiter Luigi professional and on site.  I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion, particularly if you are staying in London.",5,2021,07,20
142,"Great location , comfortable, friendly","Chose this hotel to stay for 5 days to celebrate a special anniversary . 
At the price paid excellent value, not sure it would have been at the usual tariff. 
However the location was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom with bath, as requested, was beautiful.
London rooms are small and this wasn't unreasonably small but it really is necessary to fit in some kind of bedside cabinet on both sides of the bed in a double room! (To prevent spilled coffee if nothing else)
The staff were all very welcoming , friendly and helpful although I'm not sure why I was refused a request for a morning coffee in the courtyard. Didn't seem an unreasonable request to me. Found a very nice coffee shop round the corner (Dukes Caffe) to indulge my caffeine addiction during our stay.
Cocktails and bar service excellent.

",4,2021,07,16
142,Fourth stay-just perfect.,"This gem of a hotel in St James is perfectly located in a quiet street while being within walking distance of many of London's sights. We were welcomed by the doorman on this our fourth stay and as we were early were offered drinks while we waited for our room. All of the staff from the door, reception and at breakfast were very welcoming and offered great service. This is not a concrete , corporate-type hotel but a delightful, small, personal hotel in a lovely old building-some of the staff even greeted us by name. 

 We enjoy walking around St James looking at the traditional shops as well as a walk along Pall Mall to have a look at the fishing tackle in Farlows, Jermyn Street, etc..

 Breakfast is perfect in the Game Bird( this is the first time we have been back since it was re-done) with service a la carte :the full English and eggs Benedict were great.  The restaurant was also very popular in the evening, though we did not eat there.

Our room was a Queen room in the main building which was a reasonable size, well-serviced and has all mod cons.  

When it came time to leave we were wished 'goodbye' and helped with or bags to the car and given bottled water for the journey-true service!

We will return soon.",5,2021,07,13
142,Top Class Hotel,"We have just spent 2 nights at The Stafford and had tne most amazing time. The hotel is in a wonderful position, so central. It had a beautiful little courtyard restaurant and the whole team were just so welcoming and professional. I could go on about my experience but I think it would be better if you just paid it a visit yourselves. We certainly will return.",5,2021,07,11
142,Great place in St James' to break for a drink and snack,"Sat in courtyard for a perfect Negroni cocktail, refreshing Pimms and nibbles.  The staff were friendly, helpful and attentive.  The range of photos of celerity guests and visitors in the function rooms are well worth a glance.",5,2021,07,01
142,The Perfect Wedding,"We chose to get married at The Stafford as many years ago we spent very happy hours courting in The American Bar. Food and wine were to be a very important part of our experience but to get married in their 17th century wine cellar in the heart of London was truly memorable for us and our guests. It must be one of the most romantic venues for any London wedding. We then had a most wonderful lunch in The Sutherland Room. Very high quality food and cooking, expertly served, accompanied by beautifully mature wine. In fact, there were numerous thoughtful and unexpected touches that reflected the confidence and experience of the staff - many of whom have been at The Stafford for many years -  that make their motto ""Welcome Home"" more than just a glib piece of marketing but a true and real statement of what The Stafford stands for.  Overall, our experience at The Stafford can be summed up in three words - exquisite, discreet, exclusive.",5,2021,06,30
142,A welcome home at the Stafford,"I’ve stayed several times at the wonderful Stafford Hotel. The initial welcome you always receive is genuine, the staff are so welcoming in this quintessential oasis of London life.

The rooms are always spectacular, the suite we had in the main hotel was wonderfully decorated, and generous in space with a delightful bathroom to enjoy 

The American bar is such a vibrant place to drop down into and sample a drink, highly recommend the large  Negroni list!

The theme for returning customers is very much based on “welcome home” and it really does fee that way when you pay a visit , I couldn’t recommend it more",5,2021,06,29
142,Superb hotel in an excellent location,"I am a repeat guest at the Stafford and each experience is fabulous. The staff are extremely helpful and make me feel very much at home.  On occasion, I receive an upgrade and the accommodation is always lovely.
The Game Bird and the American bar are both excellent and cocktails extremely well made.
The food is always delightful.",5,2021,06,28
142,Leisurely lunch,The perfect spot for a leisurely lunch on a warm summers day. Great service and lovely food in a pretty secluded courtyard. The perfect way to chill out with a glass or two with friends when in London.,5,2021,06,26
142,Like home but better,Spent two nights here this month. Staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful. Superb room and excellent breakfast. Didn’t eat dinner there because of other commitments but it has a very good reputation so maybe next time.,5,2021,06,26
142,Excellent,"This hotel is outstanding, the staff are exceptionally helpful and efficient, the rooms are spotless and the location is perfect.
The breakfast was superb and the courtyard was a lovely location for drinks and nibbles.
I really can’t recommend this hotel highly enough",5,2021,06,24
142,Love The Stafford,"Having tried their food boxes during lockdown which it must be said saved our Christmas, we decided to see what it would be like to have a night away at the Stafford.  We were not disappointed.  I would go further, we felt as if we had returned home even if this was our first stay.  We were made to feel so welcome.  We ate in the American Bar for lunch where the food is delightful - fish & chips and a club sandwich, a good portion size and very tasty.  Enjoy a cocktail?  Us too and there were many to try!  Their staff really do look after you and were so pleased to have guests back - you could feel their smiles in spite of facemasks.  A few short steps to our suite, we found the room of a very high standard, clean and comfortable.  We dined again at the hotel in the evening and chose from the Game Bird menu - chicken kiev and fillet steak.  Again absolutely delicious followed by a dark chocolate dessert.  Bon appétit!  The hotel is well situated and we enjoyed our evening walk.  We will return to see the Stafford and its fantastic team again soon.",5,2021,06,21
142,Wonderful post lockdown stay,"Just spent one night in this beautiful hotel and it is as wonderful as I remembered.

I was in London for a post lockdown catch up with friends and booked three rooms at The Stafford which was the perfect base for our stay.  

Prior to our arrival I was contacted by Ned Holder, Guest Relations Manager, who checked if we had any special requirements or if we were celebrating anything and also offered to book us a table in the bar for drinks.

On arrival we were not only able to check in early but had all been upgraded!  This really made our stay even more special.

We had drinks in the bar both ore and post dinner and the espresso martini was just beautiful!

I could go on but simply put the Stafford manages to make every guest feel special and I can’t wait to return very soon.",5,2021,06,17
142,Fantastic stay at The Stafford,"We are just back from celebrating our youngest daughters 21st birthday with a stay at the Stafford hotel. We had a wonderful time and were throughly spoiled and extremely well looked after by all of the staff.  Ned Holder was  fantastic in helping to organise various things during our stay,  from a glorious picnic at Kew to making sure we had lovely rooms connecting with each other!  All of the staff at the hotel were amazing at going that extra mile to make Hannah’s birthday extra special and I’m only sorry I can’t thank each of them personally.  I think just about everyone wished her happy birthday ! The cake that Ned organised was delicious the staff at breakfast so kind and thoughtful remembering drinks orders for day two and making us feel at home. 
We loved the American bar inside and out, our outdoor table was especially nice as London was very warm when we were there.  The gentleman at the door was wonderful offering tit bits of information about surrounding buildings and advice on walking routes also extremely thoughtful when we were leaving for our picnic.  
I cannot thank you all enough for making our couple of days with you so special !! We certainly enjoyed lovely family time in this weird climate.  
We will be back x",5,2021,06,13
142,City break,"After what seemed like a lifetime in lockdown  arriving at the Stafford was pure Joy!
We have lost count the amount of times we have stayed and each time has been memorable.

Counting the days until we return again",5,2021,06,02
142,My Birthday Weekend at the Stafford London!,"Myself and a friend booked a 3 nights stay, at the Stafford London, to celebrate my 54th Birthday.
I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, but the Stafford stood out from the rest!   It has all the luxury, and grandeur, that one would expect from a 5 star hotel.  But what really stood out for me was the amazing , dedicated staff and the service they consistently delivered. 
They were always so welcoming, helpful and willing to go above and beyond.  
The communication, prior to my arrival date, was excellent.   The staff answered all of my questions, promptly, and kindly arranged for a DVD player to be placed in my room.  On arrival,  I was pleasantly surprised by a room upgrade to a junior suite, which was on the ground floor (Room 15).  The suite was almost like a mini cottage - cosy and comfortable, with a lovely and spacious bathroom.  
We dined at the hotel's Game Bird Restaurant, on my actual Birthday.  The food, wine and service was excellent.
On our second night, we dined at the hotel's American Bar.  The food and cocktails were delightful and again, the staff and service was fantastic!
The Breakfast was great quality, with a good choice of foods.
The hotel is conveniently located and there is so much to do locally.  We took leisurely strolls in Green Park and shopped at nearby Oxford and Regent Street. 
I really can't recommend the Stafford London  highly enough.  I will definitely be coming back!
Thank you to all the staff, at the Stafford London. You truly are a credit to the hotel.",5,2021,06,02
142,Oasis in the heart of London,"My first visit to the Stafford after a friends recommendation. I could not fault this hotel my room overlooking the courtyard was fantastic, simple little touches like choosing your room cleaning & turn down times make a difference. 
The breakfast was first class and the service from all departments was 5 star, especially Luigi in the American Bar, warm , friendly and very professional, food was also excellent. 
I have already booked my stay for the end of this month.",5,2021,06,02
142,So lovely to be back “Home” at The Stafford,"It was so lovely to be back !.  We missed our trips to The Stafford and it was so lovely that despite the current restrictions the incredibly high standards of the hotel have not changed . 

From the moment we arrived we felt so welcome and safe .  The room was stunning, clean and very impressive.

Thank you Stuart and Sarah for making our Wedding Anniversary so memorable.

We are already looking forward to coming “home” soon !.",5,2021,06,01
142,A wonderful two night stay,"We stayed at The Stafford for two nights. Everything was lovely, our room was beautiful and immaculate and the staff were really efficient with charm.  We had drinks outside the American Bar, the staff noticed my husband opening birthday cards and bought him a little cake with a candle and happy birthday in chocolate which was so nice of them.  Breakfast is always delicious and we love the interesting art in the hotel. Can't recommend this hotel enough, hopefully we will be back there soon.",5,2021,05,27
142,Deja Vu...all over again.,"They’re back. Quite possibly the best hospitality team we’ve encountered in London or anywhere else for that matter.
Consistency is key. The Stafford delivers every time. The Game Bird, The American Bar staffed by professional, charming staff with a fine sense of humour. They had me laughing at breakfast time and again in the evening.
A special mention to the staff we don’t get to meet. Chefs, kitchen team who provided the most delicious food on time, every time. The housekeepers, those unsung heros for maintaining our spotless Junior Suite (upgrade.Thank you).
To management, highly visible and approachable. Your staff do you credit.
One complaint : The removal of the delicious golden syrup sponge with custard from the menu. ‘Friends of The Stafford’ should petition the management to have this reinstated with immediate effect.. Go to court if necessary. The Pea Veloute with cheddar and truffle toastie is a very welcome addition though.
Thank you all. Grazie Mille.It’s wonderful to see you back after such a miserable year. Until next time.",5,2021,05,27
142,Charming hotel nestled in the heart of London,"A perfect hotel, in a perfect place. This is so central that walking a few minutes in every direction will take you somewhere interesting: the Royal Academy of Arts, Fortnum & Masons, Green Park, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden.  Yet it is discreetly tucked away in St James' Place. The hotel offers a personal touch, excellent staff and wonderful rooms. Our wonderful room faced the courtyard which was full of flowers. Breakfast was excellent and we had a very knowledgeable staff serve our cocktails in the American Bar.",5,2021,05,26
142,Wonderful friendly hotel,"This was our second visit to The Stafford and once again we were not disappointed. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and luxurious and it was such a fantastic home from home. Would thoroughly recommend it. 5 stars.",5,2021,05,25
142,A personal hotel visit,"An outstanding stay in May 21. Felt like we were part of family as from door man, reception and restaurant staff all knew our name and treated us with 5 stars. Room was excellent - so clean (which is really important). Staff had gone the extra mile to look after us and my wife and had ""imported"" on request her fav. non acholic wine. Food in restaurant was great and enjoyed the discussions with staff. Cannot say any more other than really impressed.",5,2021,05,25
142,Great hotel and great to see it open again,This is a wonderful hotel. Great position near green park tube. The best staff in London! Always helpful and pleasant. Rooms perfectly presented.

Would not dream of going anywhere else! ,5,2021,05,24
142,Excellent Stay,"We fancied a night in London to see the Xmas lights and stayed in one of the mews rooms in early December.  The room was gorgeous with a beautiful bathroom.
The bar within the hotel was fabulous, the staff were so friendly and very professional with regard to Covid, we felt perfectly safe with the social distancing.  We popped in for coffee after shopping, pre-dinner cocktails and drinks after dinner too.  Will definitely visit the bar again, even if not staying at the hotel.
Excellent location, just a couple of minutes walk from Green Park but felt very quiet and secluded.",5,2021,01,10
142,Truly amazing!,"We went to the Stafford for one night in December 2020 and we had the best time.  The check in was very quick and we were escorted to our room. We had the master suite which was outstanding and even came with its own Christmas tree in it. My husband needed his shirt ironed which was accommodated for within minutes. He said it was ironed so well it felt like a new shirt! We then had drinks & something to eat in the American bar. The croquettes were the best we'd ever had. I had a Christmas cocktail which was delicious too. Breakfast the next day was equally delicious. 

At all times we felt treated with respect from the staff and everywhere felt extremely covid safe. 

We will 100% be coming back! The courtyard to sit in for drinks is next on my to do list! It is also a fantastic location for shopping and dining out.",5,2020,12,21

I love The American Bar. Ned booked us a pre dinner table. This was essential. It’s always a popular place with great atmosphere and wonderful service led by Ben and his team. Great Mojito. !
Just love my second home. ",5,2020,12,12

Lovely room, and service was very friendly and polite.  We were particularly impressed by the additional cleaning measures that were in place to tackle COVID-19.",5,2020,12,03
142,Perfection delivered personally.,"A family of 4 in much need of a change of weekend scenery in these strange times were given the warmest of welcomes by the staff at The Stafford. From the moment we walked through the door, to the moment we sadly left, we had the perfect stay. With a respectable Covid protocol in place we enjoyed a perfect set up for a family of 4. The American Bar provides the perfect location for a few aperitifs and night caps and with a perfect Sunday lunch in The Game Bird  we had the most enjoyable stay. The staff throughout were an absolute delight. Thank you again and we look forwards to returning very soon.",5,2020,10,25
142,Wonderful stay,"My husband and I visited The Stafford for the night over my birthday weekend. We had a fabulous time. The hotel was immaculate. All staff encounters were spot on, everyone was so helpful.

It was a much needed break in this unsettling time. The Stafford made me feel safe and comfortable and I cannot wait time return.",5,2020,10,23
142,And outstanding stay during our wedding,"We were fortunate enough to choose the Stafford for our recent wedding in London. The staff went above and beyond to make sure that we were well cared for during our stay, and their attention to detail was noteworthy. Their concierge, Ned, provided wonderful suggestions to improve the quality of our experience and he managed to track down specific flowers for our bouquet. While we do live in London, we felt like we were a world away due to the service, care, and quality. We are already planning a staycation for the coming month(s).",5,2020,10,22
142,Superb hotel,"My husband and I absolutely loved this hotel. The staff are some of the friendliest and most helpful staff we have ever encountered. We will definitely be returning soon. The room was very quiet, the breakfast was lovely and the American bar is a must. During this tough time they are doing a superb job, congratulations",5,2020,10,19
142,Wedding reception venue,"Our son and DIL recently had their wedding reception at The Stafford.  It couldn’t have been more magical, even with COVID restrictions.  The food, wine and service were exceptional with staff bending over backwards to make it a day to remember.  In lieu of dancing, we had wine tasting in their fascinating cellar.  From their first meeting with Luca (Restaurant manager), our son and DIL were impressed with his enthusiasm to make the day special, unlike other venues for whom it just seemed routine.  In this they absolutely delivered.",5,2020,10,15
142,Welcome Home,Fantastic stay at our favourite London hotel. Always welcomed by the friendliest of staff who cater for our every needs. Unbelievable Sunday roast at the game bird. Special mention to Ned! It really is home from home!,5,2020,10,12
142,Amazing food and service,"Highly recommended. Food was so good, cocktails amazing and service friendly and approachable. Ambiance was also really relaxing and romantic. We were offered game off the menu and they encouraged us to come back to let them know and they will have whatever game we wanted! Highly recommend!",5,2020,10,11
142,A warm feeling,"From the moment you meet Charlie at the door of the hotel you feel at home. Every member of staff at The Stafford is fantastic. Nothing is too much trouble. Our breakfasts were superb we actually ate dinner in the hotel too which we normally don’t do. The Game Bird is a really nice space. My daughter and I had the beef wellington which was delicious. We actually got some sunshine during our stay, so once we’d come back from wandering we sat outside and had a glass or two. This area outside is really unique. Again the two girls who served us were really attentive. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more 
It’s a gem !!",5,2020,10,09
142,Park Suite,"We had the fantastic experience of the six person dinner package at the Stafford, which included drinks and canapes in the newly refurbished Park Suite. The food and service throughout the evening was simply excellent (thank you to Maciej for looking after us so well) however the Park Suite itself was certainly the highlight. The Suite is very spacious but is split on multiple levels which gives a quirky and homely feel, and the private terrace gives stunning views across London. I was also impressed by how all modern amenities have been included in the room (speakers, televisions, back-lit stairs) without compromising the traditional and elegant feel.  

We were also very kindly given a tour of the hotel's impressive wine cellar and got a chance to learn about the building's rich history. An amazing evening all round and I cannot recommend the Park Suite itself enough.",5,2020,10,08
142,Fabulous Hotel,"This beautiful hotel was really superb. Our suite was wonderful and spacious and in a very quiet part of the area. The service was incredible and the staff were friendly, very courteous and efficient.

142,A staycation evening 3 miles from home!,"A wonderful 24 hours in a wonderful hotel with excellent service, lovely room, secret coutyard and right in the centre of St James. This was just what the doctor ordered after many cancelled holidays this year. Such friendly personal service and a joy to discover something new in a neighbourhood I thought I knew so well.  We will definitely be back.",5,2020,09,21
142,5* hospitality at its best,"I was thoroughly impressed by my recent stay at The Stafford London. The hotel is situated in an unbeatable location if you wish to be immersed in central London whilst also looking for a peaceful night’s sleep. The suite itself was beautifully designed, immaculately clean and extremely comfortable. Guest service was graceful, attentive and professionally delivered by every member of staff – they genuinely seemed happy to help. Many unique personal touches made my stay feel special and memorable. The enhanced Covid-19 safety measures in place throughout the premises did not in any way distract from an impeccable, highly refined standard of service. This is 5* hospitality at its best - I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,09,21
142,Amazing hideaway,"This is an amazing hotel that I always wanted to visit.

Breakfast was also a very high level 👍🏻

Thanks all

142,Anniversary surprise.,"I’ve been extremely fortunate to stay at this wonderful hotel before and was delighted when I was surprised with another stay. It’s like coming home when you glimpse the beautiful facade and are greeted by Charlie at the door. I was slightly apprehensive in the present situation, however there are strict procedures in place and nothing detracts from the impeccable service. James at Reception welcomed us with a smile and when he escorted us to our beautiful suite in the annexe, we discovered an anniversary gift of champagne and a handwritten card - what a delightful surprise! 
Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff, every one of them greets  you with a smile and has a brief chat about your plans and wishes you a good day. Matteo at our wonderful breakfasts recalled our preferences and took care of all our requests. 
This wonderful hotel is situated in the heart of London, in walking distance of Regent Street, Green Park and Buckingham Palace, yet in a peaceful, elegant road.
If you ever have the chance to stay in this special hotel please don’t hesitate- you would miss a treat! 
I wish the hotel and all the staff the very best for the future.",5,2020,09,16
142,Probably the best hotel in London try it ASAP,"We decided to have a Covid busting 24 hours in London and decided on this small hotel. What a great find right by Green Park. Smiling charming staff combined with luxury surroundings made this a very memorable trip. From check in to check there was nothing to fault. The food, the bars and the staff are some of the best in show.
The mews suites are lovely. The Stafford is an oasis of calm and charm right in the heart of London and with no tourists about we need to support these lovely people.
",5,2020,09,12
142,"Excellent hotel, with amazing friendly staff","Stayed here for our wedding anniversary.

142,"Excellent stay, safe, secure & with touch of class.","A recent overnight stay for my wife and I whilst working in London we thought we would treat ourselves to this excellent hotel. We were not disappointed. From Charlie on the door to the very helpful reception team, the service was truly first class. We stayed in the Carriage House Junior Suite and the room is very spacious with excellent bathroom facilities and incredibly clean. Would thoroughly recommend this room to anyone. The turndown service and Champagne was a great touch and though we only had the breakfast the food we tried was exquisite. 

We are already looking when to book again and I would be delighted to recommend this fabulous hotel to anyone looking for an excellent 5 star stay in London.

Thank you for taking such good care of us. ",5,2020,08,27
142,Superb hotel!,"Have stayed several times before and just stayed here again recently for 2 nights shortly after the reopening and  we really couldn't have asked for a more relaxing stay all round.

Cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2020,08,26
142,What a place !,"Great to see The Stafford back open again. What is amazing is that even with the necessary health measures in place everything was, as usual, calm and relaxed making The Stafford feel like our second home in London. Even though quieter than usual there was the same friendly atmosphere matched with world-class service. Anyone who wants to enjoy London at its best should get there before it gets busy again and there is nowhere better than the Stafford to enjoy London. My thanks to all the team, you make our visits to London special. Advice to all....get there soon before it gets busy!",5,2020,08,26
142,The Stafford is back !  Wonderful service has been resumed.,"Yes, they’re back. It was a pleasure to stay for six nights and receive such wonderful and familiar hospitality. Crisis ? What crisis ?  
Management have gone above and beyond during these troubled times to create a safe, warm & welcoming environment.
A most comfortable Junior Suite in The Mews was maintained impeccably. Food and beverage in The Game Bird both at breakfast and dinner was a joy. The American Bar ? I think I spent more time there than in my room !  (As My Bill will testify) Service was historic. Professional, kind and with great good humour. 
To all staff we say a heartfelt thank you for making our stay so pleasurable.
To our Italian ‘friends’ we say Grazie Mille. We wish you all great success in the coming months. You deserve it.
We hope to return at the end of the year.",5,2020,08,23
142,Fantastic!,"I stayed here here on business on 20.08.20. The stay was fantastic. Staff were very welcoming, surroundings were wonderful. There are some really intriguing pieces of art around the hotel. It’s exceptionally clean, social distancing and all such requirements were adhered to impeccably. The food was amazing and I would definitely recommend the bloody Mary’s! The rooms are sizeable, and service was first class. It’s great to see the staff back in action. You can see how much it means to them to be back in action again. I will be back again soon!",5,2020,08,23
142,Last Minute Trip,"We arrived at the Stafford expecting to only stay for the night, but later decided to stay for 3 nights. 
We were greeted by the doorman Charles who straight away made us feel very welcome, followed by the receptionist Ned, who showed us to our rooms who was also very welcoming. 
Our time in the hotel definitely went beyond our expectations. 
Everything from the food, housekeeping and all of the bar staff. 
By the end of our visit we felt more at home than at a hotel. We will definitely be back and are already planning our next two trips and we are not even out of london. 
Hotel is situated in a perfect area to get to pretty much everywhere on London.
And mostly a very big thankyou to the doorman Charles and the receptionist Ned who both has been incredibly helpful and gone out of their way to make our visit a definite 5* experience!",5,2020,08,21
142,Quick London break,"Charming London hotel in perfect, quiet location with wonderful staff. One night stay felt like a one week holiday.

142,Amazing hotel in a great location,The Stafford is an excellent 5 star hotel next to Green Park and close to Fortnum & Masons and other attractions in central London. The staff are fabulous and very helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was very luxurious and comfortable. The restaurant is fantastic and the food is out of this world. This is definitely a great place to stay in London and is highly recommended.,5,2020,08,18
142,Andrew Forshaw,"Our first trip post lockdown and we couldn’t think of anywhere better to stay than The Stafford in London. A favourite of mine over many years for business trips to London. 

From being welcomed ‘Home’ on arrival, then to be advised that we had been upgraded to a Master Suite to the delicious food at lunch in the American Bar and dinner at their new ‘Moorish’ restaurant Norma in Fitzrovia. 

The staff are superb, professional and friendly, nothing is too much trouble but in a comforting and sensitive manner. Special mention from us both for Natalya in The American Bat who was a delight and thank you to Stuart and all the staff for a wonderful experience all round. 

We will be back for sure. 

Best Wishes,

Andrew & Marilena",5,2020,08,18
142,Fabulous stay,"From start to finish our stay was smooth.
Staff throughout the hotel extremely polite, friendly and efficient. 
The room was truly amazing, very clean and the bed made for a comfortable nights sleep.
We had the afternoon tea on arrival on the Saturday, drinks before our meal out in the really great American bar. And finished our Sunday by eating outside in the American bar too. All good experiences which I would highly recommend. Really great stay! ",5,2020,08,16
142,London's Finest - Its Home From Home,"I was somewhat anxious boarding the train from Edinburgh to London for my first trip post COVID lockdown but meetings required me to be in London for 3 days.

The Stafford I have always called 'home' in London and l have watched with interest how the hotel and team have prepared to receive guests again.

On arriving at the hotel I was greeted by the usual ""welcome home"" and within minutes I knew that Stuart Procter, Mark and his team were fully prepared on every level to care for guests in their usual incredible levels of hospitality and professionalism.

Every detail had been thought out to the care and wellbeing of guests and staff alike. I was so genuinely happy to be back but more importantly could see that the staff were truly happy to be taking care of guests again, I cannot tell you how much The Stafford values their guests and treats every guest as family.

Every single team member was engaging, happy and delivered impeccable service with the usual grace and personalization. It was wonderful to see The American Bar and Courtyard buzzing but again care and respect shown to guests and patrons.

Our room had been fully prepared with 'personal care' packages to make you feel safe and protected if need be with masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. I loved that we were asked when we wished to have our room serviced and our space respected. 

Breakfast was as always incredible and again real care and thought put into spacing and distancing.

There is no question Stuart, Mark and his entire team a true hoteliers driven to welcoming guests back... I have no doubts The Stafford has led the way in preparing to care for guests in new times of business travel and personal travel. They care! They want to look after you and give you that incredible personalized hospitality which so many London luxury 5 star hotels miss even during good times....

I love The Stafford but its still pushing true levels of care and attention and not just name! Dont hesitate when you return to London hotels to book The Stafford as it never ceases to amaze or make you feel cared for and special.",5,2020,08,16
142,A Relief to be home ,"After months of lock down we were able to return to our much loved Stafford Hotel. 
Charlie, the wonderful doorman greeted us with his usual,big, welcoming smile. 
The fabulous Ned Holder, the guest relations manager, was also there to welcome us back. He has from our first visit, gone out of his way to make every stay wonderful and memorable. 
It felt quite emotional to see him and his fabulous team back doing the job they love. 
This is a hotel with a lot of history. It’s been through some tough times not least in the Second World War when the wine cellar acted as an air raid shelter for American service men staying there, hence The American Bar. Covid has been something of another battle. 
Our bags were very quickly dispatched to our Junior Suite in the coach house, which is now my husbands favourite room. 
It was hugely spacious with a four poster bed and large and luxurious bathroom. 
As you would expect from The Stafford it was also immaculate. 
We were lucky enough to visit during a heatwave, so it was wonderful to be able to sit outside in the courtyard area and enjoy drinks and a light lunch. 
We had dinner at The Game Bird which was as good as ever. I love this dining room. It is so beautiful and so calm. The fab staff do everything they can to give you a very lovely time. 
The overriding feature of The Stafford is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. It amazes us each time we return. 
Their attention to detail and intent on making us enjoy the experience is utterly unique. 
We stayed for three nights and left after an historic breakfast in The Game Bird. 
My husband said the full English was the best he had ever eaten. My avocado, smoked salmon with scrambled eggs was amazingly good. 
We didn’t feel too guilty about this indulgence as we had walked around beautiful london for miles whilst soaking in everything it has to offer from St James’s and Buckingham Palace to Hyde Park and Nottinghill. 
We cannot wait to return in September.

142,5 star birthday weekend location,"Stayed at The Stafford for a long weekend to celebrate my birthday with my wife the week before lockdown. 

A truly wonderful place steeped in history and where the list of previous guests makes for really interesting reading. 

The staff were amazing and couldn’t do enough to make our stay memorable and special from arrival to departure. Thank you to everyone. We hope you are all OK and safe and well.

Great central location for our 4 days in London which meant we did lots of walking but did enjoy our ride on a double decker red bus and the water buses on the Thames.

Our room was one in the old Stables which was peaceful but very special.

Excellent cocktails in the American Bar.

Superb breakfasts.

142,Birthday Dinner,"10 of us had a  brilliant experience at The Game Bird, it's not often that you leave a resaturant with expectations  being more than achieved.The food, service, ambience was first class, with a special mention to the staff, who were not intrusive but delivered a customer experience of the highest nature.
The food was exceptional, with a number of us choosing different dishes from a very well balanced menu.",5,2020,03,09
142,The Stafford hotel / London,"The Stafford Hotel lives the true spirit of London. It has a unique warm country side feel plus a stone through away from anything you will ever want or need from central London. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and peaceful for a fantastic night rest. All staff are super professional and lovely from the moment you enter. Excellent Concierge, Reception and House keeping. All waiters are fantastic especially at the American bar. This is my favorite hotel hands down.",5,2020,03,07
142,Wonderful hotel,"As always the service and staff was exceptional! I loved the room, very clean. And they have a wonderful fireplace In the Game Bird restaurant for the cold mornings. The place is all decorated with fresh flowers and gives it a nice homey feel! On breakfast buffet is lots choise. Chef Slavko was friendly and cut a fresh bread or slice a ham. Also Susana restaurant Menager very positive and friendly on breakfast and lunch.",5,2020,03,05
142,Feeling Special,"When my husband and I drove up to the main entrance of The Stafford a charming young man greeted us by name as did the charming receptionist. How they manage to do that I have no idea but they were not alone using our name and welcoming us back. 
This is so rare and yet makes any guest feel welcomed and special. 
We were staying at The Stafford with friends who had  never been there before. By the end of the weekend we had to prise them out !!!
As usual our room was charming and we had fun in both The Game Bird and The American Bar. 
The staff are quite simply faultless. I have never stayed anywhere in the world and received such charming, attentive and professional service. 
I believe Ned the guest relations manager is responsible for this. He is a delightful gentleman with huge attention to detail. 
We cannot wait for our next visit and neither can our friends.",5,2020,03,03
142,Couldn't Have Been Treated Any Better,"My wife chose the Stafford because of its great location, and we couldn't have been happier with the hotel or the location.  We became friendly with the staff, who are always around and never overworked.  The room was beautiful, the building unique, and the service as good as any hotel I have ever visited anywhere in the world.  The restaurant is top notch, management is on top of things, and the locals seem to like it a lot.",5,2020,02,25
142,Lovely one night stay,"Booked for one night, we were going to the Theatre, from the time we arrived until we left, we had amazing service, from drinks in the bar, breakfast the following morning, fantastic, all staff are so polite. the room we had was beautiful, we will come back. Thank you.",5,2020,02,20
142,Great Stay at the Stafford,"Great stay at the Stafford. Mark and the team really made us welcome and went out of their way to make our stay special. Our suite was beautiful and we had a drink in the American bar which had a nice relaxed atmosphere. The secluded location is perfect for a London stay, Minutes from Piccadilly etc... but nice and quiet! 
Thanks for having us.",5,2020,02,19
142,Husbands 60th celebrations!,"The Stafford is a great place to stay in London. Aside from the great location, the staff are the most attentive and abundant that we have ever come across in our travels. The food is superb. The rooms are very comfortable. 
We can highly recommend The Stafford - possibly they best hotel in the whole of the UK, definitely the best in London",5,2020,02,18
142,Evening dinner,"We have visited The Stafford on a number of occasions for drinks and afternoon tea, hidden away in St James’s Place, the Stafford is a perfect place to while away an hour or two in formal but very relaxed surroundings. 
We have wanted to dine here and recently took the opportunity to for Valentines. We arrived early to take drinks before dinner. On arrival one of the staff members went to find out seating availability in the American Bar, reserved two chairs and promptly came back to provide us with two options of either going to our table or take seats at the bar, which we dually did. 
The menu and quality of the service through the our time there was excellent, the staff were friendly and attentive, with nothing being to much trouble. The food was excellent, starting with the crab and my wife the cured salmon, we then shared the Beef Wellington and selected a bottle from a exceptionally good wine list. The puddings to were a marvel, both light and not overly sweet, perfect to round off the dinner.
Afternoon tea to is a treat here and with Green Park easily accessed and good spot to walk off the scones.",5,2020,02,17
142,Wow what a lunch!,"We went to Whiskey Cake in Stafford with several other people’s d it was so delicious that we have recommended it at least a dozen times since.  Do yourself a favor and go enjoy!    DO NOT leave without having Whiskey Cake for dessert!  Big enough to share, if you are nice enough.",5,2020,02,11
142,10 Wonderful Days in a true 5-Star Establishment,"From registration to checkout absolutely first rate. Professional, polished service where ‘no’ is unknown. The continental breakfast lavish, the Game Bird restaurant a destination on its’ own (the venison Wellington a standout), our suite tasteful, luxurious, & extremely well appointed. Very well located on the quiet side of Mayfair adjoining Green Park and the Tube. Worth every £. We look forward to returning in October.",5,2020,02,11
142,Horrific experience in a construction site,"I am completely appalled at our recent stay at the Stafford. We were placed in a room that was literally inside of a construction scaffolding. If it sounds strange, that is because it was. 

As you can see in the photos, room 301 is in a part of the hotel that is currently undergoing construction. We were awoken at 6 AM on a Sunday morning to workers loudly moving what sounded like huge equipment. Then the actual work began around 7 AM. 

I am shocked they even put people in this part of the hotel. Furthermore, they didn't warn us. I understand hotels need to undergo renovations. But for god's sake - tell your guests what to expect and apologize for the inconvenience.

I complained to the front desk and was offered a curt ""sorry."" 

I will be warning every New Yorker I know that this hotel has had its time and that time is passed. Unacceptable condition and even worse service. 

Shame on your manager for not responding to my complaint either.",1,2020,02,10
142,Contemporary Old-World Charm,"I realize that ""contemporary"" and ""old-world"" are an oxymoron, but this is truly what this extraordinary boutique hotel is. A gracious, beautiful hotel, which takes you back to late Victorian London, but sophisticatedly updated in decor, food and service. The multilingual staff make guests from all parts of the globe feel welcome and cared for. Yes, the up-dated older rooms in the main house are small, but for me, that's their delight. If you want larger rooms, they have two other buildings for you to chose from. And of course, The American Bar is the best spot in London for drinks and meals.

You will never find better Concierge service in any hotel anywhere. I have yet made a request that they couldn't fulfill with a smile. This trip, I needed to buy a snorkel and mask for an up-coming cruise.They sent me to a great dive shop with a wonderful driver.

As a solo traveler, the staff unobtrusively made sure I was taken care of and would even reserve a table for me in the public area to work throughout the day. It was cold and rainy during my stay, so I had all my meals with The Stafford. They created delicious, creative dishes, which were not always on their innovative menu so I could enjoy the sophistication of their kitchen. Once again, their afternoon tea surpassed expectations with a delightful and creative presentation.

Of course, there isn't a better located hotel in London with Green Park, St. James Park, Buckingham Palace, St.James St., and Piccadilly all within a short walk. Fabulous restaurants, shops, theaters and arcades are all near-by. When I did go out bundled-up for a walk, I always felt safe in that part of the city.  

I guess, from this review you can tell that when in London, The Stafford is my home-away-from-home.",5,2020,02,09
142,great place for high tea,"After a visit to the Buckingham the Stafford was the perfect place to go for high tea.
They have sourced all the items on the plate from the best local providers.
The atmosphere is relaxing and they have a great collection of Tea!",5,2020,02,09
142,First-rate!,"Stayed at The Stafford for the first time after having visited the American Bar a few times. This is a very nice, comfortable boutique hotel that is perfectly situated in St. James. The staff was very attentive without being invasive. The rooms (stayed in the Mews) were very comfortable, well appointed and quiet. All in all, a great experience.",5,2020,02,05
142,Start A Tradition at the Stafford London Hotel!,"Awarded the best Concierge services in the world,a great location, exceptional staff,cozy American Bar and sumptuous cuisine in the famous Game Room,the Stafford London hotel  has it all! As a native New Yorker, I can be very fussy. I've enjoyed two stays and can't say enough about how the staff anticipates your every wish and desire.",5,2020,02,05
142,Wonderful with some construction noise,"As mentioned before, the Stafford really is wonderful. The location is fantastic, right next to the green park tube station and the Piccadilly area. The service is fantastic - no one seems condescending and are always pleasant. The American bar and restaurant have great atmosphere. And they let us check in early, around 11am -which was much appreciated after flying in from the US. Only thing was that our room (325) was right below where they’re doing renovations (all London hotels seem to renovate in January) and in the day time it was surprisingly noisy - like noisiest room I’ve ever been in, even noisier than when I visit the big cities of India. If you get migraines or are sensitive to noise, I’d just recommend checking with the front desk in regards to your proximity to the renovations.",5,2020,02,01
142,The Absolute Best!,"My trip was extended while I was in London so I stayed at The Stafford for the last six days. It was the best decision I made while in London. The staff is incredibly friendly and very courteous, the food is top notch, the room I stayed in, the Carriage House Jr. Suite, was just beautiful and very cozy. They also have enormous bathtubs which I adored. I ordered room service several times and the food was delivered quickly and was delicious. The drinks in the bar were sensational. The concierge was always there with great ideas for the theatre, restaurants, sight seeing, etc. They even organized the best massage I've had to date. You're right next to Green Park, Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, plenty of transportation, shopping and restaurants. What I loved most about this hotel is that they offer all of the modern conveniences while staying true to the history.  I can't say enough good things about this hotel, it surpassed all of my expectations.",5,2020,01,27
142,Our Home Whilst in London,"We returned earlier this month from our 4th visit to The Stafford.  Needless to say we adore this hotel.  There is so much charm, so many choices for accommodations (main house, Carriage Rooms (our favorite), and the Mews; and then there is the fabulous American Bar and the extraordinary Game Bird.  There is also the most amazing staff who must truly love their jobs...they make you feel like family.  The Christmas decorations are indescribable...it feels like an evergreen forest in the courtyard!  We were privileged to view the New Years Eve fireworks from the rooftop and I am pretty sure we had a better view than the folks on the Thames.  The location of the hotel is perfect for us...quick walk to the Green Park tube station and completely walkable to most places that would be on your to-do it.  The Stafford is fabulous and they are true to their motto : Your home whilst in London.",5,2020,01,22
142,An exquisitely traditional British hotel offering truly impeccable service,"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the service received from everyone at The Stafford was exceptional.  This hotel upholds the utmost traditional British standards offering discreet, personal and excellent service.  We were delighted to be offered a complimentary room upgrade and welcoming bottle of wine in the room.  The breakfast was superb and we look forward to our next visit.  Thank you to all of the staff who work so hard to ensure each and every guests stay is as enjoyable and memorable as possible.  ",5,2020,01,22
142,Great Place to Stay in London,"The Location is amazing, yet the Hotel is very classy and discrete. If you are looking the perfect spot to stay in London but don't want to go to overrated/trendy hotels, this is the place. The staff is very good, the rooms are perfect and has a very interesting history (it is possible to visit the wine cellar of the Hotel, one of the oldest in London and that was used in the WW2 as a shelter. Recommended!",5,2020,01,17
142,special place,One of those gems in the heart of London you'd quite like to keep completely to yourself. The perfect blend of ultimate customer service and relaxed sophistication. it has a sense of being in a bygone era but with a contemporary twist. Back soon!,5,2020,01,13
142,American Bar,"We have been going to the American Bar for 20 years either in the lead up to Xmas or in the early New Year- without exception we have had excellent service and a warm and friendly reception from the brilliant staff- i cannot commend them highly enough- food drinks and service outstanding - we will be back for our annual visit next year.
Ian Skinner January 2020.",5,2020,01,12
142,A wonderful post Christmas visit to London to explore museums and visit friends,"After an early arrival wait for our classic room to be readied we were upgraded to a junior suite in the annex with elegant proportions, ample space and a beautiful bathroom with separate shower and bath. This was our second Christmas time visit and again the hotel was filled with festive decorations, peopled by a warm and welcoming staff always alert to our needs , and provided excellent food at all meals. This very stylish hotel , in an  upscale neighborhood is nonetheless welcoming and homey. A great combination.",5,2020,01,09
142,A joy at Christmas,"Although we have stayed at the Stafford at other times of the year, the hotel pulled out all the stops over the Christmas holiday. We had a small decorated tree and gifts in our room, with a bottle of wine to welcome us. The concierge service as always was  outstanding. Some of the queen rooms are small, but well appointed, and our junior suite was perfect. The American Bar is a kick and the specialty cocktails, while pricey, are worth a taste. This is a hotel that knows how to build customer loyalty. And the location -- a very short walk to the Green Park tube station, and mere blocks from Mayfair restaurants and shopping -- is superb.",5,2020,01,07
142,Felt Like Home,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Stafford over Christmas.  It was wonderful!  The hotel is situated perfectly in Piccadilly and we had easy access to some of our favourite haunts.  The staff were wonderful, making us feel at home, There were many touches, such as Christmas tree in our room, the carol singing on Christmas Eve that we loved.  The American Bar became our favourite and the staff were exceptional.  We were impressed how quickly they learned our name and preferences.  All in all a delightful stay",5,2020,01,06
142,Home away from home,"The service provided by the team in the Stafford is excellent (this was our 5th stay).  From the moment we stepped out of the taxi everyone was kind and helpful.  The accommodation is beautiful and very spacious for a London property.  The American Bar provide lots of delicious snacks and fabulous cocktails and the team reserved a table for us in the evening after returning from the theatre (great attention to detail).  Breakfast is delicious with a great choice on offer.

My husband lost his reading glasses on our journey to London and the concierge helped him locate them and we were able to pick them up on our journey home.  They also manage to purchase theatre tickets for us (I had been trying to get tickets for months) and we had a fabulous evening.

Nothing is too much trouble for the team at the Stafford, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.  The location is perfect, providing access to all of the major sites on foot.   

What makes the Stafford special? Definitely the people.  We look forward to our next visit.",5,2019,12,20
142,Truly an exceptional property ,"Returning to The Stafford really is a ""Welcome Home"" as says the theme of the door key holder. This visit we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite in the mews building and the welcome was even bigger. The suite was well designed, attractively and comfortably furnished, equipped with most every conceivable amenity, and kept spotlessly clean. The accommodations combined with the highest service standards of the staff and the ideal location in central London make the hotel a winning combination that all its competitors must envy and find difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. A particular feature is the quietness of the hotel on a dead end back street yet only steps away from the hustle of St. James St., Piccadilly and the entire St. James and adjacent areas. In the seven days we stayed there was only one misstep and that was our fault.  One day we carelessly did not notice that the obverse of the ""Please make up room"" sign was ""Do not disturb"" and the housekeeping staff faithfully observed that sign all day until we returned in the evening and found to our chagrin that our carelessness had resulted in the suite not being cleaned and made up: a prime example of an attentive staff and a careless guest. Hopefully we will soon again return to another ""Welcome Home.""",5,2019,12,18
142,A delicious Sunday lunch,"We were in London for the weekend and decided to have a special lunch as a treat. I'd heard good things about the Game Bird so I booked in advance online. From the moment we walked in we were treated excellently, the dining rooms are beautiful and the service on the exact right side of attentive. We both had the set Sunday lunch menu with roast beef which was absolutely delicious (and I even ate multiple sprouts, a first for me! ). After our meal the staff held a table for us in the atmospheric American bar, where we had a very nice drink. Both myself and my partner enjoyed the afternoon immensely and wished we could have stayed longer. A delightful place to dine and drink. Thanks to the staff for helping make our early Christmas weekend a good one.  We'll be sure to visit again",5,2019,12,18
142,"Location, service and charm ",Terrific home base for visiting London. Neighborhood is pleasant and access to Underground and parks are outstanding. Very helpful staff. Cute touches in room (mini Xmas tree with lights and rubber duckie in bath). ,4,2019,12,12
142,Fantastic staff not only polite helpful but incredibly well skilled Barman,"Barman what a joy to watch . The staff in the American bar Reassuringly appreciative to see a old regular taking time to catch up and making you feel more than just a client. amazing as always 
 It is a Joy and a privilege to spend time in the American bar being looked after by some of the best staff you can find in London",5,2019,12,11
142,Birthday lunch ,"My friend and I recently went to the Staffords restaurant The Gamebird for lunch. From start to finish it was perfection. An excellent start to my 30th birthday weekend before seeing a show. The food was beautiful in both taste and presentation. The staff really make it a memorable experience by being friendly , knowledgeable and passionate about food and drink. We had the Wild Boar croquettes to start , then I had the lamb and my friend the chicken Kiev’s . All of it was delicious, as was the glass of champagne. We shall definitely be back when we visit London again. Thank you so much 🥰",5,2019,12,10
142,Still Outstanding,"It is several years since I last stayed at The Stafford but it is better than it ever was, lovely atmosphere, great rooms, high profile management, always a good sign of a top hotel.

The junior suite was very tastefully appointed, the staff very warm and friendly with great food and service. The famous American Bar with its  cosy feel served us a a lovely  lunch and breakfast in the new Game Bird Restaurant was top notch. 

Overall a great London Hotel with character and 'Atmosphere'

It will not be so long next time Stafford, hotel keeping at its best!!

",5,2019,12,06
142,Lovely stay,"We recently had a somewhat stressful trip into London to do some Christmas shopping and have a nice meal. For reasons far too dull to go into the journey in was a nightmare, the meal we had at a restaurant was bad and the whole thing could have been a disaster. However the hotel was an oasis of calm. The staff were helpful, efficient, effective and friendly throughout (big shout out to the lady on reception at 6.30pm Sat 30th; I was stressed and you were brilliant, thank you)

The hotel is a very relaxed and somewhat old fashioned place to stay in the heart of London, with an excellent bar - the French 75s were most welcome - and a very good restaurant. Although, in all honesty, our room could have done with a bit of updating, it was quite, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.

I will definitely be back",5,2019,12,02
142,Convenient and classic,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Stafford for our first (but hopefully not last!) trip to London.  The staff made us feel really special for our 30th anniversary, with many unique and thoughtful touches.  Our view was lovely, and the location was soooo convenient to many attractions while feeling safe.  Ned went the extra mile to make sure we felt at home!  Thank you for representing your beautiful city in such a positive way, we hope to return!",5,2019,11,29
142,Sensational two night stay,"Excellent service, food and accommodation.

Two of us stayed one of the courtyard rooms, easy access in and out late at night. Everything was just how we wanted it to be. The staff made us feel very welcome and we cannot wait to go back.

Just wow!",5,2019,11,28
142,Gorgeous stay,"Staff so helpful, polite and welcoming. Breakfast delivered to room was wonderful as was the room. The high thread count bedding and Comfortable bed resulted in a great night's sleep. Great location. Perfect!",5,2019,11,28
142,Another Outstanding Visit at The Stafford,"My wife and I certainly enjoyed our stay at the Stafford in October.  This is I believe our 6th stay with the hotel and once again, they exceeded our expectation in every way -from the reception desk, concierge, valets, housekeeping, to of course The American Bar Service everything was extraordinary.

No request seems to small or trivial for the staff's assistance.

The nearby shopping and dining options are excellent with the theater not to far away at all.  While I spend the day working, my wife is comfortable walking in the hotel area to enjoy the day.

Years ago we spent the Christmas Holidays at The Stafford.  Our daughter still says it is one of her best Christmas times ever.",5,2019,11,24
142,Excellent hotel!,"My husband & I stayed in a jr suite at the Stafford. It was such a great and memorable stay. The staff was so accommodating and professional and the hotel itself was quintessentially British. Everything from the location (which was central to most of the sights and in a very upscale, chic neighborhood) to the room to the restaurant(s) were superb.  Our suite, which was located outside of the main hotel (in the “mews”), was like a townhouse. Would definitely stay there again. A true 5 star experience.",5,2019,11,23
142,A truly excellent Sunday lunch,"All credit to the Chef, Kitchen and waiting on staff  - we had such a lovely traditional Sunday lunch sitting in very comfortable surroundings. the staff were so polite and attentive  - a credit to them and the management  - it is so nice to see that there are still establishments being run with traditional values and high standards and superb cuisine - well done!!",5,2019,11,12
142,quality talks,"Well we have stayed at the Stafford several times and that because it works well for us my wife and i went with our close friends so we were four.
The rooms were traditional style but very well done they were extremely well presented and kept immaculate clean they had a coffee making machine a fridge the bathroom was all clad in marble . We were there for the weekend arriving friday leaving monday. The sevice was excellent in all areas, we breakfasted in the hotel which had everything one could wish for. We actually  dinned out so no news on the Lunch / Dinner   the bar area had abeen refurbished and looked good the coctails were father expensive even by London standards but the wine were good and reasonably priced for a hotel of this standing. we would return indeed we will possibly do that early next year.",5,2019,11,10
142,"Beautiful Hotel, Fabulous Staff and Wonderful Location","From our arrival to our departure 3 days later, we could not have wished for a better experience.  The room was lovely, the American Bar became our home for cocktails and light fare and the staff throughout the hotel was more than accommodating.  They made our visit a delight.  Highly recommend a booking.",5,2019,11,07
142,Best place in London,"We stayed at The Stafford London for  the seventh time.  
It is a lovely, warm place to stay    They make you feel
Like you are at home. Each visit is better than the one before. It is waking distance to-many wonderful  places. 
You will enjoy your stay here",5,2019,11,05
142,An excellent dinner in the Game Bird Restaurant.,"Having dined here, several times this year, we again had an excellent dinner on Sat 2nd Nov 2019.This was a dinner with friends and the food, service and wine were all consistently excellent as I have come to expect and I wasn't disappointed. The wine as chosen by Silvana was (again) excellent and I have come to trust his ability & judgement explicitly.",5,2019,11,05
142,Perfect hotel for a romantic getaway,"Super nice atmosphere, great and friendly staff, in the very center of London, what more can you ask? Breakfast was also super good (even if they served our coffee very late 2 days in a row..), and room service as well.",5,2019,10,28
142,Great Experience,"The Stafford was a great experience. One couldn’t have asked for a better staff, better location or more comfortable accommodation.

The American Bar, great place to unwind after a long day...or to have a simple quiet breakfast.
",5,2019,10,27
142,Excellent hotel in the heart of London,"The hotel is excellently located just a short distance from Green Park in a quiet alleyway. The interior is a very tasteful mix of traditional English luxury with a pinch of American easy-going feeling. I vastly prefer this leisurely luxury style to more uptight places in the neighbourhood. The service was similarly excellent when I had to change to this hotel from another one on a very short notice (I’m glad I did). This is a particularly good place to hosting business breakfasts and lunches and other similar meet-ups. I met with about five different groups from the London financial scene here, and everybody was impressed by the premises. I can definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you want to ask other people to meet you up over there.",5,2019,10,18
142,A Hidden Gem for an Amazing Afternoon Tea,"One of the things on my bucket list for my vacation to London was to experience a traditional afternoon tea.  And my experience at the Game Bird was everything that I imagined and more.  After exploring London all day it was wonderful to be seated at an extremely cozy couch for afternoon tea.  The food was beyond delicious and I really appreciated that the desserts came from local businesses.  The tea was exactly what I needed, served in a beautiful tea set that kept everything piping hot.  And I loved that the staff was always checking to see if we needed more hot water or sandwiches.  We were never rushed and were able to really enjoy our time.
The entire experience was phenomenal and the staff helped make it a truly memorable time.  If I'm ever back in London I will definitely make a point to return to the Game Bird.",5,2019,10,15
142,Great bar experience,"Stafford hotel Bar for afternoon drinks is highly recommended for a nice cocktail. A premium glass of wine or a sparkling. 
Cozy atmosphere. Top service. One of the favorite places in London. Very British environment. The chief Barkeeper is there for many years and know to his clients. Very friendly and professional.",5,2019,10,09
142,Squirrelled away in a bustling corner of busiest London,A hidden gem - the `American Bar is a one-off for the well-off. Decorated with memorabilia and flags from around the world without a spec of dust on any - things I just cant stand ! Serves as a positive advert of how the premises behind the scenes must be too. Yes a venue for a martini or two indeed!,5,2019,10,09
142,In the heart of St. James,"Fantastic mid size property in the quietest spot in St. James.  Beautiful rooms, fantastic attentive staff, one of the greatest bars in London “the American Bar”, and a terrific restaurant. And, oh, the oldest wine cellar in London stock with 12000 bottles.",5,2019,10,07
142,Beautiful Hotel in Terrific Location but Little Balm for 8am Banging,"My husband and I stayed in The Stafford 3 nights in September to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. The hotel spaces are beautiful and luxurious and the room was as well. Very posh. The bottle of champagne in the room was a nice and appreciated touch. We found the staff for the most part to be extremely attentive and professional and the location excellent, so this should have been a 5 bullet review. However, when we were shown our 2nd floor room overlooking the mews, we did not notice the scaffolding carefully wedged against the building immediately adjacent and almost directly below the room. Instead, after spending our anniversary at the Chelsea/Liverpool match followed by a late anniversary dinner and drinks, we were awoken our first morning at 8am by a man moving the scaffolding and banging intermittently on the exterior of the adjacent rooms with a mallet. Not pleasant or luxurious. The next day was the same, except the scaffolding movement and banging began at 7:40am. After attending a concert into the wee hours the night before, this was simply too much. I called the front desk who claimed to be unaware of the construction (impossible) and offered to call the manager. In her call back 15 minutes later she claimed the manager had 'spoken' with the manager in the other building about keeping it down. Then she offered us free breakfast for that and the next day; when I pointed out that we had a cab to the airport before breakfast on the following day, she said ""well, at least you get one."" Nothing else to offer, nothing more to say on it apparently. For what we were paying, this was extremely frustrating.  

The casual treatment of a client concern like this grates on me. We are parents of school age children on a rare trip away from them, traveling all the way from Boston to London. It is our 18th anniversary. We do not care about breakfast. We want to have late,chore-free nights that don't involve childcare, petcare or work and to sleep in on a luxurious bed the next morning with nothing to do. But that wonderful comfortable bed just sat there while the workman - freed by the acknowledgement of his actual existence - decided that banging harder was now ok. Breakfast doesn't cover this, particularly when you can only attend 1 of 2. 

I am giving the hotel 4 bullets rather than 3 only because of the performance of the majority of its staff and because I believe our experience would have been better in literally any other room in the hotel. Why we were the lucky ones put so close to the construction, I have no idea. If you stay here, the American Bar is an interesting spot for a drink but avoid The Game Bird, which served passable but totally unremarkable food for our anniversary dinner. Breakfast is good if you like a big meal in the am.",4,2019,10,04
142,Dinner in the wine cellar,"Enjoyed private dining in the wine cellar, great food and excellent service. A little warm in the area we received pre drinks however, I think this is outside of the control of the hotel due to the building. Definitely recommend. ",5,2019,09,29
142,Everything was perfect!!,"The hotel was super comfortable, clean, cute, and perfect. The staff were very friendly, kind and helpful. In terms of location, it is just steps from green park, Piccadilly, Mayfair, and St James. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,09,28
142,Relaxed lazy lunch with friends in The American Bar; perfect.,"The American Bar st The Stafford is exceptional.  I had been many times before however for my 5 guests this was their first visit and they LOVED it!  The atmosphere, the wide ranging menu and the service was absolutely brilliant.  Thank you for the happy memories; we will be back.",5,2019,09,27
142,Charme and comfort,"I am not going to write anything about the beauty of this hotel because it is evident. A very peculiar charme coming from its classic furniture -although with a modern touch - and decorative objects even in the bedroom, original tapestry and marble in the bathroom. It seems the classic 5star luxury hotel but it has its personal style! The staff is very discreet, friendly and helpful. The location, between Mayfair, Piccadilly and St James is super convenient, in the very centre of the city, although the rooms are super quite! I definitely recommend it! The only sad thing is that I forgot the lovely rubberduck in the bathroom so I cannot add it to my collection :(",5,2019,09,23
142,Great Stay,I stayed here for along weekend in September and had a great time.  Staff were cheery and helpful.  Located just off a main street meant that it was easy to get around and centrally located to all the activities I had planned.   They even have a quaint patio off their restaurant where I was able to enjoy the nice weather at lunch.  I would stay here again.,5,2019,09,22
142,The Stafford Continues to Maintain the Highest Standards,"Our annual visit confirmed the continued maintenance of the highest quality standards. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. The cosy bar is great for a late night drink, as is luncheon in the adjoining mews dining area during nice weather. We whole heartedly recommend The Stafford.",5,2019,09,19
142,The Stafford London,"I am in London quite often and would not consider staying anywhere other than The Stafford London.   The hotel is the perfect size, the rooms are delightfully appointed in a very traditional manner (my favorite) and the staff are all incredibly excellent.....across the board without fail.   The best hotel in the city......don't miss an opportunity to stay here.  When they greet you with 'welcome home', you'll know what I mean!",5,2019,09,17
142,Fabulous hotel ,"I visited The Stafford with my wife for a short break .  

We stayed in a stunning room in the mews part of the hotel .  The room was beautifully furnished,  full of light and very comfortable.

Breakfast did  not disappoint, a huge choice and very well prepared . 

All the hotel team were excellent, courteous, professional and attentive.  

We both look forward to returning back very soon .

",5,2019,09,12
142,Slice of Heaven in the City,"We loved this hotel. And that says a lot because we are very picky and high maintenance. I originally wanted to stay at the Four Seasons and I’m so glad we decided on this boutique 5 star hotel. The staff was was increasingly service oriented. They reached out in advance and really dotted on us the entire trip. The location was perfect. Close to everything!! We walked to a lot of places. Loved loved loved it. Specifically, peter was great at the concierge. Honestly, all the staff were delightful and I wish I could remember all their names.",5,2019,09,06
142,Top level hotel,"Staff at the Stafford are tops. They fulfill all requests cheerfully and precisely. The rooms are well appointed. Breakfasts excellent- and the American Bar is great. Dinners at the Gamebird dining room are good, not great. The location is super. All in all, this is a first class hostelry; expensive but less than other five star hotels. 

",5,2019,09,05
142,Best Service in London!,"This the best hotel in London - service is unmatched.  My family and I stayed for 4 nights in late August and could not have had a better experience.  The staff is extremely warm and welcoming and no detail is missed.  Though it was our first time at the hotel, we felt like we were repeat travelers at the property and felt like we were at a home away from home.  Food was incredible, the bar is wonderful and the rooms are perfectly appointed.  Nothing, however, beats the quality of the people that work there- everyone from the front desk, concierge, restaurant and room service - A PLUS! ",5,2019,09,04
142,Worth every Pound!,"This well located hotel has improved which I thought wasn’t possible.  We stayed in the new addition of suite rooms which were well appointed and roomy, although expensive.  The American Bar seems even friendlier.  The bartenders and waitstaff are great and much fun!  Save up and go!",5,2019,09,03
142,Recommended hotel.,"Particularly friendly and helpful staff. Good and quiet location.
The room I was staying in was not really big but it was practically furnished.
Service is outstanding and dinner in The Game Bird restaurant was very nice... excellent food and service.",5,2019,09,01
142,The Stafford - Among the best in London,"Great location, excellent experience staff. They anticipate your needs. Range of rooms from small to large, expensive to inexpensive. Great food and drink options. Convenient to the heart of London. Great choice for business or pleasure trip.",5,2019,08,31
142,The best,"Top of the line in every way; extremely helpful and nice staff, great location in Londons best area, quiet, clean and with a home away from home feel. A classic luxury hotel. 

This hotel is always my first choice in London.",5,2019,08,31
142,Super!,"We stayed at two other hotels during our trip, but The Stafford was exceptional! From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the level of service has been impeccable. We received a room upgrade, which was fantastic!

What makes this place special is the staff who are incredible friendly and helpful. Everything else on offer was of very high quality. 

My only issue was that the crib for our toddler was very small and he couldn’t fit it in it, so he slept with us on the bed. 

Overall, a super hotel with super staff!",5,2019,08,27
142,Internationally my favourite hotel - The Stafford,"Just checked out after 4 days at The Stafford. In short, fantastic location with all major attractions that London has to offer close by. Rooms very clean and to a high standard, staff extremely warm and friendly, food choice - first class, and the American bar a great place to unwind after a busy day. My clients love meeting me here. ",5,2019,08,21
142,"Beautiful, comfortable, wonderful!","There's nothing not to love about The Stafford London. The hotel is beautiful and ideally located, a hidden gem. Our room felt like a true home away from home -- comfortable, well appointed, quiet, and brimming with English charm. I can't say enough about the wonderful staff and the service they offer. Every morning when I called downstairs for coffee, a friendly staff member would be there within 5 minutes (no exaggeration), delivering our coffee on a silver tray, complete with an assortment of cookies. It was such a lovely way to start each day. We ate breakfast every morning and dinner one night at The Game Bird, whose staff is equally friendly and helpful, and the food, presented tastefully and elegantly, delicious. We also had a great time on our last evening in London sipping drinks and chatting with patrons at the American Bar before heading out for a stroll in adjacent Green Park. It is true that The Stafford is ""stately,"" as the hotel's website reads, but it is also warm and welcoming. Everyone at The Stafford London is kind and eager to make your stay memorable.",5,2019,08,20
142,Excellent customer service,I had to book my hotel on the fly - literally sent an email as I was boarding my international flight. When I landed a lovely email confirming my room and that it would be ready for me to shower before my meeting.  Great service!,5,2019,08,20
142,Superb!,"Location, Food, Comfort and Style was above 5 stars.  The eagerness and ability of the staff to help and recommend was over the top.  They could get us reservations or play tickets in a matter of hours.  Fabulous trip will be back here for sure!",5,2019,08,18
142,Really Great Hotel in London!,"We stayed at the Stafford for 5 nights and really loved the hotel and location.  We could be in the park, the tube, shopping, or at Buckingham Palace in mere minutes. The walk through the park to Westminster Cathedral was absolutely beautiful. The service is super attentive.  The spacious rooms (newly refurbished), VERY quiet location, and excellent staff really sets the Stafford apart from other hotels in the city.  Charlie (doorman) is fabulous and knowledgeable and happily welcomed us from minute one.  We were sad to leave....it's a super comfortable spot!  Thank you, Stafford staff, for being gracious and attentive to your jet-lagged guests.  We very much hope to see you again soon!",5,2019,08,17
142,Superb Afternoon Tea!,"I enjoyed Afternoon Tea with two friends in the sumptuous surroundings of The Stafford.   It was an elegant occasion.   We were given a black and vanilla tea to begin with which was then followed by our own choice of teas.   I chose Zest, a refreshing and subtle combination of lemon and ginger.  The tea included savoury items as well as the usual sweetmeats, which appealed to me particularly.   The cakes are presented in the form of luxury items which can be purchased at shops within the locality of The Stafford and are unique in style.   The food was plentiful and of the highest quality, as was the service.   Quite one of the best Afternoon Teas I have experienced and to be recommended in every way!",5,2019,08,14
142,Amazing,"The Room was really nice with a great selection of tea and coffee. The staff were very friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic selection of quality dishes at breakfast.  A Great way to spend our 20th Wedding Anniversary.",5,2019,08,12
142,UNIQUE!!!!!  A GEM IN LONDON,"So this peaceful place is tucked away on a side street in London, elegant, charming and perfection is the BEST way to describe this slice of heaven. It is my go to place in London because of the service, rooms and courtyard. I am looking forward to going back next month!!! ",5,2019,08,11
142,Another fabulous visit,I stayed with my mum for a night as a birthday treat We were in a carriage house suite and it was perfect. We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived. We had drinks in The American Bar before eating in The Game Bird. The hotel has a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff are superb. Breakfast was great with everything you could want. I have stayed a few times now and have never been disappointed,5,2019,08,10
142,Wonderful staff great location,Room was great. Location in W! was perfect. very quiet property with excellent staff. American bar was fun at night. Breakfast was always wonderful with lots of choices and fresh fruit in season. Can' recommend it highly enough!!!!,5,2019,08,03
142,Excellent wedding breakfast,"We have recently attended a wedding breakfast. Perfect location,delicious food, especially beef wellington and petits fours, very friendly, attentive service. I would like to recommend this place to visit.",5,2019,08,02
142,"Outstanding accommodations, food and service",We recently stayed at the Stafford in one of the suites in the mews which forms a courtyard behind the hotel.  Wonderful atmosphere and the feel of old London.  Service is outstanding and dinner in The Game Bird restaurant was delightful...excellent food and service.  Frank Laino is the best concierge in London and his team provides great service.  The American Bar serves the best martini in town and a stay here is highly recommended.,5,2019,07,30
142,Excellent Hotel,"Perfectly located for the tube and Buckingham Palace.  Not too far from Piccadilly Circus, this hotel is all that one could hope for.  Staff were, without exception, helpful, pleasant and they seem to think of everything, e.g. water at the door to help cope with the heat and one day free ice cream!  Food was varied and excellent.  Coffee made perfectly.  The American Bar is a nice way to end the day.  The rooms are small, but cosy and the bed was comfortable.  Thoroughly enjoy this hotel.",5,2019,07,28
142,Excellent hotel,"It is very nice,the staff are friendly and the front desk was v cooperative. All and all, i loved the experience.
They offer breakfast also. The croissants are delicious but the eggs are not that good. 
  ",5,2019,07,25
142,My new favourite hotel ,"I booked this hotel on the recommendation of an American we met on a cruise.
What a fabulous place to stay.
Staff, service, ambiance, food, drink and room all score top marks and the location is perfect.
This is how it should be done and some of the Capital’s landmark hotels would do well to send staff here to learn what exemplary 5 star service is really like.
I can thoroughly recommend The Stafford and intend to return!",5,2019,07,19
142,Exceptional hotel,A truly Exceptional stay.  A hidden gem in London.  From the moment we arrived the staff were incredibly accommodating and greeted us with a very warm welcome.  They were attentive to our every request.  Lovely appointed rooms with modern amenities.  We loved the location.  A visit to American Bar is a must!  Reception and Concierge services were excellent!  Will definitely be back to visit!!,5,2019,07,16
142,Wonderful Stay!,"We booked  a pre cruise stay for 5 days at the Stafford at the suggestion of our Travel agent. It was a great choice. The reception was very personable as was the rest of the staff throughout our stay. Before our arrival the concierges were great with dining suggestions and reservations as well as booking London tours for us.
We began with lunch after arriving from our international flight and were blown away by the quality of the food, the presentation and the service. This was true everyday we were there for breakfast in the restaurant or in our room. 
Our room was terrific, clean efficient with all the modern conveniences we needed.

The couple we were traveling with agrees that we would all return to the Stafford on our next trip.
Cheers to all of the crew at the Stafford.",5,2019,07,11
142,We couldn’t ask for more,"To the entire staff at The Stafford, thank you. You made my husbands 50th birthday and very memorable one.  We’ve stayed at all the fancy chains, but this cute boutique hotel with old-world charm is truly a gem.  Their attention to detail in creating a warm environment that feels like home is uncanny. 

The location is exceptional and the service is top-notch. Thank you Charlie for being such a gentleman and taking great care of us. 

The food in The American Bar, particularly the grill was some of the best food we tasted while in London. We will definitely be back and we’re looking forward to seeing you again. 

The Kennedys",5,2019,07,08
142,Tough to beat,"A very fine hotel with exceptional service and wonderful food. The rooms are large and comfortable with great closet space. We were a bit confused about restaurant directions and the concierge walked us through a back exit that saved us steps and time and then pointed out the restaurant. You are short walks from Buckingham palace, St. James palace and Trafalgar Square. We have no need to look for another London hotel now that we know about The Stafford.",5,2019,07,08
142,Wonderful Experience!,I stayed June/July 2019 with an 18 year old and a 76 year old who needed more assistance with getting in and out of cars and the hotel.  The concierge got us amazing seats and tickets to 3 shows while there.  The food was AMAZING!  The people greeting us daily were amazing and so very friendly and helpful with telling us the easiest way to get around or do anything!  Please stay here - off the beaten track but around the corner from EVERYTHING!!!!,5,2019,07,08
142,The Best of London,"Everything (and more!) one could desire in a London hotel.  Located right next to Green Park in the heart of the St James shopping district, the Stafford has elegant, welcoming public spaces, extremely comfortable rooms, great food, and a wonderful staff.",5,2019,06,23
142,It was my second visit to The Stafford. I will return.....,"Very convenient, the front entrance leads to Green Park and the Underground. The back entrance leads to St. James's Street. I particularly liked the outside seating area and the American Bar.  I had a great lunch with a friend in the Game Bird. I had a room in the Mews, very quiet and well decorated.  All modern conveniences. But above all, the staff makes a difference, they are all cheery, polite and helpful.",5,2019,06,22
142,A wonderful hotel,Great central location. The best trained staff I’ve ever encountered. Extraordinary attention to detail. Very good food and a wonderfully quirky bar. Could not be better.  Highly recommended. The best hotel in London. ,5,2019,06,20
142,British tradition at its finest,"From the moment you step out the taxi, you know that this will be an almost royal experience.  Amazing and helpful staff, the location can't be better -- a quiet dead-end street, but with easy access to hustle and bustle of London and only 5 min walk to Buckingham Palace (at least when Trump is not visiting).  Just wonderful from beginning to end.",5,2019,06,11
142,visited the bar solo recently to taste a few wines by the glass to blow a bit of work pressure,"I went a couple of times recently to relax after work . I know some of the staff for a long time and they provide great service and the selection of wines by the glass is very very good and good value too.I had a great relax time  , and Benoit and Gino are very efficient and relax service providers.I ll go back very soon . highly recommend.The bar is very confortable and you have high chairs at the counter, really nice and informal.",5,2019,06,07
142,I keep on coming,Once again I came to this very English and stylish hotel    The location is perfect    The staff couldn’t have been more polite.   The area is as far as I’m concerned the best one because it is at walking distance from everything you’d like to visit.   The hotel is a true English jewel and the decorations brings you back to the old  English life    The restaurant and bars are truly exceptional.  I will keep on coming since I feel I couldn’t make a better choice ,5,2019,06,05
142,FANTASTIC,"I must say, the Stafford Hotel is one of the best experiences I've had as a hotel guest.
From the moment I walked through the passage way that leads you to the hotel I was greeted by a friendly and professional doorman who showed me to the check in desk.

The check in was great, I was helped by a  French receptionist, I believe her name is Zelia, and she was exceptional! very ""direct"" but she was interested in my plans and how my journey from Italy to the hotel went. I was shown to a beautiful room in stable section called carriage house which is situated in the courtyard of the Stafford. 

The room has a country feel to it with a massive modern bathroom. 

Whilst my stay at the Stafford I was able to enjoy a drink in the American bar which ,in my opinion, has one of the best negroni's in town. 

Check out was easy.

I would definitely recommend the Stafford for your stay in London and I will be back soon.",5,2019,05,31
142,Wonderful secret ! ,The Hotel is incredibly central yet hidden away in St.James.  Little narrow walkway from Green Park brings you to the front door of the hotel. Staff excellent and attention to detail is great.  Fantastic restaurant and a separate bar (American Bar). Really enjoyable!,5,2019,05,29
142,Great Hotel,"Our second stay at this hotel which is a hidden gem.  This time just a one night stay for our wedding anniversary and we were glad we made the decision to stay there again.  Our special occasion made all the more so by the staff, the bottle of champagne on ice and our beautiful room.  Our only regret not staying for longer! But we will be back.",5,2019,05,28
142,Hidden Gem in Perfect Location,"I have stayed at The Stafford  at least half a dozen times, including using it as home base for friends and family when my daughter got married in London last year.  The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and spotless.  The staff goes above and beyond to offer impeccable service. The American Bar is an inviting and cozy spot for drinks and casual fare. The Game Bird has wonderful fine dining, and the flower-filled back courtyard is a private oasis for relaxing. In short, i cannot rave enough about The Stafford.",5,2019,05,15
142,"Beautiful Hotel, Perfect Location, Excellent Staff!","Beautiful hotel at St. James Place. Staff is extremely accommodating, the rooms are pretty, comfortable beds, and very clean. Ned Holder in guest relations contacted us before our stay offering his assistant for anything we required for our stay and welcomed us in person when we arrived. Charlie, their doorman, is a gem! If you want suggestions for interesting things to do and see, Charlie is your man! He gave us the best recommendations along with directions and interesting points of interest along the way. The hotel has its own pub, ""The American Bar"" which is both historic and lovely; you'll find a beautiful and classic interior along with outdoor tables in their pretty courtyard. This hotel was perfect for our first trip to London!",5,2019,05,15
142,"Great Staff, Location, Restaurant & Bar!","The staff at The Stafford is one of the best I have experienced.  The guest manager Ned emailed us ahead of our trip and asked if we had any special needs, he greeted us as we arrived 4 hours early before check-in, and our room was ready after having a cup of coffee in the restaurant.  The concierge was friendly providing maps, advice, and directions.  Everyone was very friendly and made us feel welcome.  The hotel is a block away from Picadilly and a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Trigalgar Square.  The rooms were comfortable, but the AC controls were a bit slow to respond.  The Gamebird restaurant was excellent and the American Bar is a neat bar to have right there in your own hotel.  Overall, we had a great stay at The Stafford",5,2019,05,12
142,Stafford is a home away from home!,My Mum has been staying here for over 10 years and I have been lucky to be with her on most of these visits.  Most recently I was there with my daughter.  I love this place and I feel like I am staying at someone's home versus in a big luxury hotel.  The breakfast is amazing.  The lobster mac and cheese is amazing.  Everyone is so friendly and go out of their way to help you.  On another visit in January 2019 my daughter had food poisoning and the staff went out of their way to see what she needed and how we could help.  I can't recommend this place enough.,5,2019,05,07
142,Perfect Location and Exceptional Staff,"My husband and I spent two weeks in London in a Deluxe King Room in the main building of this hotel. We loved it! Everyone who works there from the doorman, to the porters, the front desk staff, the housekeeping staff, and those who work in the restaurant and bar are extremely friendly, professional, respectful, courteous, and helpful. They all made us feel at home and wanted to ensure that our every desire was satisfied. For this reason alone we would stay here again.

Charlie, a doorman at this hotel for more than 20 years, is especially helpful and acts as an ambassador for the hotel, helping guests to understand all that the hotel has to offer. He can assist with things to see, directions, almost anything that you want to know.

The location of this hotel is ideal. It is perfectly central to anything that you want to see or do, with many key tourist attractions within close walking distance. It is also less than a five minute walk to the nearest Tube station. 

Our room was representative of 19th century living. The furnishings were a bit old and the room was decorated in colors of a Victorian-age English garden. I enjoyed it but my husband thought it was a bit dowdy. The bathroom was a decent size and everything was covered in marble. Great water pressure in the shower. Plenty of space in the room for clothing. Nespresso machine. Daily newspaper. Continually replaced bottled water. Adjustable heat. Hair dryer, and a converter in case you forgot your own.

The American Bar is a wonderful place to enjoy cocktails and a light meal. There is a charming outdoor courtyard if you are here on a good weather day. There is also The Game Bird restaurant which has a wonderful menu and the best scallops that we've ever tasted. The only issue that I had with the restaurant is that people walk right through it to get to the bar. That seemed odd for such a nice restaurant, but I think it is all that they could do considering the layout of the old buildings. Not a worry though, you will still enjoy the restaurant.

Definitely try this hotel. It is located on a quiet street in an upscale neighborhood instead of a loud and busy area. After a hectic day in busy London, you will appreciate this change of pace. They also provide a website to pick you type of bedding, pillows, and various other options to personalize your stay for your comfort. A truly wonderful hotel near many good restaurants and brasseries.",5,2019,05,06
142,Utterly Amazing!,"I have stayed in many hotels in London in the past 5 years including Claridge's, the Dorchester and the Connaught and The Stafford is by far my favorite!  First and foremost in the staff.  They are just amazing when it comes to service and making you feel that you are their most important guest.  After checkin, I was greeted by name by every staff member at all times.  Even when arriving back at 1:30am.  The location cannot be beat.  Every morning starts with a run or walk in Green Park and a nod to Buckingham Palace.  However, the hotel itself in tucked away in a mews that keeps the hustle and bustle away from your doorstep.  A short walk and you are at Fortnum and Mason and Trafalgar Square.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and the restaurant is worthy of a visit even if you are not staying at the Stafford.  The morning breakfast buffet is outstanding and they even have a lovely courtyard in the back for drinks and lunch!  When planning this last trip, we contacted the concierge desk for theatre tickets and reservations and Frank, Peter and Jack performed miracles and even got us into the Harry Potter Studios which had been sold out for weeks!  The Stafford is a GLORIOUS hotel if you like quality, service and luxury.  We have already booked another stay in September!",5,2019,05,01
142,Quintessentially London!,"I found this hotel to be the perfect location to explore London from. The service and style were wonderful, and a great value for a 5 star experience. The St. John's neighborhood is so historic, I also highly recommend the London Walks tour that basically circles the hotel.

There's a little alleyway across from the entrance that leads to green park. This is the magic gateway to the tube station, Piccadilly, and Buckingham palace.",5,2019,04,29
142,"Perfect Location,  Excellent Experience","The best location to have as home base in London.  Fabulous Afternoon Tea and hearty full breakfasts.  Felt so pampered and cared for.  Beautiful accommodations, immaculate, wonderfully appointed.  Excellent bed, alot of space to relax and recharge. Love the Floris Amenities. Massive bathroom with long bathtub and large separate shower.",5,2019,04,23
142,I love this hotel!,"This was our second visit to the Stafford. It is ideally situated in a quiet location between St James Street and Green Park. We arrived on a cold grey morning in March, tired from the long haul from Australia. We were immediately made to feel welcome by the friendly staff and given coffee by a cosy fire while our room was made ready. The atmosphere somehow manages to be sophisticated yet homely and very English. The restaurant is excellent, especially the smoked salmon trolley. I would never stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2019,04,20
142,Wonderful,"My partner booked an overnight stay at the Stafford as a birthday treat. And what a treat it was!!!  What a truly wonderful hotel, marvellous staff, wonderfully located.  Great bar, fab breakfast and our room exceptional.   Made my birthday all that bit special.  Thank you ",5,2019,04,20
142,Recent stay,I have been coming here for years and I never fail to enjoy my stay. the staff are friendly and efficient..I have always stayed in a Carriage House  room and they have recently been upgraded. I admit I preferred the old American Bar but the new one makes dining a better experience. The new restaurant is excellent and well worth “eating in”.,5,2019,04,20
142,A truly special stay for a special occasion,"I cannot fault our recent stay at The Stafford. My partner and I were in London for him to receive an award, and I booked this hotel to make our trip particularly memorable. It is difficult to describe how impressed I was with every aspect of our stay without resorting to cliched hyperbole. 
After making our booking I was contacted in advance of our stay by Mr Holder, the Guest Relations Manager. He enquired whether there was anything he could do to help with our time in London. Mr Holder is the most courteous and professional person I have ever encountered in any aspect of hospitality. He struck exactly the right balance of being attentive without being obsequious and facilitated many extraordinary elements of our stay. As one tangible example of the attention to detail the staff at The Stafford pay, when we came back from the award ceremony we found in our room a card congratulating my partner on his award, as well as a stencilled outline in chocolate of the emblem of the awarding establishment on a decorative platter, accompanied by some handmade chocolate truffles.
We were upgraded to a suite - the room was incredibly comfortable and spacious. We had lunch in the restaurant on our first day where the food was delicious, and a few drinks in The American Bar. 
What really marks The Stafford out is the staff. The welcome we were given by everybody felt warm and genuine, with courteous, caring approaches from everybody regardless of whether they were room keeping, front of house, in the restaurants or bars or just encountered out and about. This hotel really does represent the absolute best in British hospitality, and it has its staff to thank for that. If you want to feel genuinely cared about and welcomed in beautiful, luxurious surroundings, then I cannot think of anywhere better than this hotel.",5,2019,04,14
142,"High end, high price, poor food, environmentally deaf","We expectged a lot from this place.  The location is great for sight-seeing and walking. Our (42 pound per person) breakfast was included, BUT my poached egg was raw, the omelette too salty to eat,,,, the towels were chamged every time we touched one - no request to recycle. Our room was good, exceppt for the 3 steps up to the bathroom which made it difficult for someone with a cane. The staff were friendly.",3,2019,04,14
142,Stafford Service Excels...,"I can’t say enough about the entire staff at this hotel; just top notch from the morning restaurant staff at the Gamebird to the nighttime staff at The American Bar, they know what good service is all about. Of course it would be complete without the staff at the front desk who are so responsive and accommodating. And the bellman (I.e.,  Charlie, Modestas, etc.) are so friendly every time I visit. Cheers to the entire team!",5,2019,04,13
142,Absolutely perfect for our family trip to London!,"Just back from a wonderful trip to London with my husband and our two young children (4 & 5 years old).  The Stafford was perfect in every way - a spacious and comfortable room, friendly and accommodating staff, and an ideal location close to many of the places we wanted to visit.  The interior design is spectacular, with lovely wallpaper, window treatments, and so many small details that made for an extremely comfortable stay.

We arrived in the morning after an overnight flight from the US and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready for check-in.  Throughout our stay, the staff was extremely helpful in suggesting plans - especially things that were child-friendly - and making everyone feel welcome.  We especially appreciated a basket of thoughtfully selected books, puzzles, and games that the staff gave to our children - it was a highlight of their trip! 

The location is ideal - right on Green Park and just a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and St. James's Park.  We will definitely return to the Stafford for future visits!",5,2019,04,11
142,Great place to stay in the Heart of London,"We had a marvelous experience staying at the Stafford Hotel.  The staff was very attentive, from James who checked us in and gave us a tour of the hotel, to Charlie the doorman, who insured that we had the transportation we needed when we needed it.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  It felt like a home rather than a hotel.",5,2019,04,09
142,Magnificent short overnight stay in London,"The staff whether on the front desk, bar, or front of house cannot do more for you, everything is expertly handled.

Charlie on the door makes the arrival with your car and luggage so seamless that you relax the minute you draw up.He is a wonderful Ambassador for the hotel",5,2019,04,05
142,"Fabulous, Lovely Hotel","From the moment we arrived the service was beyond impeccable!  Absolutely beautiful, utterly charming hotel.  Our room was in the mews, a junior suite with a huge bathroom. The staff was most attentive and helpful and the breakfasts are not to be missed. Close to everything and I loved it!  Can't wait to return to this wonderful place....",5,2019,03,26
142,Elegant homely hotel with an excellent service,"We had an amazing four nights at the Stafford. The very friendly staff, the cosy atmosphere, the beautiful rooms, the delicious cocktails at the American bar are just a few of the reasons why this place has now become our hotel of choice in London.",5,2019,03,20
142,Coming Home,"I have been coming here for many, many years which, I admit, gives me a bias. But I haven’t been for a while and so I claim some degree of perspective!

It remains the most charming, friendly but exceptionally professional hotel I know. From the welcome outside to reception, the American Bar and the Game Bird restaurant everyone makes you feel ‘at home’. We are in a lovely Mews Junior Suite which is spacious and really well fitted but have stayed many times in rooms in the main house which are also fabulous.

This is not a cheap hotel so if price is your main driver this may not be for you. But if quality, location, charm and exemplary service are what you’re after then you should have The Stafford high on your list.

142,The always delightful Stafford.,"Without doubt, the most friendly, comfortable, homely ""5 Star"" in London. Perfectly situated and central, yet quiet and peaceful. Lovely to see a group of Chelsea Pensioners in full regalia enjoying the hotel's hospitality in the restaurant !",5,2019,03,13
142,Amazing Hotel,Nice welcome gift! Great breakfast & so close to everything. Rooms are nice size. Friendly staff. American Bar is nice but a bit pricey. I would not stay anywhere else. Our travel agent booked us here but I will definitely be back when in London. ,5,2019,03,10
142,Perfect,"This is our no.1 choice for a London stay.  The staff are friendly and professional, the hotel is in a perfect location just a couple of minutes from Green Park Tube.  The rooms, as you would expect, are spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated.  The breakfast is one of the best we've had in an hotel.  This stay was for my husbands 50th Birthday and we were thoroughly spoilt with an upgrade as well as a bottle of champagne left in our room on our return from dinner.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend.  Always delivers and service is above and beyond expectations.  Thank you again for a wonderful stay.",5,2019,03,08
142,Fantastic stay ,"I booked 3 nights at The Stafford as a surprise trip for my husbands 40th. The location looked great (right by Green Park tube), and the photos and reviews were all very positive. 

Within a few moments of arriving I knew I had made the right choice. Our whole stay was perfect.

On the run up to our arrival I was contacted by the hotel to check if we had any questions etc. I thought I would take the opportunity to confirm with the head of guest relations Ned that we would be ok to drop our bags off early as our flight got into London at 8.30am and I knew check in was 3pm. A speedy reply from Ned told me not to worry, and in fact when we arrived at 9.30am the lovely lady on reception was able to check us in and even advised we had been upgraded to a beautiful suite in the mews house. On arrival in our new home from home my husbands face was a picture, the room was stunning. The bed was big and comfy (like a giant marshmallow), powerful shower and huge bath. A kettle and coffee machine, along with a decent hairdryer, etc. Everything we needed. 

We visited the bar a couple of times at the hotel. On the Saturday night it was buzzing with the waiting staff producing incredible looking cocktails, and a little giddy we ordered 2 each before dinner. They were gorgeous, and beautifully presented. 

Sunday was my husbands 40th birthday and I had requested a small chocolate cake with Happy Birthday in my emails to the ever helpful Ned. We returned to the room for my husband to discover his chocolate cake which made his day. It was delicious and reception kindly arranged for it to be boxed up so we could take the rest home.

I honestly can’t fault this hotel, it’s in a great location, everything is very comfortable, and it’s greatest asset is the staff who really do make the effort to make your stay special. We loved it and can’t wait to “come home” again. ",5,2019,03,05
142,Best Service in town,"We stayed in two nice junior suits ( an upgrade from the hotel, we reseved kingsize rooms). The service and the breakfest was extraordinary good, as well as the Cocktails were. 
Welldone everybody
We will come back",5,2019,03,05
142,EXCELLENT!,"first of all the five stars reviews are spot on. A Boutique Hotel which makes you feel very comfortable and very well pampered. The staff are excellent and the food both for breakfast and in the Game bird restaurant is superb.
highly recommended and looking forward to my next visit.",5,2019,03,05
142,Excellent as always,"Always a lovely experience to stay at The Stafford and our recent trip was excellent as always. Great room, which was a surprise upgrade, and beautiful breakfasts. Such friendly helpful staff who always go the extra mile. The location could not be better and the cul de sac setting makes for a quiet night’s sleep. We have stayed at many five star hotels in London but this is our favourite.",5,2019,03,05
142,Simply wonderful,"I happened to arrive in London on my birthday, and the staff must have noted this when I presented my identification at check in, because shortly after I settled into my room I was surprised by a knock on my door.  A friendly staff member had brought birthday cake to my room.  This set the tone for my entire stay at The Stafford -- the hotel was an absolute delight in every way.  The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious, immaculate, and quiet, the bed was the most comfortable I've experienced in my travels and the service from the employees is impeccable.  I will definitely return soon!",5,2019,03,03
142,Anniversary,"We loved the experience as a whole! Special amenities for our anniversary and a lovely service from James, Freya and Lorenzo. The room was situated in the courtyard are with a lovely cosy feel to it. Housekeeping really went the extra mile to look after us. We adored the breakfast with a wide selection on the buffet including a chef who can help with cheese selections, serano ham and fresh bread selections. Can’t wait to visit again!",5,2019,02,27
142,Stunner in all ways,"My arrival experience began with a friendly face welcoming me even before I got out of the taxi out front. The service here is exemplary. Personalized, caring and highly vigilant and the room was absolutely perfect. Lavishly appointed with gorgeous amenities, it was comfortable and the bedding provided one of the best night’s sleep I’ve had in a long while. Great location as well and I’ll certainly return!",5,2019,02,26
142,The Stafford Hotel is the best,"Although we started off a bit poorly because we had requested early check in (had offered to pay for an extra night and the person making the booking had recommended not doing that but rather using an ""early check in"" option-which we discovered upon arrival did not exist), the hotel staff were amazing from that moment on.  They moved as quickly as possible to get our suite ready and then made sure that every day we felt welcome and pampered (with notes left in the room with fruit bowls, wine, a Sudoku book -because they saw that we played Sudoku-chocolates and sweets and on the last day--a tray with all kinds of snacks for our trip home. The rooms by the way are beautiful (we stayed in the antique section).  
The breakfast is delicious and top-notch. The wait staff are gracious and responsive. And one morning when we had an early tour, the staff whipped us up two boxes with muffins and bananas in a flash.  
The American Bar is also just lovely.  We recommend the octopus appetizer and  2 entrees that we really loved: codfish and filet mignon.  They also have great and unusual drinks.
Lastly, the staff at the door are always ready to help with taxis, recommendations, and are incredibly friendly. During our last minutes, we had a wonderful chat with a young doorman who is from Lithuania (unfortunately, I missed his name).   
And if this were not enough of a reason to stay at the Stafford, its location is perfect!  Walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the Eye of London, etc.  We will definitely stay at the Stafford the next time we are in London.",5,2019,02,25
142,Home from Home!,"Returning to The Stafford and being greeted with “welcome home” from all of the staff always brings a smile, it never fails, its like being a part of the family!
Quintessential English attention to detail, beautifully understated and underpinned with a few great Italians. From arrival to departure, you cannot fault The Stafford or ‘the family’ that make it happen. I can't mention you all, but from Dani and Marianna, Susana at breakfast, Salvatore in the American Bar, Gino the very best sommelier in The Stafford and probably the world............thank you one and all!
Can’t wait to ‘go’ home again!!
",5,2019,02,25
142,Engagement trip of a lifetime!,"The Stafford London is an absolutely amazing hotel in central London that exceeded my expectations in every way. My fiance and I spent our engagement weekend there and we will treasure those memories forever. The hotel delivered superbly on all the basics - central yet secluded location, luxuriously appointed rooms, impeccable customer service from everyone, from the doorman to the guest relations manager. It also had a ton of charm - a beautiful courtyard with flowers blooming in the spring and summer, a regal English restaurant onsite with excellent food, and a casual but classy American bar. We threw our engagement party at the American Bar and it was a huge success. Everyone complimented the venue and the service. My sincere thanks to Ned, Charlie, Lovisa, Freya, Andrea, and everyone who made this the stay of a lifetime. I can't recommend it enough.",5,2019,02,23
142,Such a lovely stay,"Upon suggestion by my cousin, who's a regular guest at the Stafford, I decided to visit for the night with my mother. We booked a deluxe room in the main building, which was beautiful.  Having arrived at the hotel quite late we decided to enjoy a nice glass of champagne in the lounge of the game bird restaurant and we were lucky to have a nice table near the fire place. The atmosphere is so warm and relaxing at the hotel. The waiter who looked after us and was very friendly yet professional and attentive.
The room was elegant with a classic English charm to it. The beds and bedding were absolutely divine!!! The turndown service in the evening is always such a lovely touch.
Breakfast was one of the highlights of our stay, a wonderful buffet as well as a full menu of cooked dishes. Service was perfect. 
When we checked out the reception remembered our name, which as it was the first time we have stayed there made us feel right at home and part of the family. 
We can't wait to come back to the Stafford! We will recommend to everyone.",5,2019,02,20
142,Another amazing stay,"Another stay at The Stafford, another perfect stay. The American Bar has been refurbished but the atmosphere is still there, even Benoît, the Bar Manager, is still around! The Game Bird is busy in the evening, serving some excellent dishes, I would recommend the Duck Wellington! I had a chance to have a lovely upgrade, big thank you to the entire team and the boss for the feeling at « Home » sensation! ",5,2019,02,18
142,Stafford like amazing ...,"
Stafford London, the perfect translation of English style.
Ideal and Francy place for a special stay in St. James.
Elegant, comfortable in Classic English style, where a family air breathes, thanks to all the hotel staff ready to provide an excellent service.
Stafford offers the possibility of dipping in a second in the blasphemers of shopping or Green Park green.
Buckingham Palace is two steps away.
Enchanting with all the comforts, perfect style with the rest of the hotel.
Great breakfast at the game bird, served by a small army ready to satisfy your need and make you comfortable.
The American bar, immersed in an atmosphere that was obvious, with style and tranquility, with a look you can find in the States, caps, helmets, and many other objects hanging and at the same time in the Old England, wisdom and style balance.
I had the pleasure of meeting Salvatore, the Bartender that advised a ""quality choice among the many cocktails of the chart, very friendly guy.
Amazing the Dehors, diving in the hotel yard, between the classic carriage house and modern apartment.
Thanks to all the Stafford Hotel staff... A place to go back soon.",5,2019,02,18
142,A Real Gem,"We stayed at the Stafford for 2 nights in the main house. This was our second visit having stayed before Christmas on my nephew's recommendation. It is an oasis of calm in the capital. The ethos is that, while resident, this is your home. The staff are friendly and helpful, always greeting you with a smile, attentive yet not  overly familiar. This starts at the front door with Charlie and his colleagues who cannot be more helpful. He sets the tone for the rest of the team. 
The decor is comfortable country house that is immaculately maintained and decorated and the bedrooms are spacious with top quality bed linen, marble bathroom and every facility that you would expect from a hotel of this standing. 
Breakfast is taken in the Gamebird Restaurant and cannot be faulted. The best quality ingredients cooked to order and again run like clockwork by Susie and her team of waiters. The only hotel breakfast that has met this standard in my experience was at The Lygon Arms in Broadway, when it was part of the Savoy Group. We also dined at the Gamebird on our first night. The food was sublime and the whole experience memorable. Lobster and Crayfish Cocktail, Duck Breast Wellington sliced at the table and served with Confit of Duck. We would normally have stopped there but could not resist the puddings. I had a slice of Rhubarb and Custard Tart with Ginger Ice Cream and my wife chose the Blood Orange Baked Alaska which was flambeed with Cointreau at the table. While the waiting team were friendly, efficient and surprisingly unobtrusive they provided theatre with with their skilful service serving the Wellington and the flambeed Alaska which impressed us and our fellow diners. 
Congratulations to Stuart and his Team who prove, on a daily basis, that excellent standards of hospitality can be delivered without either being stuffy or standing on ceremony. The first excuse we can find for us to go to London and you will see us again.",5,2019,02,16
142,Fantastic stay!,"Stayed for 4 nights in one of the carriage house rooms which face towards the courtyard, you can tell the rooms have just been renovated and have a lovely country feel to them. 
The breakfast in the Game bird was really enjoyable and the service was brilliant. 
We even enjoyed a quick drink in the American bar before heading to bed and the cocktails were on point. 

I'll definitely stay at The Stafford again in the future.",5,2019,02,15
142,Nic e Hotel in London,"Really enjoyed staying at The Stafford.  Very cosy room, and great facilities. Te fitness centre has good equipment and enough space.
American Bar provided a great sandwich for a lunchtime.
Breakfast was leisurely and lots of choice.
Would certainly stay here again",5,2019,02,15
142,Lousy experience,"I stayed in the original building. The room's heating system was not working. I asked for a room with proper heating. They could have given me a room in the adjoining modern building but chose not to do so. Instead I was given two space heaters which worked fine but made the air very dry. I complained to the manager on duty that a five star hotel should have given me a room with proper heating. Obviously they did not choose to do that.The manager's response was when I said I was being given three star treatment was just to stare at me. The cooked breakfast was less than perfect. A lady from South Carolina sitting near me sent her poached eggs back to the kitchen twice! On business, I stay all over the world in all types of hotels with all types of ratings. My experience at this place soured me on it. You may like the English charm of the place but frankly management's attitude I find appalling for a hotel of this ranking.",2,2019,02,07
142,Weekend in London ,"Stayed at this lovely hotel again and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful room in the old stables .
Lots aid character with all the amenities.

Went to the newly refurbed American Bar and the new look is Fab.

Had a lovely cocktail and a bar food , and the while evening was well above par !

Thanks so much to the great staff who made us all feel so welcome as always from concierge , reception , bar staff .. all could not be more helpful 

Best
RH ",5,2019,02,05
142,Great Stay in a Great Location,"We stayed 6 days at the hotel and were impressed with every detail.  The staff could not have been friendlier or more attentive.  The room was very comfortable and we particularly appreciated the individual room thermostat.  
This is a true first class hotel that is centrally located and within easy walking distance to major attraction.  It is also only a 5 minute walk to the Underground.",5,2019,01,31
142,Celebration!,"We were delighted to be able to stay at this wonderful hotel. From the moment that we approached the front door, we were greeted with a smile. Every single member of staff, from Charlie the doorman, Daniele at Reception, Lev the Concierge, James, who showed us to our marvellous room in the Mews, housekeeping staff who took care of our every need, looked after us with genuine kindness and courtesy. 
Our room was beautiful, elegantly furnished with all amenities and spotlessly clean. I particularly liked the ‘night light’ feature which dimmed the bathroom lights during the night. An excellent idea! 
We had the pleasure of meeting friends in The American Bar and were looked after by Andrea and enjoyed a really lovely evening. 
One of my favourite meals of the day is breakfast- and we certainly were not disappointed. Beautiful and elegant surroundings, with excellent service and one of the best breakfasts that I’ve enjoyed in a hotel - beautifully presented, served properly and tasted delicious. What more could you ask for? 
I would certainly recommend this wonderful hotel. It’s in an excellent position to explore London and all that it has to offer and I will look forward to returning as soon as possible. 
Thank you to all involved in making our celebration weekend one that we won’t forget!",5,2019,01,30
142,London’s best hotel,This hotel is excellent. The staff are really well trained and attentive but not over fussy. Lovely rooms. Great restaurant and bar. A bit old fashioned maybe but that gives it character. Overall it has to be the best hotel in London. ,5,2019,01,23
142,My Favorite London Hotel,"The Stanford is a small, elegant hotel in walking distance to most of central London and right near a tube station. The rooms are elegant and well equipped for travelers. Breakfast and tea time are worth going to, typically English and perfectly prepared. I can’t say enough about the staff: friendly, helpful, making your stay as pleasant as possible. It feels like a home away from home, only better. I would suggest you book through the hotel reservations. ",5,2019,01,23
142,Hidden gem - Quiet stay in the centre of London,"I stayed one night in the Mews Junior Suite, which was excellent. Room and bathroom is very spacious, beds are comforable and the room lovely decorated, very cosy. We felt at home immediately. Amenities are from Floris and complimentary coffee and water in the room. We had breakfast at the Gamebird which was excellent. Anything you can imagine for a lovely breakfast.
What is really unique for this hidden gem is the location. In a quite little street in fancy Mayfair you have all main sightseeing points in walking distance and an undisturbed sleep. All the staff was extremely nice and helpful. 
All in all a flawless experience which we would definitely recommend. Hope to return soon.",5,2019,01,22
142,Extremely relaxed and very friendly. ,"We stayed one night on 16th Jan. The whole atmosphere extremely relaxed and staff could not have been more accommodating and helpful. All this in a quiet courtyard setting a minutes walk from Piccadilly. We are certainly looking forward to returning soon, when next in London. Thank you all. ",5,2019,01,21
142,Heaven in London -,"My husband and I stayed at the Stafford between Christmas and New Years 2018 and it was a perfect vacation. Due to an overnight flight, we arrived insanely early, but we were made very comfortable in the lounge while they prepared our room for an early check-in. We were upgraded to a large and beautiful suite complete with a Christmas tree and complimentary wine!  Every member of the hotel, bar and restaurant staff treated us warmly and even remembered our names and the smallest preferences (like water with every cocktail). We loved the American Bar and the heated courtyard where my husband could enjoy a cigar each evening. Breakfast at the Game Bird was included in our package and it was exceptional – fresh fruit, cheeses, pastries and pretty much anything you requested cooked to order. Dinners in the Game Bird were so delicious (and expertly served) that we ate there all but one evening. Don’t leave without trying the Chicken Kiev!  The wine list is amazing, and we particularly enjoyed our private tour of the Stafford’s historic wine cellar. And the bedding - I never wanted  get up – Egyptian Cotton?! I can’t say enough about the Stafford. Perfect location, knowledgeable, warm and gracious staff, beautiful rooms with every amenity and exceptional food.  It’s a perfect oasis in London. We can’t wait to return.",5,2019,01,16
142,More than a hotel,"We always go to London at Christmas time.
This time we choose to stay at The Stafford. The staff was friendly and correct and we had an upgrade at once. We had a junior suitee in the old and charming stables. This was so amazing and fresh and lovely decorated. Spacious and with  an open fireplace. We had roomservice at breakfast every morning and this was so fantastic! Most dinners in evening we had booked at The Gamebird and this was an outstanding experience in world class. The staff was very attendant and so caring about everything and the food was in top class! Afterwards we went to The American Bar with so much history, you will be amazed! All in all the best stay we have had in London plus the perfect location. We will come back next Christmas for sure!
",5,2019,01,16
142,Week end a londres,"We had the opportunity to spend a week end in London, and to stay in this hotel. 
The location is really practical, near green park and very next to the fabulous Buckingham palace.
The lobby of the hotel is very welcoming and the staff was great!
The bedroom that we had was at the first floor, with a good size, very clean. The bed was good, royal! 
The breakfast is made with good products, a lot of choice!
As we said in our comment at the end of the stay, it could be nice to renew some things in the bedroom ( carpet, furnitures in the bathroom..) to make it even more remarkable!",5,2019,01,15
142,"Simply, divine","I spent a week at the Stafford with my husband and teenage daughter between Christmas and New Years. From the moment we checked in until we left, everything was wonderful. Our suite was beautiful - and included a Christmas tree! Suzanna in the Game Bird restaurant greeted us with attentiveness and grace each morning and Dani at the front desk answered all questions with thoroughness and care. I cannot express what a wonderful experience it was to stay at the Stafford. We will return happily whenever we go to London!",5,2019,01,13
142,Poor check in/out didn’t spoil a lovely weekend,"Recently spent a couple of nights with my wife at The Stafford in London - a special Christmas treat. Booking process was simple and confirmed with an email that also checked what type of pillows we wanted and asked if it was a special occasion. Nice touch. 
Check in went ok until I was asked for my passport - something a British national would be unlikely to carry on a trip to London. When I said i didn’t have it, I was told I needed to produce some ID. Again I didn’t have anything with me other than my credit cards. Commenting I thought this was an unusual request, I was rebuked by the sniffy receptionist who said it was hotel policy to ask for everyone’s passport or ID!! Thankfully they let us stay - even though I couldn’t produce any documents - and we went to our room feeling like we’d been ticked off.
Room was pleasant if unremarkable - the bed and pillows were comfortable and although I thought the room a little small, it was beautifully furnished. Breakfast was excellent and the service impeccable - just as you’d expect in a 5* establishment. 
Major fly in the ointment came at check-out - distinctly sub-standard. Nobody at reception when we tried to leave at 08.30 and despite pointing out to the doorman we wanted to pay and go, he couldn’t find anyone. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity and I was about walk out, someone graced us with their presence and relieved my credit card of almost a thousand pounds. Unfortunately they couldn’t print me an invoice or receipt, instead offering to email it to me. So 5* prices but distinctly not 5* service.
Rated this review at 3 due to the poor check in/out experiences. If we’d checked in/out with ease, would have been a 4 rating. 
And I’m still awaiting my receipt via email!",3,2019,01,12
142,Auxiliary staff are BORED and BOORISH,"This is a top-rated, top-priced hotel, therefore there should be NO failings.
 So how about a doorman who never greets his guests, reads his cellphone while excuding boredom while he opens the door, or talks thru his guest's ears to a compatriot across the hall? --- NOT an aberration, happened every time this moron was on duty. 
Or Housekeeping who performed the full variety of failings over a stay of 8 days --- missed the room entirely one day, came in without knocking one evening, failed to clearout used cups and glasses on two occasions.
    Or management, who knew we were arriving early, fed us continual 'will-be-ready-soon' messages, then magically opened up the room only PRECISELY at the duly appointed normal hour of 3pm -- this is NEVER coincidence, and for a long stay guest, not an auspicious start.  

As a frequent visitor to London, I've stayed in many hotels better than this, and wont return here.",2,2019,01,12
142,Simply Wonderful,"If you're looking for a stay with understated luxury and impeccable service in London, this is it. I stayed at The Stafford in early January and loved every minute of it. Everything from drinks at The American Bar to housekeeping was excellent. The hotel is also in an great location - right in Central London but next to the open fields of Green Park. Loved it and will definitely be coming back!",5,2019,01,11
142,Perfection!,"The Stafford is a simply wonderful hotel in London.  The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms are very comfortable, well-appointed, and quiet.  The location is absolutely ideal -- near many key attractions, yet tucked away on a side street, so extremely quiet and private.  And the dining options are excellent.  I would not hesitate to recommend the Stafford to anyone and I can't wait to return.",5,2019,01,09
142,Post-Christmas London Trip,Very wonderful traditional hotel located right in the heart of London.  The staff was great and the American Bar is a cannot miss.  Daily breakfast was well worth it.  Concierge helped immensely with lost bags and logistics around London.  Rooms were nice sized and well set up for our family.,5,2019,01,09
142,Excellent experience,"I have read some of the recent reviews of the Stafford Hotel and I agree with those who said it is an excellent choice-elegant, well located, attentive staff, lovely dining and fun bar scene--I was there with a theatre group and we were well accommodated-my room was small but well-appointed and comfortable-even had a walk-in shoer which I really appreciated!",5,2019,01,09
142,Wonderful hotel,"We started with dinner at the Stafford's restaurant (Game Bird), and enjoyed the experience so much that we decided to check out of the hotel we were in and move to the Stafford.  We are glad that we did.  It is a beautiful hotel, small enough to feel intimate and exclusive, but large enough to provide all the comforts of a full-size hotel.  The service is impeccable, and the location couldn't be better.",5,2019,01,09
142,Old World Charm,"A fantastic hotel in Central London which exudes old world charm but has all mod cons, excellent friendly service. Make sure to visit the American Bar (It seems to be undergoing some small renovations) outdoor seating is available",5,2019,01,08
142,Truly English Feel,"This was our second stay at the Stafford and it wont be our last (coming back in June). Service from Housekeeping to the managers (particularly James Fleming) was outstanding. Breakfast, although pricey which is normal at this category of Hotel, was delicious. The American bar also had great service and amazing cocktails (although 21 Pounds for a cocktail is a bit much). Love the Stafford!",5,2019,01,07
142,Outstanding Service in a Fabulous Hotel,"The Stafford Hotel was an absolute delight. I was completely impressed by the level of customer service. The staff are personable and helpful. The hotel itself was stunning and the perfect place to stay in a superb location. The room was incredibly comfortable and the breakfast was perfect. A huge thank you to all that made our stay fabulous, especially Ned - I’ve not met such a welcoming and conscientious member of staff. I would recommend a stay here to everyone.",5,2019,01,06
142,Just GREAT!,"Stayed in December and it was a true Christmas treat! Great room, great amenities, great staff, great location...just GREAT! Plus beautifully decorated Christmas trees wherever I looked - including in my room where a little tree was on the desk. I’ve been to London many times and can honestly recommend this hotel to one and all. ",5,2019,01,03
142,Gorgeous Xmas stay,"I have been spending time in London during the holidays for years and did not know about the quietly placed and absolutely gorgeous Stafford. Everything you want in a small luxiury hotel.

Restaurant and bars with xmas trees and decorations everywhere were just divine. 

Fun drinks on the terrace out back too. Be sure to reserve if you are a large group and want to be outside.",5,2018,12,31
142,Truly the Best Hotel in London!,"I've stayed many times at The Stafford -- but none were as special as the week during Christmas.  

The hotel was beautifully decorated with Christmas trees, ribbons, candles, and greenery - including a small tree in our room.  The superb General Manager Stuart Procter and his family hosted a wonderful Christmas eve carol concert in the historic wine cellar, with choristers from a nearby church, mulled wine, and roasted chestnuts.  We didn't join the torch-lit procession to celebrate midnight mass at a nearby church, as the Concierge Team somehow had managed to arrange tickets for us for midnight mass at Westminster Abbey.  As we got back to our room around 1:30 am on Christmas, we discovered The Stafford Santa had delivered some surprise presents, including Tom Parker Bowles new cookbook!

We stayed for the first time in the renovated Carriage House rooms facing the cobbled courtyard - gorgeously comfortable and chic, with a fantastic bathroom. I also love the traditional rooms in the Main House and the large suites in the Mews Building, but there was something particularly delightful about staying in a luxe 380 year old carriage house.

All of this Christmas cheer was on top of the always brilliant service of The Stafford.  Stuart has a great team - Thanks Mark Surguy and James Fleming for taking such good care of us; Ben Provost for the humming American Bar (and the new negroni menu); Ben Tish, Luca, Ricky, and the Game Bird staff for superb food; and Brett Tidy, Modestus, John, and the whole concierge team for making everything happen, particularly during the busy holiday season.

There are many great hotels in London -- but The Stafford is a very special gem.  See you in 2019!",5,2018,12,28
142,What a treat!,"Had the most lovely stay catching up with an old friend. The most comfy beds....struggled to get up in time for breakfast, but so worth it. Great location but so quiet it's hard to believe it is in central London. Staff all very attentive and helpful, and it has a real  homely feel. Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2018,12,23
142,A little gem,"We just had a one night stay in London for a Christmas catch up and the Stafford was the highlight. From the wonderfully helpful staff, to the great ambience, and the luxury home from home feel, it was perfect. To cap it all the breakfast delivered to our room was delicious. 
A truly relaxing break in the heart of London, it’s hard to imagine a better place to stay. We will be back, hopefully for longer next time.",5,2018,12,22
142,Elegant and Traditional ~ Welcoming and Informal,"We enjoyed a divine experience at The Stafford Hotel.The Mews Suite was absolutely remarkable with bedding that was completely sick! Duck down duvets, white duck down pillows and welsh wollen blankets covered a bed that was SO clean and comfortable you almost wont get up! Dual sinks with marble basins and floors,sunken bathtub and separate waterfall shower was purely beautiful in the spacious bathroom. After exploring the local area with Green Park less than 1 minute away, you could return to your room, relax and choose from an extensive movie selection on TV. Because of the extraordinary emphasis The Stafford sets on customer service,there are not many ""DIY"" opportunities like retrieving your own Ice or late night pantry snacks and the like, but the mini bar does offer some small bites. This superb property sets a very high bar and has not lost its ambition to maintain high standards among the newer trending hospitality options emerging throughout London. The Stafford was quite enjoyable and quiet and nicely tucked away from the immediate noise and bustle of Piccadilly.",5,2018,12,18
142,Green Parks Hidden Gem,"I have worked in the vicinity of Green Park for the past 4 years and had no idea that this gem of a hotel existed. I only discovered it when my husband booked a nights stay to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary as a surprise. It's a short walk from Green Park station in the heart of  St James, centrally located and within easy walking distance of many major London attractions. Check in was very efficient and all the staff very welcoming and knowledgeable.

The hotel is smaller than many of its 5 star counterparts but all the better for it. Our room was wonderful; spacious as London Hotels go, with everything we needed for  our stay. Technology has been incorporated with an interesting lighting system and and even more interesting state of the art toilet :). The Christmas tree was a nice touch. 

We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks in the American bar and dinner in the Game Bird restaurant, we not were not disappointed. This time of year is busy, with the run-up to Christmas, so I would recommend booking in advance if you want to enjoy either during your stay.  We thought the food was excellently cooked, presented and priced given the location. Breakfast is also severed in the Game Bird and I could have happily spent several hours there working my way through the various options. 

We had high expectations, given the reviews, and we were not disappointed. Whilst the Bar and Restaurant are clearly popular spots for meetings it was refreshing to see very limited use of mobile phones. We also noticed how warmly many guests were welcomed clearly indicating a healthy returning clientele. If I could make any suggestions it would be better lighting in the bar in the evening, more coffee pods in the room and separate the toilet from the bathroom.

Whilst we were only there for one night I could imagine it being an ideal base for an extended London trip. We also hope to go back outside the busy season to enjoy a leisurely cocktail in the bar and view the memorabilia in day light.",5,2018,12,13
142,A luxurious oasis right in the heart of London,"I was fortunate enough to stay at this gorgeous hotel. The rooms were so cosy and decorated to a wonderful design and standard. The hotel has the added benefit of a wonderful bar and their restaurant, The Game Bird, is a gastronomic delight!

The things that really set this hotel apart from most hotels that I have stayed in London, is the service and the design of the hotel itself. Service is so attentive in all parts of the hotel and the courtyard and entrance to the hotel feels like you are at a luxury country retreat as opposed to being right in the heart of central London.

Would definitely recommend.",5,2018,12,11
142,A perfect hotel to experience Central London,"The Stafford is a wonderful English hotel.  We have stayed there numerous times and it never disappoints.  The rooms are clean and well appointed. The staff is professional, kind and helpful, always improving upon our ideas for how to spend the day.  The location is perfect for us as it is within walking distance of numerous parks, excellent restaurants and a number of museums.  It is also pleasantly quiet for London, strategically located at the end of streets with limited access.  We particularly enjoy ending the evening in the American Bar with its wonderful wait staff. One could stay at many comparably-rated hotels in London, but none are as friendly and comfortable as the Stafford.",5,2018,12,10
142,Sensational Stafford,"If only i could stay at this fantastic hotel more often...stunning rooms, very slick service and a great menu through out the day. The American bar is the perfect spot to have pre dinner cocktail and the Chicken Kiev is spectacular. Thank you to all at the Stafford for making my stay so comfortable and above all relaxing.",5,2018,12,10
142,"Excellent service, good property. Some room for improvement","Stayed before and the hotel is a great choice for those who want real service rather than lip service provided by the 5 star chain hotels. The location is excellent within walking distance of just about anything. It is also a happening yet peaceful environment away from the madness of Oxford Street. I like the atmosphere in the hotel and also that there are some real English staff (many other hotels don't have any!).
Restaurant was good, I must admit the food I thought was not as nice as 3 years ago. 
Service is excellent.

We stayed in a deluxe king. Super spacious. You won't need such a big room unless you have a child and need an extra bed or an exceptional amount of luggage. T
Areas of opportunity for improvement:
he carpet was coming off the floor - like in the whole room. Really needs an upgrade urgently. The bed was a bit soft for us.
We ordered room service for three and it was delievered on trays but no table. It was almost impossible to eat it. 
I noticed that they now charge a 12.5% service charge. Common in such establishments in London. I would love management to explain this. I have to say iy confused me a bit, I normally leave tips in the restaurants and a big tip for other staff at the end. Now I am not sure what to do.
I paid 450 pounds per night",4,2018,12,10
142,The Stafford...still as charming and special as ever,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at The Stafford, returning after quite a few years away. It is better than ever! The service is superlative, warm and gracious. The American Bar is a favorite venue for drinks and a light meal and it's outdoor courtyard dining space is lovely. The decor is classic and chic at the same time, our bed was super comfortable, and the food is very good. It does feel like an oasis in the middle of a busy city...and it's in an excellent location, with the Green Park Underground station nearby. Loved having a Nespresso coffee maker in our room. Highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2018,12,09
142,The Spectacular Stafford,"My husband and I enjoyed a five night holiday at the Stafford over Thanksgiving. We were very much impressed with the quality of service from every staff member we encountered. The hotel has a beautiful history with modern comforts and amenities. We dined at Game Bird for Thanksgiving dinner and enjoyed a partridge, leek and ham pithivier and a generous portion of soufflé for desert.  We also spent time at the American Bar and value the conversations we had with the international staff.

The hotel is in an exceptional area for touring, being a short walk to Buckingham Palace and steps from the Green Park tube station.  I highly recommend The Stafford.",5,2018,12,09
142,Quiet and wonderful,"My first stay here was in 1964, when I was 8 years old.  The Stafford has changed since then, but it remains a quiet, luxurious oasis in downtown London.  The staff is very helpful, the rooms are lovely, the food is good, and the location could not be better.  It’s a perfectly sized hotel — no big crowds of people getting off of tour buses.  Museums, the West End, Buckingham Palace, etc are all within walking distance.  For longer distances, you can easily catch the Underground from nearby Green Park station.",5,2018,12,03
142,Such an amazing stay at The Stafford,"My husband and I spent a week at The Stafford in July. Such a pretty hotel. I can not say enough about the staff and how accommodating they are. We had breakfast daily at the hotel and honestly it was so hearty we really didn't even need much for lunch. You can have breakfast in the beautiful dining room or you can have it outside in the courtyard which is also so lovely.  The American Bar is such a great place to end a busy day of sightseeing for dinner and drinks. In March we spent a week at Claridge's, which of course is renowned for it's beauty and impeccable service, I have to say that The Stafford was on par with Claridge's for the services and the our room at The Stafford was as pretty or maybe even a bit nicer. ",5,2018,12,03
142,Just fantastic !!,"After a year , we were back to The Stafford hotel , just amazing , the new restaurant and the new American bar , are just out of this world , fantastic quality and incredible nice staf , friendly and in the same time , extremely professional ! All the staff of reception and concierge , are always ready to help with any need , the room was clean and the bed ..... like to sleep in a cloud !! The Stafford is not an hotel , is a way of life !! We will be back and we will suggest to all our friend !! Thank’s so much to make  our holiday so great !!",5,2018,11,30
142,A CLASS ACT IN A CLASSY LOCATION - IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS,"Once again I returned to this classy 5 star plus hotel. The accommodation, public areas, location, service and total professionalism of all staff whom I have come to know well from my other visits have made me feel important as part of the hotel family. Indeed the ""welcome home"" greeting from all staff says it all  An amazing place to stay and meet for social / business purposes - on this visit I had a breakfast meeting with an international business partner who was superbly welcomed and treated like one of The Stafford family. The MD Stuart, his executive assistant Sarah and Head Concierge Frank were always present interacting with guests and should be proud of their fantastic team and hotel. To coin a Scottish phrase "" A wee gem of a place""",5,2018,11,21
142,Outstanding Hideaway,"Majestic, unstuffy, hideaway in central London.  Location is perfect in St James’s close to Pall Mall, Piccadilly, Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Whitehall, Trafalger Square, Regent Street - ideal for shopping, dining, history and culture - and all within walking distance.  British institutions surround you - The Ritz, The Wolseley, The Royal Academy, Fortnum and Mason and  St James’s Palace to name but a few.  It is a two minute walk to Green Park Tube station and we used the Jubilee Line to quickly reach events at Wembley Stadium and the O2 Arena
The hotel is quiet and offers refined elegance with unobtrusive, discrete service.  Staff remember  all your preferences and are very friendly and approachable.  Returning guests are greeted like old friends by Ned who is the guest relations manager. He and the rest of the staff aim to make it feel as though you have returned home and it certainly feels that way.
 Rooms are beautifully decorated in calming, muted colours and rich fabrics. Beds are supremely comfortable, breakfast substantial and the American Bar atmospheric.  I wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else when I visit London.",5,2018,11,20
142,A Jewel of a Hotel in a Gem of a City,"My husband and I stayed at The Stafford Hotel for three days/nights during the first week of November 2018.  This beautiful little jewel of a hotel is tucked away on a quiet street a short walk from Regent Street, the Palace of St. James and Buckingham Palace.  The staff are exceedingly polite, friendly and ready to be of help at all times.  The atmosphere is both cozy and elegant.  When we arrived our room was not quite ready and we were offered a drink sitting near the fireplace in the lounge/bar area while we waited.  Our room itself was small and dominated by a huge and wonderful, comfortable king size bed that was like sleeping on a cloud.  The closet area and bathroom - up two steps from the main part of the room - was small but spotlessly clean, well appointed and funcional with lovely bath products.  There was no view from our window.  The hotel is quiet, a paper was put on our door each morning, we received help getting tickets, taxi's and directions and were in walking distance of most everything we wanted to see and do.  We had dinner in the bar area one evening and the food was delicious - the best Chicken Kiev I've ever had!  I found our stay here to be delightful and would most definitely plan to stay here again should I find myself in London.",5,2018,11,19
142,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"We spent a delightful afternoon celebrating a 60th birthday in quintessential English Style.
The setting of the Hotel, just between Green Park and St James's is truly serene. Its history, especially during the last World War, is amazing as are the displays in the American Bar, which is not to be missed. 
The Afternoon Tea itself was as one would expect first class on all levels, ambiance, service, freshness and tastes to excite the palate.",5,2018,11,12
142,One of our favorite hotels!!!!,"We returned to The Stafford for yet another idyllic visit!!  As The Stafford says, welcome home, and that is exactly the way we feel each time we return to this gem of a hotel tucked just off St. James in the heart of London.  The staff is warm and welcoming, and the rooms are superbly comfortable.  

I visit the gym each day when we are in residence.  It is small but very well appointed and has a great supply of towels and bottles water.  Showers are also available.  

The bar is fantastic.  We always make a reservation to ensure we can find the table of choice when we arrive.  The space has recently undergone a renovation in the main area, and it was tastefully re-decorated with beautiful wood and lighting.  The first room still has the old character of the former bar.  There is also an outside space for those who want to smoke cigars/cigarettes.

The Game Bird restaurant serves a delicious breakfast along with lunch, high tea and dinner.

With all the states amenities and excellence, what truly makes The Stafford wonderful is the staff.  We will return to London in the fall, and we will choose the Stafford for sure!!",5,2018,11,10
142,A night at The Stafford,"We spent a wonderful night at The Stafford last weekend. It is a hidden gem in the heart of London. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel so welcome and completely at home, nothing was too much trouble. After the most beautiful cocktail in The American Bar, We had dinner in The Game Bird, the food was delicious - I can recommend the venison!  There is an extensive wine list- and a very knowledgeable sommelier. After a very comfortable night’s sleep, breakfast was a treat! Again, we were so well treated, and felt thoroughly spoilt. I intend to have breakfast at The Stafford whenever I visit London. We are already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2018,11,08
142,Best Ever Hotel Experience In London,"We walked round to the Stafford after being let down with poor quality rooms at a near by hotel and they could not have been more accommodating to fit us in for the weekend. If that wasn't enough to impress us they then went on to provide some of the best service we have ever received from any Hotel we have stayed at, nothing was too much trouble and the staff were friendly without being over bearing! Couple this with fantastic rooms, great food and drinks and it was overall a great experience, so much so we have rebooked for next month! Fantastic Team.",5,2018,11,05
142,It keeps on getting better!,"We spent our Holiday at Stafford for a week in mid-October. We have stayed twice previously in 2017. The Stafford's greeting is ""welcome home"".  This is not an ad-campaign but true. Whenever we returned to the hotel from an outing, we felt that we came home. Charlie and Gregory  met us at the door as we arrived to check in and remembered us from May 2017 and were warmly welcomed . Brent, the concierge assisted mailing a package within the UK. 
The entire staff is professional, courtesy, and will try make your stay absolutely perfect. The American Bar is recently renovated. It has kept is charm and style. More importantly, the team wants to make you comfortable and welcome. Vivivana is the only person's name I remember but all provided exceptional service.
The room was comfortable and quiet.
We are looking forward to returning to our London home, The Stafford.",5,2018,11,02
142,An Ideal Hotel,"I recently enjoyed a five-night stay at the Stafford and am delighted to report it is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. First, the location is superb- a small quiet street off Green Park- where the noise of the city is barely perceptible. Second, the staff is charming, kind and efficient- always willing to go the extra mile. Indeed, they are one of the main reasons this is a great hotel and it is clear that management is responsible for hiring great people and inspiring them to do their jobs superbly. My room-located in the Carriage House-was lovely with a marvelously comfortable bed and a luxurious marble bathroom. I enjoyed a delicious breakfast in my room each morning which arrived promptly 10-15 minutes after ordering it. I also had dinner one evening in the Game Bird and on another evening had drinks with friends in the American Bar.  Both were exceptional. The concierges were also superb. I could go on and on, but my point has been made. The Stafford is in the “ideal” category and I can’t think of too many hotels that could be described that way. No complaints whatsoever! Kudos to everyone at the Stafford!",5,2018,11,02
142,Perfect!,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights to celebrate my birthday. Everything about our stay was perfect, from the welcome on arrival, the warmth and professionalism of all staff we came into contact with, to the room amenities, ambiance of The American Bar and complimentary champagne which they surprised me with for my birthday! The location is very quiet but just a stone’s  throw from Piccadilly and the hustle and bustle of central London. You must stay here - you will definitely not be disappointed!",5,2018,11,02
142,Nice ‘old-school’ hotel with impeccable service,"I stayed in several dozens of London hotels mostly making choice based on my loyalty membership in hotel chains. But I love experimenting and decided to try The Stafford. Occupying three historic blocks just behind The Ritz and bordering Green Park the hotel is perfectly located in the heart of London to easily reach all you want to visit. I have got a surprising up-grade to Junior Suite and enjoyed with its spaciousness, lovely sitting area, all premium amenities. And a view to the open-air bar on the tiny dead end street leading to the hotel door. Although public spaces inside these historic buildings are somewhat cramped, but the staff was so cooperative, professional and friendly that you forget this minor ‘inconvenience’. The concierge team was so helpful in reserving restaurants for us. However, a young concierge did not know the meaning of the word ‘philately’ and sent us to a wrong place to buy stamps. Our dinner in the hotel’s intimate restaurant The Game Bird was just delicious and darkened lighting topped this unique experience. The American bar is very popular and a real must. Think, I ll be back.",5,2018,11,02
142,Not what it used to be. ,"We were so looking forward to our 2 night stay with the memory of a lovely “Deluxe King”  room which we  stayed in several years ago. 
Upon our arrival we were “upgraded” to a Carriage House King—translation: there was no Deluxe King available even though it had been confirmed upon reservation. The upgrade was part of the renovated area but done in a modern tasteless decor so unlike what the Stafford, a quaintly elegant hotel, is known for. 
We were then offered a smaller King in the main part of the hotel, which was showing signs of stress and neglect, as if the owner was not putting any funds or attention into the details.  We finally were moved the second day into our requested accommodation, which was fine, but  still were amazed by the ridiculously small shower which was too confining even for a small frame person such as myself. 
The American Bar is still appealing and attracts non-hotel guests as well. 
The staff couldn’t be nicer or more helpful, but sadly the bloom is off the rose at this place. ",3,2018,10,30
142,Excellent service ,"From being warmly welcomed on arrival by door staff and the charming Customer Relations manager Ned to a meticulously managed early departure, our stay was perfect. Our Junior Suite was excellent and the bathroom a delight. Food in the Game Bird more than met expectations, and the quirky American Bar was great fun. Can’t wait to come back!",5,2018,10,29
142,Amazing Experience,"The room was out of this world, with a bed so big I had to climb on it. We were made to feel very welcome with a personalised message waiting for us.
The decor throughout the hotel was faultless. Unfortunately we were only staying one night. The breakfast was fantastic with a wide range of produce and again staff were very attentive.
Would love to return to the little gem of a hotel tucked out of the way",5,2018,10,25
142,When you want that bit extra,"Simply beautiful.  Beautiful location, superb rooms well appointed (and we were at the lower end of the spectrum) exceptionally clean and well presented.  nothing was too much trouble from the staff who were polite and attentive.  London without the Stafford stop and experience would be a missed opportunity.",5,2018,10,24
142,Posh hotel snuggled in the heart of London,"Stayed here for a total of one night and two days. Booked via Expedia with an additional request for a smoking room and a late checkout.
Check-in was smooth. Very obliging and friendly staff who tried to cater to my additional requests. They had found a smoking room for me but given that this room was booked back-to-back which prevented a late checkout, they recommended me to upgrade to a carriage room.
This carriage room was located outside by the restaurant - and although they did not permit smoking indoors, they assured me that I could pop outside any time I wanted for a smoke.
My check-in time was around 8pm in the evening and by the time I had made my way into the room, there was a bustling crowd enjoying dinner seated directly in front of the carriage rooms - not to mention in front of my room. I literally had to weave my way in-between seats to get to my door. The staff assured me that the restaurant closes at 9pm and it should be quiet post then.
Now the room was great. Posh, clean, neat, with a tub and all. Room service was also great - prompt, friendly, and I liked the pasta and soup I had ordered. Although the initial soup of the day I had ordered had ran out, their alternative dish on the menu was very tasty.
Couple of improvement points though. The bed was a very high double bed - or so I thought. It was comprised of two single beds connected together, so I ended up sleeping on one corner of it as opposed to being able to enjoy the vastness of a real double bed.
And while the hotel was great - the room location was not at its best. The restaurant may have closed its orders by 9pm but it seemed the guests were more than happy to stay back much later. It was loud and noisy - even when I had the TV on. The chatter and laughter continued for a good couple of hours until 10:30 or later. Worse, I was startled awake by the bustling outside my door in the early morning - with the staff getting ready with the opening of the restaurant.
And to make things worse, the carriage room upstairs had a noisy guest who kept on scraping the floor during the wee hours of the night.
After a rather disgruntled sleep, woke up for a quick sightseeing tour of the Buckingham Palace which was located close to the hotel. Unfortunately upon coming back to the hotel around 2pm to prepare for my late checkout - found out that I had been locked out of my room. Had to go back and forth from my room to the front desk a total of two to three times - once to let them know I had been locked out and to get them to get my card key working again, second time to let them know the extended card key seriously was not working, then the third time to be accompanied by the front desk staff to get my door opened. Was quite a bit annoyed despite the apology from the hotel on this hiccup.
Aside from this, checkout was quick and smooth - and the extremely friendly doorman helped to lift my spirits a little.
Overall - I may choose to stay here again, although definitely not in the carriage rooms as it is far too noisy and busy for someone like me who was eager for a good nights rest after a week of a grueling workshop.",4,2018,10,22
142,The honourable Edward Louis Sandilands,"I stayed here with my partner for a night and it was absolutely stunning. The service and staff were impeccable and extremely attentive. The room was beautiful and immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was also perfect. I can’t recommend this hotel enough, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be booking again.",5,2018,10,20
142,Hidden gem,"This place rocks! As in I saw Ronnie Wood quietly having a meeting here one afternoon. Hidden amongst alleys it is perfectly located between Buckingham palace and Piccadilly. Rooms are small but old school, clean and functional. But the various bars and restaurants are outstanding and the staff is wonderful. Everyone is super helpful and friendly. Say hello to Charlie and Frank if you're there! They're the best.",5,2018,10,18
142,Great service at the American Bar and perfect for a good cocktail ,"Brilliant service with an attentive team, I’m really picky if you are paying for quality, but the staff excelled, it was worth it! I will be back again with more friends. It was a great way to spend a sunny afternoon eating and soaking up the atmosphere in the cobbled courtyard. ",5,2018,10,17
142,It's almost too good,"Selecting The Stafford as my first stop on a trip to England nearly ruins by comparison every other hotel on the trip.  The Stafford is a great hotel, perfectly groomed and maintained with perfect service and a location that could not be better.  It's one of the best hotels I know -- on the level of The Connaught, La Mamounia, and Rome's Raphael.",5,2018,10,16
142,Interesting location ,In St. James just behind the Ritz. Funny little lane between the buildings opposite the hotel walks you right into Green Park. Great for tube / shopping / dining. Wonderful location. Staff very friendly. Decor is fantastic. Very posh feel. Nice bar and restaurant. Interesting artwork. ,4,2018,10,15
142,London's Greatest 5 Star Secret,"I have stayed a couple of times now and 'how' I have missed The Stafford for all of my years, working, living and traveling to London is beyond me.... not only is the location incredible but this hotel has gone to great lengths to become outstanding.

The combination of tremendous service, true comfort and luxury is just beyond. The Stafford takes me back to the mid 90's in London where hotels in London were still delivering old world charm and that special care and attention to guests at the highest levels.

I think this is now my London home... forget AirBnB and indeed the raft of hotels I have tried... The Stafford makes me feel special... from the doorman to the bar staff to the reception team and concierge I love this hotel. The food, the breakfast and the sheer comfort of the rooms is just great... I may even move in permanently!

Love The Stafford",5,2018,10,13
142,Location beyond our dreams,"We just returned from a 5 night stay. I did extensive research on hotels in London and chose The Stafford due to a previous poster favorably comparing it to Relais Christine, our favorite small hotel in Paris. I am so glad I chose The Stafford over my second choice, The Goring (walked by and hated the location) or a few hotels we considered in Mayfair that were further away from where we wanted to be.  I'm giving 5 stars primarily for the fabulous location, and the team of doormen, porters, concierge, etc.  We stayed in a deluxe king in the main house.  The room was fine, not outstanding, but fine. Size was good.  We overlooked St. James Place which we were happy about.  Fun to watch the people walking to and from Green Park.  The marble bathroom was good except for the separate shower which was teeny tiny and we had to keep turning off the water as the drain could not keep up.  Other than that, we had no issues.  We did not have breakfast included, and were glad, because we loved the breakfasts at The Wolseley and 45 Jermyn.  The concierge recommended a wonderful Italian restaurant, Il Vicolo, a few minutes away, which was so good we ate dinner there 3 times.  I would recommend this hotel if you want a very quiet location near Piccadilly, Green Park, The Mall, Buckingham Palace, etc.  Other hotels very close by are The Ritz, Dukes and St James Hotel.",5,2018,10,07
142,Beautiful hotel in wonderful location,"The location is perfect.  

The staff are professional, courteous and accommodating. Bathroom toiletries are lovely and the beds are comfortable.

The restaurant is one of the most beautiful I've seen. 
Despite the beautiful room and friendly servers, the English breakfast was not as good as I would expect at a hotel at this level. I would not pay for breakfast to be included if I stay at the Stafford again. I like the English breakfast at the Wolseley restaurant that is a few blocks away better.",4,2018,10,02
142,"Elegance, Comfort & Location","A charming, newly renovated, classic hotel tucked away in the historic St. James area of London. 
Old world charm & grace, welcoming, attentive staff and conveniently located near upscale shopping & the busy West End. The hotel’s Game Bird Restaurant is lovely for meals thru out the day; the American Bar is a well known stop with cobble stone patio outside; fun on a warm afternoon & evening for drinks & appetizers. 
Note: Carriage House rooms are located “outside” the main hotel. A charmingly designed area for entertaining w/geranium filled window boxes and tables & chairs on a large patio is shared with the American Bar; this is great until the bar patrons party past 10:00 pm and jet lagged guests have to call the front desk. Rooms are very comfortable w/ down comforters & blankets beautifully updated & well appointed furnishings. The bathrooms are spacious and offer the latest in every modern bathroom convenience!",5,2018,10,01
142,Our wonderful week in London,"We spent seven wonderful nights at the Stafford. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the most accommodating staff.. We were given a tour of the hotel and asked if we had any special requests.
During our stay they made many reservations for us.
Before we left home we tried to make dinner reservations st Bocca Di lupo without success. We even tried having American Express make arrangements. The concierge at the hotel got us a reservation.
Charlie, the door man, was extremely cheerful and helpful. We look forward to our next stay.",5,2018,09,30
142,A Flawless Retreat,"We are so happy we chose the Stafford London for our anniversary weekend. Our friends highly recommended it - and we will absolutely return. From the moment you walk in the door - you are inundated with fabulousness and professionalism. I would particularly like to thank Zelia - the Assistant Reception Manager for showing us every comfort and courtesy. She absolutely went out of her way to make our weekend special and enjoyable. 

The hotel itself feels like taking a journey back in time. The dining room is lovely - as was the breakfast. We really can find a thing we didn't like - it was a complete reprieve from the daily grind.",5,2018,09,24
142,Fourth stay - 6 wonderful nights,"I've reviewed the Stafford before, it is, almost certainly, one of the few remaining 'proper' 5 star hotels, anywhere. Charlie on the front door recognised the car, opened the door for my lady and opened with ""Hello Mrs ******, welcome home"". A welcome from Concierge, by name, followed....this is a small hotel, the staff are quite possibly the best trained I've come across anywhere and nothing is too much trouble. Needless to say it has replaced the Lanesborough as our London hotel. Jermyn Street, Fortnums, The Royal Academy are a 200 yard stroll, access to Green Park and a walk down Queen's Walk to Buckingham Palace? Not much more. The food in the Restaurant, the Game Bird, is modern English with a few hints of Europe here and there and quite wonderful. If you like something a little more relaxed...eat in the American Bar, newly redecorated and redesigned many of the mementos and photographs from former guests have disappeared and as a result there is more space - it may take a little while to get used to the Bar in it's current itteration if you were used to the cluttered individuality, however, the staff are unchanged, welcoming and very professional/helpful. 

We were given a Deluxe King in the main house. My Lady, who never knowingly underpacks, found more than enough space in the wardrobes to hang her clothes ""properly"". There was even sufficent space to accommodate my clothes and plenty of drawer space. The bed? As I've said before those of smaller stature may need a set of steps but amongst many comfortable beds that seem to be appearing in hotels, finally, the Stafford's beds require some real willpower to get up from they are 'that' comfortable. We look forward to a return in early December for the usual Christmas shopping.",5,2018,09,18
142,Magnificent Hotel,"The Stafford is a truly remarkable hotel and is set in such an iconic location. The staff was committed to providing exceptional service at every turn and made me feel completely comfortable for the duration of my stay. In addition to the outstanding service, the food and wine at The Stafford London left a great impression. The cuisine at The Game Bird is so delicious that I was inspired to taste everything on the menu. And the American Bar is filled with so much history and character that I never wanted to leave, hoping to make my own mark like the distinguished guest before me. I was also lucky enough to have the opportunity to dine in the 400-year-old wine cellars, where the Sommelier, Gino Nardella, selected an exquisite bottle of wine to complement the food. Great experience, highly recommend.",5,2018,09,17
142,Absolutely the best location in St. James area.,Spent 5 nights here in June.  Very professional staff.  Great housekeeping.  The American Bar is always happening.  The stayed in the carriage house and found it a little noisy.  The doors are solid and the outdoor walkway portion make it slightly noisy.  Would not hesitate to stay again but would probably choose the mail building.,4,2018,09,17
142,Fantastic Hotel!,"My family had two adjoining rooms here in late July for 4 nights. We absolutely loved everything about this charming hotel...the rooms were beautiful, the beds amazing, housekeeping left great little chocolates and other treats for the kids in the evening, American Bar very cool atmosphere, dining room GORGEOUS, food delicious (we actually ate every breakfast there and two dinners), service impeccable, and the doormen were so friendly and nice in helping us get cabs (especially Modestus and one other gentleman) and just chatting with us. Truly loved this hotel and so glad we splurged to stay here...made the trip to London! Can't wait to visit again!",5,2018,09,16
142,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I stayed twice this month, and when we return to London we'll certainty stay here again.  The entire staff does everything to make your stay enjoyable.  We stayed in the main hotel and also in the Mews.  The Mews are the more modern rooms (especially the bathrooms) .  The American Bar is great as is the restaurant.  My most sincere thanks to the entire staff for making us feel so welcome.  Special thanks to Salvatore in the bar.",5,2018,09,16
142,Sedate and refined and lovely,"This lovely, small, old school hotel, is tucked quietly in St. James Place, and provides a calm respite from the often frenzied pace of London.  The rooms are not large, but they are tastefully appointed, and the beds are quite comfortable, and the service is top-notch.  The Stafford has one of the two remaining American Bars in London hotels.  The other, better known one, being at the Savoy.  The Stafford American Bar is a clubby, relaxed spot serving classic and trendy libations.  There was an issue with service in the bar on the last night of my stay.  The bar was busy and the servers seemed a little overwhelmed by this.  It was way more raucous than seemed appropriate to this particular venue.  However, I pointed this out to the front desk staff, and upon investigating, they let me know the following morning, during checkout, that there did, indeed, appear to be issues with service and decorum in the bar the previous night, and they generously comped my tab.  I trust that this was an aberration, and I would love to return to the Stafford soon",4,2018,09,13
142,Mews Master Suite❤️,"Awesome hotel! We had a Mews Master suite and it did not disappoint! Loved the location, the hospitality and everything! The Moonraker cocktail in the American Bar may be my favorite cocktail EVER! We will be back!",5,2018,09,12
142,Stylish Stafford ,"This hotel is full of character, the staff are friendly and helpful, our room ( a classic double) was clean and comfortable but rather small 
The American Bar is a great Mayfair watering hole but has prices to match!",4,2018,09,08
142,The best place to stay in London!,"We have been staying at The Stafford for years and our recent experience - August 2018- showed that it is still absolutely on form. Rooms are updated (great Wifi) and lovely as ever. The renovations to the American Bar were carefully done so as to preserve its atmosphere, but give it an updated and refreshed feel. As always, the staff was incredibly courteous and helpful. You simply aren't going to find a better experience in London.",5,2018,09,04
142,World-class service,"The Stafford is a true gem in London.

We recently held a large event at the hotel, catering for 15 guests travelling from across the globe. The hotel was warm, friendly and most of all highly hospitable to all our guests - who each commented on how welcome they felt and how fantastic the hotel and staff were throughout.

It was a pleasure working with The Stafford and I look forward to doing so again soon.",5,2018,09,03
142,Wonderful stay!,"This is such a great hotel...from its location, to its style & staff. We stayed for a special occasion and loved every minute! The staff were attentive & thoughtful, from check in until check out, and the service was exceptional, both in reception and in the bar & restaurant. We stayed in a Mews room, which was beautifully appointed with all the luxuries you would expect..plus a few extra touches. A great nights sleep, and a delicious breakfast to get up for! Just wish we could have stayed longer...",5,2018,08,30
142,Familiar and comfortable,"We have made it a habit to stay at The Stafford when we come to London for more than 30 years.  It always felt like home to me, where people would remember our names and individual preferences.  Paul Newman would stroll through the American Bar and Julia Roberts would drop by for lunch.  And the General Manager would regale us with his stories.  But much has changed in London and at the Stafford.  Things are much less formal now and only a few of the original staff remain.  One can only hope that charm isn’t fleeting and that the Stafford doesn’t become just another very nice Hotel.",5,2018,08,29
142,Loved every minute,"Tucked out of the way, but close to theatres, parks and fabulous shopping the Stafford is just a lovely hotel with great service throughout.  A pretty, well presented room, with the best bed ever, and a wonderful breakfast to get you set up for the day.  The American Bar was a great end to the day too.  A hotel we’ll definitely be returning to.",5,2018,08,27
142,Great Place to Stay in London,"Perfect place to stay in London.

142,"Stafford Mews, London","This is a wonderful hotel with staff who care from the doorman, the housekeepers, the concierge to the bar and restaurant. .We were welcomed with complementary tea and coffee upon arrival while we waited 15 minutes for our room. The bedroom is spacious and comfortable and the hotel corridors are covered with lovely English wallpaper. it is altogether cozy and elegant..  we can't wait to return.",5,2018,08,14
142,Ad hoc Visit ,Always nice to walk around the corner to have a meal or even just a drink either with friends or on my own. A lovely hotel with some of the best samtaff anywhere. My last visit was to meet friends from Scotland who were staying there and said how comfortable they found the hotel. I shall have to try staying there myself one day. ,5,2018,08,14
142,"Wonderful hotel, restaurant and bar with exceptional service!!!","One of the best hotel experiences!!! My grandma and I were treated so well and had an Amazing stay at The Stafford. The hotel property, restaurant and bar are all wonderful and the staff was very attentive and provided exceptional service which made us book an additional two nights. We highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to come back!!",5,2018,08,13
142,Outstanding,After visiting the Stafford with my friends the hotel did not disappoint. everything from the service and staff to the standards of the rooms is outstanding and would defiantly recommend this hotel to others.,5,2018,08,08
142,Amazing!,"Our yearly weekend visit to The Stafford was gorgeous as always!  The service, food and decor are all perfection and every detail is always thought about!  Such a wonderful location which is really accessible and the staff are so helpful when recommending places to visit and eat.  Couldn't recommend more highly!",5,2018,08,08
142,Perfect,"Very nice surprise ! Little hotel with the traditional British touch ! Very pleasant with a nice back court ! Staff is amazing 
A special thank you to Mihaela who was very welcoming showed me the hotel facilities and made me me feel like at home :) She speaks perfect Spanish.
Will get back for sure..",5,2018,08,08
142,Mrs Blamire ,"Stayed here for one night my only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer really!!!looked after by all the staff a great ambiance as you arrive enjoyed our drinks in the American bar was fantastic to sit outside in the courtyard surrounded by gorgeous flowers 
The location is perfect the rooms are splendid can not fault this hidden Gem of a hotel in the centre of the capital from the start to our early morning breakfast amazing!!! ",5,2018,08,08
142,Company Stay,"I have stayed at the Stafford 3 times now for a corporate event.  From liaising with the event staff, speaking daily with the reservations team to make the ever changing bookings that come with upto 20 guests from across the world to the front desk and door staff - the Stafford experience is first class.  I would not hesitate to recommend The Stafford for either a personal or corporate stay.",5,2018,08,07
142,"Brilliant, as usual. ","The Stafford is just superb. Spent three nights there last week and it is just the most splendid hotel. The warm welcome, the super comfortable rooms, the wonderful breakfasts, the amazing position. They all add up to making The Stafford such an easy place to be. The American Bar is also an awesome place to meet. ",5,2018,08,06
142,Superb!,"My husband and I celebrated our 39th Wedding Anniversary at this wonderful hotel. The welcome at reception was so warm and there started a really special weekend. Dinner in The Game Bird was outstanding and we returned to our beautiful room, a recently refurbished junior suite in the Carriage House, to find a bottle of complimentary claret from the hotel. The next day (our actual anniversary) was marked by the surprise arrival of a complimentary bottle of champagne and a card. Drinks in the American Bar were also a special feature of the weekend.

Our thanks to all the terrific staff at The Stafford for making our wedding anniversary so marvellous. We have stayed at the hotel on previous occasions and we will be back.",5,2018,07,28
142,A Perfect Location,"The people at the Stafford were genuinely happy to see my wife and me, even though it was our first visit there. Whenever we had a question or needed something, they were right there for us, from helping suggest a local pub, get theater tickets or use the Tube to get around. Yet, they were never in our way - it was like magic.

The location was perfect - just off the main streets, so our room was very quiet, yet just a short walk to the nearest Tube stop (Green Park) and a moderate walk to the theater, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Hyde Park. 

The meals in their Game Bird restaurant were excellent, and sharing a salad and perfectly cooked Dover sole was no problem. We began each day with a breakfast there - flaky pastries, fresh fruit, perfectly cooked eggs and meat, all served at an attractive table. We usually didn't need to eat again until dinner. 

Our room was spacious, the bed comfortable and everything was spotless. Many other nice touches.

We would definitely stay at the Stafford again on our next trip to London.",5,2018,07,24
142,A courtyard in midst of London...,"I do not write many reviews, but I will make an exception for The Stafford.

Through the years, I have stayed at the leading hotels--Claridge's, Dorchester, Savoy, but they don't compare to The Stafford. They all offer top notch service--what The Stafford sets apart is the staff. Without fail, they are gracious, smiling and helpful.

Beyond that, I particularly liked the Game Bird, the American Bar and the outdoor seating  in the courtyard.",5,2018,07,23
142,Lovely Hotel and Gracious Staff,"We recently returned from a 4 night stay at the beautiful Stafford Hotel, London and were so pleased with our accommodations! We booked directly with the hotel and were offered a ""4 night / pay for 3"" special offer including breakfast. The hotel staff were all very gracious, polite, helpful and kind, as were the waiters in the excellent Game Bird Restaurant. We enjoyed 2 delicious meals at the Game Bird and would recommend dining there while you are in London.  I chose the hotel based on the location, ratings, and reviews. We walked across the street through a passageway and were right in Green Park, near Piccadilly Street, 5 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and 15 minutes walk to most other tourist destinations. Everything about our stay at the Stafford exceeded our expectations, and our stay there was one of the best parts of our visit to London!!",5,2018,07,16
142,Perfection!!,"This was our first trip back to London in nearly 40 years, so we decided to look for a hotel with impeccable service located near all of the tourist attractions that we wanted to hit.

The Stafford fit the bill perfectly and far exceeded any of our expectations!

The quality and attention to detail from the staff of this amazing establishment begins far before your arrival.  The Concierge at The Stafford could not have been more helpful in presenting restaurant recommendations and securing their reservations.  They actually contact you prior to your arrival to find out if you have any ""preferences"" for the room, including how to stock the mini-bar.

As we were coming off a ship, we arrived exceptionally early (like 8:30 am).  And while our room wasn't ready (quite understandable), Dan and Ned made us perfectly content in their beautiful lobby until our guide arrived, taking all of our bags and insuring that we had water as it was going to be hot in London.  When we returned from our tours in the late afternoon, Ned escorted us into our beautiful room and insured that we understood how to use everything in the room (a really wonderful and helpful touch).

The room itself was gorgeous, with a super comfortable bed and lovely sitting area.  The bathroom was a delight with a separate tub and shower.  While an older hotel with beautiful, charming details, all of the amenities and touches were completely modern with free WiFi, electronic clocks and fantastic menu-driven televisions.  The shower was a little smaller than at home, but the water pressure and wonderful rainforest shower head more than made up for the smaller size.

The common areas are beyond beautiful, from the American Bar in the back of the hotel to the gorgeous tea room which serves unbelievably tasty meals.  The location is perfect...quiet side street but minutes to the tube and all the sites.

But it's the people and the staff of the Stafford that really make this place shine.  From the host in the restaurant to the doormen who greet you every time you come in, from the housekeeping staff who provide nightly turn down service to the front desk staff who greet you every time you step off the elevator, this staff is perfection.  

Well done to The Stafford and we can't wait to come back and visit again in the near future.  This will be our new home in London!",5,2018,07,13
142,Secret Gem in heart of Mayfair,"We lunched in the newly refurbished American Bar which displays a huge array of memorabilia of American caps ties aeroplanes all hanging from ceiling. The décor still offers an ambiance that you can always relate to the Stafford. Décor is appealing but being old fashioned perhaps preferred old style. Gone are the traditional eating trays replaced by tables where height can be adjusted to suit and bar has been extended.
The staff are still as good as ever , with Ben and Gino sommelier always there to make your stay memorable. It still is our favourite place for lunch or Dinner and to stay in one of courtyard rooms is magic.",5,2018,07,10
142,Londons Gem,"A gem in London, with great rooms, excellent staff and service ;wonderful atmosphere and just a good overrall feel. It is on the expensive side but well worth it from an ambiance, service and comfort perspective. This is our second time at the Stafford and we will definitly be back.",5,2018,07,09
142,One of the Finest Hotels We Ever Have Experienced,"It is difficult to add more to the superlatives described in other reviews. Thus is a notable hotel in every way, staff, cuisine, ambiance and quality. Everyone one we encountered was friendly and gracious from the doorman to the servers right up to management including Sarah Penrigh, Camille Fleuriet and GM Stuart Proctor. You feel they all are there to be responsive to your requests, as well as being proactive during your stay. A drink in the American Bar, lunch in the Mews and dinner in The Game Bird all were excellent in atmosphere and quality. 
Location, location, location! The hotel is in central London, but surrounded by quiet, and a perfect location for exploring, particularly via the tunnel to Green Park and its Tube station. 
Highly recommended!",5,2018,07,06
142,Outstanding service and a first class property,"We booked directly at The Stafford's website after narrowing our London hotel search down.  Once booked we needed help from the concierge with dinner reservations and from the first moment we contacted the hotel through check out we received exemplary service.  Our room on the third floor was spacious and comfortable, although not much of a view which didn't bother us since we weren't in the room that much.  Ned from the Front Desk walked us through all the features of the room, including the light switches.  The bed was super comfortable as well and the air conditioning worked really well, especially since London was having a hot spell.
We only had a drink at the bar on our first night.  Having not been to London in many, many years I had forgotten how expensive it is, but you do get what you pay for.  Since we were taking multiple tours we didn't spend a lot of other time at the hotel but whenever we needed a taxi there was always someone available to help secure one.
Finally when we checked out the bellman came up quickly to collect our bags and the doormen secured a taxi for us to Heathrow, putting our bags in without us having to lift a finger.
We loved London and are planning a return trip, we just don't know when.  However, when we do we would love to stay at The Stafford once again.",5,2018,07,02
142,Glorious Game Bird,"We enjoyed an evening with friends at this fine dining menu and were treated to a meal created by guest chef Lisa Allen from Northcote.  The meal she served was available with a wine pairing and we opted for the full experience.  We arrived early and enjoyed pre-drinks at the wonderful bar and were pleased to note that others were affording themselves of this unique event.  We started with a glass of Moet & Chandon served with warm Lancashire brawn and English mustard and a Southport potted shrimp muffin - both diving.  We then enjoyed Morecambe Bay wild seabass, followed by an unusual English onion in its own skin which turned out be to a roasted onion then scooped out and filled with a delicately flavoured bouillon.  The main dish was beef Rossini and Lisa Allen's own take on strawberries and cream.  At £150 per head (with wine pairing) this was indeed a considered purchase but well worth it.  We also met Lisa Allen during the course of the evening and applaud her ability to provide such a superb meal away from her own kitchen.  Hopefully The Stafford will replicate such dining events in the future.",5,2018,07,02
142,Lovely Hotel with Old Fashioned Character,"The service is wonderful and the hotel has the feel of an elegant club.  Beds are very comfortable. The food is excellent and location is on a beautiful, historical cul de sac.  it is perfect for an American family wishing for a luxurious place to experience historical London.",5,2018,06,25
142,A Luxurious Disappointment,"If you are a well heeled traveler and the front desk gives you Room 122 on arrival run out of here fast. A glance of the half sized door and entryway will remind you of the tiniest flat in Chelsea jammed between standard row homes. The bathroom (tiniest in my 30 year London hotel experience) was so narrow you had to walk sideways to not hit the towel rack or fall into the tub.  To sit on the toilet in this room you must remove the lower toilet paper holder from the wall. This is not the timeless luxury I read about. What annoyed me most was that the hotel charged 1.3 times the rate of my previous nights for a Friday evening stay and when I asked for an improvement in the rate for this room to match the other nights , rather than address my concern I was given a 10% discount card for my return stay and made aware of a London congestion rule that allows the hotel to charge more.   A 10% discount for a room that was 50% smaller than the rest and is probably sold on last minute websites doesn’t seem fair. I am in London many times a year and decided to stay here because of a great evening with clients at the American Bar on my last trip. Much to my dismay and I am sure to many others who love this bar, it is now elongated no longer clubby and intimate but rather an amalgamation of metal glass racks that sit just above head level. I felt like I was drinking on the other side of a cage, with the added bonus of having the glare of the under-mount lights for the glass racks right into my eyes. This was a horrible change by management and many in the bar commented about this.  This is a nice quiet hotel and nicely appointed but is located in an area mainly for tourists, unless your clients are the Royals or hedge funds in Berkeley Square. Even then there are closer hotels.  Breakfast in the Gamebird was fantastic. Sorry, but I really wanted to like this place, having seemingly been shafted with Room 122 and an assistant front desk manager who had zero customer service skills, I will not return to stay or to have a drink at the bar.  Too many other London hotels close by offer much better!",3,2018,06,16
142,Tucked away and secret!,"A secret luxury hotel, away from it all but a few steps from being right back in the thick of it.  Old world, luxury charm, with great service (apart from one lady who was rather snooty to me whilst checking in - but it may have been because I was flustered somewhat!).  My husband and I stayed here as we were attending a nearby event and decided to stay in town rather than rush back on the train.  We were so glad we did.  Lovely room on the 6th floor (I had requested a quiet room), good size, marble bathroom and everything you need - apart from tea making facilities!  Good coffee machine, fresh milk etc, but it would have been nice to have had the very english facility of being able to make yourself tea first thing in the morning!  
Breakfast was excellent, as was the service.  Good variety for continental breakfast and an excellent array of choice for cooked to order food.  
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and to be honest wished we had booked 2 nights!  We will certainly stay again.  It's a charming, elegant and a serene stay in a busy City.",5,2018,06,14
142,Absolute luxury,"This beautiful and elegant hotel has outstanding features with great and wonderful characteristics its sure to impress the eye of anyone looking to stay in a luxury hotel like this, my room was fantastic and quirky with a timeless feel, i would certainly want to stay in the room longer if i had the time, but due to work business i was shortly out of a room that i felt i could live in. Great stay and thanks to all those whom helped.",5,2018,06,12
142,Elegant and Timeless,"The Stafford is one block from ""everything"" - restaurants, shops, people on the street, yet it remains an oasis of quiet elegance, personalized service and just about everything a traveler wishes in a hotel. Rooms are well appointed, dining is available all day and the outside patio is a special treat. We have stayed here twice a year for many years and will return again this winter.",5,2018,06,11
142,A Beautiful Hotel in the heart of London,"Out of the many hotels to choose from in London it was a very easy decision to return to The Stafford, this time for a special occasion with my wife.  The warm welcome ""home"" we received when we checked set the tone for the rest of our memorable stay.

Our room was amazing room, it was light and spacious and had the most comfortable bed.

We enjoyed a light lunch in the courtyard that was fresh and very tasty.  

The breakfast was superb.  

I would like to thank everyone at the hotel, for making our stay so special and welcoming.

We will defiantly be back very soon !.",5,2018,06,08
142,Amazing stay in a stunning hotel!! ,"Well what can i say about this hotel....it is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location (a little hidden alley near the front of the hotel takes you right through to Buckingham palace only a couple of minutes walk) just ask the helpful porters to point you in the right direction 😉. On arrival we were greeted by the lovely Emmanuel who guided us to the reception. All staff were very friendly and welcoming with a quick check-in. We were taken to our suite and shown around by Ned who was great. We stayed in a need suite which was absolutely Amazing!! Amd looking right over the beautiful courtyard. The suite far exceeded any expectations we had, every room beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. Opening the doors in the bedroom was a wow factor to the huge bathroom! With his and hers sinks, big walk-in shower and lovely big bathtub it was perfect. I could have gladly stayed in our room and never left. We had drinks in the new bar which has recently been refurbished and looks fab! 😉 staff were great and we were never without a drink in our hand. Don't forget to ask for the tour of the cellar, we felt very lucky to be able to see and hear the history behind it. The bed was fantastic! I've never had such a good night sleep (and I'm very picky when I sleep in a new bed). Breakfast was very tasty and had plenty on the menu. All the waiters were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you. We had a lovely walk around London as the hotel is Very close to many sights. We would definitely recommend a stay here. Very special mention to Stuart *manager*, Emmanuel and Ned..great guys and made our stay wonderful. Thankyou so much! Kirsty and Shaun wheater x",5,2018,06,07
142,Perfect “London Home”,"This is my second stay at The Stafford and it’s safe to say I will be returning. The whole stay has been fantastic. 

Our room was well appointed and had all of the elements that you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

Dinner in the Game Bird was first class, the food was traditional British fare but perfectly presented with fantastic flavours.

What makes The Stafford is the staff, there are too many stars to name personally, however every single member of the team clearly enjoys delivering outstanding service. What makes you feel at home is the relaxed nature of the service and the fact the staff allow their personalities to come through. 

Looking forward to our next visit.

",5,2018,06,01
142,Fantastic quiet location within 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace,"The Stafford is a hidden gem close to so many of London's highlights.  The attention to detail and the friendliness of the staff sets this hotel apart.  From the minute you arrive, you are treated like royalty.  The breakfast room is so charming and has the most delicious and varied buffet breakfast you will find anywhere.  The Stafford has old world charm yet modern conveniences.  Our spacious Mews suite #632 was beautifully decorated with a fireplace, plenty of closet space, a huge marble bathroom with separate shower and tub, a great shower head and even a yellow Stafford rubber duck along with a nice selection of high end toiletries. Ask to see their wine cellar, reputed to be one of the oldest in London dating back to the time of Henry VIII.   If you are looking for an intimate hotel with a great location, this is it.",5,2018,05,31
142,"Elegant, quiet and well-situated","The staff are polite, unpretentious and quick to assist with any needs or questions.  I highly recommend The Stafford for its location and comforts — and the little secret tunnel straight into Green Park near the Tube station is a nice bonus.",5,2018,05,30
142,Fabulous,"Thanks to everyone at The Stafford for making our wedding anniversary afternoon tea so enjoyable. Great food, service and relaxed atmosphere. Love this hotel so much. I almost don't want to spread the word. ",5,2018,05,29
142,Something special made exceptional,"Simply stunning.  We stayed only one night but the attention to detail, the service, the food , the room..................I could go on were just superb.  Everything I would have dreamt of plus a bit.  The only disappointment was checking out as I could have stayed far,  far longer!

I really hope to back again sometime soon and perhaps for that longer stay.",5,2018,05,29
142,Lovely hotel in perfect location.  Great service too,"I agonized over where to stay in London since I hadn't been in years.  Booked several options and chose to keep the reservation at the Stafford and I am glad I did.  We booked through the Chase Luxury Hotel collection so the room was a relative bargain for London (included breakfast, a 85 pound credit towards dinner one night and a room upgrade, as available).  We were upgraded to a room in the mews (in the courtyard).  The room was good-sized and lovely and the bathroom....I could take it home with me.   A separate huge shower and two sinks. The service at the hotel could not have been better.  Always a pleasant greeting and a lovely bottle of wine in honor of my husband's birthday.   The location was perfect.  Walking distance to dinner and theater.  Just a short stroll to the Green Park tube or bus stop for other locations (eg Victoria and Albert).  I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2018,05,26
142,Better service does not exist.,"The staff at the Stafford is the best I've ever experienced. Anywhere. 
Not cheap, but worth it. We stayed in the Carriage House, overlooking the outdoor portion of the American Bar.
Highly recommend including the breakfast  in your deal.",5,2018,05,26
142,Extraordinary experience,"This was our third stay at the Stafford London.  The experience has always been wonderful.  All The staff are sincerely welcoming and helpful.

The rooms are very well appointed with lovely amenities. (Floris Soaps).  The location next to Green Park makes tube travel very easy.  

The meals at the Stafford are excellent.  I would not stay anywhere else in London.  The Stafford sets a bar for others to achieve.",5,2018,05,23
142,A wonderful haven tucked away in St James's....,"This was a surprise birthday stay for my wife's birthday and the reception staff acted their part perfectly in keeping the booking secret right from the advanced booking stage.
The welcome at the hotel on arrival was genuinely warm and got the day off to the best start. The receptionist walked us to our courtyard suite and explained everything precisely well.
The room on the first floor walk-up terrace overlooked the cobbled open area of the American Bar which was very busy all day but much more interesting in street scene terms than noisy. Everything in the room was spotlessly clean and the accommodation itself was excellent; sitting room, separate bedroom with sliding doors to sitting room, dressing room with sliding door to bedroom and a magnificent large bathroom with separate bath and large shower. The bathroom products were from nearby Floris and were of first class standard as you might expect. A bottle of champagne and birthday card was waiting in the room. The short walk from the courtyard into Blue Ball Yard leads you straight into St James's Street.
We took advantage of the in-room service for supper and had a delicious meal from The Game Bird restaurant and great service. We did not have a pudding but the waiter brought a piece of birthday cake on an appropriately decorated plate when he returned for the supper dishes.
Breakfast in The Game Bird Restaurant was a treat with the same level of excellent attention and service. The food quality was very good as we had come to expect.
We had lunch at the American Bar next day and Benoit and his superbly trained team made it another special occasion for us and two guests we had invited for lunch. The cocktail waiter produced a great 'White Mouse' and Benoit recommended a perfect bottle of M.I.P Provencal rose wine - the weather in London was also on its best warm behaviour too - to go with the delicious roasted bream.   
I have been to the American Bar for lunch on previous occasions but this was my first stay in the Stafford Hotel. This is one of the discrete treasures of London. Many thanks to the whole team for making everything go so well and I look forward to the next time.",5,2018,05,23
142,"Lovely, quaint, personable - one of my favorite hotels","There isn't anything quite like staying at the Stafford. First, it is a historic building and you can feel the old-world style throughout. From the unique rooms to lovely courtyard. Second, they legitimately have the most comfortable beds I have ever stayed on in a hotel. It might be worth staying there for that alone :) They are a welcome respite after a long flight. Third, the staff is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling - solo for work, as a couple on holiday, or as a family. The location is also perfect for tourists looking to easily get to main attractions. 
 London has many wonderful, glitzy and glam 5 star hotels that are great as well... you won't go wrong staying at them either... but I would still choose the stafford over them any day. You get all of the same creature comforts, but in a more quaint and personable setting. Staying at this hotel feels more like staying at a dear friend's or family member's guest house versus a stodgy and unpersonable hotel.",5,2018,05,22
142,Perfect Venue for a Birthday Party,"I recently celebrated a milestone birthday, and was looking for an interesting, elegant, fun and delicious venue for a private party of 15 people. Thank goodness I found The Stafford, for it ticked each of these boxes many times over. The Stafford is an elegant boutique hotel tucked away in the secluded streets of St James. The lovely Alastair Jubber from the Stafford’s Events team could not have been more helpful, he promptly responded to every question and made excellent recommendations. The private room is in the 300-year-old wine cellar, which is atmospheric, truly private, and large enough to hold a single oval table for all the guests. They asked that the same menu be served for everyone, but there was plenty of choice and the food was delicious. The flowers were spectacular (and lasted for two weeks!). You could bring your own music and connect it to their sound system. Finally all the staff were excellent and we were well looked after. I highly recommend the Stafford for this type of event.",5,2018,05,20
142,What a Gem...,"Just returned from two night stay and just loved the hotel.  Great location, friendly staff and comfortable room and wonderful restaurant Game Bird.  Stayed at other hotels and locations in London but this is my favorite.  Hotel is on nice quiet street right in the heart of the city and quick walk to Buckingham Palace.  Just across the street there is a 'secret alley way' that leads directly to Green Park and it is a quick five minute walk to Buckingham Palace.",5,2018,05,15
142,Favorite Hotel In London,"This hotel was amazing!  The location is perfect.  The staff couldn't be more helpful.  The American Bar serves great wine.  The restaurant was fabulous.  We loved every minute of our stay.  Because of business, we stayed in two hotels while we were there.  The other had a better trip advisor rating.  The Stafford our favorite .. hands down.  We'll definitely stay there again!",5,2018,05,14
142,Service beyond compare!,"This was the third time we had stayed at the Stafford, and the quality of the visit was as good as ever. Our room was on the small size but well appointed, and the bathroom was large.  As always the service by the receptionists, porters and concierges was excellent. I have to give the porters a specific accolade.  We had gone visiting about 15 minutes away but needed to get back to the hotel to take our car to the airport. There were massive demonstrations which had shut down all the roads around St. James and it had started to rain. We couldn’t get back to the Stafford so the concierge arranged for our car to leave from the Holiday Inn north of Piccadilly, and the porter brought our bags on foot to the Inn and had them loaded by the time we arrived. Now that’s real service! Thank you to The Stafford.",5,2018,05,13
142,Excellent hotel,"Everything perfect, service, location...on our next stay in London we will go again for sure in The Stafford Hotel....you can from there visit by walk many interest point of London and the staff were very friendly",5,2018,05,13
142,Fabulous hotel even better staff,"I recently stayed at the Stafford in a carriage suite. The visit was to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Firstly a huge thank you to Ned who went above and beyond to make this a special visit
All the staff we came across were polite but real not pretentious and they could not do enough for us. My only regret was being unable to visit the American bar that was under going a refurbishment during our stay. Maybe an excuse for another stay. ",5,2018,05,08
142,Superb hotel,The location of the hotel is great just a few minutes walk from Green park station. The Piccadilly is in walking distance. Staffs are amazing especially the concierge they are very helpful and attentive. Room was spacious and very comfortable. The overall decoration and ambiance are fantastic. Highly recommend and will stay here again when we have a chance to come to London.,5,2018,05,08
142,"A friendly,well managed, comfortable hotel","I've stayed here many times and each time the service from the staff has been genuinely friendly and efficient on all levels from the porters,bar and restaurant staff and anyone else with whom you come into contact. That's quite a tribute in today's world. The rooms tend to be on the small side but that's a small cost to pay for the pleasure of staying at this elegant hotel.",4,2018,05,06
142,Recent stay,"Overall experience was exceptional.  Always feel it is home away from home.  The staff is simply the best.  Feel that they are all friends.  They can't do enough for me and obviously, they must be like that with all visitors.",5,2018,05,03
142,"Stately and traditional in the heart of St. James', five star service","We only stayed one evening, unfortunately, so we didn't get to use the spa, or tour its 300 year old wine center, but if you want to be in the heart of St. James', close to everything - Greene Park, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey - with five-star service, this is your place.  The decor is very traditionally British (think elegant Portmeirion tablewear), and our room was perfectly equipped, if a bit on the smallish side) with a beautiful white carrara bathroom, wonderfully thick towels and bathrobes, heavy blackout curtains, and a large wide screened TV.  The concierge was wonderful - arranging to keep our luggage for several hours after our checkout.  Would definitely love to return with a little more time to enjoy the hotel's amenities!",5,2018,04,28
142,"Great location, beautiful hotel, and AMAZING SERVICE","The Stafford Hotel is such a charming, classic London hotel. It is conveniently located next to Green Park for early morning runs and near great restaurants for lovely evenings out. I stayed in the Carriage House and loved my modern room and amenities. Breakfast was amazing and the drinks at the American Bar were superb. What I especially loved about the Stafford was the service. Everyone was super friendly and attentive, from the doorman, to concierge, to the wait staff, and reservation team. They took care of all of my concerns quickly and thoroughly. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for holiday or work.",5,2018,04,24
142,Old fashioned charm with a modern edge ,"As we arrived our taxi said she’d had the Stafford on her knowledge exam.... old style elegance was her take..... she was right!!
Beautiful and dynamic building with the right level of good style and modern influence 
The suite was stunning , great decor and comfort. You do get what you pay for but hey, we’re only here once so worth the price 

Can not recommend enough.... have heard the Sunday lunch is s great experience will have to try it!!",5,2018,04,22
142,Very British ,"This is a beautiful, very British hotel. The location is so convenient next to Green Park and the tube station. We had booked an Airbnb in Mayfair that turned out to be uncomfortable. In a panic I showed up at The Stafford with my two children. They were so gracious and took us in and gave us a beautiful room.  It was such a relief to stay here after the disappointment at the Airbnb.  I will say this hotel is mostly used by businessmen. Having a woman and two children staying did not seem to be the norm but they did everything they could to make us feel welcome and comfortable.  My daughter has multiple food allergies that they accommodated. The concierge helped us with all our needs around town. I can not thank the staff enough! They saved our trip!  ",4,2018,04,21
142,Birthday theatre weekend,"A truly wonderful hotel ideally placed for all the major sights and attractions . The hotel is beautifully maintained and serviced by Stuart and his attentive staff . A real pearl in the hotel community.  The rooms , food  , attention to detail is a testament to the running of this comfortable “home from home “ in London.      Thank you so very much ",5,2018,04,21
142,Quite the best hotel stay I have ever enjoyed in London,"The Stafford is well located for those with an eye for London's more ticked away treasures. I have stayed in both the Stables and the main house, and have found both well appointed, maintained and entirely glitsch free. The American bar is a true bar devoid of pretence and tinsel - its is a wonderful place to relax into at the end of a long day. All things said, the stand out element of both visits was the immense professionalism and sheer warmth of each and every staff member encountered. I can recommend the Stafford and  its employees more highly to you all.",5,2018,04,19
142,"A delightful, very professionally managed hotel in St James, one of the hearts of London","I've been traveling to London dozens of times over the past 2 decades, and usually stayed at the Connaught or the Berkeley, but decided to try the Stafford, since I'd walked past its front door so many times and it looked very pleasant. It's quiet, tucked away off the main streets, with three buildings built around a cobbled yard. There are three types of rooms -- smaller ones in the main building that also houses the restaurant and bar (some of these can be a bit dark when the weather is awful, which was most of the time this year!), some very pleasant rooms from the converted stable, and then a 6 story structure with larger rooms, mostly suites. The decor is pleasant and in good taste, all of the rooms that I've stayed in (and I've sampled all three types over the last year) are in good shape, and the bathrooms are very pleasant: that oxymoron, ""English plumbing"", is not a problem at the Stafford. The staff are welcoming, efficient, and very accommodating; the concierge(s) are terrific. There is a small but adequate exercise facility ; the main restaurant is very good, and the somewhat quirky American Bar is a pleasant place for drinks, and is always crowded. You can walk to the Green Park tube station in 3 minutes, through a hidden passageway from St James's Place into Green Park, and otherwise exceptionally convenient. I will continue to stay here on my frequent trips!",5,2018,04,13
142,highly recommended,"We stayed at the Stafford London with our 2 kids (10 and 12) for 4 nights. From the first minute, we experienced the great professionalism of the staff. The service is extremely efficient (from the cleaning team, breakfast, concierge, doormen, reception, etc). Professional but still warm and welcoming. The hotel itself is very elegant yet cozy. The location is perfect, as it is very central, but in a small street with absolutely no noise. The Stafford gave us the feeling of true and rare luxury, where elegance meets relaxation. thank you !",5,2018,04,11
142,Perfect Location and Perfect Hotel Personality,My wife and I recently stayed at the Stafford London Hotel.  The hotel was selected by the business I worked with but it is exactly what I would have selected if I had made the selection.  It is located in a perfect location to see many of the London attractions but yet in a location with more than sufficient privacy.  The hotel staff was very personable and attended to every need we had.  We liked the historical feel of the hotel.  We hope to return to the hotel in the future and we would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2018,04,05
142,Birthday treat with friends,We stayed here in december with 6 friends for the first time.  We visit London frequently & this is the first time in the quaint little gem.  I would not hesitate to recommend it.  The rooms were lovely & the bed so comfortable.  The service & drinks were very good & the breakfast was first class.,5,2018,04,05
142,PERFECT!,"I stayed at The Stafford this time round for 15 nights. All perfect as usual, including highly efficient laundry service. Breakfasts always great, including my specially ordered Diabetic jam....THANK YOU. Dinners a delight with wines of quality. Front of house service 100% polite and courteous. American Bar a bit crowded in the evenings, but hey, better popular than empty, with delicious Bloody Marys. Car service always on time with drivers who could get to destinations accurately even if two hours drive into the Hampshire countryside.....ALL PERFECT! THANK YOU!",5,2018,04,02
142,An elegant retreat ,"My husband and I spent three nights at The Stafford and so enjoyed this really special hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated with great curtesy and kindness. We had a generously sized room which was beautifully decorated. The bed was very comfy and I loved the Floris bath products. Always good to have a Nespresso in the room with fresh milk in the fridge. Our room backed out into the Mews and was very quiet as is probably every room in this hotel as The Stafford is at the end of a small cul de sac. 
We loved The American bar. Breakfast in our room was seriously good with wonderfully sourced products like the yogurts. 
The guest relations manager Ned Holder went above and beyond. 
We have been lucky enough to have stayed in many beautiful hotels around the world including The Grand in Cap Ferrat and The George’s V in Paris as well as Claridges and The Mandarin Oriental in London. There was a lovely note in our room when we arrived saying,”welcome home”. After just one night that is how we felt. It isn’t a question of if we go back just when we go back. ",5,2018,03,29
142,60th birthday celebration ,"I don’t usually write trip reports but I felt compelled to do so after visiting the Stafford. 
It is an exceptional Hotel in every way. Stuart and his team are incredible. The moment you arrive they take care of everything. They are friendly, professional and attentive. 
The accommodation is superb; we stayed in a junior suite. It was pure luxury - the bedding and the the bed felt like heaven. Everything you could wish for is supplied in the room. 
We had drinks in The American Bar. It is filled with memorabilia and it was fascinating just reading and looking at all the wonderful pieces they have accumulated over the years. 
Breakfast the next day was delicious. You could have a full array of pastries, breads, ham, cereals, fruits etc. If you wanted a cooked breakfast, again there was a fabulous choice. I had two poached eggs, smoked salmon and avocado, followed by lots of freshly brewed tea.
My only wish was that we could have stayed longer. Having been fortunate to stay at a lot of 5 star hotels in London, this is by far the superior. I can’t wait to go back and visit Stuart and his team. Thank you for Everything. ",5,2018,03,29
142,Consistently excellent,"I have been staying regularly at The Stafford hotel for 8 years now. Sometimes on business, sometimes for pleasure, sometimes alone, sometimes with my wife. The reason I always stay at The Stafford is that in every way it is consistently excellent, from the warmth of greeting on arrival and at check in, to departure. The rooms are all nicely decorated, very comfortable and well maintained. The hotel has a great atmosphere about it, the service excellent. The American Bar is well worth a visit and the Game Bird restaurant is so good one does not want to leave the hotel if one does not have to.",5,2018,03,24
142,What can we say? OUTSTANDING!!!!,"We arrived early afternoon on Saturday, March 17 and our room was not quite ready.  We were escorted to the lounge area to relax and had some tea and biscuits.  We were upgraded to a carriage house room facing the courtyard.  It was quiet, but some evenings, the bar patrons were a little noisy.  The bathroom was wonderful....heated marble floor, toilet/bidet combo and the shower.....amazing!  We received the newspaper daily which was a nice way to start the day.  We had turndown service each night and water was left at the bedside along with slippers. The hotel is a short walk to the Green Park Underground station (we found the ""secret"" passage). No need to use a taxi!
The attention to the small details makes all the difference at The Stafford and we would highly recommend a stay here to others.  We plan on a return trip and we would definitely stay at The Stafford again!  Thank you for making our visit outstanding!",5,2018,03,23
142,Excellent hotel,"Great location within walking distance of several sites. The hotel is situated in a quiet cul de sac which assures you of a good nights rest.
Classic King room was more spacious than I thought. Very good breakfast (buffet and a la carte). Friendly and helpful staff. When returning to London, I would definitely consider this hotel again.",5,2018,03,20
142,Simply perfect,"Perfect location when based in Pall Mall or for St James or Piccadilly. Superb service, quiet cosy rooms, lovely bar area with superb cocktails. My first choice (at the right price). Highly recommend.",5,2018,03,03
142,Excellent place for the stay in London,"It was an incredible experience to stay there. It feels like home. The staff is accommodating and friendly. The rooms are clean, the bar and the restaurant serve delicious food and drinks. The hotel is located near places like The Buckingham Palace, The Big Ben, The Trafalgar Square, so there is only a short walk for great sightseeing. Also, the underground station is just a few minutes away. Highly recommended.",5,2018,03,02
142,Can’t wait to go back!,"We had an incredible six-night stay at this lovely hotel and we are already talking about going back.

We had two rooms in the main house — a classic king and classic queen.  The classic king was lovely with plenty of room for two people and had an extra area for a vanity .  The classic queen was quite a bit smaller but still lovely.  The beds in both rooms were extremely comfortable.  

The service is impeccable — on par with the the best we’ve seen anywhere.  The rooms are checked several times a day and freshened up and towels changed.  (That was wonderful for us as our schedules changed daily but we were always assured of fresh towels!)  If you have a request it is dealt with quickly and efficiently.

We were delighted how quiet the hotel was in the evening making a restful night sleep extremely easy.

We tried most of the hotel’s facilities— the American Bar for drinks in the evening, and the Game Bird for breakfast and afternoon tea— and enjoyed them all.  My husband especially loved the American Bar and said although the drink size was small (compared to American bars),  the drinks were superb.   Do keep in mind though that all these facilities of this five star hotel also have a five star price!

We like to walk a lot and found everything we had planned to do within easy walking distance — Green Park, Hyde Park, the British museum, the Churchill museum, Harrods, the theater,  Bond Street , Chinatown , Piccadilly Street and much more.   

We will definitely be back!",5,2018,02,27
142,Consistently Excellent,"I have lost count of the number of times I have stayed at the Stafford yet every time the hotel never disappoints.  From the staff to the rooms - I have NEVER been given a reason to complain about anything.  

From the fantastic bar to the concierge - the hotel gives you a personalised experience which you will most likely not find at any other comparable hotel in London.

I will not stay anywhere else.",5,2018,02,26
142,Superb Experience!,"My wife and I recently spent two nights at Stafford Bungalows. Everything from the welcome by the staff as we drove up, through to the room, to the food and the attentive service can only described as superb!
We travel widely and have never experienced the unique charm of Stafford providing glimpses of the colonial life of wealthy tea plantation owners. 
",5,2018,02,26
142,Friendly and Unassumingly Superb,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted with big smiles from the doormen and  check-in staff. The Stafford has an aura of calmness yet maintains an undeniably friendly atmosphere that you immediately relax into.
It was our anniversary and in our room waiting for us, a iced bottle of Moet with a note, how thoughtful and very much appreciated by us.
The room, ambiance, cocktails in the American bar and staff made the experience of staying at 'The Stafford' one that we look forward to repeating.",5,2018,02,25
142,Special ,"This was our second stay at the wonderful Stafford hotel.  Once again, the high standards of customer service experienced at the hotel set it apart from some of the others we have stayed.  The staff genuinely care.  In particular, the concierge staff were very supportive.",5,2018,02,24
142,What a comfy bed!,"Stayed one night with my partner for Valentines Day. What a treat! Every single member of staff was wonderful. Room service was a treat - make sure you order the Mac N Cheese! The bed was other worldly I'm surprised I didn't try to take it with me. And the breakfast service was divine.

Would I recommend The Stafford? Every. Single. Time.",5,2018,02,19
142,I just love The Stafford!,"It drips pure class in the classiest part of the classiest city in the world. The food in the Gamebird is sublime. Try the Chocolate block, great wine. Having the most delicious breakfast served in the Suite late on valentines morning was a real treat! Thanks Sarah Pendrigh, you always look after us. Good to catch up with Frank, best Concierge ever.",5,2018,02,15
142,"Fantastic staff, and the best beds in Europe!","Located at the end of a cul de sac, we were greeted on arrival by a team of friendly and enormously helpful bell and reception staff. Room was small but very well appointed, however the bed was the most incredible, soft and comfortable I had encountered. Traditional English breakfast in the restaurant also very memorable with French press coffee by the fire. Will return again!",5,2018,02,15
142,Home from home,Probably one of the best hotels in London. The Service is top and the entire staff almost go out of their ways to make you happy. It has been the 4th time I was there with my wife and will go back again.,5,2018,02,15

I have experienced many 5* hotels in the UK and internationally, and The Stafford will definitely be my go-to hotel in London in the future - it felt like 'coming home'.  

The American Bar and The Gamebird were also spot on - food, drink and service.",5,2018,02,09
142,"5 Star Hotel, 6 Star Management & Staff.","A wonderful hotel full of charm and character. The management and staff worked so hard to ensure our stay was perfect.

142,My First Stay ,"This is a uniquely nice hotel not too big but with all the necessary trimmings. I stayed at their new wing Room 431 a very elegantly decorated and very happy room. The bed was really very comfortable. 

This little treasure is hidden away but still very central London. A walking distance to all the great shopping. 

Hotel has a very nice bar and even a finer restaurant. The service was quick, efficient and courteous. 

A must stay if in London. ",5,2018,02,01
142,Exceptional service,"The service provided by room service, housekeeping and doormen was absolutely perfect. The hotel is centrally located. It is very attractively decorated, both in public areas and in the room where I stayed.",5,2018,01,30
142,A home in London!,"I love staying at The Stafford! I have returned many times in the last four years with my husband and sometimes with our three children. We always get a warm welcome home! The food and room service has always been perfect. The American Bar is cozy, with great food and drinks - and the coffee will put some starch in your spine! The rooms are lovely and comfortable, will blissful heated floors in the bathrooms. The beds are heavenly! The entire concierge team is wonderful, though I have to admit that Peter takes doting care of me! On our last trip my husband and I were there over New Year's Eve. We stayed at the hotel for dinner and dancing and then went to the roof to watch the spectacular London fireworks. We were treated to dessert after the fireworks in our room! We left on New Year's Day during a parade that closed the streets by the hotel. The hotel called a taxi for us and the wonderful bellmen walked us to our taxi through a ""secret route!"" Truly a wonderful experience!",5,2018,01,30
142,30th birthday amazing 😄,"The Stafford is a top class hotel. The location is perfect, so close to Piccadilly but even more close to Buckingham Palace.
Upon arrival we were greeted by amazingly friendly staff who took our bags and made us a cappuccino by a warm open fire.
The Stafford has a true old English style in decor with modern and old chic 
The breakfast in the game bird was another great feature to staying here, you can choose from a huge selection I would highly recommend the full English breakfast.
The American bar is a must when visiting the Stafford, the cocktails on offer and the old American feel really bring the place to life.
I stayed here for my 30th, all the amazing fine details that is put in to the Stafford really makes it special.

142,"Classic, chic, luxurious stay!","We have stayed at the Stafford twice and you can't beat it for its class, calm and luxury. The rooms are spotless, every attention is thought of and the staff are very attentive. Room service was a dream and despite being in the heart of central London, it is tremendously quiet and peaceful. Breakfast is a very luxurious event and I would highly recommend it when you want to treat yourself to a little classic luxury.",5,2018,01,27
142,A great hotel ,"Managed to get a great deal for the hotel on secret escapes and the was fabulous. It is tucked away in quite part Mayfair not far from Green Park.

The service in the hotel was exceptional, from the opening the doors to how clean and tidy the hotel was. The staff were very friendly and couldn’t help enough

The rooms were excellent and were all very well equipped. The rooms were bigger than most for a central London hotel. 

All in a great stay and worth the money for a top London hotel",5,2018,01,26
142,An hidden gem not so hidden! ,"From the door with Charlie to the concierge Peter and Noemi the receptionist, the arrival at The Stafford is splendid. The Game Bird is buzzing with Luca, Susanna, Lorenzo and the unusual Ricky. Benoît and Julien in the bar are killing it, busy in the evening but always try their best to accommodate you. Rooms are perfectly maintained, the housekeeping girls are really kind and not intrusive. If you are having an early breakfast, you might meet the GM or the Hotel Manager, hosting and helping! Great team, and to quote Tina Turner “Simply the best”",5,2018,01,26
142,Outstanding quality & service,"The Stafford is located in the heart of one of London’s most prestigious areas.

The quality of the hotel in terms of service, furnishing, decor and comfort are excellent.

Certainly a hotel that is highly recommended and one we will be returning to

142,Glad we could return,"In May 2017 we started our three week wedding adventure and had such a fabulous experience that we wanted to return someday. Fortunately and unexpectedly the next time was over Christmas 2017. It was so nice to see familiar friendly faces at The Stafford as well as meeting new ones. Christmas lunch was outstanding and one of the most delicious ever! Our favorite spot is the American Bar. We usually had breakfast there and as early risers came down before normal serving time. However, whilst preparing for opening, the staff was happy to provide the very much need first cup of coffee . We notified the hotel that we would be arriving earlier than expected (but before normal check in) Another unexpected pleasure was the room was ready upon our arrival. Can't say enough how memorable our stays at the Stafford have been and looking forward to visit numner3",5,2018,01,18
142,Amazing,We visited the game restaurant in the hotel for our wedding anniversary.  The hotel keeps its classic decor as does the restaurant and it is completely sublime.  A very relaxed luxurious setting for a divine dinner. My husband had the game bird which was so soft and delicate to taste and I had the venison stew which was absolutely fantastic. We enjoyed a lovely bottle of red rounded off with the lemon meringue.  The menu is very British classic with old favourites such as trifle featuring.  Overall we had a wonderful meal and a great anniversary. ,5,2018,01,17
142,We love the Stafford,"An absolute gem of a hotel in a perfect location : quiet, yet within walking distance of many tourist sights, restaurants, shopping, etc. We have stayed here several times over the last few years and always enjoy returning. The staff are very service-orientated, my car was parked for me, our bags taken up to the room and we were given coffee while we waited for our room to be made ready-which was ready at 11.50am!  
A la carte breakfast in the newly-refurbished Game Bird restaurant was a treat with delicious poached eggs, smoked back bacon, sausage, mushrooms and black pudding! Lovely fresh orange juice is poured, good coffee in a cafetiere ( French Press), toast and a buffet of cold items.  
We will return!",5,2018,01,17
142,Top Notch,"I rarely write reviews so bear with me. My college-age daughter and I had originally planned to stay at the London Edition, but changed our minds at the last minute in favor of a more “London” experience. We have stayed at two other boutique hotels in London last year; one in Notting Hill, the other location escapes me. In addition, I have travelled extensively around the world. All this being said, The Stafford is one of the best hotel experiences I can remember. 

The staff was extremely courteous, helpful, and generally pleasant and fun. The room was large and well appointed with every necessity provided, including 2 (!) adapted electrical outlets for US appliances. (no USB ports BTW). The bathroom was all marble with a working towel warmer and incredible water pressure in the shower (just like the old days). The room did not appear to be recently renovated as some others may have been, so there were signs of age, but everything was spotless. 

I must take a minute to talk about the bed since it is something I look for in a hotel. The (king!) bed at The Stafford was incredible. From the mattress to the pillows to the linens and comforter. I️ have experienced the same from much more expensive hotels once or twice before, but for some reason The Stafford’s bed stood out. When you are exhausted from a long day of travel, what a delight. 

We had drinks at the American Bar, but did not eat at the beautiful restaurant. The bar was cozy and not too crowded. Pierre and Ricardo (?) took pride in their mixology and it showed. So fun! We often ordered tea to our room and it arrived in 5-10 minutes. So efficient. 

Lastly, the location of the hotel was perfect. Generally central to our needs. We walked to some favorite spots (Fortnum & Mason). The hotel is next door the The Spencer House. If you are there on a Sunday, I️ highly recommend this one-hour house tour, a highlight of our visit. Getting a black cab took a minute since the hotel is tucked away in a back courtyard, but thus the privacy and quiet of this location. Uber drivers were only minutes away. In addition, across the courtyard was a small tunnel which provides a shortcut to Green Park and the tube station. 

All in all, The Stafford will be our London home. What a find.

142,THIS HOTEL IS 5 STAR PLUS LUXURY,"There's hundreds of hotels in London however we keep returning to the Stafford where we are spoiled by the total luxury and efficiency of the amazing professional attentive staff and management under the overall management of Stuart. The General Manager's Executive Assistant Sarah and Frank the concierge boss have been at the Stafford for decades and certainly know how to personalise things for guests. A lot of people don't know about this ""hidden gem"" of a hotel tucked away in close proximity to Green Park Tube Station and the Mayfair, St James, Piccadilly classy areas. The strapline on the Stafford website "" Stately Five-Star in the heart of London"" sums this place up. It's a must visit when in London and I highly recommend it.",5,2018,01,08
142,A Fantastic weekend,A wonderful weekend at The Stafford. The staff were always helpful and thinking about the guests. The rooms were ideal and the beds extremely comfortable. The staff in the American Bar were as attentive as ever.,5,2018,01,08
142,"Love the intimacy, style, service and location","Fantastic location, beautiful hotel with wonderful feel and amenities and service and perfect place  to check out all of the incredible stores and restaurants nearby. Chutney Mary’s, an iconic Indian restaurant, is a stone throw away.
Highly recommend.",5,2018,01,03
142,"A luxurious, welcoming and beautiful hotel.","Thank you to all at The Stafford for the most exceptional stay in London. A fabulous location was only topped by the wonderful staff, gorgeous surroundings and delicious food.  The charming mews courtyard twinkled with Christmas trees, so unique and special. It certainly lived up to its claim of being one of the finest luxury hotels in London.",5,2018,01,03
142,New Year's Eve stay,Absolutely fantastic.  We were welcomed most warmly and the staff were all extremely pleasant and personable.  The Stafford was immaculate.  American Bar quirky and fun and stayed open even though there was only us in the bar until late.  The room was awesome and we were upgraded (thanks TH)!  Overall a 10 out of 10 experience.  Hope to be back soon.,5,2018,01,03
142,"A classy hotel in the heart of St James, close to the action","Our first stay at this popular hotel In heart of St James. It’s was our wedding anniversary so decided to treat ourselves.

Our room on fourth floor overlooking the front was very comfortable. 

Having recently tried Gamebird ( it was very good) this time we decided to use the Lovely American Bar as our base before we hit theatre land. 

Look forward to a return.",5,2017,12,23
142,"Homely, Christmassy, perfect","We stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we couldn’t have picked a better hotel. The staff were amazing, the hotel was very personal, cosy and had the perfect “non chain” feel. I can recommend a tour of the centuries old wine cellars including WW2 memorabilia, incredible! The rooms were very comfy and had just been refurbished. We would definitely stay here again, thank you to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful.",5,2017,12,17
142,very nice small hotel,"stayed for one night in December 2017. all staff were very friendly and courteous. our room was very comfortable. Nicest hotel we have stayed in London. we had a classic king room with a enormous bed, fairly small bathroom with shower over the bath. very full mini bar (which we did not use but may have on other occasions). very easy to get to from Green Park.",5,2017,12,12
142,Séjour délicieusement British ,"So British! 
Ideal location, friendly welcome, charming bedrooms in the Mews with just perfect bathrooms and beds with a fireplace.
The cosy setting for breakfast and afternoon tea ( both delicious).
As English a bar as one can ever dream of.
Not cheap but worth every penny spent!!",5,2017,12,11
142,A repeat visit was terrific!,"After a long hiatus, we returned to The Stafford for 4 days in late November. We had a spacious room and beautifully updated master bath in the original Carriage House (room 7).  The American Bar is lively and the service friendly yet efficient.  Breakfasts in The Game & Bird were wonderful.  Everyone at The Stafford is professional and no request is too small, it is simply a wonderful hotel with a wonderful team!  And it has an unbeatable location.  We will be back!",5,2017,12,11
142,Excellent as always ,"Our 3rd visit to the Stafford and excellent once again! 

We received a lovely room upgrade to a Mews junior suite. The room was nice, airy, bright and spacious. Very comfortable bed. We’d previously stayed in a deluxe and a suite in the stable part of the Mews- all were excellent but this by far was the best yet 😃

Complimentary teas and coffees, lovely presentation. 

The service was outstanding again, always feeling welcome, like they’re greeting friends. 

Gym has had some more equipment added for strength training. 

Thoroughly recommend staying here if in London",5,2017,12,11
142,Exceeded my expectations...,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Service was very high level, room is comfortable and clean. Breakfast was very tasty and served very well. The atmosphere in the hotel is amazing. You feel like you are a very important person for this hotel. You get a personalized service wherever you go in this hotel. Thank you  for this wonderful experience.
Location of the hotel is very good. In walking distance to Oxford Street, Harrods, Green Park, Hyde Park, Piccadilly Circus, Buchingham Palace, LondonEye etc...",5,2017,12,08
142,See below,"The bedroom was very comfortable - we had a queen-size bed that may have been the most comfortable hotel bed I have stayed in. The room was quiet from the traffic noise point of view, with quiet aircon, but a rumbly toilet extract. Although it went off with the bathroom light switch, you could hear distant rumbles from other bathrooms. 

The public area of the hotel has had a makeover which has taken away the traditional English character. There are now small square brown tables everywhere with no tablecloths.

The service is top class, and the food excellent (except my grapefruit at breakfast tasted as if the peel had been crushed along with the fruit)

There have been big changes to this hotel over the years - the American bar is quite different from the original one. If you are new to the hotel that may not matter at all. If you are returning to an old haunt it may.",5,2017,12,08
142,Tea,"Afternoon tea here was amazing, the service and attention to detail was perfection, the hotel had beautiful Christmas decorations made a perfect afternoon as prices go for London afternoon tea it is really good, the best scones ever!!",5,2017,12,07
142,The Stafford Standard: High In The Best Possible Way,"So you can stay in a large and grand hotel, of which there many and of which many are exceptional. Or you stay a a place like The Stafford, where the only difference will be the absence of distracting bling. The staff here are professional, helpful and friendly. The food is terrific, though I must admit that we only had breakfast in the hotel. The American Bar retains its character after a substantial increase in size of the years. I would particularly recommend the ice cream, which they make on site and is really pretty special. Congrats to the pastry chef who does this! In any case, The Stafford has expanded over the years, which is fine, but the experience has only gotten better. I should know: My first visit was in 1980 or so, then back in the 90s and now yet again. Could not have been more pleased.",5,2017,12,06
142,Beyond Amazed!,"I was lucky enough to have one of the Mews Suites and my stay was unbelievably amazing! For central London, I was amazed by the spacious room and separate living room. With two bathrooms, we never found any issues sharing the space. There was more then plenty of closet space and I definitely felt at ""home"" in the suite. Close by to Piccadilly Circus and the Tube stations, I felt like you couldn't beat the location. the staff continuously went above and beyond to make sure that I had everything I needed, even if it was just a few sightseeing tips! I'll definitely return in the future, because I know with certainty that I can trust the property and it's amazing team!",5,2017,12,06
142,Excellent in every way,"This hotel is very good indeed, excellent in every way.  It is intimate with absolutely excellent service from every member of staff that we encountered.  Our main reason for returning would be the chef who is extremely competent and talented.  The breakfast is of a high standard with each meal individually cooked and the dinner is of superb quality.  The syrup sponge was light and exceptional.  The Dover sole was perfect.  We had a good room with a separate shower cubicle and the wi fi worked well.  This would be my choice in London in future.",5,2017,12,06
142,Simply stunning!,Great service. The American Bar had a brilliant and vibrant atmosphere to enjoy some of the best food and cocktails i have had in central London by far. After my lovely food and drinks i was able to smoke a lovely Cuban cigar outside in their terrace lit up and kept warm with outdoor heaters. i joined a lovely group of gentlemen smoking and the great service continued even though i was outside! Lovely luxurious presence with welcoming staff and i cannot wait to come back. Thank you!,5,2017,12,06
142,"Service, location and niggles","The word ""perfect"" comes to mind each time we stay at The Stafford. The description applies especially to the location (walking distance to almost all of the west end), the staff (unbelievably attentive, helpful and correctly friendly) and the ambiance of the property. The hotel really is a pleasure to stay at and as it claims is ones ""residence while in London."" The staff make it feel like you are at home, little is too much effort and most is preemptively provided. As always there are niggles, and in striving for increasing perfection there always will be: could there be more than one capsule of coffee provided daily for the in-room coffee machine, and could the light switching come with instructions? As you can tell from the seriousness of those niggles staying at The Stafford is being on a high! As an aside, this trip we found that the Events staff more than match the capabilities of the hotel staff as they organized a simply outstanding luncheon party for our extended family.",5,2017,12,04
142,A genuine experience rarely available to mere mortals,"This was a social function in the Stafford Wine Cellar. the surroundings were superb and the food and service just outstanding. Apparently Maggie Thatcher enjoyed evenings here with Ronald Regan. Whether that is true is irrelevant. From the moment you approached & were greeted by the doorman nothing was too much trouble. The food both canapes before and when seated was perfection. This is clearly not a cheap venue and is somewhat hidden away but, as they say, you get what you pay for and this was value for money.",5,2017,11,22
142,Perfectly perfect,"We stayed at The Stafford last week for 5 nights.  From our arrival to departure, the staff were absolutely top-notch.  So kind, helpful, friendly, courteous, and willing to go the extra mile for us - including acknowledging my daughter's birthday with a surprise cake.  Our room was small, but very nicely appointed and beautifully maintained, and perfectly adequate for our needs.  As for the location, I cannot imagine a more central spot for a hotel in London.  Green Park is right out the front door, which was a lovely green space that we enjoyed daily.  All the highlights of London are within walking distance.  When we next come to London, we will certainly return to the Stafford.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,11,19
142,Hidden Treasure,"Located off a side street in St James is the most understated 5* hotel we have stayed in.
The Stafford exudes friendliness, charm and hospitality way above its very close neighbour.
Having spent last Saturday here for my 60th birthday the staff could not have made our stay anymore enjoyable than they did.
From reception through housekeeping, to all the waiting and serving staff, the politeness and genuine desire to please was contagious. It’s almost as though the staff are all shareholders such is the willingness to make the stay a memorable one.
It succeeded with us and other guests we spoke to. The general manager should be both pleased and proud to have such a great team both in front and back of house.
Thanks again for making my birthday a real treat",5,2017,11,14
142,Wonderful stay at the STAFFORD,"My husband and i have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London. Our past 3 Trips  there, we have stayed at The STAFFORD and enjoyed our trip immensely.  We visited at Christmas time which was breathtaking.  The entire hotel is decorated so elegantly and the staff is superb.  They know your name and say “Welcome Home” on your return visits. The dining room menu has been re-done and the food is excellent.  It is a small hotel but large with amenities.  The bar is unique.  The fitness center is quite nice.  All in all, The STAFFORD is a favorite of ours. You will want to return there also.",5,2017,11,11
142,One away from home,"I have stayed many times at the Stafford.It never disappoints.
The warm welcome, the service, the comfortable rooms are consistent with my expectations. The beds are so comfortable, I rate them only second to my own bed at home!
A very British,very lovely hotel to come back to.",5,2017,11,11
142,Home from Home,"Classic King sized room, two day stay in St James location.  This was an unexpected booking, but my word we were blessed.  Making a change from our regular 5* property, due to construction work nearby, we thought we would book with the Stafford.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we got in our cab back to the station, the staff in all areas made sure our stay was truly a home from home.  The quality of customer service, the friendly nature of everyone through to the homely decor, cleaning standards and comfortable traditional pocket sprung bed with (amazingly) comfortable pillows & linen absolutely everything just went to clockwork.  We were pleasantly surprised at how ""unstuffy"" such a prestigious property, in a traditional location performed without any diminution of it's importance or grandeur. The experience only benefited from truly feeling that nothing was too much trouble.  It may be a little more expensive (or a lot less) than your normal ""5*"" choice or indeed some of the properties who ""shout"" about their importance, but we felt this gem was well worth the price. So yes, just once this a hotel truly deserving of it's 5* rating.",5,2017,11,11
142,"The Stafford: ""our (expensive) residence whilst in London""","The Stafford's card reads, actually, ""...my residence whilst in London..."", which is quite appropriate since the hotel provides the sense of security, the comfort and the well-being that we associate with our private residences.  We have stayed at the Stafford before, and will return as long as we can.  The Stafford is expensive, however, and the question of value is, of course, relative.

The Stafford compares favorably with other small luxury hotels in Europe, such as the Christine in Paris, Raphael in Rome, Londra Palace in Venice and Avenida in Lisbon.  No, there is no off-street parking or swimming pool.  The elevator is small.  The executive center is an Apple laptop on a fine desk in the lobby.

It is superbly located near the Ritz and convenient to major attractions and shopping areas.  On the other hand, it protected from the sounds of the city as it is a ""destination"".  Its staff is superbly trained and makes its work appear effortless.

The rooms are elegantly appointed, immaculately clean and meticulously maintained.  The slippers and plush bathrobes are not a surprise, but nevertheless appreciated.

The hotel's restaurant used to be called ""The Lyttleton"", and we thought it was outstanding.  It is now called, after renovations, ""The Gamebird"", and it is still good, but not quite as before.  Something is missing.  Maybe a different chef, a change in menu or kitchen philosophy: it is not the same.  Breakfast is excellent, as good as it gets.  Dinner, way above very good but short of stupendous.  

The American Bar is not to be missed.  It is extremely comfortable and cozy, with good service, and actually superior bar food.  While dinner at Gamebird was approximately $125 per person, with wine, tax and gratuity, a party of four ate at the American Bar for about $40 per person.  Hey, London is expensive, has always been...!

Well, speaking of expenses, during our most recent visit we were charged different sums on successive days for the same room.  We paid $483, $540 and $733 per day, for the same room.  When I inquired about the charges, I was given an explanation that I did not understand, but chose not to pursue the subject.  I suppose we were lucky to check out when we did!

All in all, The Stafford has always been a pleasant experience.  The issue of value, however, is for the individual to determine.  Whatever the market will bear, it has been said of a capitalist system.  We will ask more questions when we book again at The Stafford.  Although we may be able, on occasion, to bear a $733 a night charge, I am not sure we want to do it.",5,2017,11,09
142,Our London Home,"The Stafford offers a beautiful and relaxed place to stay, tucked away in St James's by Green Park - all of the staff could not have been more friendly. Cocktails in The American Bar followed by Dinner in the new Game Bird Restaurant where the food is simply exquisite, what could be better.",5,2017,11,09
142,Luxury in London,"It almost seems totally unnecessary to write anther review for this fine establishment. Tucked away in a quiet cul-de-sac, words like charming, gracious and elegant come to mind. The staff throughout are professional. Breakfast at the Game Bird is a great way to start the day; a nightcap at the American Bar is obligatory (if you have an interest in wine, ask for a tour of the wine cellar, which also includes a historic bomb shelter from WW2). The Stafford is a very special hotel minutes easy walk from Buckingham Palace and St.James Park; Piccadilly and Pall Mall and the west end theatres. My first stay at The Stafford will not be my last.",5,2017,11,06
142,"Elegant, sophisticated, aristocratic English hotel","The Stafford is in the heart of the St James's district in West London, an area historically known as an aristocratic neighborhood.   Indeed, the Stafford lives up to the reputation.  It exudes style and sophistication.  The rooms are large, luxurious, with a classic English decor.  Staying there makes you feel like an elite, or perhaps like a Kingsman (filmed across the street)
The staff is so attentive and subservient, that as an American, I felt a hint of unease.  They are clearly accustomed to a privileged, older, wealthy clientele, but they were still able to make me and my family feel welcome.
The location is also excellent, being walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar square, Piccadilly Circus, Theater.  A short cab or Underground ride will get you to the museums, and the many other attractions in Westminster.  Shopping is an easy walk, especially if one is in the market for fashion (perhaps the best Mens' apparel shops in the world).
It is an expensive hotel, but you do get a lot for your money, including wifi, excellent staff, nice rooms, etc.  The restaurant is also excellent.",5,2017,11,06
142,Our favorite London hotel!,"The Stafford is our go-to hotel when in London! To start, the location is perfect for shopping, theater, or museum-going. During our most recent stay at The Stafford we celebrated my wife's birthday. We were fortunate to be given a beautiful upgraded junior suite room that nearly made us want to stay in and not leave the hotel.The staff, who are always friendly and helpful, made this visit especially memorable -- thank you all! The dining room staff are attentive without being overly solicitous -- always just the right touch! Ned, the concierge, had arranged for a special birthday dessert for my wife after our dinner at The Game Bird and for a beautiful flower arrangement for our room.  We can wholeheartedly recommend The Stafford and look forward to another visit in the not too distant future.",5,2017,11,04
142,Great hotel - superb staff and facilities,This was my first time in The Stafford and what a gloriously enjoyable experience it was. The staff in all departments were exceedingly helpful and pleasant and always willing to assist. The rooms were very comfortable with all necessary facilities readily available. Over my three nights in the Stafford I had breakfast and Dinner - the standard of the food was exceptionally high and their wine cellar was to die for. One was looked after every minute of the day - first class all round.,5,2017,11,02
142,too good to be true,"what a great stay at the Staffort Hotel London. The reservation was super easy, the staff was helpful with London tips before I even arrived and so was was the whole arrival in the hotel. Seeing how beautiful decorated the lobby and restaurant is, I assumed the hotel room was like this and so it was, beautiful decorated and furnished - feeling to be at home! 

The American Bar is such a nice bar with delicious food and drinks. the perfect bar for a great evening in central London. 

I really have to thank the whole staff in this amazing hotel!! I will definetly come back soon and will recommend it. Many thanks to the whole staff.",5,2017,10,31
142,3 lovely nights in London,"We greatly enjoyed The Stafford for three nights in room 100.  Our upgraded room was lovely and spacious with its own patio.  Service was friendly, attentive and professional.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and beautifully arrayed in The Game Bird.  Hotel location is convenient to West End theatre, sightseeing and shopping.  Not to be missed is a drink in the iconic American Bar.  The overall feeling of the hotel was that of a luxurious English country manor.",5,2017,10,28
142,"""Cloud"" beds and Cocktails","Another wonderful stay at our home away from home in London. Again Frank, Sarah, Ned, Giorgio  (and the better 'ole) and all the team provided  us with a stay scattered with those small pleasures.. after a flight from USA and Oz.   The dinner at the the Game Bird (try the fat pidgeon), breakfast with that lovely blood sausage, and the bath, that  scrummy bed cushion..... oh how lovely. Each morning Green Park, gave access to my wonderful walk... past Buck palace, and over to Hyde Park to build that appetite.  Stuart, the GM, has pulled together a great team to serve us at this most perfecty located Hotel. I could have just stayed in! See you again soon guys.  K and D P.S. thanks for the chat and drink on our final night. Oh and book for the restaurant as it fill quickly. have a great stay.",5,2017,10,25
142,You can't get better service ~ food~ value ~ settings I would challlenge anyone to find a restaurant to better it,"Dears Sirs 
In one way I do not want to write this review its so fantastic to visit And  you are shall I say the staff/ team make you feel the most important person or group in the Stafford restaurant at that moment because the service and food is the best in town ,
I am worried that if to many people realise what they are missing it could spoil the ambience with to many bookings 
And then when I need to return it's full which will soon 
But my guess the management would not let this happen",5,2017,10,21
142,My Favourite ,"The Stafford is my favourite hotel in London.   The service and attention to detail is superb.  Truly, British Experience.  The American Bar is must have experience here. You have to see it to understand.   
The Junior Suite in the Muse area is a nice experience.   ",5,2017,10,19
142,Perfect London Oasis,"Ok, so let's break this down into what you're probably interested in.  

Location - Great, entrance on both sides to 2 different main streets, easy walking to Hyde Park, and decent walk to Buckingham, Big Ben, and much of Mayfair

Accommodations - Superb, we stayed in Carriage House rooms, charming, spacious, clean, easy plug locations and USB ports, and an awesome bathroom with 2 sinks, heated floors (mind blown, I never thought of that!) and a toilet from the future.

Service - Exactly what you're hoping for.  From moment of arrival, to every question or request the good people up front are on point, friendly and professional.  I got the feeling that taking care of me was remedial and easy, almost like they wanted to say, ""cmon that's all you got?  Challenge me!""  Alpay in restaurant, went above and beyond and we didn't ask for it.  Roberto at the American Bar helped make our evening cocktails a joy.  Charlie up front, you rock and I unfairly wished you never got a day off.  He was a perfect greeting for our arrival and so helpful getting us recommendations and even got us last minute reservations without us asking.  To the gentleman who took care of me at check in and check out and making sure we were settled, I'm embarrassed I forgot his name, because he was terrific.  Seriously I could write several paragraphs on this section but I think you get the point.  There wasn't a bad egg in the group and I'm rudely leaving out many people.

Setting - the courtyard which hosts some of the outdoor tables and pseudo private back entrance is an oasis.  Sitting there in the evenings enjoying a drink, and talking with all the other patrons, you forgot about the madness outside the walls that is London.  A perfect way to wind down a busy day.

Restaurants - Not that you're hurting for dining options in London, but rest assured breakfast was delicious and I ended up eating far more calories than intended every morning, see my review on the Game Bird for dinner, in summary it's an excellent example of fine dining with a surprise value IMO.

If and when I return to London, it is here I will stay.  ",5,2017,10,19
142,The Epitome of Hotel Service and Care,"Wrapped up our two-week UK tour with a four-night stay at the Stafford.  Could not have ended it with a better hotel choice.  Elegant, quiet, spotless.  And the service was extraordinary.  The staff has an uncanny knack of knowing what you need before you've formed the question!  From the initial check-in and concierge assistance to the nightly turn-down service of our room, our stay was like a dream.  

The only negative?  Having to leave.",5,2017,10,15
142,Luxury Hotel,"I was in London to attend a wedding with my daughter and wanted to stay in a classic luxury British Hotel. After reading several reviews and listening to friends recommendations, I chose The Stafford. The Stafford is truly a wonderful place to stay.  Our spacious room was beautiful with a very comfortable bed and spotlessly clean. A perfect place to unwind after a hectic day. The staff are gracious and very accommodating. The service and atmosphere of the restaurant and bar are excellent. Lastly, the location of the Stafford is ideal for everywhere you might want to go in London. It's an easy walk to historical sites, shopping, restaurants and the theatre but also very close to a tube or bus stop. I will definitely stay there when I return to London.",5,2017,10,15
142,If you want to be treated like royalty in London . . .,"Well, let me just start by saying that as four exhausted travelers ambled in to the Stafford hotel in London after ""the red eye"" from the States, we were instantly lifted by the warmth and enthusiasm of the staff. We were treated like royalty, escorted over to a seating area while waiting for our turn in the queue to check in. Ned was a total blessing - arranging for some coffee and cocoa to warm us.  He was interested in hearing about our trip and made a point to greet the children, which I thought was noteworthy. Our server also brought some delicious cookies for the children (wish I had gotten his name as he was most kind throughout our stay). 

The rooms are lovely and clean. My husband and I stayed on the 5th floor in the main guest house in a room that connected to our children's room.  We could catch a glimpse of the London Eye from one of them.  I found that our room was quite spacious and always kept quite clean and refreshed.  My daughter was delighted that there were small robes just their size - she felt so grown up!  The rooms do have a/c - something that our tour guide mentioned was nice in the summer!

We dined in the Game Bird each morning (the french toast is divine!!!  And I am still dreaming of the wonderful bowl full of fresh berries!!!)  

The hotel's location is OUTSTANDING.  So close to the Tube and within a mile of several sites including Trafalgar Square, St. James Park/Green Park, the SE corner of Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace (the list could go on).  They have a jogging map at the front desk if you ask for it!

The staff is courteous and welcoming -  the general manager, Stuart, made sure that we were all set for a lovely stay.  As I mentioned, Ned was just wonderful!!!  He left the children a little surprise after our ""Harry Potter"" tour.  

We had a lovely stay and hope to return again someday!!!!",5,2017,10,10
142,A wonderful London hide away,"The Stafford is tucked away in a side street off St James’s. It is a beautifully maintained old Edwardian building. From the moment one arrives at the front door, the staff make every effort to be helpful and friendly, and anticipate the guests’ every need. The hotel has a quiet and dignified feel like a private club. The rooms are comfortable and quiet.

We stayed there over our wedding weekend and the staff made us feel totally at home. They left a bottle of champagne in our room, provided us with a car to the register office, and presented us with a congratulations cake. Small touches which made our visit so special. 

We dined informally in the friendly American Bar and the food and wine were excellent. 

We cannot recommend the Stafford more highly.",5,2017,10,08
142,Great location,"The hotel has great location, near Picadily street but still in a very nice and small street connect by an alley to Green Park. The place is ellegant and well decorated, the room very nice and super comfortable. Great bed! The only thing that I didn't like very much was breakfast , service was slow and the food wasn't that good. Room service was excellent and the staff is all very polite and efficient.",4,2017,10,03
142,Wonderful stay in London!,"We recently returned from a visit to London and had an absolutely fabulous experience at The Stafford Hotel in Mayfair.  The Stafford prides itself on making their guests feel at home with their excellent service, lovely accommodations and excellent dining experiences. We stayed in one of the newly renovated Carriage House Jr. Suites which was large and very well appointed.  The newly completed ""Game Bird"" restaurant was amazing as was the American Bar for more casual food.  Mr. Stuart Proctor, the very present and charming GM is very warm and welcoming,  as is Frank Laino,  Executive Concierge who can assist with your very request.  This is truly your ""home away from home"".  Very high level in all aspects.",5,2017,10,03
142,"The Best Hotel in London, The Stafford","My last stay ... 9/19/17 thru 9/29/17 ... was my third at this absolutely wonderful hotel!!  This was a special trip for my daughter's birthday and her first time to London.  The hotel accommodated us with a junior suite and executive king in Rooms 415 and 416, the ambiance and charm of which were amazing!   The staff is to be commended for their continued excellent service and attention to customer satisfaction ranging from Frank Laino, Head Concierge and his wonderful staff...especially Assistant Concierge Peter Knell, who arranged transport for us to and from the theatre, airports, took care of restaurant changes, etc., as he had done in my previous two visits with my grandsons..., the wonderful restaurant staff, one of whom remembered where I sat two years earlier with my grandson for breakfast, and Charlie, the fabulous doorman who greeted us with the brightest smiles and tips on what we might enjoy each day while the weather was so beautiful.    The breakfasts are outstanding, as is afternoon tea, and the restaurant and American Bar are not to be missed.   The best part was seeing old friends on their staff, some of whom have been at the hotel for 40+ years!  Its location is outstanding...a two minute walk thru Green Park to Buckingham Palace and a two minute walk to Piccadilly to pick up the Green Park station (Jubilee Line) tube as well as the bus.  The hotel is on a quiet street in the midst of so much activity that makes London so wonderful.   I have told my travel agent to recommend The Stafford to guests who are looking for the most wonderful accommodation experience, and quite clearly, I will be staying there again on my next visit.",5,2017,10,03
142,"Great British Hotel, The Stafford London","On a quiet street in St James's is a great British hotel, the Stafford London. London streets can be very busy but the Stafford London sits in a cul-de-sac that eliminates the street clatter and the crush of vehicle and foot traffic. Even still the hotel a very short walk to Green Park via a pedestrian passage with the Tube station and Buckingham Palace just 5 minutes away. 
Once inside the hotel she shows her five star ranking. Rooms are well appointed, comfortable and welcoming. The restaurant, Game Bird and the American Bar provide fine dining with excellent food and drink.  
Above all it was the staff that made the stay at the Stafford a memorable experience. They were all professional, attentive and always available to help in any way especially the registration staff and the doormen.",5,2017,09,30
142,Historical building in the center of London with nostalgic management,"The traditional entrance was followed by a freezing reception. Even if we had shown a prestigious membership to a British institution the reception wanted to charge the credit card with a huge deposit for our future consumption at the hotel bar and restaurant.
After protesting they didn't charge us. When we finally entered the room we were underwhelmed by the tiny dimensions - we were never more than one foot away from the bed. The bathroom was very tiny too, and additionally there were rust spots in the bathtub.
On top of all that the walls were covered with old-fashioned water color of magnified insects  - not our cup of tea ...",3,2017,09,28
142,This must be what it feels like to be the queen,First class experience from the moment I first contact this property. Notable professionalism and warmth from every staff member I encountered. Rooms that were simply stunning with a mix of traditional and modern touches done just right.,5,2017,09,24
142,Excellent room,"The room (COPENHAGEN) we stayed was excellent and I like the bath room very much, expecially the floor of the bath room is warm (with heating system) and is very comfortable, the bathtub is big enough and I enjoy the bathing very much. The staff are friendly and helpful that help us to buy the tickets of Les Miserables !",5,2017,09,06
142,totally fabulous experiece,"Where do I start?  Well why not start with a Negroni in the American Bar to start soaking up the atmosphere of cool sophistication but laid back chic simultaneously.    
Follow this with a meal at the Game Bird Restaurant.  Superb service and hats off to the best Sommelier in London.  

Share the Smoked and Cured as a starter.  The Salmon is carved at your table and sprayed with a whisky infusion.  You will be treated to  an eclectic mixture of other delicious seafood as part of the dish.

I had another starter as my main course  - the Dressed Devon Crab light and gorgeous.  this was a perfect meal with great variety and I could not manage any more food. For the wines to accompany just ask Ginos' advice.",5,2017,09,05
142,Caroline ,"Wonderful Hotel, First Class !
My husband and I recently stayed at The Stafford.  What we experienced was a hotel that is just fantastic.  The staff, especially Sarah Pendrigh, were amazing.  Everyone was professional, courteous and friendly, and they met our every need.  

Sunday lunch in The Game Room is not to be missed, excellent. 
Breakfast was as good, offering a wide selection to suit every taste, even boiled eggs and soldiers, how truly British!  

But unlike other London hotels of this quality, there is a warmth and friendliness at its heart.  It's interior is intimate, a place where you can sit, relax and enjoy a delicious cocktail in the unique American Bar.  
The courtyard is lovely too. 

The whole team should be very proud and complimented because nothing was ever too much trouble.  Our room was beautiful, so many lovely touches, sheer luxury.
Thank you to all at The Stafford, you are fantastic!  ",5,2017,09,05
142,Exemplary!!,"We stayed here for 3 nights in July.
I loved the hotel from the moment we arrived.  Check in was fairly swift. We found the staff friendly and helpful.  I had booked 2 standard rooms, for ourselves and our daughter. They were small but in a compact and bijou way. Cosy and luxurious!!  Bear in mind we are in central London, the rate for both rooms was reasonable.
We sat and had drinks in the beautiful courtyard and then we chose to have a light bite to eat in the American bar. Our meals brought to us on padded trays, quirky and a great idea.
The following morning, we ordered some early Tea and juice, the hotel included The breakfast basket pastries in the order...I couldn't resist...they were so delicious, like they had just come straight from the oven...they probably had!! We asked them not to bring them the following morning, not because we didn't like them but because we did, too much!! 
We had a great few days in London sightseeing and taking in a show. 
The hotel has a small footpath opposite which leads straight on to Green Park. 
It is so ideally situated and yet, when you are sat in the courtyard it feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of Central London.
I hate big corporate hotels and the Stafford was a fantastic find. 
I wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else when we are next in London!!",5,2017,08,25
142,So good!,What a wonderful hotel. Location is so central yet tucked away in a quiet street. Bed was very very comfortable and breakfast was delicious. American Bar is a delight. What sets the Stafford apart from the rest is the consistent high level of service. We all loved the Stafford and its staff and we will be back! ,5,2017,08,24
142,Wonderful stay ,From the moment we arrived at the Stafford we were greeted with a warm welcome and the staff were friendly and efficient from start to finish. The location is perfect in the centre of London close to the theatre district and in easy walking distance of the main attractions. The breakfast deserves a special mention especially the muesli and the baked beans. The tarte tatin was also amazing. The room was modern and nicely decorated with a wonderful bathroom and extremely comfortable bed. I would not change a thing.,5,2017,08,24
142,Excellent 5 Star Hotel,"Great location, close to everything!  They have a superb staff, very knowledgeable and can help with suitcases. They also have an excellent breakfast served in the Dining Room.  Easy walk to subway, would highly recommend!",5,2017,08,23
142,Charming Property in Quaint Location.,"This charming hotel is accentuated by the attentiveness of the staff.  The rooms in the new building were spacious and modern.  The location, at the end of a dead-end street, is close to a former home of Winston Churchill.  They are very close to Green Park and a short walk to many London attractions.  The breakfast was superb and The American Bar is a lively place to visit in the evening.  Great hotel!",5,2017,08,21
142,Game on! ,"Grouse season was just underway when my Dad and I visited recently. This was by far the best choice of restaurant for this occasion and cuisine. My Dad is a huge fan of game and the grouse far exceeded expectations. Kicked off with a French 75 at the restaurant bar, perfect start, great contemporary artwork on the walls, chose a great bottle of red from the very sizeable wine list to accompany our grouse. Which was cooked sympathetically and taken off the bone and accompanied by the slow cooked legs and traditional garnish. The bread sauce not too overly spiced so the flavour of the meat shone through. The accompanying red wine sauce I think is the best I've ever had. My Dad was very pleased indeed. Brilliant English desserts for afters and a decent old fashioned in the kooky American bar finished off a really enjoyable evening. The service was really personable and informal and chef James took the time to pop over for a chat. My Dad is already planning a return visit for his birthday and we can't wait to see what exciting things James and his team have up their sleeve for the upcoming menu. ",5,2017,08,19
142,Charming place,An elegant place with huge  charm. Great staff make you feel really at home. I actually think it is hard to beat this place  to stay in central London. There is a great bar and the rooms are well-appointed. If they bothered to make the restaurant special and worth dining in beyond breakfast  it would be perfect. This is a very good hotel which could be great.,4,2017,08,17
142,Traditional top-end hotel,"This is in a great location in central London and within walking distance of many museums, theatres and restaurants.

It is hard to fault the overall service from arrival to departure and the staff were helpful at all times. However it got off to a bad start when trying to arrange a reliable early check-in time by email. It was unsuccessful and the standard suggestion is to 'book another night'.For the price we paid, the bedroom was comfortable, but the bathroom was in need of refurbishment and the shower was below par. 
The bedr",4,2017,08,17
142,A delightful haven near Piccadilly,"The restaurant at the Stafford Hotel has recently undergone a major refurbishment and a new approach to fine dining. Judging by our visit, the improvements are well justified and the service, in particular, was of the highest standard. 

I cannot recollect ever being better looked-after for lunch from the moment of arrival to settling  the bill and departing: we were escorted by the concierge, greeted by the restaurant manager, served lunch by two staff, served  wine by another, brought our desserts by a fourth and our bill presented by a fifth. Everyone was exceptionally pleasant and attentive without being over familiar.

The Market Lunch (fixed price: choice of 3 starters, 3 mains and 3 desserts) was excellent value for such beautifully cooked and presented dishes. I have to say that the Lemon Posset was one of the best sweets I have had in a restaurant for a long time.

The Stafford is a haven of peace - the epitome of a discreet, quintessentially English hotel, perfectly situated in a quiet enclave of St James's - only a few hundred yard from bustling Piccadilly.",5,2017,08,15
142,Afternoon tea ,"Four of us had the afternoon tea as a birthday treat. Two types are offered with a good selection of beverages. We were sat at a cosy site although a little too near the busy thoroughfare, which was the only downside to an otherwise near perfect experience. The service is outstanding. The staff work very hard to ensure everything is to your liking. Obviously very highly trained and to a very high standard. Their dress code is pleasing as is the really nice fabrics, seating and the use of colour throughout the area we sat in. The food is very nicely presented and tastes and looks good. We were not rushed or felt any pressure to move on and spent a very pleasant afternoon and early evening in this very nicely appointed hotel. The toilets are very nice and clean. I would recommend this experience. Service is included in the bill and a 25% discount can be found. ",5,2017,08,14
142,Almost way above average but minor misses in a few areas...,"Classic hotel with professional staff...Door and reception sets the tone.  They are very good.   
1) Greeted by name at our late check-in.
2) Late food and seating was arranged in bar 
3) Comfortable room size and king bed was quite comfortable
4) Aknowledged by staff throughout our stay.
5) Loved the back entrance for tube, bus, tourism  convienence.
  
Details count:
1) Smoking staff at far back/mews entrance.  Staff should smoke elsewhere or ciggie cans provided...ciggie stepped out onleft on the ground ( seemed like it got swept up every other day).  Guests shouldn't walk by them smoking.  Rear entrance is still an entrance.
2) Carpet was kinda worn in areas of our room (116).
3) Maid twice wanted to enter to clean first day even though newspaper was still hanging ftom door at 9ish.",4,2017,08,14
142,Refined,"We were lucky enough to stay at The Stafford overnight. What a lovely hotel, centrally located, and virtually every whim taken care of.  The hotel is literally 2 minutes walk to Green Park tube.

The hotel itself is grand traditional English, warmly decorated, and has a nice feel to it.  There is the main restaurant for refined English food, and The American bar, adorned with traditional American post war photographs and memorabilia.  I should mention the cocktail menu is outstanding!

Our room was large, with bath and shower, television with a wide selection of modern movies on demand, nespresso machine, and a very large bed! Attention to detail was soot on, with virtually everything you need provided.  If not, room service can accomodate.  Overall very comfortable, and room service breakfast was excellent, and more than enough for 2 people! Well worth the price!",5,2017,08,14
142,Lunch,"Had a wonderful lunch for my birthday celebration with my lovely son. A couple of drinks in the American Bar beforehand (lovely nibbles included with nuts, crisps and olives) and then had the Market Menu in the dining room. The salmon tartare was sublime and my son had a delicious pâté, Then tomatoes and mozzarella salad and a scallop cerviche. For mains I had a fish pie and my son had the chicken. We were pretty full by now, but the chef sent out a complimentary chocolate cake with strawberries and a hand written 'happy birthday' complete with candles and the waiting staff had a good go at singing birthday greetings. Just lovely, staff marvellous, chef James Brown was brilliant and thank you to all who made it a meal to remember!",5,2017,08,06
142,Gamebird restaurant,"First impressions is a elegant, first class hotel was pleasantly surprised to find a menu of great British traditional food. Comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff and a good choice of food to cater for vegetarians and 2 happy fish & chips eaters. Treacle pudding with custard just the job and a lovely surprise treat to finish.",5,2017,08,06
142,Beautiful property with friendly staff!,"Came here after we were rudely dismissed and treated poorly at The Duke and we're so glad we did!! Beautifully decorated with a cool bar and outdoor space to boot! Friendly, warm and welcoming staff from the darling doormen to the staff at the American bar! Fun drinks and yummy food! Glad we came and thanks to all there for being so kind and nice. Refreshing after being treated so poorly at The Duke . Kudos!!! ",5,2017,08,04
142,Outstanding!!,"This is our second stay at The Stafford, which my husband booked for my birthday!

From the moment we arrived, the Stafford exceeded all of our expectations- the room was fab (we stayed in a deluxe king room), great amenities- complimentary teas and coffees and free premium films. We were able to check in early (1pm- check in is from 3pm) and left to go exploring. When we came back, the hotel had left a lovely birthday surprise for me. The brownie was to die for! 

The gym is compact but has 1 of everything e.g. Bike, treadmill, cross trainer, rower and weights (machines and free weights)

Room was very quiet and overlooked the courtyard. The hotel were never intrusive and when we placed the 'do not disturb' sign on the door, housekeeping very discretely slipped a card under our door with the number to call if we wanted our room to be made up/ turned down. 

Last morning there, we asked the hotel to arrange a taxi for us to Paddington but the hotel kindly offered to take us in the hotel car- a very luxurious BMW. 

I felt very spoiled. Thank you Stafford for making my birthday feel so special! ",5,2017,08,04
142,The Stafford London: The Game Bird,"A lovely gem in St. James. Perfectly crafted Chicken Kiev and delicious fish pie. Everything was perfect,including the service. There was a wide selection of salmon which we didn't have a chance to try. Next time. ",5,2017,07,24
142,Great Location and Beautiful Property,"We stayed at the Stafford Hotel for 3 nights in a classic king room. The room was a bit on the small side (especially with 2 suitcases) but it had a high ceiling, so it didn't feel small. We had a wonderful comfortable bed!  A/c worked great, which was good because it was hot and humid in London. Great location, next to Green Park, St. James Park and the tube, 5 minutes walk to Shepherd Market, where there are great ethnic restaurants (Persian, Lebanese, French) as well as several pubs. Can walk to Westminster and Parliment House, and Buckingham Palace. 

The service in the hotel was beyond our expectations, especially Peter, the concierge. After we got on the plane, my husband realized he had forgotten to pack some medication, which he takes daily. He quickly emailed the hotel and asked if they could help with locating a doctor.  By the time we arrived, Peter had already contacted a doctor, and the doctor was on the phone with my husband within 10 minutes of checking into our room. He called a script in to a nearby pharmacy, and the meds were delivered to our room in the hotel about an hour later.  We were most appreciative and impressed!

We had dinner one night at the Game Bird, the formal restaurant in the hotel. We also had great service there from our waiter. I had the Dover sole and it was so good!  My husband had the fillet, which was done the way he likes it.  A bit on the expensive side, but to be expected in a hotel restaurant. 

Breakfast in the American Bar on the outside patio was a completely different experience. The patio was full of guests, and there were only 2 waitresses. We were seated at a table a ways away from the entry to the hotel/restaurant, and after waiting for about 10 minutes for someone to come over, we moved to a recently vacated table closer in.  Again, we waited for a menu, and waited more for coffee/tea.  We heard the people at the table next to us complaining that they had been waiting for 45 minutes for their breakfasts, and we got worried. Finally, so many people were complaining that one of the supervisors came outside, and then got more waiters to pick up the service. They definitely had a problem with the service that day, which you wouldn't expect in a hotel like the Stafford.",5,2017,07,21
142,Simply Perfect.,"The Stafford London was exactly what I had hoped for.  Our stay at the hotel did not disappoint. The location was perfect for exploring London, located on a small quiet street, a beautiful private courtyard to enjoy a glass of wine.  We enjoyed a light breakfast in the courtyard -- wonderful way to start the day  The staff is professional and friendly.  Our room was a jr suite in the Mews, on the 5th floor.  A quiet, large, very comfortable and luxurious room.  It was exactly as described on their website.  The bathroom was a pleasure!  Two large stand alone sinks, separate shower and large soaking tub.  The courtesy car to the airport was an added pleasure.  We enjoyed dinner at  The Game Bird -- expertly prepared and beautiful presentation.  We peeked into the American Bar and walked around looking at all the photos, but since the weather was so hot when we were there we choose to have our drinks in the courtyard.  I would definitely stay again and highly recommend The Stafford London and their restaurant The Game Bird.",5,2017,07,19
142,Mandy ,"Wow wow wow this hotel is heaven and arguably one of the best. 
Attentive, friendly , knowledgable and polite staff who all go the extra mile to help you.
The rooms have everything you would need and the beds are just like sleeping on a cloud. 
The location is perfect and central for everything.
Love the bar and the courtyard perfect on a sunny day.
The food is gorgeous and the breakfast 😍well is one word .....Amazing.
I would recommend this hotel ten times over and I can't wait to stay again.
Definitely in my top list of hotels to stay. ",5,2017,07,19
142,Lunch in the sun at the American Bar,"Really enjoyed our lunch in the sun - a total joy to find such a lovely peaceful spot only minutes away from the noise of Piccadilly. Top-notch service, tasty food, and helpful staff inside when we wandered about after finishing our meal. Would love to stay there one day!",5,2017,07,17
142,Let down by rooms,"10/10 for service. The staff are really lovely. 

10/10 for common areas. Really special. 

I however can not stay at this hotel again. The rooms are simply too basic and poor. I was on 6th floor, the rafters. The room had a tiny ceiling height. Had I been 6ft it would have been a genuine issue. 

The room is dowdy and not that well maintained (cupboard doors didn't open well). 

The bathroom was so small and the bath/shower so cramped I couldn't stand up in it (and it made the floor akin to a swimming pool). 

The rooms let the whole place down. 

They also don't have a hotel car which other hotels do and it's just sub optimal for the money. 

Great staff. But better places for the same buck",3,2017,07,17
142,Simply. A great London hotel. Unmatched.,"A complete service experience that amazes and delights the guest. The lobby is
gracious and welcoming while offering  the best of advice and directions. All my
questions and requests were addressed and satisfied in very good fashion.
The rooms are beyond comfortable and luxurious. Linens and bedding are first
class.
Gamebird is a huge addition with a welcome bar and dining room. The food is excellent.
Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. The American Bar is still the place and the terrace finishes it
all off. A thank you to staff. All the staff.",5,2017,07,12
142,Exceptional Week In London,"My wife and I just wound up an exceptional week in London. Without question, our delightful stay at the Stafford Hotel contributed greatly to our overall experience. The service, dining and very British ambience were second to none. It's truly a home away from home and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in London but at the Stafford. The Pimm's Cup served in the American Bar is most refreshing!!",5,2017,07,10
142,Quietude in London,"A special place.  It is hard to believe that a hotel so near Piccadilly could be more serene, restful and quiet.  The staff uniformly is well trained, solicitous and professional.  The main building is a truly English feel.  The breakfasts are outstanding--more than one can reasonably eat--and all good.  Would definitely return.",5,2017,07,09
142,"Beautiful hotel, prime location","Stayed 2  nights. Was upgraded to larger room with a very nice view of their carriage house and courtyard.  Beautiful rooms, top-notch service in dining room and hotel. Location is on a quiet street, but directly across this quiet street is a little passageway that leads directly into Green Park and central London.  Wonderful!  The only disappointment was their martinis are tiny.",5,2017,07,09
142,"Classy, timeless","Great service all day long with a lovely, classy bar downstairs. The location couldn't be any better, and the staff were lovely and always had fantastic recommendations and advice. I can't think of a better way to explore the beautiful city.",5,2017,07,09
142,Gracious Oasis,"Every aspect of The Stafford is exceptional; from the overall ambiance, room accommodations and staff made my week long stay a pleasure. The thoughtful attention to detail creates a gracious oasis. The rooms are meticulously clean. Twenty-four hour access to the gym is a plus. I look forward to returning to the Stafford on my next visit to London.",5,2017,07,09
142,Service at The Stafford,My family recently stayed at The Stafford in London.  The hotel is an absolute gem located in the heart of London.  Every hightlight in London is either walkable or accessible via the Greenpark Tube stop.  In addition to The Stafford's classic English style the concierge staff are the best.  They were extremely helpful in securing dinner reservations and assistance in any way.  The bellmen and reception were also very friendly and could not have done more to make our trip memorable.  I would highly recommend staying at the Stafford.,5,2017,07,07
142,Lovely place,"We have been to last week's dinner, lovely place in the heart of London with tradition and English style. We ate a great fish starter, served with home sauces, and then at the waiter's tip we took a good quality sole and cod . We felt pampered from the beginning to the end of the dinner, from the staff and especially from the restaurant manager, a great person. We highly recommend, even just for a drink, we saw a beautiful lounge room.",5,2017,07,05
142,Outstanding hotel and superb staff - thank you!,"We stayed as a family of 3 in a superior/deluxe room with a rollaway bed for our young daughter.  

The room was spotlessly clean and attentively attended throughout our stay, so much so that we never needed to request anything additional.   The bed was wonderfully comfortable (as we later found out in 3 other hotels around the country, this is not something upon which one can rely).  Everything was in beautiful condition, easy to use and perfect for our needs as a family.   

Desk and door staff went above and beyond at all times in their courteous and professional assistance.  We felt as if we were returning home every time we returned to the hotel after a busy day of exploring the capital.  

This was by far and away our best hotel experience in England during our stay and we will definitely recommend The Stafford to our friends and visit again ourselves in the future.",5,2017,07,05
142,Terrible - Rooms are small + hot,"Rooms are tiny. 
With a/c on cold, our room was really warm. Tough to sleep through the night. Disappointing for th price. Staff not particularly receptive. 
For the money it costs, you could stay in far nicer places.",1,2017,06,28
142,A week at The Stafford with family!,We just spent a week at The Stafford with family (grandparents and children-the whole 9 yards). It is a small hotel in a great location. The Spencer house (Princess Diana's family house) is on the same street. The hotel is in its own little nook and in a traditional part of London. You can cut through to Green Park which gives you quick access to the tube if you want it.  All of the employees at The Stafford were very attentive and kind. We had a suite in the main house and it was beautiful. It even had fresh flowers. Buckingham Palace is a 5 minute walk. Leichester Square is a 20 minute walk.  I would definitely recommend The Stafford!,5,2017,06,24
142,Fabulous Hotel,"Our stay at The Stafford was truly fantastic. The rooms were lovely, and the bed was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in at any hotel. And the staff – I simply cannot say enough great things. From the warm welcome at our arrival to the day we had to (sadly) leave, they took phenomenal care of us. To top it off, you couldn't ask for a better location - many of the top London attractions are within walking distance, or an easy tube/bus ride away.",5,2017,06,16
142,Wonderful Stay,My husband and I had a very comfortable and spoiling stay at the Stafford.  The room was beautifully appointed and the staff so helpful whenever needed.  The food was delicious and well served and we had a very pleasant morning sitting in the sun in the peaceful terrace outside. The hotel has a wonderful established British feel. We really could not have had a happier time and so quiet even though when you leave the mews you are in the centre of London!,5,2017,06,15
142,London's best,"The Stafford never fails to provide an oasis of calm, civility and luxury, can't recommend this London landmark more. Fabulous setting, first class team and my wife absolutely adores it here! The concierge even managed to find us a table nearby restaurant on a Saturday night at very short notice, can beat that.",5,2017,06,14
142,Best place to stay in London,This place and staff are AWSOME!  A short walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace. A short walk to many places downtown. Piccadilly Circus was just a few blocks away and many shops and restaurants along the way. If you have any questions just ask anyone at front desk.  Peter (concierge) was above exceptional for recommendations and how to get there.   He even arranged transportation to cruise terminal in South Hampton.  ,5,2017,06,13
142,Terrific hotel,"The Stanford is in the best location. We walked all over central London. The staff was very helpful, the room large and comfortable. We ate in the restaurant and at the American bar and both were delicious. We have stayed in several 5 star hotels in London. This was by far the best. Will definitely return.",5,2017,06,11
142,Love this hotel...,"Such a great hotel, beautiful rooms and stunning linen and towels (makes all the difference)! Food was great and love the bar. More on the pricier side of hotels but worth every penny would certainly revisit when next in London. ",5,2017,06,11
142,The American Bar at the Stafford,"Off the beaten track but in a very good central location of Mayfair near Buckingham Palace and with a secret passage from Green Park into this wonderful oasis.  The hotel is 5 star but has The American Bar open to the public.  Tucked away at the back of the hotel with a beautiful cobbled courtyard for outside dining and/or drinks.  The bar is full of intriguing collection of artefacts, knick-knacks and signed celebrity photographs donated by patrons and guests over the years. The American Bar is open to non residents from 8 am to 11 pm daily.  You can order a breakfast or dinner but a reservation is recommended because it is a very popular venue.  It is exclusive so expect mid-range to expensive choice of drinks and cocktails.  Very intimate and exclusive.",5,2017,06,06
142,No place like home....,"The Stafford is a hidden gem in the heart of London, fantastically located to sample the UK's beautiful capital city, London. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city, The Stafford offers a welcome and tranquil setting to relax, whether in the American Bar,  The GameBird restaurant or in the comfort of your own bedroom. 
Nothing is too much trouble for this amazingly friendly team who make sure you are looked after from the minute you drop your bags to departure. Their attention to detail is truly amazing, from remembering your first name instantly to through home comforts in your bedroom.
We will definitely be back to sample home from home at The Stafford. 
Thank you to Stuart, Pierre & all the team.
Anthony and family",5,2017,06,05
142,A Nice Stay in Mayfair,"Central location near the Ritz and with a private passage to Green Park, this is a very convenient location.  Not inexpensive but what in London is?  The staff is very very accommodating.  Tea and cocktails in the garden were great",4,2017,06,04
142,Perfect!,"We have stayed at the Stafford two times and will not stay anywhere else in London.  Location is perfect near Green Park and Buckingham Palace.  We love walking to restaurants and shops.  The hotel is beautiful inside with beautiful dining, flowers and definitely high end hotel.  The staff are terrific and took care us with swiftness and sincerely caring.  We needed advice on travels to Southampton and took care of every detail. I can't say enough about the staff - felt like they were family!",5,2017,06,04
142,Love This Hotel!,"This was my third stay at The Stafford. I will never stay anywhere else when visiting London. The staff is incredibly kind and welcoming and the hotel is perfect. I have stayed in the regular rooms in the main building. This time we had a junior suite in the courtyard building. It was spectacular. The room was a nice size with plenty of space for luggage and to relax and enjoy the room. The bathroom was huge with two sinks and plenty of space for both of us to get ready. The two restaurants were fantastic. The staff at both are friendly and accommodating. The first time I stayed at the Stafford, I became very ill. They found a doctor for me and a member of the staff went to the pharmacy to pick up medicine for me. They even made special meals for me to eat. I have to eat gluten free and they are happy to accommodate that in both restaurants - including really good gf toast! I consider The Stafford my home away from home when in London. ",5,2017,06,04
142,Lovely place especially The American Bar,"Took a couple of clients to the American Bar at The Stafford last week (end of May 2017) and hadn't visited before.

Walked through the park and took a short and tight alley through to the road the hotel is in. Got a lovely welcome from staff at the hotel as we walked through to the back where the bar and courtyard are.

It's table service unless you are seated at the bar, which is well stocked but quite small.

There were no tables available outside so we sat inside.

We had a number of excellent Gin and Tonics and although not particularly cheap (£11:50 for a Tanqueray 10) they were lovely.

Good level of service and friendly staff as you'd expect from an establishment of this kind.

We snacked rather than had dinner but wholly enjoyed the sliders, fish goujons, hummus and delicious scotch eggs... all of which were served to us with padded lap trays... nice touch

A great place for a pre theatre drink, I'll definitely try to get there earlier so we can make the most of the few tables positioned in the small but pleasant courtyard outside",4,2017,06,03
142,Wonderful stay at The Stafford,"The Stafford Hotel is a first class hotel offering a first class experience. We experienced the best levels of service, discreet and understated delivered to the highest standard. The staff are the hotels best asset, followed closely by the fantastic location and the most delightful comfortable beds. If you are looking for a hotel in a fabulous location with the best of service look no further than The Stafford, it was such a pleasure to stay. Thank you. ",5,2017,06,03
142,Our New Favorite London Hotel,"A business associate from London knew we were going to London for a long weekend and were planning to stay at The Ritz. He suggested The Stafford London. He promised we would not regret it.

We fell in love with The Stafford London the moment we arrived. It is tucked away in a small street and feels like a private residence/boutique hotel in some ways. The hotel is rich in history. I asked one of the employees a little about the history of the area and we ended up chatting for close to an hour. There is a wine cellar, over 200 years old, that has a small museum as well as dining option.

Staff was welcoming and so helpful with helping us choose things to do.
We had a queen room which was on the smaller side but comfortable and we loved having a fireplace.
The American Bar, our friend's favorite place to discuss business was a treasure. Food was great and it was surprisingly quiet. We invited friends from London to join us  for drinks and nibbles after a concert. They were wowed by the hotel and bar.

Sadly, we didn't have a chance to dine in the restaurant but hope to next time we visit.",5,2017,05,24
142,Lovely Stay .  Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed with our two little girls.The hotel staff was very welcoming. 
The room was big enough for the 4 of us with very nice personal touches, the teddy bear and the children/baby toiletries were very much appreciated.  A great hotel for leisure or business. ",5,2017,05,24
142,Doors slamming and jamming !!!,"I spent 2 nights here again, but it might be my last time as this hotel is too poorly managed and did not offer any compensation for a disastrous experience with my door that locked me outside the room in my sweat pants after jogging. 

Their doors are really a complete mess, they do not seal out sound, they slam violently making awful sound and i was woken up several times by my neighbors going in or out of their rooms. 

Furthermore, they have such poorly designed ""do not disturb "" signs that you cannot close your door easily once you've put the sign out...and of course it is one of those where you have to crosscheck always that you did not put it on the ""make the room"" side...

Their maintenance guy ""fixed"" my door by slamming the lock hard to unjam it...

430 GBP per night for time travel to the 19th century...maybe that concept could work with some...not with me. 

Also on my first stay there i ordered the mac&cheese in room service and it was awesome, delicious and sophisticated and fresh with mushrooms, prosciutto ham etc... so i ordered the same this time...more or less the same ingredients but clearly not as fresh...disappointing. ",2,2017,05,23
142,Wonderful stay for husbands 50th birthday,"The Stafford is a beautiful hotel, luxurious, yet friendly and cosy too. Fantastic quiet location with a shortcut through an alley straight into Green Park. Our beautiful room had a huge comfortable bed and fantastic bathroom. The American bar is lively and buzzy and a great place for cocktails before dinner. All the staff we met were friendly and welcoming which made our stay extra special. Breakfast the following morning was a real treat. Best place to stay in London.",5,2017,05,21
142,5 stars is 5 too few,"Where to begin? Check-in went smoothly and perfectly attended to by reception and doormen who delivered the luggage to our room.

We had a drink in the American Bar before retiring and Angel was most helpful. The best kept secret in the hotel is the American Bar breakfast. Eric was very accommodating and attentive to our needs. Game Bird restaurant is great for a more formal meal or tea.

The décor is that of a classic English hotel, which we wanted. However all the modern conveniences were in place as well... a perfect mix of old and new.

My fiancée had forgotten some medication in the US. Concierge Bret arrange for the hotel doctor to consult via telephone. The doctor the order the prescription which was delivered to the room!

Doormen Paul and Greg were exceptional as well. Unfortunately we could not remember other staff names for recognition. Nevertheless all greeted us by name and knew the room number for any charges we incurred.

The worse part of our stay was that to leave for our next appointment in the itinerary. The Stafford exceeded expectations and we would not hesitate a second to return.",5,2017,05,20
142,Oozes charm,"Another of my favorite London hotels. As the title says it oozes charm and I love the historic bar with the airplanes hanging from the ceiling 
I am in London at least four times a year and the Stafford is always a great choice as one of my homes away from home",5,2017,05,19
142,Perfect lovation,The Stafford must have been plucked out of the countryside and plonked into the heart of London. So if you don't like that countryside type of hotel then this is not for you. Everything quite tight but has a great bar and outside sitting area if weather permitting. ,4,2017,05,17
142,An Old World  Gem in a Great London Location!,"We lived in London for a long time recently and enjoyed having drinks in the iconic American Bar several times. When we decided to return to London for a special occasion, we decided to stay at the Stafford. Our three nights there were truly special - some of the best (and most cheerful) service we've encountered anywhere, a smallish but beautifully equipped room with lovely traditional English decor and a great modern bathroom, nice public spaces, and excellent breakfasts. We signed up with the Stafford's hotel group, which resulted in breakfast included, a very nice afternoon tea for two, and early check-in,late check-out. Possible upgrade but it was a busy weekend so that didn't materialise, understandably. The location, just a short stroll through a ""secret"" passage from Green Park, is unbeatable but still quiet. There is a lovely mews on the far side of the hotel with plentiful outdoor seating where they serve lunch and drinks. 

A highlight for us is the American Bar, a cozy, clubby traditional space with comfy seating, great bartenders, and an excellent (and varied) bar menu. We enjoyed the sliders, salads, and a large juicy cheeseburger in this friendly space. It's full of historic photos, ball caps and model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. 

We can't wait to return! ",5,2017,05,13
142,"Wonderful evening at The Stafford Hotel, St James's Place","I met a friend for dinner last night in The Game Bird at The Stafford Hotel in St James's.  A small and elegant hotel, The Stafford offers a warm welcome and impeccable service, always offered with great charm.  One instantly feels ""at home"" as one enters through the lovely lobby.  This hotel is an oasis in the middle of London close to theatres, bars, restaurants, cinemas, Green Park and St James's Park.  The Game Bird itself was recently opened following a refurbishment of the restaurant area.  The décor is tasteful, as one would expect - mostly shades of blue, with gorgeous plush seating and the area has been opened up to make the most of the light and space.  The Assistant Sommelier, Sylvain, was incredibly knowledgeable and suggested wines that perfectly complimented our delicious food.  The items on the menu were all tempting and it took some time to choose!  The Waiters were lovely, particularly Karim who was informative, attentive and charming and Head Chef, James Durrant, was, as always, on top form producing fabulous dishes - monkfish with langoustine consommé, pistachio soufflé with white chocolate ice-cream amongst many equally enticing options.  Thank you to all at The Stafford Hotel for a lovely evening.",5,2017,05,12
142,Charming Property with a Classic Approach,"I stayed at the Stafford for the first time while in London for business recently and enjoyed its classic approach. The property is tucked away at the end of a street that is busier than you'd expect as it appears there is a pedestrian pass through that locals take advantage of while commuting to/from work and the Underground so you're never alone even though the street you are located on is a dead end. I used Uber to grab a car as there is not a lot of taxi traffic and hailing one would require the door men or a short walk to a main road. 

The property itself is older, smaller and in keeping with English traditions in many positive ways. I thought the staff was warm and professional and I appreciated that their approach seemed consistent with the overall vibe of the hotel. The room was nicely appointed and a good size for this type of hotel while the bathroom and shower/tub area were a bit more compact than I'd like. I was traveling solo so not a big deal but you'd definitely need to take care to coordinate if with someone else. Speaking of others, I'd definitely recommend this hotel for couples looking to get away for a romantic weekend - its well located near parks, shopping, tourist areas, and restaurants but is a bit removed and tranquil enough considering being in one of the busier spots in the city.",4,2017,05,12
142,Exceptional Stay in Fashionable London,"We fell in love with The Stafford Hotel!  It is a small and intimate sanctuary in London with an ideal location in The St. James/Green Park area. It is within walking distance to Mayfair and Piccadilly. The warm hospitality and the service is impeccable.  Every small detail is cared for from the moment of arrival until departure.  
Our room, in the renewed Carriage House was spacious, well appointed and very comfortable. Loved the bathroom!   My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer! 
Beautiful and so private that you can't believe you are in the heart of London!!

Breakfast choices were plentiful and delicious. Room Service also wonderful  and accommodating to an early departure one morning.

We dined  in The Game Bird our first night; warm atmosphere, wonderful food, wine and exceptional service. (do try their Sticky Pudding for dessert)

The American Bar was a treat for a late night dinner and drinks.
 
 Our thanks to Frank, the head concierge, and Lucca in the dining room for taking such excellent care of us during our visit, as well as all the other staff members of The Stafford Hotel,  This is truly a gem in London..",5,2017,05,09
142,Mr ,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. 
Could not go to London without staying there.
Wonderful cohesive welcoming staff make it my favorite destination .
Game bird restaurant is first rate 
Geno has total command of the wine cellar 
Close to everything yet in a quiet location ",5,2017,05,08
142,Beautiful little hotel for afternoon tea,Went here for a friends birthday afternoon tea and it was lovely. The service and attention to detail was amazing. We had two little girls with us (5 + 11) and they were very well catered for with a big cup of hot chocolate instead of tea and they and us adults really enjoyed the afternoon tea. Was very traditional and quaint inside.,5,2017,05,04
142,Another Great R & R week,"This hotel is hands down one of my favorites in London. Everything from the decor, staff, rooms, food, and lovely patio bar make it a great stay. Not to mention the location is impeccable. Right in Mayfair and an easy walk to many restaurants and high end shopping. This time was more special than before as I had a 2 day delay getting to the UK from my previous destination. Not only did they hold the room, but gave me a spacious upgrade which had a little outdoor seating area. It couldn't  have been more thoughtful and appreciated. 

Also, their restaurant The Gamebird is not to be missed. Lovely meats and tasty deserts in a very comfortable dinning room. 

I will continue staying at The Stafford and am glad that my company has made the switch.",5,2017,05,02
142,Deserves a six!,"I have just stayed two nights with my friend JC.  We were met by the General Manager Stuart, a delight.  He asked us to try the newly furnished Game Bird Restaurant which we did.  The menu has a new twist and we met the Chef James, I had Rockefeller Oysters, scallops, beer and ale pudding.  All well presented and also met the Master Sommelier Gino.  The American bar under Benoit is a delight as is the Concierge Frank.  If I could give it a six I would but this is a rare five from me.  Well done.",5,2017,04,30
142,Consistently the very best in London,"I have been staying at The Stafford hotel for the last seven years, the only place in London I stay at. The staff there are friendly, very professional, the service is nothing short of excellent. The hotel is very comfortable and well maintained throughout. Apart from the great atmosphere of the American Bar there is now a new restaurant in the hotel as a result of refurbishment and a new chef. I had an excellent meal there and would highly recommend it. I look forward to my next visit, one cannot give a better recommendation than that!",5,2017,04,29
142,Great hotel,"Absolutely great staying in this beautiful hotel. The overall service has been impeccable and the hotel was very conveniently located to reach  all the major city attractions which was perfect for us that were in London for leisure purposes.

",5,2017,04,28
142,I loved this hotel - reviews I read were wrong,"I read a review on this hotel that was not helpful at all. In fact, it made me so nervous I only booked 2 out of 4 of our nights in London. The review was so wrong! I loved this hotel. I love the location and know it well as I often stay at Duke's nearby. The room was gorgeously appointed, quiet, clean, five star experience. I hope to only stay in that room every visit to London. It was impeccable, the staff lovely and boutique experience. There are three buildings so I can only speak to the main hotel but I did see the stables and they have been redesigned with a more modern look and more spacious. It depends on your taste but this is a wonderful place to stay.",5,2017,04,25
142,Very nice,I enjoyed very much this hotel. Everything is high standard and extremely comfortable. Breakfast is rich and the breakfast lounge is cosy. The cigar lounge is very pleasant. Service is outstanding. The location is incomparable. ,5,2017,04,23
142,Absolutely perfect hotel!,"This is my second stay at The Stafford and I won't stay anywhere else.  Our room was extremely comfortable, well thought out and spacious.  All areas of the hotel have a small, intimate feel and you really feel that you are in an old fashioned London hotel.  It also has a great location in St James's right around the corner from Fortnum and Mason.  It is also conveniently located to Green Park tube station.",5,2017,04,20
142,Absolutely beautiful hotel in perfect location!,"My family and I had the distinct pleasure of staying 5 nights at The Stafford over spring vacation.  The Stafford feels more like a private club than a hotel.  The Stafford is the epitome of intimate, first class service wrapped in a beautiful, warm and inviting envelope.  From the gorgeous artwork to the cozy furnishings, this hotel far exceeded all expectations.  The front desk, concierge, and wait staff provide a warm, hospitable experience that I have yet to encounter in my travels.  Please do not miss the opportunity to stay at The Stafford Hotel.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else.
Side note: the property is tucked in between 2 lovely parks making it an ideal location for families.  And a 5 minute walk to the Buckingham Palace & Piccadilly!",5,2017,04,20
142,Luxury in the West End,"I absolutely love The Stafford Hotel . It is quite simply the best 5 star hotel in London. Conveniently located between St James' St and Green Park , ideal for anyone visiting London whether that be business or leisure. 

The famous American Bar is a must visit with a great cigar terrace in a private courtyard. They have just launched a brand new restaurant , The Game Bird, which I have not tried yet but have heard great reviews so far.

A special mention to Stuart Proctor, the GM and all the staff for always making me feel at home .",5,2017,04,20
142,home away from home,"An hotel of graet charm in a quiet  central area.
a great service frome the friendly stuff.
The food we had at the bar and the resturant was very tasty.
they clean the room twice a day and meet your need in every possible way.
I will definitely returne to the Stafford!",5,2017,04,17
142,Gorgeous hotel with wonderful staff,"I got a chance to travel to London after a business trip. I planned to stay at both a British boutique hotel and an American brand name hotel during my three day visit. Stafford caught my eyes because the interior design and concierge awards, and it went beyond my expectation! 
The room is lovely and cozy. Every detail of the building just made an architecture nerd such as me fall in love. The American Bar brought a touch of the rich culture of the hotel. 
The best part about the hotel is the staff. Everyone is a joy to speak to. The concierge staff went above and beyond to help me planning my short trip in London. The personal attention is really something I can't find at a chain hotel. Definitely will come back here!",5,2017,04,14
142,Luxurious comfort in an ideal location,"My family and I stayed three wonderful nights and enjoyed every minute.  The hotel is luxurious, but that's not the hard part, is it?  This hotel also had an unbeatable location--a quiet dead-end street with a back passage out to Green Park and Buckingham Palace on one side and easy access to all the West End attractions on the other.  We made good use of the short walk to the Green Park tube station, and it was fun to see so many people sunning themselves in Green Park during the unusually fine weather.

The staff was friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed the hotel bar several times during our stay.  We highly recommend The Stafford London!",4,2017,04,11
142,Great hotel in central london,"I recently stayed at the Stafford hotel and had a great experience. The staff at check-in were welcoming and polite and when I was shown to my room they made sure I was made aware of all the rooms features so I could fully enjoy my stay. The room was lovely - decorated in a modern style but felt very homely. The bed was very comfortable and as a result I had a great nights sleep. The bathroom was well equipped with nice products and lots of soft, fluffy towels! Check-out was as professional as my check-in experience and I look forward to staying at the Stafford again!",5,2017,04,11
142,Fab hotel,"Stayed on a Saturday night having ""won"" a voucher for a night's accommodation in a charity auction.  Great location between St. James's and Green Park.  Understated but very classy accommodation and service.  A noisy aircon unit outside and some building work next door slightly upset the ambience.

In the unlikely event I need a central London hotel and can afford this price point in the future, I will stay again.",5,2017,04,11
142,Elegant hidden gem in the heart of St. James's.,"Spring Break with the family. My wife and I and two sons (13 and 18) settled at The Stafford for 10 days with a full ""tourist"" agenda. The immediate feeling when entering the The Stafford is one of comfort and understated beauty. You realize in an instant you are in good hands. Our room was perfect for the four of us. Not huge but plenty of room and extremely clean and comfortable. In my opinion, the location cannot be beat. It's secluded, but you are a short walk away from so many great locations. Green Park, Piccadilly Circus, Jermyn St., Bond St., Oxfort St., Saint James Court, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, The London Eye, etc. You are also within walking distance of many great restaurants. That said, The Game Bird and The American Bar, which are at The Stafford, are two of the best places in London. On any future visit to London, on business or pleasure, I will stay at The Stafford.",5,2017,04,08
142,"History, Luxury in central London","Loved this hotel.

We booked through Luxury Hotels who offered exceptional service with room upgrades and little extras thrown in.

The rooms were spacious with excellent comfortable beds.

Reception staff were most welcoming and had us in our room in a minimal of fuss even through it was 8:00am and we had just come off a 26 hour flight.

The American bay is fascinating with lots of photos of all sorts of historic visitors.

Hi tea included in our package was excellent as were the breakfasts we ate everyday for the 4 nights we stayed.

Cant fault anything about this hotel, its in a great location, its staff are great, the rooms are excellent.

Can only thank the Stafford for making our stay so wonderful",5,2017,04,08
142,Secluded London luxury,"From the moment you arrive, everything at The Stafford demonstrates impeccable class, style, and attention to detail.  The hotel offers each finesse and luxury you would expect, but it is delivered warmly and without fuss or hesitation.  Every member of staff I met was unfailingly charming and friendly - a warmth which I have found can be lacking in some luxury establishments.

The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Green Park tube; which meant it was super quick for me to travel to work commitments in the City. Bond Street is also just a stones throw away and so perfectly located for shopping!  Being on a quiet side road however, the hotel is incredibly calm and peaceful, so it's easy to forget that Piccadilly is on your door-step.  

I stayed in a Mews Suite; in a separate building behind the main hotel on a pretty cobbled courtyard.  It's just a few steps from one building to the other though, so no inconvenience at all when popping down for (the rather delicious) breakfast - even in the rain.  The suite was stunning from top to bottom.  Top marks too for the extremely comfortable bed. I suffer from a bad back, but despite the mattress feeling softer than I am used to, I didn't suffer from any aches. 

On a practical note, the wifi is super fast and there was large desk where I could comfortably do some work.  There was loads of wardrobe space and plenty of clothes hangers (a bugbear of mine when there aren't enough) great coffee in the room, very fluffy bath robes and a cute additional touch of a rubber duck (my personal favourite!)

The room was turned down in the evening. It's rather lovely to come back to find everything 'just so' and cosy - and with your slippers waiting for you.  One night  I was dashing around to get ready to go out when the  housekeeper appeared at the door. Without skipping a beat, she offered to come back to turn down the room when it was more convenient.  She clearly had a sixth sense!

I also found myself running late for a dinner appointment, but the extremely helpful concierge brought a taxi around to the hotel within a couple of minutes. Indeed, I felt like all the staff go out of their way to make everything about your stay as effortless and as easy as it can be. Top marks.

I had a few drinks in the American Bar - definitely worth a visit.  They know how to make an excellent cappuccino as well as their way around the wine list.  The service is 5 star but in no way stuffy; very much delivered with a smile.  It was too cold to sit outside, but in the summer I dare say you would have to drag me away from a table in the courtyard.

In short, I think that The Stafford offers a peaceful slice of luxury, delivered in the very best way possible.  I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.",5,2017,04,04
142,Elegant accommodations with exceptional service,My board meeting brought us to London and our Virtuoso travel advisor recommended this luxury hotel within walking distance of the meeting. It surpassed all expectations. Afternoon tea is a highlight & the personal package in our room was so perfect! welcome We enjoyed one of the best concierge services ever! We will be returning here forever...,5,2017,04,02
142,A Secluded Haven in St James,"How can a hotel right in the centre of London feel like a charming country house with very attentive, but unobtrusive staff, who quickly learn your name and make you feel as though you are at home? Well look no further than The Stafford. They have it down to perfection. We celebrated my 70th birthday with 16 family members of a wide age range and enjoyed private dining in the Sutherland Room to the highest standard of both food, wine and service. We spent a long weekend, which will last in all our memories for ever. The youngest member of the party said it was the best 24 hours he had ever spent in London! 
We thank the Stafford for the special birthday bite of cake that you sent to our room and the ice bucket filled with water for my wife's Mother's Day flowers......oh, and of course the taxi service for the six of us who went to the Royal Opera House on our last evening. 
I suggest that those reading this review should read other reviews which mention the American bar, the beautiful mews courtyard, the hotel's marvellous proximity to various famous landmarks and nearby tube station, with convenient little passageway that comes out at the front door! (We left York station on the fast train to London and were in our hotel room 2 and a half hours 
later, having used the tube to Green Park. Unbelievably convenient!) 
Don't think that this review is the only way we are singing your praises. We are telling all our friends what a wonderful find this hotel has been and thank you, most sincerely, for making this birthday celebration so special. Thank goodness we chose to stay with you.

142,Hidden gem,"A wonderful boutique hotel just off St James oozing charm, tradition and elegance. Staff are all so well trained and understated to make the guests feel all important. We stayed 3 nights celebrating a family ""Big"" birthday and 20 of us enjoyed a private dining experience of perfection. The American Bar with all of its memorabilia is a must as were the freshly cooked breakfasts served by attentive and efficient staff. Our bed was so comfortable and our room was so quiet considering our central position in the West End. Excellent concierge staff too just to round off our total experience (they dropped 6 of us to the Royal Opera House without hesitation and gratis). A little gem!",5,2017,03,29
142,A British Treasure,"This was our first time staying at this hotel and based on our 6 day visit, it will certainly not be our last.  This hotel is 5 stars in every possible way.  Location wise, you cannot find a better hotel.  Tucked away in St. James it is on a very quiet street (we had some of the best night's sleeps here) but literally only a stone's throw from the busy Piccadilly Street, Pall Mall and Green Park.  Ask about the (not so) secret passageway from the front of the hotel to Green Park (from there it's only a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and only 2 minutes to Green Park tube station which is convenient if you travelled to London via Heathrow Airport).  If you are an avid runner, St. James Park, Green Park and Hyde Park are all nearby so you can easily fit in a 10 mile run through all three parks while seeing some of the sites within.  Fortunately, we were blessed with fantastic sunny weather and enjoyed seeing parts of London during our morning jog.  The concierge has a handy running map if you need guidance.  As for the room, we selected a deluxe king room and were so glad we did. The room itself was very spacious as was the bathroom (nice amenities included) and vanity areas.  One quick word about the water pressure - fabulous!  After a long day touring, it's always nice to come back to a hot shower with sufficient water pressure!  Our room also had two closets and a coffee/tea bar.   The hotel personnel were very friendly and always greeted you with a smile whether you were leaving the hotel at 6am for an early morning jog or returning after 11pm - always professional and willing to do whatever necessary to make your day.  If all of that weren't enough, a slice of chocolate cake was delivered to our room to help celebrate my birthday!  And I'm a huge fan of any establishment that promotes ""going green"" (you could elect to have your sheets changed when you wanted vs every day).  If you have time, ask to tour the 300 year old wine cellar.  Our tour guide, Liz, did a wonderful job explaining the history of the hotel and its wine cellar (which houses over 3,000 bottles of wine and can be used for private dining functions).   And there are a few more historical markers right around the corner of the hotel.  The Stafford London is truly a magnificent hotel.  You cannot beat the location; easily accessible to many of London's sites, shops and restaurants.  We have stayed at a number of hotels while vacationing in London but The Stafford is, by far, the very best!",5,2017,03,27
142,A pampered home away from home,"If I could give The Stafford 100 stars, I would. The staff take great care of their guests and make it feel like you're coming home, especially if you're a returning guest!  Excellent location about 10 minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus, the theater district, Buckingham Palace, Mayfair shopping, all while feeling totally secluded in a quiet side street. Green Park, accessible through a near-hidden passageway, is on your door step, as is the Green Park tube station - most convenient. The rooms are calm and comfortable with beautiful marble bathrooms. The American Bar is relaxed and lively, and the new restaurant menu is exquisite. I don't ever want to stay anywhere else in London now!",5,2017,03,27
142,Great & Very British Hotel,"The Staff of the Stafford treat you like Royalty.  The Concierge (Fernando & Brett) are second to no one.  They got us reservations when we couldn't; even prior to our arrival and were fountains of knowledge.  Once you arrive the staff is impeccable.  From Checking in (My wife loved the Pink Jackets) to the restaurant staff they are great.  And let's not forget the doormen, they will get you a cab anytime, offer you umbrellas if needed and provide you with directions as well.  This entire hotel is quite little slice of heaven, right in the middle of London.    A Gem, DON'T MISS IT. ",5,2017,03,26
142,Another Outstanding Visit,"Just spent five days at The Stafford London -- excellent service, gorgeous room, great location, and lovely staff.  I had a busy week of business, including dinner for 24 at the Sutherland Room and several business meetings.  The Stafford Team delivered everything flawlessly.  We sampled the menu from the new Game Bird, and loved it.  Congratulations to the General Manager for the continuous refurbishment and innovation - can't wait to see the new rooms in the Mews.  For anyone who wants an elegant and luxurious but not fussy stay at a ""country hotel"" in the middle of London, this is the place....",5,2017,03,21
142,Still Outstanding,"It is several years since I last stayed here but this hotel still has  the best atmosphere of any hotel in London. The small intimate Game Bird Restaurant recently opened continues this theme and of course the legendary American Bar is a must visit, we had a lovely lunch in there.

The rooms, the friendly staff, good food and overall hospitality were second to none, it is plain to see why the Stafford enjoys such a fine reputation. Always a good sign of 5 star hotels is the visibility of senior management and this was very clear at this hotel with the General Manager making himself known to us and other guests.

If you are wanting to stay in the centre of London at wonderful atmospheric/intimate hotel, look no further than the Stafford - still outstanding and better than ever

142,Beautiful Boutique 5* Hotel,"The Stafford is a charming 5* hotel. I stayed here for one night and enjoyed every moment of my stay.

The hotel is absolutely stunning and the staff were so welcoming and friendly and made my stay very pleasant. 

The food was delicious and they were able to accommodate my ceoliac disease. My breakfast was served sitting in front of a warm cozy fire which was an idyllic setting. 
The service was First class and the staff were friendly and attentive, but also whilst giving you space to enjoy your food. The food tasted amazing and was cooked to perfection.   

The room was luxurious and spacious with a huge bathroom which had a large bath and a large shower cubicle.  The were plenty of towels which were lovely and soft and to a high standard as was everything else. The bed was very comfortable and also had little lights attached to the headboard so that i could read my book.

When i returned after an evening out...my room had been tidied up with fresh towels and slippers laid out ready for me for my return. 

I would also suggest a visit to the fascinating wine cellar & museum before you leave, which was used an air-raid shelter in World War II.

So if you are looking for somewhere to stay in London, whether it be business or pleasure then i would totally recommend this beautiful hotel, where i could not find a single fault. I definitely will be returning. Thank you to all the staff for making my stay so pleasurable.",5,2017,03,14
142,Man in the hat,The American bar of the Stafford Hotel situated in cobbled yard at the back of the Hotel .this place is ideal for cigar smokers the staff of friendly and well knowledgeable about their craft . its almost a secret little club,5,2017,03,14
142,Perfect spot in London!,"This was my third stay at The Stafford in as many years.  I used to stay at another hotel but switched just by chance (and friends' recommendations) and have not looked back!  It is an oasis in the middle of London!  The charm of a country house hotel but with London right outside the door.  You can walk to many of the places you might want to go, or at minimum take a short cab ride.  Staff is tops, décor is charming... and you feel as though you've found a secret hideaway with the location down St. James' Place.  I look forward to enjoying the new restaurant!",5,2017,03,08
142,Wonderful Hotel located just off St James Street,"This is another gem of a hotel located in a very quiet street with lovely views of Green Park. Originally an old Town House, The Stafford  has great character fiilled with antiques. I have stayed here a couple of times on business.  The restaurant has an excellent menu and the bar is great in the summer when you can sit outside in the beautiful courtyard ",5,2017,03,05
142,Could do better!,"On the plus side:
Lovely bathroom with fluffy towels, towelling robes (large), nice black & white veined marble on floor walls and sink. 
Excellent location for theatre.and the very nearby Green park - leading to St James Park. 
Close to Green Park station.
Quiet room - we were on the fifth floor.
Free movies - some recently released
Pleasant staff.
On the minus side:
Very soft bed - OK for me but not my wife!
Bathroom had an unpleasant odour - (drainage problem?)
Shower door would not close and seal properly
Charged for minibar drink that we did NOT have - this was not checked at check-out time either.
Workmen noise upon arrival and during the day after 11.00 am - apparently going on all week during an upgrade.
Expensive when you consider alternatives and that the stay did not include breakfast - a full English being listed at £31.
We were put off using the restaurant by the noise. Overall left feeling disappointed.",3,2017,03,01
142,Characterful Hotel With Outstanding Service,"We love the Stafford, it is charmingly old school though timeless, refined & elegant yet oh so welcoming & friendly. Staff go the extra mile at every opportunity & seem free to let their personalities fly. The hotel is packed with character & characters & the American Bar in particular is unmissable, it's dark, cosy, & clubby, festooned with old photos & eclectic bits & bats. Many London based friends use it as a local so the atmosphere derives from an interesting mix of visitors & natives. Food, drinks & service were all top notch on this visit & we look forward to the opening of new restaurant Game Bird in March. The location in well heeled St James is fairly peaceful & very handy for town with Green Park tube less then 5 minutes walk away & we adore the charming cobbled courtyard out back on the mews.  Main house rooms are a delight, decked out in English country style with supremely comfortable beds, sumptuous fabrics & gorgeous products. Mews suites are a tad more contemporary & no doubt the Carriage House accommodation will be glorious. Just lovely.",5,2017,02,28
142,Secluded luxury,"Secluded in a pretty Mayfair street you'll find the Stafford.
This hotel has understated elegance and luxury. The hotel has the most comfortable bed I've ever  slept in, the breakfast was delicious and the service was wonderful. 
I recommend that you also try the American Bar for a cosy and chilled evening.
The hotel is a stone's throw from Green park and also just a few minutes walk to Piccadilly Circus and the sights of London.",5,2017,02,27
142,Always Wonderful!,"This is my second time at The Stafford.  Even though they are going through some renovations, my staying was wonderful.  The staff were cordial, professional and helpful.  They make sure you feel at home.  The hotel continues to be lovely and charming.  The room was comfortable, the bathroom had plenty of amenities, they offer complementary wifi, water, coffee and tea.  The hotel bar was enjoyed every night.  The Stafford is very close to wonderful restaurants and it is located in a fabulous area of central London.",5,2017,02,26
142,Perfect in every way.,Beautiful hotel near green park. Close to picdilly. The beds were to die for. They were so soft and pillows were so  fluff the towels were beautiful and soft.breakfast was ample with plenty of choice and the staff made you feel so welcome. I can not fault this hotel in anyway.there is a restaurant and also a bar where you can eat. For smokers there is a little courtyard  with fires to keep u warm. The rooms r luxurious decor.. just book this hotel you will receive a warm welcome,5,2017,02,26
142,Old school charm,"Have stayed before, bond was delighted to stay again. Received an upgrade to a super king room. Very spacious and well equipped with an amazingly comfortable bed. Very nicely lit room with choice for different moods.
It may not be everyone's taste as it could be described as a chintz palace, but old school service and charm and extremely comfortable.
Their were some renovations taking place so be aware if you are dining during the next few weeks.
Had a swift drink in the famous American bar, very 'Ralph Lauren' and worth a visit.
I normally don't stay as claiming over £400 for ex's is questionable at times, but noticed a room could be bought for £350 ( maybe because of the renovation).... however this did not detract in any way from our stay.....Excellent!",5,2017,02,23
142,A hidden gem in London,"A very pleasant stay in this luxury hotel. We enjoyed wonderful service, and great atmosphere in the American bar - try the White Mouse! And great choice of Whiskeys.
Especially enjoyed a visit in the amazing wine cellar. 
Top quality English breakfast, and ",5,2017,02,22
142,Home from Home,"I have stayed at The Stafford on more than one occasion and I am never disappointed by the first class service.

From the moment I arrived I enjoyed a 5 star experience.  A personal welcome as I was checking in.  A stunning bedroom with an exquisite bathroom.   The bed and pillows allowed for the best nights sleep I have enjoyed in a long time .

I took breakfast in my room which was delicious .

I look forward to returning to my second ""home"" very soon.",5,2017,02,22
142,Home from home,"Every time we stay at this hotel we feel like 'we have come home'. The hotel is of a high standard and is so very comfortable, you feel so relaxed from the moment of arrival.
The staff are second to none & make you feel like you are part of a big family.
The American Bar is full of character, with superb wines and beer (& at Christmas the best mulled wine you will ever find) and very tasty bar snacks!
Looking forward to our next visit!",5,2017,02,21
142,American Bar still a hidden Gem,The American Bar never fails to please. The ambiance is fantastic the staff are really so experienced and attentive in a very discreet manner. To serve your food up on a deluxe tray is just great presentation and food matches the standard of this location,5,2017,02,21
142,What a pleasent surprise,"Did not stay at this hotel, just merely used its restaurant for a business lunch with one of my clients. My client and I were most suitably impressed. Beautiful décor and the staff were very professional and helpful. The food was absolutely first class and the wine cellar extensive. Will definitely be returning soon. It should be noted however, I was told the restaurant will be going through a complete refurbishment, when finished it will change its name from the 'Lyttleton' to the 'Gamebird', not sure about that!",5,2017,02,20
142,Perfect London Hotel,"Stayed a night in the Stafford in a beautiful room in the Mews Suites , the staff were very efficient but also smiley and helpful.  We had a drink in the American Bar before going out for dinner and felt we would have liked to stay there all night and had supper on a tray as other residents were doing.  Really comfortable bed with gorgeous linen and a very spacious bathroom, wished we were there longer.",5,2017,02,20
142,1 night weekend stay,"Difficult to review.
A very well known and established hotel originally a luxury Georgian town house.
One hopes for a sense of intimacy over a large hotel and to a degree get it.
The staff are all superb and cannot be more helpful
The American has character and we too a light lunch there.
First course best calamari we have ever had.
Second not so good. A caesar salad was VERY ordinary and the crab salad with avocado was served with a hard unripe avocado.
Mentioned this to the staff but nothing was done!
We had a real problem with the bedroom.
Not ready at 1.00pm after requesting an early check in and when shown to it a 2.30 had a very unsuitable bathroom.
The bedroom to bathroom was down a big step in the doorway- dangerous at night -and the bath was sunken in front of a window below floor level making it difficult to get out of.
Duty manager agreed change of room which was acceptable but again not ready until about 4.00pm
Spoilt the visit.
Rooms quite small and rather tired.
Sadly we failed to experience that level of luxury and comfort that makes you want to go back asap.
Breakfast very good but pricey, of course.",3,2017,02,20
142,Can't Really Find Anything to Criticize,"Quiet, elegant but comfortable, handsome (and well-equipped) rooms, good food, great bar. And then there's the charming mews in back, with its semi-secret exit onto St. James's Street -- with The Wolseley, Wilton's, and Chutney Mary's within blocks.",5,2017,02,20
142,"Felt like a guest, not a customer","Our first visit to London -- The Stafford was as much a highlight as many of the famous places to see!  Every employee we encountered throughout our stay seemed genuinely happy and eager to assist us with whatever we needed.  Whether it was directions, a cab, a knife & plate to slice cheese we'd purchased from a local shop, or a late-night snack as the kitchen was about to close...they accommodated our every need with a smile and seemingly effortlessly.  Excellent location for walking to local sights as well as hopping on the tube.  We will be back!",5,2017,02,20
142,High quality service and an impeccable hotel.,"My wife and i stayed at the Stafford this weekend just gone. We were greeted with a smile on every staff members face and dealt with in a professional manner by the concierge who were also friendly and were ready to help with anything needed. 

They managed to get us a reservation at a very high end exclusive restaurant just to top off the stay! The American bar has a relaxed yet trendy feel  whilst the rooms are spacious, exceptionally clean and furnished to a very high standard.

I would recommend anyone both on business or holiday to stay here. A nice mix of age groups and luxury throughout.",5,2017,02,20
142,Delightful and elegant London hotel.,"The Stafford is a peaceful and charming base ideally situated in St James'. The building is elegant and yet homely, with supremely comfortable rooms prepared for your ""overnight"" as though by your private ""maid"". The front of house staff are calm and clearly very knowledgeable, with the ability to conjour up taxis out of nowhere. And, they look, to see if you are pleased, which is rare these days. I wouldn't hesiate to confirm that The Stafford deserves all of its five stars, and maybe one or two more too boot !",5,2017,02,16
142,Remarkable Stay,"My husband and I just returned from a long weekend (for a wedding), and the highlight of the weekend was The Stafford. Like every review here, my review gushes nothing but praise. 

We rode the Heathrow Express and then took the tube to Green Street/Green Park (?) and towed our bags to the hotel (5 min. tops) - playing a little bit of hide and seek as the property isn't super easy to find. We were met with huge smiles and after check-in, we received a tour of the ground floor of the hotel and then were brought to our room. 

(I had a hat shipped to the hotel for the wedding and it was waiting for me without any hassle.) The concierge/bellmen were gracious, polite and incredibly helpful: mentioned and then secured reservations for us at Chor Bizarre - without a doubt the best Indian food we've had ever. 

Centrally located, we strolled through Green Park down to Buckingham Palace, and easily explored though Piccadilly and Trafalgar squares. If you'd rather choose a less-expensive breakfast (than in-house), there are 2 Pret a Mangers within two blocks, and oodles of other cafes nearby for lunch and dinner. We had a drink at The American Bar on the ground floor and at 6:00 on a Thursday night, it was packed. Lovely cocktails and our server brought us a platter of three snacks to munch on...

To the room: luxurious linens, gorgeous heavy drapes, gilded accessories...evening turn-down service included drape-closing, bedside linens with slippers and bottled water. The bathroom had a towel heater, a rainfall shower and a set-alone tub complete with a rubber ducky. They've really thought of everything. 

We had a tremendous stay at The Stafford, I highly recommend it!",5,2017,02,15
142,Relaxing long weekend - hope to return!,"We are just back from a long weekend in London.  Though the weather was cold and damp (it snowed) the hotel was warm and welcoming.  We enjoyed quiet drinks in the bar before dinner and time by the fireplace after dinner.  Every amenity has been thought of and the service impeccable.  The location was perfect, close to shopping, theater and restaurants.  We truly enjoyed out stay and hope to be back again some day.",5,2017,02,14
142,"Great place, service and staff was exceptional ",Cosy boutique style hotel in a great location. Staff was always very friendly and courteous and made us feel welcome from the moment we entered the hotel until check-out. The room and decor war nice and the bed super comfortable. Definitely one of my favourite hotels in London ....and a place to come back to. ,5,2017,02,14
142,Hidden gem ,"Fantastic location tucked away but right near lots of London favourites, St James park, Fortnum and Mason etc
Customer service is exceptional and nothing too much trouble. 
Very comfortable beds, great showers and top quality breakfast.
Wouldn't hesitate to stay again
",5,2017,02,13
142,Good food and wine,"Great food and wine, nice location, let down by a guy ranting to a load of business people at the next table.  Make sure to ask for a tour of the cellars, amazing collection of fine wine and some historic stuff from when the hotel was used by the yanks during ww2",4,2017,02,13
142,Quiet hotel with a perfect location,"In London for a week and stayed at the Stafford for the first time. Perfect location, amazing staff, a wonderful experience. Loved having tea by the fireplaces in the afternoon after exploring London.",5,2017,02,08
142,"Amazing hotel, staff & amenities - we will definitely return!","I won an overnight stay for 2 in a competition, so were a little apprehensive as to what it might be like.  We should not have worried - it was sensational!
We were upgraded to a Junior Suite - really tastefully decorated and the most wonderful comfy bed with luxurious bed linen – and pillows of our choice!  All room amenities and decorations had been carefully considered and thought out for their guests.  The Bathroom was spacious and very well equipped - the towels were sumptuously soft and fluffy – and the vast shower really simple to use (as opposed to some which need for you to take your reading glasses into the cubicle to try to work out how their complicated knobs, handles etc function).    
We had a drink in the “American Bar” before heading out to the theatre, and what a lovely place to have a drink!  Really interesting memorabilia and a pleasant clientele. 
The Breakfast, the following morning, was amazing – a wide selection to choose from and all freshly cooked.  It was delicious!
The staff throughout the hotel, the bar, the restaurant, the Concierge were really polite and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.
We have definitely found a place in London to come back to time and time again!",5,2017,02,07
142,Totally delighted with out 1st visit to The Stafford in London,Stayed 2 nights for my wife's birthday weekend. We especially liked:  fantastic service;  great location for central London & parks; understated luxury & elegance;  posh but not 'over the top fussy';  great food in restaurant; fresh fruit selection at breakfast; overall general 'feel good factor'.  This is now our favourite hotel in London.  I really can't think of any negatives!,5,2017,02,05
142,Slightly dated luxury with perfect location,"We just came back after 2 nights away on a slightly special occasion for us. The hotel arranged for a surprise for my girlfriend - even if she booked the room and my name wasn't on the reservation.

Staff are all very helpful - but the final touch is missing. Remembering who we are and what room we stay in for instance. And dont't take away half finished water bottles, even if you supplied them complementary during turn down service. Ridiculous pedantry from me really and should be taken as tips for improving rather than criticism. The concierges should btw take note that they are perfect.

Areas of the rooms that are prone to wear and tear, show wear and tear. 105 needs a carpenter for the bathroom door, painter for areas where suitcases bump into and the carpet was slightly rumpled on some spots.

When  you as a prospective guest read this - go there. The hotel should read this as constructive feedback to stay on top of their game. This was our second stay and will not be our last.",4,2017,02,05
142,"Location, Style, Sumptuous rooms, Amazing Staff","I've tried for several years to find an amazing hotel in London....and finally it's happened.  It seemed if the hotel was good, the location was not.  If the bedrooms (and beds) were luscious, then the staff lacked training, but finally - all things have converged perfectly at the Stafford.  The location is amazing, and secluded on a back street with no traffic or traffic noise.  The staff from bellman, to check-in, to breakfast staff, to concierge was supportive and asked me the questions anticipating my every need.  Also, there's a most amazing bar and a Courtyard for the spring / summer months (and it's huge !) so you can have your own ' park' without leaving the hotel.  Truly an amazing find, and my new home in London !!!!",5,2017,01,31
142,"Wonderful hotel, excellent service","We absolutely loved our stay in this hotel. The rooms were very comfortable and the staff very friendly and welcoming.
I hope to go back to the Stafford Hotel again one day. Thank you to all the staff for making my stay so wonderful.",5,2017,01,27
142,Gem tucked away in the heart of London,"My recent stay at The Stafford Hotel was a celebration and total splurge for my daughter and me. The staff met my every expectation with complete understanding and follow-up and were very relational! We stayed in a Junior Suite and we both felt so pampered. The food was excellent and the staff once again accommodated us in the restaurant with ordering off the bar menu, as the bar was full. Afternoon tea was sublime! I would love to stay here every time I come to London, which isn't often enough.",5,2017,01,26
142,London Gem,"My wife and I have stayed in many fine hotels in London over the years, and this was our first time at the Stafford.  This time we decided to stay in a smaller hotel that might offer a more intimate and friendly setting, and we were not disappointed.  Besides the excellent location, the Stafford has an outstanding staff that look after a guest's every need.  The public rooms are beautifully decorated and create a welcoming, warm environment in classic English style.  While the room that we stayed in was not particularly large, it was attractive and extremely comfortable.  The main dining room dinner menu was first rate, and the American Bar is a delightful haven for everything from an evening cocktail to a late breakfast.  We are looking forward to a return visit later this year.",5,2017,01,22
142,Wonderful stay at The Stafford,"My mother and I celebrate my birthday together each year and this year we decided to book The Stafford in St James for the night of my birthday. I'd heard lots of great reviews of the hotel and recently went for delicious dinner there before Christmas, so though it would be a good opportunity to stay there. 

We checked-in at 16.00 and after booking the 'Mews Junior Suite' we were very nicely surprised that we had been upgraded to a 'Mews Master Suite' which was magnificent in size and grandeur.  We had a couple for hours to enjoy the room and find our way around it as it was so big! Unfortunately I didn't bring enough clothes to utilize the walk in wardrobe (this time). A bottle of Champagne and fresh fruits helped kill the time a bit too. 

We went for a very nice dinner and then the casino on route back to The Stafford (I doubled my money and cashed out). On return to the hotel we had night cap at the famous 'American Bar' and then off to bed. I was so surprised at how quiet the room was being in Central London. 

The next morning Breakfast was served till 11.00 am so a very reasonable time for a Sunday indeed. I had an obligatory 'Full English' which as excellent. The staff we always very friendly, chatty and super officiant. We managed to get a late check out as didn't want to leave. Next time I hope to stay for longer.",5,2017,01,17
142,Disappointed,"Great location. Staff attentive. 
However the American Bar menu is poor in comparison to my last visit. Their Club Sandwich which used to be one of the best, is now very poor, heavy and clumsy (using too much Sour dough bread? of all things), poorly filled layers, tough bacon and the last layer has chicken bits slathered in an unidentifiable sauce.

Did the main restaurant fare any better?
 
The steak & ale pudding looked unappetizing right from the start, like a dark brown German military helmet dumped in a bowl. The outer layer was thick and tough, the ""steak"" mixed and filled out with bits of onion. Overall it was really poor and rather tasteless.  I left all the outer layer. The soup was just soup, nothing special and the complete meal was not worthy (or worth the cost). Very un-Stafford like and a pub frankly would have managed better (and cheaper).

The final bill had added discrepancies (never had that here before) which OK they removed after I pointed them out, but finally and really surprising was a so called ""Discretionary"" Service Charge which was already included into the final bill.  
This is a sneaky practice and coupled with their Fast Checkout facility is easily missed if you disagree with it, when rushing off to catch a flight for example. 
Be very aware - this charge is approx £15 per day, so a 4 day stay and if missed, you've lost £60!  
It is a practice I did NOT expect from a hotel of this class.

I'm sad because this was one of my favourite hotels in London, but with such uninspiring and clumsy food in both the Bar and the Restaurant, plus the so called Discretionary £15 a day Service Charge slipped into the final bill, I can't see myself or indeed any of my London friends staying here again.
I'm in London possibly a half dozen times a year for 3, 4 or 5 days at a time and tend to use the higher end hotel and prepared to pay.  
BUT it's a two way exchange and for this standard of hotel and at this cost I'm afraid I expect a lot better.",3,2017,01,17
142,Quiet and elegant,"My wife and I stayed at this well located but quiet hotel in the St James's area of London. So handy for the theatre and West End shopping. The staff are attentive, friendly, helpful and very professional. 

We enjoyed a wonderful dinner with friends in the restaurant and special thanks to the sommelier who gave us a private viewing of the hotel's magnificent cellar. The American Bar is also worthy of a visit with an extensive display of baseball caps and an equally impressive range of whiskies and bourbons.

We had a suite in the mews which was extremely well appointed and spacious.

We would return to The Stafford without hesitation. Thank you for making our visit such a special occasion!",5,2017,01,16
142,True Luxury in a Fantastic location,"We stayed at the Stafford hotel last weekend on a family visit to London, and my only regret is we didn't stay longer! 
It is a beautiful hotel, the staff cannot do enough for you, our room was available on arrival, despite us being very early. 
The location is ideal, minutes from green park tube station, and walking distance from lots of landmarks. 
we opted for breakfast on sunday morning and were overwhelmed by the choice and the quality of the dishes.
Will hopefully be returning soon for a longer stay!",5,2017,01,09
142,Wonderful stay over December holidays,"We stayed 5 nights over December holidays at the Stafford and had a wonderful time.  The staff were exceptional and did everything to make our stay comfortable and pleasant. They went above and beyond and there was never anything they couldn't do.  The rooms are cheerful and beautiful and we slept very well.  We loved dining in the American Bar and also in the main restaurant and we never felt rushed.  

I would totally stay at the Stafford again and would wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.",5,2017,01,06
142,Perfect hidden away gem hotel,"This was perfect in every way. Old england style hotel but renovated, hidden from the busy streets but in the heart of fashion streets, museums, historical plazas.. The quiet room for breakfasts is a treasure. Paintings with corgies and old portraits, fireplace , old pub at the rear of the hotel and a perfectly effective concierge who will go the extra mile to meet your requirements. 
",5,2017,01,03
142,AMAZING Stay!,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Stafford recently, it was PERFECT and from experience, one of the best hotels in London. Room was excellent, service was excellent, and when we asked for a tour of The Wine Cellars (highly recommended), they obliged immediately. Will definitely stay again.",5,2016,12,28
142,Wonderful Hotel Tucked Away in St. James,"If you look at my other reviews, you'll know we like this hotel.  It is elegant, refined and in the center of everything.  Prince Charles and Rupert Murdoch are your neighbors here.  On this visit, we encountered Ted Danson of ""Cheers"" fame hanging out in the lobby and later in the American Bar.
We stayed once again in the carriage house.  Nice and quiet, plenty of space with a home-like feel. We were told the carriage house rooms are being updated this winter so it will be interesting to see what they do with them.
On the rush to the airport, I did not closely examine my bill and later found an issue with some credits we were due.  This was quickly resolved via email on our return home.
As always we look forward to our return to the Stafford which we are planning now.",5,2016,12,27
142,A reason in itself to visit London,"We are regular guests of the Stafford, and have been for years. It always delights and is one of our favourite city hotels anywhere. It sometimes provides just that extra bit of impetus that causes us to choose London over other European cities. Like coming home. We have been remiss in not posting a review before now.
Our last visit was 10 days ago. As always, the experience was stellar, both overall and in the details - a warm and efficient welcome, a quiet and sumptuous room, the deeply knowledgeable and attentive concierge staff (Paul and Fernandez were especially helpful on this occasion), the elegant and intimate public spaces, the quality of the food and beverage, the tasteful seasonal decorations,and the general sense of calm and competence throughout. This hotel has personality without being intrusive. Many of its staff are long serving and distinguished in their branches of the hospitality profession. We look forward to our next stay.",5,2016,12,21
142,Oasis off Piccadilly,"If you want to avoid Bling five-star hotels near West End, and enjoy top British understated service, the Stafford is ideal. All the main shopping areas are within walking distance. The staff are very attentive without being intrusive.",5,2016,12,19
142,Divine,"Stayed here for one night as my wife and I were going to the ballet, a belated birthday present. This hotel was a find and is a true haven in the hustle and bustle of london. We were treated really well by all the staff nothing was to much effort. The restaurant food was amazing and we both enjoyed drinks and cocktails in the famous American bar...

You will not be disappointed with this place...like hotels used to be before they all became the same..",5,2016,12,19
142,A hotel with style and outstanding service,"As I write this review, I need to tell you that we've been staying at The Stafford for decades and this is the only London hotel that we will stay in. So, what brings us back with all the other great hotels available? First, the service here is out standing with the best concierge group in the city. Their knowledge and willingness to do whatever they need to meet your needs makes these people special.

Second, the location is the best in London. You are by Green Park, Buckingham Place, the theaters, Fortnum and Mason, Hatchards, and wonderful shopping. And you've got the Piccadilly line, which will take you all over the city. Third, with their new chef, you have delicious food and the best dover sole we've ever had. Fourth, this is a series of building that offer specially decorated rooms for all needs. I love the main house with its history and my husband likes the newest building with the big showers. Regardless what room you are in, the hotel is filled with history and charm.

Fifth, they've turned the back courtyard into a delightful, all-day dining experience with an expanded menu. So, you can dine outside, in the bar, in the living room, in your room, and in their lovely dining room. Wherever you chose, you will have a delicious meal.

So, over the years, what has changed that leaves us sad. First, the dining room has lost its quite intimate feel with packed, noisy, breakfast diners, so that we fled to the American Bar for a delightful and intimate breakfast. They use to have the most marvelous custom made strawberry jam, marmalade, and honey. Now they serve commercial jams.

Second, when it came to afternoon tea, no hotel could compare to The Stafford (and my friends and I have tried them all). The sandwiches have gotten smaller (like all the other teas), they dropped their delicious egg and mayo sandwiches (but prepared it for us on request), and no longer offer the variety of fabulous sandwiches they once had. For the new guest, this is still a lovely tea, but not what it use to be for us old timers. The Stafford afternoon tea is still popular, so make a reservation.

Third, as hotels now offer medium and large slippers, The Stafford has only the large size, so I bring mine from other hotels. They think of everything else to please guests, but have missed this one. A minor issue, but so untypical of a hotel that thinks of exceeding guest expectations.

Fourth, we were frustrated that the hotel didn't offer a secure internet service. I'd be willing to pay for access, if we had password protected service from everyone else using their computers..

As you can see, the small issues I described are minor given how fabulous this hotel is. I'd like to end this review telling you something special about The Stafford, which few guests know. In the American Bar, at the end of their beautiful  bar the last chair is in honor of and a memorial for an extraordinary woman. Nancy Wake. Here is what Wikipedia says about her: ""Nancy Grace Augusta Wake AC, GM (30 August 1912 – 7 August 2011) served as a British Special Operations Executive agent during the later part of World War II. She became a leading figure in the maquis groups of the French Resistance and was one of the Allies' most decorated servicewomen of the war. After the fall of France in 1940, she became a courier for the French Resistance and later joined the escape network of Captain Ian Garrow. By 1943, Wake was the Gestapo's most wanted person, with a 5 million-franc price on her head. 
After reaching Britain, Wake joined the Special Operations Executive. On the night of 29/30 April 1944, Wake was parachuted into occupied France Auvergne, becoming a liaison between London and the local maquis group headed by Captain Henri Tardivat in the Forest of Tronçais. From April 1944 until the liberation of France, her 7,000+ maquisards fought 22,000 German soldiers, causing 1,400 casualties, while suffering only 100 themselves."" Her first husband was tortured and murdered by the Nazis. When her second husband died, she was destitute and The Stafford provided her with a room and board. They even supported her when she entered a nursing home. When you are in the American Bar, stop by to see their loving memorial to Nancy. This small, untouted memorial shows that The Stafford is not only a commercially successful hotel, but also one with a loving heart and deep values.

As you can see, this is a hotel that holds our loyalty and respect.",5,2016,12,15
142,"A prime location, a cosy British atmosphere and a great service!",A great place to stay when in London!  Piccadilly and Hyde Park are only a few steps away.  The Junior Suites are beautiful and calm.  The breakfast buffet is incredible and the à-la-carte hot items are excellent!  The open Salon with fireplace is perfectly suited for a quick tea with friends or simply to read the morning paper.  The overall ambience is chic yet cosy and very British!  The service is discreet yet friendly and efficient.  My 2-night break-away at The Stafford was a fabulous experience!,5,2016,12,09
142,An after lunch drink,"After a good lunch with  a good friend in St James we popped into the Stafford for a glass of Champagne and a cigar.

They have an excellent court yard for smoking, it is quite private and heated.

It was a brilliant end to a very good lunch.",5,2016,12,08
142,Everything a five star hotel is supposed to be,"From check in to ambiance, service, concierge, location and service.. outstanding 
Price is reasonable for location and services . Professional classic from top to bottom. Excellent pub as well . Quite traditional English service ",4,2016,12,03
142,A gem in St James's,"What a lovely hotel-an absolute oasis of quiet and calm but just a few minutes stroll from Picadilly, Jermyn Street, Pall Mall, Bond Street, etc.- in fact most of the major places of interest in London are not far away. We pulled up outside the door, our bags were taken in from our car which was valet-parked for us. Our room was ready on arrival, so we were taken straight up having declined the offered tour as we have stayed previously. The room was lovely and warm & comfortable, had an espresso machine and was serviced promtly and perfectly during our 3-night stay. This hotel is just like a country house with delightful staff and service. Breakfasts are very civilsed with perfectly-cooked eggs to order, excellent black pudding and tasty sausages. We were delighted to find that when we came down on Sunday morning, that the Christmas trees and decorations were up and the fires burning in the fire-places added to the ambiance. This is a lovely, conveniently-situated gem of a hotel to which we will surely return.",5,2016,12,01
142,A great find !,"Excellent location, super staff and a really comfortable bed.  
We arrived well ahead of the normal check in time but the staff were so helpful and turned a room around for us while we enjoyed coffee in the drawing room. NIce :).",5,2016,11,30
142,Perfect Thanksgiving dinner,"Absolutely amazing meal! Just found the hotel walking through London from the river. Had a set Thanksgiving menu which was really great.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Food was lovely, would go again!!",5,2016,11,30
142,Unparalleled Excellence,"The Stafford is one of the greatest hotels I have ever stayed at. Walking into the lobby is more like coming home than arriving at a hotel. The rooms, particularly in the mews, are amazing. Comfortable beds, ample space and all the right amenities are the hallmarks. 
As wonderful as the physical space is, it is the people that really make the difference. Notable are Peter the Concierge and Lionel, Irita, Inese and Erik who make The American Bar and Grill the best spot in London for a friendly cocktail.
I would not hesitate recommending this hotel to anyone who is willing to spend a bit more for a truly excellent hotel experience. ",5,2016,11,26
142,Beautiful,"Hotel and staff were equally fantastic. Such beautiful charming decor and in an ideal location hidden away from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly. We were upgraded to a Suite which was lovely and I was even left a birthday cake in our room. Only negative was waiting a long time for breakfast and when it arrived, my partners was cold. We understand that these things can happen sometimes and the staff were more upset than we were. We would return in an instant ",5,2016,11,20
142,Our home in London,"Beautiful hotel! Very English, detailed decor elevated the experience.  Room is comfortable and well furnished.  Hospitality staff are professional and helpful.  Location is great, as it's just off Piccadilly.  We would definitely come back again when next in London!",5,2016,11,19
142,London Finest Charm and,This was my first time to London.  I was thrilled to have stayed in one of the most perfect charming London hotels. We stayed in one of the suites out inthe stables. If you want elegance in a true english setting this is place.The room was decorated in english traditional charm with a fireplace with comfortable beds. I loved everything about it. The American Bar located in the hotel is cozy and busy with lots of people warming up from a cold day. A must see and to enjoy. I adored also having tea outside the main dining room. This is truly one of my favorite London hotels that give you 100% London charm and elegance. Not to mention the staff is superb.,5,2016,11,15
142,A legitimate five star hotel,"No surprises here.  It is a fine hotel with very nice rooms, common areas and superb service. The bar named the American bar, is very popular busy and loud.  There is another calmer place to have drinks tea or coffee where a conversation can be held.  A huge breakfast spread with a big selection of fruit and baked goods.  All in all a very enjoyable experience.  Dinning room good in general is just OK nothing special so would suggest going elsewhere for dinner",5,2016,11,12
142,Fantastic!,"First time we decided to stay here and we we're not disappointed.  Staff are friendly and attentive. We were upgraded to a Classic King room, which had a small dressing area as well as our main bedroom.  Bathroom was fitted out in a marble extravaganza which was very clean and a good size.  Beds were very comfy and linens were beautiful, just the sort you sink into.  Great location just by St James Park and a short walk through to Oxford St and Soho.  We had afternoon tea in the restaurant/lounge area which was beautiful.  Drinks in the American Bar (which is open to the public) can get a bit busy and loud, but coming back to the hotel at the end of the night and having a nightcap it seemed to only be hotel guests drinking there.  Overall highly recommended, spend a few more pounds and make your stay in London an enjoyable one.",5,2016,11,12
142,"Our ""home"" while in London since 1980.","Our family has stayed at The Stafford since 1980 for both business and pleasure.  The minute I walk through the door, I feel like I am at home.  The staff is always very helpful and so nice. My husband & I spent or honeymoon there and we celebrated my parents 50th wedding anniversary at The Stafford.  My most recent stay was in October with a friend to visit my daughter who is studying in London and I was so happy to see that my dad's photo with his dog Duke is still in The American Bar! The perfect place for a pre-dinner cocktail and/or nightcap.  The Stafford's location is perfect as it's nestled between St James, Piccadilly and Green Park.  I can't wait to go back to The Stafford in two weeks with my son and husband!",5,2016,11,07
142,An absolute gem....,"On arrival we were upgraded to a stable room..... Beautiful... The most comfortable bed I've slept in in any hotel..... The room key card said welcome home, and we truly felt at home, from the welcome we got at reception to the wonderful  food in the restaurant , to the lovely staff... Highly recommended, worth every penny, we will most certainly be back.",5,2016,11,06
142,Outstanding!,"My partner and I stayed in The Stafford Hotel in London following a recommendation from a family member. 
The hotel is situated close to Green Park station (5min walk) so is in a great location for exploring the city. Buckingham Palace is just a short walk through Green Park (approx 7min), so again ideal for anyone eager to see the sights. 
The hotel is beautiful and classic in its decor and there is a real sense of grandeur throughout. The service on reception was excellent and the staff throughout the whole hotel were so helpful and knowledgeable, and could not do enough to ensure our stay was perfect. 
I had booked a Deluxe King room for our stay but on arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was fabulous and spacious with a view over the courtyard and I would definitely recommended this for a special occasion. 
The hotel bar is a treasure trove of sporting memorabilia which has been given to the hotel by guests. The cocktails were excellent and there was a great relaxed atmosphere. 
The hotel breakfast was wonderful- service again was fabulous and the food was delicious. 
I could not speak highly enough of this hotel and would not hesitate to return when I'm visiting London in the future. ",5,2016,11,06
142,American bar for cocktails,Really nice comfortable traditional bar serving great cocktails and drinks.  In the heart of St James.  A lot of American memorabilia on the walls and ceiling there is a really relaxing atmosphere.  Hotel itself is great although the rooms are a bit over priced.,5,2016,11,06
142,A hidden delight,"This is a hidden corner of london you have to try !  Great bar, great lounge,beautiful bedrooms, lovely staff, hidden away, but close to everywhere.  The General Manager, Stuart, is ever present, and always happy to talk , even with his strong northern accent !",5,2016,11,04
142,Lovely Stay at the Stafford,"I arrived to the stunning elegance of the Stafford and was immediately given the ""red carpet"" treatment. Upon learning my name once, the staff addressed me by name the entire visit. My room was clean and beautifully appointed, the staff was cordial and professional and went out of their way to make my stay spectacular. The room service was timely (faster than expected), the food prepared by their chef was delicious, and the American bar was a great place to unwind (the courtyard was lovely too). I can't wait to return for another solo trip to London, and I will indeed return to the Stafford. To the entire staff who made my trip one I'll remember for a lifetime - a sincere and heartfelt THANK YOU.",5,2016,11,01
142,Perfect,"Just left after 4 night stay at the Stafford.  Enjoyed everything about the hotel. Small, inviting, comfortable common areas.....excellent service but discreet. Outdoor seating for drinks and lunch was a big plus.  Rooms were large and comfortable.  My new favorite in London. ",5,2016,10,31
142,Always a great stay!,"I've been staying at the Stafford for years both when making business trips as well as for personal vacations.  Each and every time the stay has been memorable.  The staff is outstanding--especially the concierge and bell desk staff who have been at the Stafford for ages and actually remember their guests!  They are also very dialed into the London restaurant scene and are tops at getting those hard to make reservations.  The location of the hotel near Green Park and the tube station there is ideal.  The rooms, although typically small by US standards, are well appointed and comfortable.  The American Bar is unique and well worth the stay if for no other reason.  In fact my just-graduated-college daughter placed a hat on the famous ceiling of the Bar...Amherst College Volleyball:  see if you can find it when you visit!  Can't imagine staying anyplace else in London (and I'm there 3-4 times a year)!",5,2016,10,27
142,Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel located in St. James Place in central London has maintained superb service,quality and a sense of home away from home since I first visited some forty
years ago.
It is smaller than some of the other well known hotels in London which allows the staff
to know its guests and provide more personal service.",5,2016,10,26
142,A wonderful stay,"This lovely, elegant hotel was perfectly located.  The underground was just a few steps down a little alley to the Green Park Station - easy access to airport and the tower of London.
Piccadilly circus was just a few blocks down and many shops were all around and there were several excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.
The American Bar was our favorite hang out place right in the hotel. High Tea was wonderful as was breakfast and dinner.",5,2016,10,25
142,Stately Five-Star luxury away from the crowds,"When we go to the mountains we tend to avoid the highest peaks because there are more people climbing them just because they are the highest. If you climb the lesser known, 2nd highest mountain, its a much nicer experience because there will be less people and there may only be a metre difference in height!

Choosing the Stafford over the Ritz would be the same analogy... Stately Five-Star luxury in the heart of London and just around the corner from the busy Ritz.",5,2016,10,25
142,A welcoming elegant home while in London.,"Not only does the Stafford provide one of London's very best locations in St. James, next to Green Park and Mayfair, but it also provides very personal service to guests, with great attention to their needs and individual preferences. 
The staff makes you feel like it is your own home, if only you were so lucky.",5,2016,10,24
142,I really wanted this place to be as good as the reviews. But not quite.,"Positive:
The hotel has a really nice out of the way English country house hotel feel. Great bar, nice restaurant, none of the hustle and bustle of central London. nice classical décor and lots of helpful staff.
Negative:
The service just wasn't quite up to snuff. Two days of the three I asked for them my wake up call just didn't come. The first time they fooled me and I overslept and had to go running across London to make my meeting. The second time I was smart enough to leave a back up on my smart phone so no harm done. The hotel is also not on a main street at all and can be difficult to find. The staff does a poor job explaining how to get to and from the hotel (one passage closes at 10:00 pm but you will discover that when you find it closed).
Minor stuff I know I not what you would hope from a top flight hotel.",4,2016,10,22
142,This is what you think about when you think London elegance. ,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Stafford at the end of a 32 day 8 country business trip so I was tired and in need of some luxury and that's what got. The staff was very professional and friendly, the rooms are small but it's an old typical English design. Plenty of room for two and a great bathroom. I didn't have time to dine there but the American Bar was fantastic great ambiance and bartender. 
Close to all the major attractions and the best shopping in London. Can't wait to go back. ",5,2016,10,20
142,Can't wait to come back!,"The bed was the most comfortable I had ever slept in. The room small but perfectly adequate with every comfort and luxury on hand. The bath divine and the staff just lovely. It resonates a luxurious feel throughout and this will not be my last time staying at this hotel. I wish I could have stayed longer! It was also so quiet, you could hardly believe you were in the centre of London.",5,2016,10,20
142,Lovely in every way,"From the moment we arrived it was a welcoming charming atmosphere. After a very long flight it was a pleasure to be so efficiently and pleasantly received. The room was bright, restful, spacious and very appealing. The Hotel situation very convenient and if we couldn't walk to our interest spots, taxis were always just a few minutes from the call. Restaurant lovely and especially the historic Pub.",5,2016,10,17
142,Nice Hotel!,"Stayed for a night, nice room, expensive bar though, good location, near tube at Green park and Bond Street, St James etc, probably the most expensive French 75 ever had, beds comfortable, nice bathrooms and toiletries, did not eat here but looked good.....thats about it",4,2016,10,14
142,A nice place to celebrate a special occasion,"We stayed at the Stafford during our weekend trip to London in celebration of a special anniversary. The  hotel is in a great location a short and easy walk to St James Park or just a little further to Kensington Gardens. We found it to be a relatively quiet place with a nice bit of energy. The hotel is a combination of a posh residence and a converted mews (yes a horse stable). We elected to stay in one of the converted stable rooms as we thought this would be a little different and fun...it was. The hotel staff were fantastic. They were always there and continuously went out of their way to make our stay memorable. We ate our breakfasts here, had a late night bar meal on our arrival and an afternoon snack before heading out to a show. The food was well prepared and the service was good.

The decor of the hotel is a mix of formal and casual, all very nice. The bar area is adorned with an interesting collection of almost anything you could imagine to do with sports. In the mews area is an open courtyard with outdoor dining, informal and nice. Our room was well appointed with everything we could have wanted and the bedding was great.

While we enjoyed our room in the converted stable we feel we must offer a caution. The Hotel have situated outdoor dining in a way that pretty much blocks access to the ground floor rooms. This was OK during times when there were no people at the tables. (I have attached a few pictures) However from mid afternoon until late evening the tables were full and we had to ask people to allow us access to our room...not so good. This also created an issue with noise right up against the window and entrance door to our room. We would not hesitate to return to the Stafford but WILL NOT STAY IN THE STABLE ROOMS. 

Really Good! the staff, the character of the hotel, the location, the quality of appointments
Not So Good...the outdoor dining blocking access to some of the rooms",5,2016,10,12
142,A Perfect London Getaway,"We spent two nights in London at the end of a an extended land and river cruise vacation in Europe.  We wanted some time to decompress before heading home, and the Stafford did not disappoint.  

The hotel arranged transportation from Heathrow for us, and from the moment their host Cecilia met us until the moment we left two days later, we were extremely impressed with the service, ambiance, and location of the hotel.

We were within walking distance of Piccadilly, Jermyn Street, and every other place we wanted to go.  Our room was very quiet, and even with three weeks worth of luggage, we had plenty of room.  If you are looking for a high energy, modern hotel, you might be disappointed -- the Stafford is old-world elegant with service levels to match.

We would definitely stay there again!",5,2016,10,12
142,Great hotel in great location,Located within walking distance of most theatres and near wonderful restaurants.  Lovely room with full tub and excellent service.  Could not have been more pleased.  It is located off a main street so quite.  Excellent bar and delicious breakfast.  It was my first time there and I would definitely go back.,5,2016,10,06
142,Good ,"Very nice presented hotel, stayed for 1 night but had a really good room, it was modern and quite space full.
Cosy and nice. Would recommend .
Staff was good as well.
Would go back whenever need to book a hotel in London again.",4,2016,10,03
142,Harbour in the storm,"Enjoyed another really good stay at the Stafford last week, and if anything, it was even better than before.

Excellent service all round, they serve a great Martini in the American Bar which should not be missed.

Had one of their junior suites in the mews, and very much worth spending that little bit more. So quiet you would have thought that it was out in the country rather than in a busy major city.

One of the most comfortable beds I have come across in a hotel!",5,2016,10,03
142,5* sophistication in London,"We had booked an evening's stay at the Stafford as part of a special birthday celebration and loved it.  It seems like the epitome of a charming, friendly 5 star hotel.  The staff gave us a great welcome - we were slightly early so we sat down to some tea while the room was finished.  And the room was lovely.
There is one entrance that leads down a small alley to Green Park and a back entrance that leads to Piccadilly and the tube at Green Park.  You are right in the centre of London and close to the Royal Academy, Fortnums, Waterstones and Jermyn Street among many others.  
A lovely base for a stay in London and somewhere to enjoy.",5,2016,10,01
142,An excellent stay,"absolutely brilliant hotel. Service was quiet, inconspicuous but attentive. Room was large with high quality beds, bedding and fittings. Bar had a lovely atmosphere. Breakfast was included in our rate (otherwise it would have been very expensive) but was of a high standard. Would return without question",5,2016,09,29
142,A Real Gem - The Ritz but Cheaper,"First time to stay here and before staying had never even heard of it. Tucked away down a fairly insignificant side street the hotel entrance is not very commanding but once inside the quality and ambience really shows.

Every aspect of the hotel is based on traditional styling and it works. I stayed in a Deluxe King room which was a good size and very well appointed with a good size Bathroom complete with tub and separate shower. The bed was very comfortable.

In the rear courtyard to the hotel, which also serves for al fresco dining from the ground floor bar, what must have been the original stable blocks to the building, were all converted into suites.

Location is excellent, you are a 2 minute walk from Piccadilly and only about 5 minutes from the famous Ritz hotel which the Stafford Hotel gives a run on its money in terms of quality of service. This is a genuine alternative in my opinion.

On the whole, you can't fault this Hotel.",5,2016,09,23
142,Home away from home!,"We arrived at The Stafford hotel and was greeted immediately. Our suite was perfect for our family of 3. It was also impeccably clean and comfortable. ur night time maid, Maria was lovely. The concierge (Charlie and Peter) helped us plan out our week. We enjoyed our breakfast in the morning, plus we ate at the American bar twice. The food was delicious. 5 STARS! We will DEFINITELY stay there again, Lord willing!!! The location is walking distance to St. James park, Buckingham Palace, National Gallery, Trafalgar Square... Quiet location, and oasis from all the hustle and bustle.",5,2016,09,19
142,Wonderful hotel and staff!,"My friend and I were given a lovely room with no stairs and a walk-in shower after we expressed concern about getting in and out of the bathtub.  Staff and the hotel were lovely, and our stay was delightful.  The concierge and staff in the dining room made sure our stay was memorable.  Air conditioning was a plus since some days were unusually warm.",5,2016,09,19
142,Hidden gem hotel,"We were not lucky this time, having a very nice room, with an extraordinary confortable king bed BUT unfortunately we were just in front of two service doors (plus one extra door in the corridor), so wake up unrequested was very early... But this was simply not our day because the hotel is just great, deserves its 5 star level. Bathroom is nice and full of amenities. Breakfast buffet excellent even not the Ritz one and the scrambled eggs salmon beautifull to see and excellent ! Hope to be more lucky next time with the location of the room because it would be unfair to keep this impression.",5,2016,09,18
142,Hotel stay and dinner,"We recently spent three days in London during a visit to the UK to see our son graduate from Oxford. I planned a special dinner one night and after looking all around London for a quiet dining spot with a round table to accommodate a party of six, found it on Trip Advisor in the Stafford Hotel where we were staying. When we arrived at the hotel I was informed that two  in our party had been upgraded to better rooms. We were offered a suite in the Mews rather than the suite we reserved in the main building and it was very spacious and beautiful.  We were greeted by an young man who asked if the private room selected for our dinner was satisfactory. After looking at the three different rooms, I decided the Panel Room best met our needs. They willingly moved us from the Pink Room to the Panel Room. We asked if we could tour the wine cellar, and Mark gave us a first rate look at a fascinating part of the hotel that was rich with history. We were off to a play that evening and when we arrived for dinner everything was perfect. The room was warm and inviting, the chef prepared wonderful meals, the service was just right as when ever we needed something it was there, but we still had privacy to enjoy a family occasion. In all, our three days at the Stafford were very special. The staff was friendly and helpful, the accommodations were first class, and we felt as though it was a home away from home. The location is on a quiet street with wonderful shopping near by. We will certainly return to the Stafford on our next trip to London.",5,2016,09,08
142,Lovely hotel,"The staff are very attentive and friendly. The bedroom was beautiful and very well equipped. The location is great, very central and particularly good for the palace, parks and Westminster . The American bar is absolutely wonderful.",5,2016,09,06
142,Wonderful stay at the Stafford!,The accommodations and staff were exquisite.  Fantastic location as well.  I have never stayed at a hotel that was more accommodating with any situation or request.  This is now my new favorite hotel in London.,5,2016,09,06
142,Excellent private meal in the wine cellars ,"Attentive service, gorgeous food and an evening to remember. Set in the wine cellars used as a bunker in the Second World War, my colleagues and I enjoyed a private meal. The staff were always on hand to keep drinks topped up and the food (I had asparagus/duck/parfait) was excellent. I'd highly recommend!",5,2016,09,06
142,Yes yes ......superb in all ways,"Booked for a family lunch outside , a great courtyard area , an imaginative menu , delightful staff , lovely French rose , and ideal for adults and children , quiet within minutes of shops , a few too many hedge suits bragging of the morning activities in markets ....but overall this is substance over show ...always loved the venue .....but we should keep to ourselves ....👍😏",5,2016,09,05
142,Absolutely splendid ,"Met outside for lunch it is just like being in the country right in the heart of London.

The weather was perfect a hot summer day could not have enjoyed it more.

The bar in the hotel is also one of the best In London but if possible to drink eat outside is a real treat!! ",5,2016,09,03
142,Stunning hotel ,"We have just spent 4 days in this magnificent hotel located in a quiet street but in the heart of London . The staff here are excellent nothing is too much bother . Our breakfast was included and delivered to our room was delicious. The room is beautifully appointed very English , we would recommend anyone to stay here . ",5,2016,09,02
142,New Favorite London Hotel,"Quiet location in busy London, brimming with English charm and a welcoming & professional staff. Everyone was efficient and friendly, notably Paul the evening concierge (very helpful, great guy), Kitty in the bar/restaurant (I'm misspelling her name) and the longtime bar mgr (name escapes me) who ran a tight ship with a great sense of humor. Although located on a quiet street the Hotel is within walking distance--or short Tube ride--to everything London has to offer from B'ham Palace to Trafalgar Sq to Piccadilly to Mayfair and much more. It's our new go-to Hotel in London. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2016,08,30
142,Our Weekend Away at The Stafford,"A fabulous hotel! A warm welcome with very helpful and accommodating, friendly staff.
We bid for a room any this hotel in an auction at a Ball for Kids in Need!
We had a superb Deluxe room. The bed was incredible- so enormous and the best we've ever slept in!
Great location for shops and theatre. Lovely mews/courtyard outside dining area - ideal for lunch and afternoon tea! Breakfast included with a mouthwatering array of fresh fruit, yogurts, salmon, continental selection before your hot breakfast (Eggs Royale superb!)
Would definitely choose this hotel again...(Oh and ask for a tour of the wine cellar)",5,2016,08,29
142,The Stafford has it's MoJo back !,"After many years of staying at The Stafford I had actually stopped going during 2013 /14 because things weren't quite as good as they had been in the past. I am delighted to report that The Stafford is back on top and better than ever. I stayed 2 nights earlier this month and it was back to business as usual with the combination of things that you expect from a great hotel. Superb staff, great food, calm relaxed and unruffled service. The Stafford is a haven of tranquility in one of the world's busiest cities.",5,2016,08,27
142,Loved this place,"What a wonderful experience to stay here. The location is fantastic, the staff is helpful and friendly all the time, loved the American Bar. Just a very lovely stay.
We enjoyed a leisurely breakfast and then brunch in the dining room. 
I would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,08,26
142,Great place to stay,"Excellent service from all staff, nothing is too small to sort out for you. Rooms excellent with little finishing touches that make you feel welcome. The breakfast was excellent, the best I have had for anywhere I have stayed in London.",5,2016,08,25
142,A Wonderful Edwardian feel to a small luxury hotel!,"The rooms are beautifully decorated; the beds are exquisitely comfortable! The staff is friendly without being intrusive. The dining room is intimate and quiet. Tea is served in an adjacent lounge and is excellent.
The hotel is situated in a cup-de-sac and therefore is extremely quiet despite being in the heart of St. James and just off Piccadilly. It is within walking distance of the National Gallery, Piccadilly Circus, Parliament Square, Buckingham Palace, the Mall, and Mayfair.
An excellent place to stay.",5,2016,08,25
142,Boutique and Unique.,"This place is incredibly.

I stayed over Easter and was welcomed with a large chocolate egg and champagne. 

The staff are accommodating and caring, the service and concierge is faultless.

The rooms are generously sized with elegant styling, and their in-house pub forced me to try my first 'english beer', and only a short walk to everything you need.

This is the best London has to offer.",5,2016,08,25
142,Absolutely fantastic,"Everything from lunch on the outside terrace, to our gorgeous Carriage House room with Floris toiletries and a bed fit for a king, to the wonderful American bar and delicious breakfast were perfect. The Stafford is my new hotel of choice in the capital. Compared to other hotels who profess to be at this level, you definitely get more than you pay for!",5,2016,08,23
142,Maters of their craft !,"Every detail of this hotel has been well thought out , from the warm but formal greeting through to the immaculate reception that makes you feel like you are the centre of attention. The staffs eye for detail is impressive clearly stewarded by a manager who has reputation for being one of the best in the business.

The room was superb, from the quality of the finish and fittings and the most important thing, the feeling of being in a top quality home, refreshed after sleeping on a bed fit for a king then in to a top quality appointed bathroom leaving you feeling brand new and ready for the day ahead.

Every day has to start with a decent breakfast and the Stafford will exceed any expectation, the informal but professional greeting invites you to the relaxed but attentive environment where your every need is met without you having to ask for anything.
The reputation this hotel has is fully deserved and the experience you will have will leave an indelible mark and leave you thinking "" Can it actually get better than this ! """,5,2016,08,23
142,Quintessentially English Oasis in the heart of Piccadilly,"This is a delightful hotel, with extremely charming staff who are very willing to please. The hotel is located close to wonderful Old Bond Street and Fortnum and Mason and Regent street for shopping and art galleries. The hotel is wonderfully appointed and despite being quintessentially English is appointed with all mod cons. Our bedroom was large and airy with the most comfortable bed, breakfast was delicious. There is a wonderful bar where the cocktails are superb and very well worth a visit for pre dinner drinks and a night cap. There's also a large outside seating area where you can enjoy a lovely al fresco lunch (weather permitting) ! We enjoyed a very happy and most comfortable stay!",5,2016,08,22
142,loved it,"very nice hotel in a great location, reasonable walk to anything you want to do. Lovely outdoor area. Breakfast every morning was excellent and the staff in the dining room very professional. the room itself was very nice and the bathroom spacious. bed very comfortable. There is no question in my mind that we would stay here again next time we are in london.",5,2016,08,22
142,Boutique class act!!,"We loved our time at the very classy Stafford on St James Place. Location, staff and facilities are all top notch. Right next door to Buckingham Palace and midway between Piccadilly and Pall Mall. We walked in all directions with many of the iconic sites nearby. Hyde Park, Westminster Abby, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Soho, Harrods and plenty more are within 15 minutes walk. We walked back from the Tower of London via St Pauls Cathedral and the round trip through Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall. 
Perhaps we were blessed with 4 days of perfect weather. 
Ferdinand our concierge knows everyone and everything going on. His recommendations were spot on and nothing too much trouble. Gregory gave us a private tour of one of London's oldest and perhaps best stocks cellars. He was incredibly helpful and escorted us down Crown Lane to a fantastic little Italian Restuaraunt. 
The Littleton Restuarant and the American Bar at the hotel have plenty of charm and class and excellent fare. 
This was a real treat for us on our first visit to London and was one of the highlights of our trip.  ",5,2016,08,20
142,Fab hotel in London...,"Myself and my partner visit London many times and have stayed in loads of hotels in central London. This is by far the best.. In terms of location, rooms (the rooms in the mews are very special) and bar..",5,2016,08,18
142,It just keeps getting better,"I've enjoyed The Stafford for many years.  This visit was with my family and I can't say enough good things about the service and staff.  The hotel is great and location is excellent, but the people of the Stafford are outstanding.  The courtyard off the American Bar and Carriage House rooms is a charming quiet oasis in the heart of London.",5,2016,08,17
142,Great hotel,The service was amazing.  The hotel is adorable - very quaint and English but also comfortable.  My room was big and clean and very well decorated.  It was also very quiet.  Lovely outside terrace at the rear of the hotel too.  I would definitely return.,5,2016,08,16
142,Weekend stay,"The hotel was 100% brilliant. All the staff was very helpful and the hotel is a fantastic building with all traditional features. 
Outside to the rear is an amazing courtyard where you can relax and fine dine or simply enjoy a beverage. 
The food is amazing and lots of choices to suit all.
We will return again to this hotel and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
",5,2016,08,15
142,Mrs Rogerson ,Absolutely wonderful stay 5* service care and attention from staff amazing rooms beautiful extremely clean and luxurious this hotel is very classy and provides a very enjoyable stay food excellent especially the breakfast and  courtyard bar area are delightful ,5,2016,08,14
142,Lovely,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff, food was lovely dined every evening while I was staying here. Always greeted with a smile or good morning,afternoon or evening. Room was comfy. Staff helped with cases. Would recommend to anyone travel for business. ",5,2016,08,13
142,Fabulous 5 star stay!,"We had a suite in this luxurious hotel and it was stunning. The decor was perfect with lovely sitting room and very large bedroom with marble bathroom. We asked for breakfast to be delivered to our room and was delivered with silver tea pots etc, everything we could have wished for. The staff were great also. We had a drink and a sandwich in the bar after our theatre visit which had a great atmosphere, like something from an old movie. This hotel made our stay in London very memorable, for all the right reasons.",5,2016,08,11
142,Sedate Stafford Hotel,"The Stafford Hotel located at 16-18 St. James Place in London is set on a quiet street but close enough for visitors to London's Piccadilly area, Green Park, the Ritz Hotel and the theater district. We were able to walk back at night from the theater and felt safe, despite the ""lateness"" of the hour.
Our room was small but elegantly and sedately furnished. Most of all it was quiet, almost quietly elegant. 
Afternoon tea was a pleasant experience, though I've had better and more memorable sandwiches and pastries. Our experience was marred by someone on her telephone. Perhaps, people could be asked to step outside to answer their phones. Breakfast was served cheerfully and the wait staff was very attentive. 
The staff is helpful and most accommodating. I would not hesitate to stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2016,08,10
142,A fabulous hotel,"I stayed for one night with friends at the weekend and cannot fault this lovely hotel.  It is perfectly placed within easy reach of many attractions. We dropped our luggage off before going out for the day and returned late afternoon and the check in process was very smooth. The staff were great with the right balance of being friendly and polite but not too over the top. We stayed in a junior suite in the Mews. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a separate seating area that was transformed into a bed while we were out for the evening. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were the best I have had in a hotel.  The bathroom was huge and the Floris toiletries were lovely. 

We had a cocktail in the American Bar before going out for the evening and found the many photos and memorabilia very interesting. I also thought the courtyard was like a little oasis away from all the noise.  You wouldn't know you were in the middle of London. 

We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was incredible. I particularly loved the pantry table which had everything you could possibly want - cereal, yogurts, fresh fruit, cured meats and cheeses along with pastries. You could also order a hot dish and I had waffles which were amazing!  My friends had egg dishes which they were also very impressed with. 

I will definitely be recommending this hotel to my friends and family when they are in London and hope to stay again very soon.",5,2016,08,10
142,Superb service and spacious rooms,"Hats-off to the superb service at this hotel at the center of London.  We were traveling with two children and this hotel was child-friendly.  The rooms were clean, spacious and felt like ""home"" away from home.  Staff was very helpful and definitely tried to go an extra mile to make our stay memorable.  Thumbs-up!",5,2016,08,10
142,A perfect hotel experience,"The Stafford is tucked away off St. James Street, far enough that it's blissfully away from all the noise, but not the London attractions.  I'm almost afraid to post how much this is one of my favorite hotels, because I really would like to keep it a secret. The staff is wonderful, the room, though small, charming ( we had a king sized bed), and the restaurant very nice. We walked to Buckingham Palace, the War Museum, and Westminister Abbey from there.  Convent Gardens and the theaters aren't far, either. We will return!",5,2016,08,09
142,Second to none...,"I stayed at the Stafford the Saturday night before the RideLondon 100. 

This was dangerous as I warmed to the Stafford so quickly, I didn’t want to leave and head to the start of the ride very early Sunday morning.  

It’s hard not to like the Stafford, from the very comfortable room to the great staff I met. The hotel staff could not be nicer and more helpful.  They recommended a fantastic Italian restaurant on Saturday night, Il Viccolo, but also prepared breakfast, at an ungodly hour. Breakfast also including specific food that a cyclist would appreciate.  Together with safe bike storage, the Stafford left nothing unturned. This allowed me to get ready for the ride, stress free.

I eventually returned to the Stafford on Sunday afternoon to the welcome of enthusiastic staff, genuinely keen to find out how I was and how the ride went.  You can't beat what the Stafford does, anywhere!!

See you very soon and thank you so much.",5,2016,08,04
142,A gorgeous hotel in a superb location,"Set alongside Green Park and St James's Palace, the location is as good as it gets in London. The hotel and its level of service from the staff are also as good as London has to offer. I cannot praise them enough. 
The room was spacious and beautifully furnished, the courtyard where we sat and had an informal meal was a peaceful oasis inside the hustle and bustle of the city.",5,2016,08,04
142,The Best Service in London,"An all too brief stay overnight before the Ride 100 cycling event. Nothing was too much trouble for the team - safe bike storage, great local restaurant recommendation - Il Viccolo, very early breakfast request and a fantastic Stafford burger in the courtyard after the ride to finish off a great stay. 

Great room, great location and the best staff in the industry!",5,2016,08,03
142,A terrific oasis in the heart of Central London,"I have been staying at the Stafford for years having been introduced to this hotel from one of my best friends. As a recreational pilot and interested in history, nothing quite like the American Bar to evoke such a special atmosphere. Frank, the concierge at the Stafford always ensures my stay is pleasurable and attends to any request with charm and efficiency. I can recommend this to any business traveler - its the right counterpoint to the end of a busy day.",5,2016,08,02
142,What a find!,"After staying at another boutique hotel, nearby and quite well-known, for more than 20 years, we decided to try the Stafford, which is nearby in St. James Place. We simply could not have been more pleased. The hotel oozes old world British charm throughout, but at the same time has all the modern amenities – items like flat screen TVs, Express Check-out and Wi-Fi that actually works the way it's supposed to. 

The bar, called the American Bar, is a delight, with one room adorned by aircraft models hanging from the ceiling. The hotel staff could not be nicer and more helpful. Of course, the location is excellent, about a five minute walk from Piccadilly, perhaps 10 minutes from Piccadilly Circus. Need a haircut? The oldest barber shop in the world is a five minute walk.

We'll be returning. Couldn't be more pleased!",5,2016,08,02
142,Hospitality at its best,"You know you are in a safe pair of hands, when the hotel of your choice, The Stafford London, invites you in and takes care of all your worries. Staying overnight for the London Surrey 100 cycle event involves unusual requests regarding bike storage, how will I get my bike so early in the morning, a choice of a local restaurant choice specific to a cyclists needs. an early personalised breakfast (04.30am) for a group of 6 concentrating on nutrition for an epic endurance event plastic secure fasteners to fasten your number to your bike as one broke (05.05am) and a room to come back and change after the event.

These are the issues swirling around your head! But in true style Frank and his team had already anticipated our every need, the service was seamless, pro active thinking at its best.

A massive thank you to Frank and your team for a service that can only be described as 'Bellissimo'.

",5,2016,08,02
142,An excellent stay at the Stafford as always.,"Typical of the high level of service: when I arrived, there was a small group checking in so one of the concierge team asked another receptionist to come out to help me check in so avoiding any wait. Very helpful.",5,2016,08,01
142,Truly excellent hotel,"The Stafford is a special place .Great location with superb staff who simply go that extra mile to look after their guests .
We had  short but memorable stay.
Courtyard is a delight and the food was excellent.",5,2016,08,01
142,Lunch at The Stafford,My family and I visited the hotel to have lunch. I had stayed at the hotel many years ago and on this occasion was looking for a quiet and tranquil place for a special celebration. We had a very appetising meal with excellent wine served very efficiently by a team of attentive staff.,5,2016,08,01
142,"Amazing locations, great staff!","Fantastic location!!! The Stafford Hotel is located within walking distance from Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus. Our room was very comfortable. The staff was A++++. especially Iulia, Liz and Susana, in general everyone was very friendly! Will come back for sure!",5,2016,07,30
142,Amazing,"This hotel is so amazing location is not too far from Green Park the atmosphere is warm and welcoming Staff very friendly. Majority of the rooms have the view of Green Park.
The American Bar is a great place for a casual dinner. I definitely will return here. 
My stay was extremely comfortable and relaxing from start to finish, I would definitely  recommend the Stafford hotel .",5,2016,07,29
142,We loved every minute of our stay,We loved every minute of our stay. We were greeted like long lost friends and felt at home immediately. I can honestly say that every member of staff with whom we came into contact was absolutely delightful.  Our stay was comfortable and relaxing from beginning to end. I would highly recommend the Stafford hotel to any visitor.,5,2016,07,28
142,Ideal hotel and location for a London weekend.,"Can't say enough about this hotel and it""s staff.  I'm originally from the UK but now live in the USA and recently visited with my American Fiancé - her first trip to the UK.  It was everything we could have hoped for in terms English style with modern amenities.  The American Bar also added a great retreat from the busy London scene for cocktails and after dinner drinks.  There are many attractions within easy walking distance but the highlight has to be the shopping around Bond St.  This hotel really is well kept secret and I only wish we'd had more than two nights to spend in London.  We will be back !!",5,2016,07,28
142,"Quietly elegant, yet efficient","We had afternoon tea in the Stafford on one of the hottest days of the Summer.
It was a relief to come into this comfortable, elegant hotel and settle back in the lovely couches and have a hearty, yet refined Afternoon tea. We started with a calming glass of champagne, which just hit the spot. The sandwiches are artfully done with thin slices of bread, perfect roast beef, They change around, but the roast beef was delicious. 
We worked our way through the salad, onto the scones, the tiny raspberry cakes. Every bite was tasty and just right.
I would add this to a visit to London especially if there are older people in the group.",5,2016,07,27
142,Lovely hotel,"We spent several days here in the Guv'nor's Suite in the Carriage House. What a charming suite! Beautiful accommodation, although with only one window it seemed a little dark. Also, you must walk across the courtyard to enter the hotel. 

The hotel is located within walking distance of many attractions, and it is convenient to the Tube. Breakfast at the hotel was nice, as was tea in the afternoon. The American Bar is a great place for a casual dinner. 

We definitely will return here. ",5,2016,07,27
142,we paid to much for such a claustrophobic room,"We were in London for 3 days, as usual in the summer to visit friends and shopping; The hotel is located very well to Green Park, close to everything; room very small, claustrophobic, we had to squeeze between the furniture, the wall and the bed. We felt sick in such a small room.  Clean room, but no carpeting. Large bed, uncomfortable, very soft mattress.
Bathroom large, clean. Staff helpful, nice.
Breakfast very tasty.  It was not possible to have a London beer in the bar, it is ridiculous in middle of London, so we went out to dinner elsewhere.

We paid too much for such a bad room. I would not recommend and will not definitely go back to that hotel.",3,2016,07,27
142,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I spent 10 terrific days at this wonderful hotel, nestled in the heart of St. James on a beautiful private street just off of Green Park.
Our room on the upstairs level of the carriage house overlooking the private brick paved courtyard was spacious , beautifully furnished in old world charm and lovingly maintained by their attentive and well trained hospitality staff.
Morning breakfast either in the open courtyard or in their beautiful dining room was delicious and served perfectly by their traditionally, old world trained waitstaff.
The concierge service could not have been better. Fernando and Peter made us feel as if they were there to personally see to our every want and need.
Everyone and everything about this hotel reflects their total commitment to quality and service.
We can't wait to come back and plan on making The Stafford our home away from home whenever we're in London.",5,2016,07,25
142,Wonderful Staff & Great Location,"The staff at this charming property was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The exceptional service from the concierge and valet staff made our stay wonderful. The hotel itself is beautiful and while the setting is somewhat formal it does not feel at all ""stuffy."" The outside courtyard dining and bar area is particularly lovely. Our room was well appointed and very clean but rather small. I do believe we selected the least expensive option in the main building. Larger rooms are available. The central London location, just off Green Park, was perfect for us. It's about a 7 minute walk through the park to Buckingham Palace, about 2 minutes to a Tube stop and short taxi rides (or reasonable walk) to Westminster, Parliament and even Trafalgar Square. If you go to The Stafford, be sure to have a tour of the wine cellar - it was one of the highlights of our trip - ask for Gregory, he is a delight and a wealth of knowledge. Concierge Fernando was extremely helpful to me with pre-trip sightseeing planning and dining arrangements as well as during our stay. We did not have an unlimited budget for this trip and The Stafford was not the most budget-friendly option but well worth it. The property itself is full of history, has the feel of old London and the staff is wonderful. I look forward to a return visit.",5,2016,07,21
142,Elegant but Comfortable,"The service at The Stafford is very professional, accommodating, personal and friendly.  The hotel is elegant yet not pretentious and you feel at home.  It is like being a guest in a country house.  Our room (a suite in the main house)  was extremely comfortable and well maintained.  We have stayed here several times and love the location in traditional London.  It is close to all the hubbub but sits in a quiet refined area.  We especially liked the easy ""hidden"" access to Green Park through the passageway across from the hotel.
I want to compliment Michael (I think that was his name), the duty manager when we checked in on March 22.  My electric converter did not work and he responded quickly to our dilemma by unearthing a 220 to 110 converter from somewhere and bringing it to our room.  This was a huge help to us.
Also when I happened to ask Gregory if the hotel had a brochure outlining its history, his gave us a lot of information on the subject and also took us on a tour of the wine cellar which we didn't even know existed.  It also houses a little museum of WWII artifacts that remained from when the cellar was used as a bomb shelter.  Seeing this was a very special part of our stay.
The concierge Fernando was really helpful in anticipating changed circumstances on one of our prearranged private tours.  He saved us a lot of trouble and money.
Camille at the front desk was very gracious in responding to all requests and our inquires about hotel history.
We also appreciated the prompt and thorough housekeeping service which was much improved over the Kempinski days.
We enjoyed the Manager's Reception and the opportunity to visit with the Manager, Stuart and the Head Concierge, Frank.
Staying at the Stafford is a very delightful experience.",5,2016,07,20
142,A Perfect Stay,"A big thank you and all the staff at The Stafford for the wonderful way you looked after my father, and his friend, during their three day stay earlier this month.  They had a wonderful time celebrating his 85th birthday and said that the service they had received from you all was faultless.  In particular the kind man who took their bags to Berkeley Square for them to get a taxi back to the station on Sunday morning as all the roads were closed due to the demonstration and marathon being run through the West End.  He went above and beyond!

The hotel is perfectly situated in St James's, just a few paces from Green Park and the tube station and a minutes walk from Piccadilly and St James's Park.  There is the original building with the Lyttleton Restaurant and lovely American Bar which leads out on to a cobbled courtyard to the Carriage House and additional rooms in the old converted stables.

The rooms while not huge are extremely comfortable with all the amenities you could possibly need.

Thank you again for making their visit so special!",5,2016,07,20
142,A calm oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city,"The Stafford is just stunning. A real treat whether it be to meet a client for a meeting over lunch in The Lyttelton, cocktails in The American Bar, or an overnight city break with a loved one - you will not be disappointed.

The Stafford is a very special hotel indeed and the location is great - a 5 minute walk to Piccadilly. This is a first class hotel. I have never experienced such fantastic service!",5,2016,07,14
142,Summer in London,"Our room in the main house (Junior suite) was an excellent corner room overlooking the courtyard. My wife and I had our daughter with us and there was plenty of room for three people. 

The staff was very helpful and attentive and I highly recommend the American Bar.

Very quiet street and close to all major attractions.",5,2016,07,13
142,Tiny Room; High Price,"Read very good things about this hotel and was familiar with the area.  However, the room was extremely small and better suited for 1 person even though we booked what we thought was a Queen room for 2 people.  Overall feeling of the hotel was that it is a bit snooty.  The American Bar, however, was great.",3,2016,07,12
142,Exceptional,My first time staying at The Stafford. What a wonderful hotel. The outside seating bar area is very cute and timeless. Elegance throughout the hotel. The room is very tasteful and had a great layout. Excellent bed. Fabulous location. Quiet.,5,2016,07,12
142,Coming Home in London,"The Stafford has institutionalized a culture of excellence that has few parallels. It has been my hotel for 20 years and while ownership has changed several times, the quality of the welcome has remained constant, and superb. Each time I arrive, the receptionist says, ""Welcome home,"" and each time the greeting feels authentic and I feel I have returned to casual perfection.",5,2016,07,12
142,not happy,not happy with condition of changing / cancelling . refunding of the hotel. so tough and never helpfull. They try to force the guests to stay at hotel if they made a mistake with booking in the hotel! I never faced such an issue in previous hotels ! The other hotels been so helpful to cancel the booking when the guest faced issue ! But you were not !,3,2016,07,12
142,"Very nice location and building, but I had problems with noise and internet","I was in London for a business trip, and chose this hotel because of a good location and 50% discount (but still quite expensive). The staff are very polite and the hotel building is very nice, but I had problems with noise; I could hear the guests walking in the room above me as well as the noises from the nearby alley. Further, the standard internet kept cutting off and didn't work properly. Having so many other good options in London nowadays, I probably wouldn't stay here again, but the place is very nice for an after-work beer, for example, as long as you do not need to sleep in the rooms.",4,2016,07,12
142,Excellent experience ,"Ideal location, traditional decor and impeccable service from all staff made this a perfect and thoroughly memorable occasion. Our room was in main hotel building and was clean and bright with very comfortable bed. Minimum external noise through night so awoke refreshed and ready to see the nearby sights. ",5,2016,07,11
142,Wonderful stay at the Stafford,"My husband and I planned our honeymoon trip to London, staying at the Stafford for twelve nights.  We chose a carriage room as they looked spacious and liked the original details of wood beams, fireplace, etc.  It was a bonus that it was so easy to access via Bluebell Alley, without having to walk through the hotel.  Enjoyed a few meals at the American Bar.  The staff was so courteous and helpful, the room kept immaculately clean, and the decorations for the Queen's birthday were quite festive.  The Stafford was everything we could have hoped for and more.  Location was perfect with Green Park underground station just a few minutes walk.  We were sorry to leave and very much look forward to a return visit.  Cheerio!",5,2016,07,08
142,Wonderful stay in St. James,"This was our first stay at The Stafford, and we would go back tomorrow! The advance concierge did a fantastic job of taking care of everything I asked - dinner reservations, show tickets, Wimbledon tickets, car to/from Heathrow, etc. The hotel is a treasure and so well located. The Stafford London is my new favorite!",5,2016,07,08
142,Never Again,"I booked this hotel and the carriage room because the pictures on the Internet looked wonderful and its location. Well the only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the location is good.  But there are many better hotels in the same area.  We checked in late at night and were lead outside and could not tell that a resturant was right outside our door.  Nor were we warned or advised about it before hand.  The room was not what what was advertised.  Instead of a a spacious high ceiling, canopied bed and modern bathroom.  We received a small cramped room, with two twin beds pushed together if you tried to sleep together you fell in the crack and just about on the floor.  The bathroom was old, with paint peeling from several areas.  The noise from the damn resturant right outside our door was awful and non stop.  I could hear individual conversations.  Even worse these people would not move to let us out of our room, I had to push my way through.  The same situation when we tried to get into our room people did not want to move. I even had some jerk push his chair and hit my foot when I was trying to get to my awful room.  Saturday morning 8:00 am we were awoken to the staff pressure washing the Courtyard and our door.  Instead of a five star hotel I felt I was in a discount motel.  And we certainly paid a premium price. I hated every minute of it.  Would I recommend or stay there ever again. No never!!!!!!",2,2016,07,04
142,Elegant hotel great location,I had a great stay at the Stafford in London for a week. The staff was wonderful and the rooms are exquisitely clean and nice. It has a great location as its on a very calm street away from the hustle bustle but a pleasant 7 minute walk brings you on piccadilly circus. The only downside was that I could hear some noise of doors opening and closing in the morning which was a little disturbing. They also have an amazing 300 year old wine cellar which is not to be missed and I was lucky to be a part of lunch while watching the Euro cup football match.,5,2016,07,01
142,Elegant hidden gem central to all,"We enjoyed three nights at the Stafford London recently and stayed in one of the carriage house rooms. The room was quite comfortable, the bed and linens luxurious, the bath generous. The room provides easy access by way of a rear entrance through the mews, so it was easy to come and go without walking through the main building. However, there is a patio eating area just outside the room and with hotel deliveries, setting up for service in the morning, and those who want to enjoy an outside table on a nice evening, the noise may be a bit much for some who are early to bed or sleeping in. We enjoyed the American Bar a few times -- what a great place to enjoy a cocktail or two after the theater. We loved the ambiance, and the food and service are excellent as well.  From the time we arrived until we checked out, we felt well cared for. The wifi was not strong in our room, so we reported it and a note was made to have it checked immediately. A pleasant stay all around. Lovely hotel!",5,2016,06,29
142,"Autp-Wake-Up ""Call"" at 7am all days","Chambermaid gave us a wake-up-call all days at 7am, also on sunday. She banged all the doors next to our without any consideration to other sleeping guests. The staff at reception tried the best bootless.",2,2016,06,28
142,Enclave of calm in central London,"Delightful experience in the heart of London between Green Park and Piccadilly. Excursions to the theatre, museums and night life all within a few minutes. We saw Motown with our adult kids as a weekend break.",5,2016,06,28
142,Plesantly Suprised,"I was a little nervous using my Amex points for four days at the Stafford, but upon arrival we were greeted by some of the nicest and accommodating staff. This is a small boutique hotel centrally located in London. Close walk to Buckingham place, Churchills war room, Parliament, Westminster Abby, London Eye and much more. Very close to Harrods and other great shopping. The rooms were extremely clean, bedding and mattress awesome. We had a free breakfast every morning and some great cocktails in the old historic lounge. The wine cellar tour was nice and was used as a bomb shelter in WWII. Definitely would recommend this to any traveler. A sweet Gem tucked away in central London.",5,2016,06,25
142,Amazing stay,"The hotel facilities, staff, and location make this an ideal place to stay.  You must experience the breakfast!  Could not have been better. Our room was a bit small, but the bed was comfortable, internet easy to use, and the American Bar is perfect.",5,2016,06,25
142,A gem of a hotel,Tucked away on a quiet street but in close proximity to where you want to be The Stafford is a gem.  We (a family of 7) stayed here at the suggestion of our travel agent and chose it for its location.  The staff was friendly and so accommodating.  The concierge staff was helpful before and during our trip as were the front door men.  The American Bar is not to be missed! The rooms are lovely!,5,2016,06,23
142,Outstanding service and location,Everything was perfect at this beautiful hotel.  Morning breakfast was included and it was superb!  Concierge service outstanding.  Our suite was quite large with a bathroom an a powder room.  A large bouquet of white roses and a bowl of fresh fruit welcomed us when we arrived.  The bed was very comfortable.,5,2016,06,21
142,Short Stay,I used to stay at the Stafford a lot many years ago.  The hotel has if anything got better.  Truly outstanding and it was a joy to have a cocktail in the expanded American Bar.  Staff are extremely helpful and pleasent.,5,2016,06,21
142,Loved the Stafford!  Great Concierge!,"The Stafford is a lovely hotel in a great location with wonderful, friendly staff who made our stay memorable and fun.  Our only complaint was the rather snobby servers in the American Bar who delivered slow and overpriced fare with an attitude, which was a shame given the great ambiance in the bar.  Otherwise, we give our stay an overall Excellent rating.",5,2016,06,20
142,Delightful Stay,We chose The Stafford for it's excellent reviews and proximity to Buckingham Palace. We wanted to be in London for The Trouping Of the Colours. Not only did we get a chance to see the pageantry but participated in The Stafford's Party for the Flyby. We met quite a few friendly and cordial people at the part and were very happy with the service there provide by the hotel. Altogether it was a wonderful experience especially because it was my wife and my 58th Anniversary.,5,2016,06,20
142,Really Lovely!,"This was a wonderful hotel. We stayed in a beautiful junior suite. It has wonderful English character and charm. They have all the things you need. Bed was so comfortable. Really enjoyed breakfast everyday, room service was good too. They staff where wonderful and went out of their why to help us.  As a person who has travel to London for over 40 yrs, it was fabulously located, easy walk to shopping, restaurants. Only would say that if you stay in the older part of hotel, halls are very narrow with steps in unexpected places, if you have mobility issues make sure to let them know ahead. Overall was perfect place to enjoy London. ",5,2016,06,15
142,Wonderful hotel to stay.,"Spacious room with a large modern bathroom. Staff very friendly and helpful.  St James is a convenient and interesting area of London to stay.  Great breakfast.  The American Bar is well known and enjoyable for a drink.  Afternoon tea in the lounge.  Frank the executive concierge gave us a walk around the area, we heard many fascinating facts as it is one of the older sections of the city, and finished up in Green Park nearby to see the 41 gun salute as it was the opening of Parliament, all the heraldry and spectacle of London was included.",5,2016,06,15
142,Luxury London Hideaway,"The food, service, bar, rooms and overall experience are exceptional. This will become your home away from home in London. Green Park nearly at your doorstep, and a 10-15 minute walk to Picadilly Circus.",5,2016,06,15
142,First class London Hotel,"The Stafford London was a wonderful experience. It is in the St. James Park area, quiet but easy to get to all parts of London.  It is clean, luxurious in its care of guests, with good food and wonderful amenities.",5,2016,06,15
142,The Stafford is a delight!,"On our first trip to London we discovered this small gem of a hotel. It was a delight --lovely, with excellent service and staff. From check-in to check-out our stay was wonderful. We will be back! Thank you for a lovely experience.",5,2016,06,14
142,Nice hotel,"We recently spent five nights at the Stafford and found it to be very enjoyable. It's small and boutique-like in feel. The staff is great. Our room was on the 4th floor, which I believe was recently renovated. The room wasn't terribly large, but the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was nice & bright. There's a magnifying mirror which is always helpful. Breakfast was included in our package & we enjoyed eggs, etc. every morning. The American Bar is a nice spot at the end of the day. We would happily stay there again.",5,2016,06,13
142,fun bar,The bar at the stafford is perfect if the weather is dry and you feel like a cigar outside.Failing that its very cosy inside as well.Tucked away off St James St its also a great location.Not cheap obviously.,4,2016,06,13
142,PERFECT STAY,This Hotel is perfect in every way.  The room was modern and beautifully decorated and the bathroom stunning.  Extremely comfortable bed too of course. The breakfast was delicious with plenty to keep us going until way after lunch!  Having stayed at several 5* hotels in London The Stafford has now become our first choice.  The location just a short walk from St James Park is in an ideal location.  Highly recommend.,5,2016,06,13
142,Best hotel in London,"Having resided as several top hotels in London i have decided that this one stands out as one of the best.
The staff are the most courteous ,efficient and helpful of all the London hotels that I have stayed in .
The room I had was stunning  with great views  over the courtyard couldn't have asked for anything better.
All in all you won't be disappointed if you book to stay here, Thankyou you  for a 
fantastic stay and look forward to seeing you again soon.

142,return,"excelleny accomodations, superlative staff, very good location, food and bar very, very good and comfortable, very secure feeling there, but London is no different than continental Europe,you must be very aware of your surroundings, area, there is a definite edge to the city now",5,2016,06,10
142,Nice and Quaint hotel in the middle of London,"I've spent two nights at the Stafford in April 2016.There are two sections of this hotel, one is the main new building and the other one is the old stable building which house the suites and the gym. I stayed on the 6th fl. of the new building. The rooms are very nice and clean, it has all the amenities of a five star hotel. The room I stayed in is right opposite the stairs so I can hear staff going up and down. And as the hotel is situated in a quiet back street off St. James so don't expect any spectacular view. I especially like the location of this hotel as there's a small walk way across the entrance of the hotel that leads directly to Green Park and Green Park station.",4,2016,06,09
142,Understated elegance in a great location,"Based on recommendations of friends who have stayed there before, we chose the Stafford for a recent short visit to London.  Looking back, we made the right choice and will return.  First, the location could not be better.  The Stafford is close to many of the great tourist spots, as well as restaurants and shopping.  At the same time it is tucked away on a quiet street where the hustle and bustle of London seem to disappear when you turn the corneron St. James's Place.  The room (a Mews suite) was fantastic for me, my wife, and our son.  Comfortable, ample room, and great amenities and service.  The staff went out of their way to make us comfortable.  The food was great and the American Bar is a must visit.  I must specifically compliment the bell staff and concierge for their restaurant recommendations.  They know the city and where to go.  Thank you Stafford.  Looking forward to returning soon.",5,2016,06,08
142,Anniversary Surprise from across the pond,"While I didn't stay at the hotel, my parents did on a recent trip to celebrate they're 40th anniversary. My brothers and I wanted to surprise them, so we contacted the team at the Stafford for help. They went above and beyond to find a fabulous way to make my parents' visit extra special. When my parents arrived, they were surprised with flowers and champagne in their room. The reservations team also helped us arrange a card and well wishes so my parents knew we had been thinking of them. The reservations team also make sure that the stay was as wonderful as possible, making it memorable for their anniversary. As they've told me, my parents were sad to say goodbye. We hope that we can make the Stafford a regular ""home"" for our family and a wonderful place to celebrate life's big moments.",5,2016,06,08
142,What a refreshing change,"We picked the hotel as a last minute option. on arrival the staff was incredibly friendly and seemed to want to welcome you throught the doors......  the experience from start to finish was my 5 year old granddaughters first london trip and she now thinks all hotels will offer her the same amazing experience. ALL the staff was simply amazing and really felt comfortable and relaxing,,, 100% recommended!!!",5,2016,06,07
142,"Mostly great, but.....","This is a lovely hotel in a great part of town. Convenient to tube, etc. My main concern was the bill add-ons - where did the service charge for the room come from? And that newspaper - it's not complimentary. All these unadvertised bill extras",4,2016,06,06
142,"adorable hotel, great location","stayed here two weeks ago and it was perfect. amazing location, beautiful rooms and fun little bar in the back. I was pleasantly surprised with how large the room and bathroom were. The all marble bathroom was a definite plus for me. 
the one thing to note is we paid an additional $100 a night for a roll away bed...a little steep if you ask me but I would still stay here again - and look forward to it!
also, they couldn't find our luggage after we checked out so we were delayed in leaving while they searched. Eventually it was found and I'm sure it was a one-off mistake.",5,2016,06,04
142,"So British, so good!","Ideally located in Central London, the Stafford just might have the best trained staff in the civilized world.
We were graciously welcomed and served for 3 most enjoyable days and nights. Directions, suggestions for transport were routinely offered with expertise. Even at busy times the doormen succeeded in snagging cabs for us.
Thanks to the Stafford's location we were able to easily walk to most of the dining spots where we had reservations. The full complimentary breakfasts offered varied, good food.",5,2016,06,01
142,A Relaxed  Stay in Central London,"London is a very busy City and The Stafford is a quiet, relaxed retreat but situated in the very heart of London.  The hotel has many great features but it is the staff that make the hotel such a relaxed retreat. They are very engaging and attentive and one gets the feeling that they are happy in their work and really ready to go the extra mile to ensure that the guest is happy. The rooms themselves are very comfortable and there are many nice touches. The hotel bar is informal with a quirky touch and some excellent cocktails. I recommend The Spitfire. Certainly a hotel to be recommended for both the busy executives and for those visiting London",5,2016,06,01
142,Not just an hotel - an experience.,"As we made our way from busy Piccadilly street, through the narrow passage ways, towards the Stafford hotel, we felt we were being transported back in time to a different London. The hotel has an elegant old fashioned British style that made us feel like royals. It is relatively small for a 5 star hotel, which makes it more personal.
Our experience started with me accidentally making a non refundable reservation for the wrong date. My fault, but they were kind enough to allow me to change the date. Pleasant surprise. When we arrived, we were upgraded to master suite. Another pleasant surprise.
As the lady was showing us the suite I just couldn't get the smile off my face.
The suite included a bedroom, living room, bathroom with bath, shower, toilet and 2 sinks, and there was an extra toilet room. Complementary water and a nespresso machine.
We ate breakfast at the hotel on 2 days, the buffet and the healthy one. Both were excellent, though a bit pricy. On our 3rd day we walked 2 minutes to Piccadilly st and choose one of the many cafes there for a more affordable breakfast option.
Even though it is centrally located, The hotel is very quite, Being in a back- dead end street. Our room faced the court yard, where there are tables of the American bar. There was only a bit of noise when we wanted to take an afternoon nap. There is No one  there in the evening.
The only fault I can find is that the pluming is a bit old fashioned, the sink drains very slowly and it is sometimes challenging to flush the toilet properly. But that didn't bother us. We truly enjoyed our experience at the Stafford.",5,2016,05,30
142,Everything we hoped for and more! ,"My wife and I stayed at The Stafford for 3 nights.  Our first room was in a carriage house room. It was charming and unique and if you don't mind the noise and a bit of smoke wafting in from time to time, you'll love that room.   When we told the hotel staff that we wanted a quieter room, they immediately found us another room in the main house and moved everything while we were our for dinner and a play.  We didn't have to complain or argue.  They simply accepted our word and moved us.  I don't know about your experience, but that kind of service deserves to be acknowledged.  

There were other delights like when Gregory took the time to show us our new room, regaling us with stories about the hotel and making sure we understood the light switches and how to turn on the night light.  

The beds were comfortable and the decor was charming; the bathroom had a nice sized tub with plenty of hot water; and the food was good.  We had some laundry done while we were here.  When we came back, there was a mystery box on the bed.  We opened it to discover the socks and other things neatly wrapped in tissues and a sign on the closet telling us our other clothes were hung with care.  

With the impeccable service, I can't recommend this hotel enough.  Service like that does come at a cost, but it was worth the price.  

",5,2016,05,29
142,Relaxed elegance,"Situated close to Green Park and Piccadilly - this hotel is well sited to explore the shopping area between Piccadilly and Oxford street (including Bond street). The hotel is also close to the tourist sites of The Mall, Buckingham Palace, Horse guards, St James Park and Palace. Rooms very comfortable but not all have a ""view"". Meals available in the Lyttelton (Silver service) or the more casual environment of the ""American bar"". Meals in the American bar are good but not spectacular. We didn't try the silver service restaurant due to the short stay. Breakfasts varied. Coffee good. Staff excellent and friendly.",5,2016,05,24
142,Great location & service,"Looking for boutique hotel in London, close to Buckingham, Parks & shopping. This is the place. GREAT staff, very quiet with a very subdued old school feeling.  Breakfast is fabulous but also expensive. Overall a great hotel with an ambience of old world & old school",5,2016,05,24
142,Delightful Return to the Stafford Hotel,"This was our third stay at the Stafford Hotel.  The hotel ambiance and staff are truly exceptional.  The staff made us always feel welcome.  They know our names, are warm and welcoming.  The Stafford is not trendy or loud....it is definitely our home in London.  The rooms are quiet, well appointed with lovely amenities.  The rooms have outlets with U.S. compatibility.  I cannot image we could stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2016,05,23
142,Stafford always shines,"With its unbeatable location, amazing and welcoming staff, elegant rooms with the most comfortable beds ever, buzzing bar and top notch restaurant, The Stafford is one of my all time favorite hotels in the world that I can always count of to make stays in London a delight.",5,2016,05,23
142,Best Hotel in London,"Wonderfully, superb service! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a superior hotel experience. We will definitely stay here again in our future travel to London. From the front desk to the house keeping services provided it was amazing!",5,2016,05,23
142,Stay at Stafford,"Perfect in every way.  Hotel, room, staff, service, food and drink are all top shelf.  We'll be back.  Experience is always very proper and typical of old English hospitality.  Almost feel like home and always called by our names.  Very nice.",5,2016,05,22
142,A hidden gem,"Do not pass this hotel by. It is located on a quiet dead end near Spencer House. Convenient walk to the Park and Underground. Beautiful grounds.  Staff bent over backwards to make sure every detail was taken care of. Concierge is knowledgable. Bell Captain and front desk people always there with a smile and a friendly word.  The rooms are adequately sized, with a quaint feel. Cleanliness was impeccable.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,20
142,Hidden gem,"Tucked away in St James with direct access to adjacent park & short walk to picadilly & surrounding shopping area.Loved the American bar & cobbled courtyard . Beautiful rooms & superb staff.
Be sure to eat in the hotel restaurant , our food got better with each course ,wonderful ambience & staff together with an impressive wine list. Be sure to visit , we will be back.",5,2016,05,18
142,Four visits in two months,"I used to stay at The Dorchester but decided to boycott it due to its owner's embrace of extreme Islamic social policies in his home country of Brunei. I then stayed at The Connaught but found the new decor rather off-putting and the bedrooms literally colourless. In both cases, it's a long walk to Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square. The obvious answer was and is The Stafford. It is a two minute hop to Bond Street and Jermyn Street, the Royal Academy and Fortnum and Mason, the Burlington Arcade and all its smaller cousins. 
The hotel itself is wonderfully QUIET, isolated from the din of London traffic. You can actually sleep with the window open! There is a wonderful courtyard to sit in for drinks and even a cigar. The hotel is beautifully maintained with many different room options, all of them attractively decorated. Very good A/C, and relatively quiet. A couple of caveats: the water pressure on the second floor of the Carriage House rooms is weak, and if you need a firm bed, you'd do best to ask because the beds I have sampled in the past two months are surprisingly soft. 
The dining room is lovely with almost Baroque plasterwork and offers a satisfactory breakfast buffet and a great à la carte menu. The staff could not be more helpful and seem to make an effort to be genuinely friendly. 
All in all, a cosy, comfortable island of calm in the heart of St James, with an obviously devoted clientele of returning guests.",4,2016,05,18
142,Fabulous real English hotel,"We stayed four nights at this fabulous hotel situated in the perfect location between St James place and green park. The room was beautifully decorated. Beside the wonderfully comfortable beds, my favorite was the make up area with an upholstered stool, makeup table and mirror.
From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel like this was our London home. The service is excellent from housekeeping to the gym to the restaurant. It was the perfect choice!",5,2016,05,17
142,What a London hotel should be,"Quirky, quaint and very British. Always love coming here. It's not cheap, but it's well worth it for the experience. Love the American bar, it's cocktails and snacks. Great for friend, family or a significant other.",5,2016,05,17
142,The  London experience,Truly the feel of Britain in atmosphere and charm.  The American Bar is so friendly and a wonderful place to stop for a quick bite and a drink after a long flight.  The Carriage House rooms are charming and well appointed.  Staff is superb!,5,2016,05,17
142,Subline Stay at The Stafford London,"My husband and I spent a week at The Stafford London, located in the St. James neighborhood.  The experience was fabulous.  Staff is super attentive and friendly.  Breakfast buffet was great, with a huge selection.  The hotel is very close to St. James Park (we visited every day) and Green Park.  We were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to visit, e.g. The Globe Theater, Parliament, Victoria and Albert Museum.  It was a really wonderful visit.  Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,05,16
142,Elegant calm in the City ,"The Stafford London exudes elegance and charm.  Only one block away from the hectic energy of Piccadilly Road, you are enveloped into a world of devine interiors, quality food, old world charm with sophistication of today, bedding so comfortable you won't want to leave and to top it all off, warm attentive service from a professional and charming team.

Superbly appointed for exploring St James Park, Buckingham Palace, Royal Academy of Art, Churchill War Rooms, Fortnum & Masons and the finest shopping in St James and Mayfair.",5,2016,05,15
142,Staying at the Stafford,"The Stafford is in an excellent and charming location, convenient to Buckingham Palace, St. James's and Piccadilly.  The staff are friendly and helpful beyond belief.  The American Bar is very fun, and breakfast was wonderful. I stayed in 119, which was good because it was on the first floor, and the lift was out of order for a few hours, but the window looks out onto a corner wall, and that made the room dark.  I only stayed 2 nights so I didn't really unpack, but there's plenty of room in the bathroom for toiletries, etc.  Another plus, and American outlet and an adapter.  I really liked the Stafford.",5,2016,05,10
142,Chartwell Journal,Excellent Hotel and Excellent Service - American Bar is a great place to drink and eat. Rooms are very comfortable and well fitted. I will be returning in the near future. Location of Hotel was very good for central London.,5,2016,05,09
142,Solid English experience ,"We were at the hotel in a wonderful Mews Suite. The room was spectacular and huge by any standard and certainly for London. All amenities were great and the services as well. If I had a single complaint it is that the breakfast dining room seemed bent on reminding us of the London of 25 years ago (decent but not great food and never how you ask for it). 

Highly recommended as a great smaller gem property. ",5,2016,05,07
142,Best Hotel in London,This Hotel is just perfect with its unique character and absolutely outstanding service! Food is very good and the staff very very friendly!! If you wanna have a perfect stay in London you have to stay in this hotel!!! Thank you for the perfect stay!!!,5,2016,05,05
142,The feeling of being an important guest in the middle of London,"The Hotel is placed very practical for anyone wanting to be guest in London. For tourists, wining and dining, shopping. And so near to great parks. We had the feeling of staying in a intimate and not to big hotel vith great service.",5,2016,05,03
142,Went that extra mile,"We recently had a great stay at the Stafford for my wife's birthday. The room was amazing and the bed was the comfiest I have ever slept in. The staff were the best and without any prompting provided a very decadent chocolate cake and a bottle of wine to kick start the celebrations. It definitely got me in my wife's good book. It really is a great location, everything is in walking distance and you would hardly know you were in central London, it is so quiet and peaceful. A home from home and 10/10, couldn't ask for more.",5,2016,04,28
142,Traditional values with modern flair ,"Just a brief visit to The Stafford, which is tucked away in a quiet location in the West End of London. No noisy cars and buses outside your window, so calm and relaxed.
Arrival greeted by friendly well presented staff, knowledgeable and the surroundings are traditional with a modern flair. If you want modern minimalist this hotel is not for you, but anyone who likes traditional hotels with a relaxed atmosphere then The Stafford delivers. 
The rooms in these hotels are never huge, this visit was in the old part of the hotel, but the beds are very comfortable and the decor smart and traditional, none of that stark modernist soulless stuff or ostentatious bling here thank you!
Bathroom clean tidy and good size, nice toiletries and towels immaculate, good attention to detail. Usual good size flat screen TV and enough storage space if you were on a trip for longer than one night, so city breaks etc here no problem.
The Stafford is well located for all the major attractions in West London/wider London area, with a brief walk through their impressive courtyard to the busier streets where you can easily access taxi's and buses, likewise a short walk to Green Park station accesses the tube network.
Good spaces by reception and lounge areas for informal meetings, so good for business, likewise if you just want to sit quietly and read a book/newspaper.
There's no parking here from what I could see, however if you're bringing a car to London and need safe/secure parking then that's no problem here, as there's a Vinci Car Park nearby with underground parking 24hr security by Hyde Park. A short cab ride or walk away, I'm sure The Stafford will be pleased to help with this if required.
I didn't eat here so unfortunately I can't comment on the restaurant or food, but I will pop back soon for dinner when I'm in London to write a review on that.
The Stafford offers good value for a quality hotel to stay at in London, well worth considering on your to stay list.
",4,2016,04,26
142,Stafford's Garden Cocktail,"Hendricks gin paired with fresh apple juice and apple sour refreshed with fresh mint and cucumber and an orange twist. OK this was delicious, but the atmosphere, the staff, you can't believe this place. We had the best dinner here. It was quiet, not loud like most London bars. Everyone was very civilized. If the rooms were larger we would stay here, but we took a cab ride here for dinner. Excellent!",5,2016,04,25
142,What a find!,Beautiful traditional hotel with all the modern touches you would expect. Staff are so friendly and accommodating. The sports bar in the evening was a great experience! Very laid back and relaxing. Drinks were expensive but delicious! Will be returning to this lovely gem in the heart of st James! Wonderful location! Thank you,5,2016,04,25
142,Still London's best kepy secret.,"I added on a London visit to a recent European business trip and the decision to book The Stafford was one of the best made.  The location, service and ambiance is unrivalled and the experience is akin to staying in a grand Country house with all London has to offer on the doorstep.  Since 1912 London has seen many hotels open and the supply shows no sign of slowing - none however have the homely residential feel of The Stafford.",5,2016,04,25
142,Perfect!,"This was our first weekend away with our baby and a little apprehensive due to all that goes on with him....feeding, noise etc etc. Well we needn't have worried! The welcome we received from the lovely Mark was just fantastic! The actual hotel is beautiful, our room was spotlessly clean and spacious even with the added bits we requested. However the staff without exception were all superb! I have to say we were blown away with the level of service we received-professional, genuine and warm. Special thanks to Mark, Luca, Ali and the rest of the staff in the restaurant, I'm sorry I cannot remember all their names. Literally nothing was too much trouble and our son Thomas was spoilt for choice with new friends! We were there for the marathon and even our friends who met us after said what a super place it is and loved the food. I cannot think of a better place to stay while in London and will most certainly recommend. We are already planning a possible stay over Christmas with our parents. Thank you and thank you again! You took the stress out of travelling with our son! I just wish more hotels, restaurants etc had the same fantastic standards as yourselves. Senior management you should be very proud of your staff.",5,2016,04,25
142,"Good location, but.......","A superb location in the heart of Mayfair, with most areas within walking distance and 1 min walk from the nearest tube station (Green Park). The hotel is a touch dated and tired, the rooms are quite small, but well appointed with all the necessary amenities, it just needs an update.
",3,2016,04,24
142,An awesome experience!,"This was our first trip to London. This hotel was awesome in every way possible. The employees were very caring, the food was excellent, the rooms were very nice with the most comfortable bed we had slept in ever! Very well situated, as we were at walking distance from Picadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace and many other amenities. We would definitely go back to stay there and we strongly recommended to every one.",5,2016,04,22
142,The Best Hotel in London,"I have been staying at The Stafford in London for more than 20 years. It is, as The Stafford likes to say, ""your home whilst in London."" On our latest visit, my wife & I took our 13 yr old granddaughter on her first trip to London (or anywhere abroad). The Stafford staff made sure that everything was special for her, beginning with their enthusiastic welcome to the hotel. We stayed in a lovely suite in the renovated Mews building. The Concierge staff, led by Frank Laino & Peter Knell, took care of all reservations with great skill. We were welcomed to The American Bar by Ben & Lionel & their superb staff. The dining room staff was also very attentive, and the English  breakfast there is as good as it gets. Happily, Stuart Procter is back as General Manager; and he is ably assisted by his Executive Assistant, Sarah Pendrigh, who paved the way for another grand stay at The Stafford. It is a warm atmosphere made special by the people on the staff, many of whom have been there a very long time . They take great pride in offering friendly, attentive service. No request is too much. I would not want to stay anywhere else. ",5,2016,04,21
142,good location,"Small boutique hotel tucked away just off Green park, 2 minutes from the underground, and easy walk to Piccadilly / Buckingham palace and other local attractions.

The welcome was friendly and efficient, room was clean, of a good size, the only negative i found the duvet quite thick so was hot during the night.

American bar was funky with memorabilia all over the ceiling, good service, with good selection of 'nibbles' with drinks.

Room service breakfast, good quality (although limited cooked breakfast for vegetarians)

Pleasant stay and would consider staying here again",4,2016,04,21
142,Another Stafford Stay!  This Time in the Carriage House!,"We've stayed here a number of times and it always feels special to us.  Great location with a tucked away feeling.  Fine staff and very St. James!
But we had never stayed in the Carriage House--built in 1741.  So this time we reserved there.  Nice sized room.  Very homey.  We feared that it could be noisy since the rooms open to the outside courtyard and bar area but, in fact, it was even quieter than the main hotel.
The plumbing did seem due for an upgrade.  The first day the toilet would not stop running. The next to last day the shower facet  blew a cartridge and the water could not be turned off.  Each time the maintenance man appeared within minutes.  Wearing a suit and tie, incidentally.
During our several stays here, the WiFi has been very slow compared to other hotels. 
But we are very fond of this property and look forward to our next visit.",5,2016,04,20
142,Love this property - don't love the new tower,"Fantastic hotel and the perfect location. I have been staying at this property for 40 years.  Before there were mews out back and before the tower out back.  The mews are lovely and well decorated with lovely outdoor space.  The original hotel is just perfect in every way.  Now we have to look at the new tower space.  You could be anywhere, looks like every hotel room in this category worldwide.  There is nothing special or meaningful of the experience of staying in this new section.  If this were the only part of this hotel I would never go back.  Stay in the main house or the mews and then you will get a feel for what the Stafford should be throughout the property.",4,2016,04,20
142,Regular haunt,"I use the hotel regularly as a meeting place with my colleague who stays here often when he is in London. This really is a wonderfully refined and calm presence just off the beating noisy heart of town. Service is impeccable, the rooms delightful and the decor absolutely top drawer. An outstanding classic central London hotel.",5,2016,04,20
142,Amazing and Unique,"Spectacular ! 
I did not stay the night at the hotel.I attended a dinner in the working wine cellar. 
Food was amazing 
Location breathtaking 
The cellars during WW2 were converted into an air raid shelter, there are still find artifacts left behind from wartime, including gas masks and original news clippings.
I Would recommend this for a special occasion and I would love to go back",5,2016,04,20
142,"Simply Beautiful, perfectly English!","5 Star perfection. A room in the main house, after being instantly charmed by the calm elegance of both the reception and the check in process.

I was walked to the room by the member of the team who completed my check in swiftly. 

The room is classically elegant and welcoming, highly appointed and mostly - THE BED.

I was also highly impressed by the silence of the room. Not a single sound from the corridor or neighbouring rooms. 

Breakfast was simply perfect, and The Stafford is now at the very top of my list of Best Hotel Breakfast ever. The service is truly 5 star, without being stuffy or overly formal. the full cooked breakfast, cooked to order, was beautifully presented. Coffee-press refreshed regularly, and the dining table spread with continental options in the middle of the room really makes you feel that you are dining in a St James home. 

I loved it.",5,2016,04,19
142,Disappointed,"Well, not entirely disappointed. The restaurant has great service and food and the American Bar is excellent too. What disappointed us was the room standard in a Five Star hotel. Among the irritating items was the shower cabin which was so small that it was ridiculous to have one in the first place. The was a bathtub though but who uses them nowadays? Also the room and its equipment as such could do with an ""upgrade"". Our friends got a room so small they had to change and that is just inconvenient and unnecessary (to a room not much bigger by the way). 
There are quite a number of good hotels in the area, with four or five stars which are substantially better. 
Should also mention that doormen and reception staff were all very helpful but I will still select a different hotel next time in London. ",3,2016,04,17

142,Beautiful Boutique!,We just love this hotel! From it's 'tucked away' location in the heart of London you feel like someone special staying there. My husband and I have stayed overnight twice now and The Stafford is definitely on the top of our list. Our suite was just lovely and the breakfast was superb! The decor is top class elegance and the staff were always friendly and helpful. The American bar is a fabulous curiosity you just have to explore as well. We'll be staying again!,5,2016,04,15
142,Breakfast at the American Bar - I'll do it again!,"I've been at the American bar for a breakfast with my family and it was such a good way to start the day for all of us. I liked the fact that they have various options, for healthy and sweet tooth, and the smoothies are very good as well. 
The waiter was very attentive and helpful and the atmosphere in the bar lovely and peaceful. A nice and cosy place.

142,Lovey Stay,My husband and I spent a lovely night on Sunday at this little hidden gem. We had a beautiful junior suite and very much enjoyed our tour of their incredible wine cellars. We enjoyed being tourists for a day with the hotels close proximity to Hyde Park. After a good nights sleep and a delicious breakfast in our room we were ready to take on the day ahead. Thank you to the team for making our stay very special. ,5,2016,04,13
142,Our London Home!,"A very quiet, friendly 'five' star hotel tucked away in but still in walking distance to Green Park, St James's Park, Buckinham Palace, Fortnum & Mason etc. Stayed here a number of times now and always had excellent service from the moment the doorman opens the taxi on arrival until he closes it on departure.",5,2016,04,11
142,Best secret london,"Stafford The American Bar is the hidden Jem in London Mayfair Best fish and chips in London west End , best ambiance and Staff you are likely to enjoy. The Hotel restaurant is also a treat and should not be missed. Seek out the cellar and find a secret that is not advertised or mentioned . Should not really add to trip advisor as would like it to remain best secret in Mayfair.",5,2016,04,10
142,The Stafford - a home away from home,"Their slogan is quite accurate - your home away from home - that is exactly what it feels like! Very well situated, close to the subway and buses and very close to Green Park. A very nice hotel with warm professional service. The room was ok, a little on the small side, with a nice comfortable bed and so quiet you could hardly believe you were in the middle of a big bustling city.",5,2016,04,09

142,American bar is a must if in this part of town!,"Visited this bar many times over the years and it never fails to reliever in service, style or quality. An oasis in the centre of a busy part of town but the staff make you feel relaxed and very much looked after. Even on a showery slightly cold day able to sit outside as staff lite warmers and catered to your every need. Prices are high (ish) for London but well worth it! Would highly recommend! ",5,2016,04,07
142,Amazing throughout the decades,"My first experience with the Stafford hotel was in 1964 as a young teenager on a trip with my parents and sister.  Booked into the Stafford by Thomas Cook Travel Agency, it immediately became our favorite hotel of the whole trip.  The memory of the hospitality, comfortable and elegant rooms has lingered in my family's good memories all these years. And, oh, my goodness!  Heated towel bars--something we had never heard of at that time. My parents, now in their 90's, and sister, were thrilled when they heard my husband and I would stay there once again in late March 2016.  

Our stay last month was everything I remembered.  With a warm and friendly welcome, a wonderful room, and elegant surroundings, I felt like nothing less than royalty. We were so well taken care of!  I will long remember the entire on-duty concierge staff waving goodbye to us from the front door as we departed for home.  Yes, the heated towel bars are still there, and yes, it is still ""home"" in London.",5,2016,04,05
142,The best place for a cigar in London....and a glass of perfect wine.,"My London tradition is to smoke a great cigar at Harrods back patio. Until this trip when a friend told me about the Stafford. Tucked on a tiny street, this place is magical and has a back patio off the bar. My friends were right, it was the perfect place to relax and get away. 

The hotel itself is a gem and we want to stay there next trip. Close the best shops and great restaurants, it has it all. 

But, for now I will remember the best afternoon I've ever had in their back patio smoking a fantastic cigar. OK, and enjoying a bottle of wine from their extensive list. 

Bravo Stafford!!!",5,2016,04,04

142,Stafford is Home,"if you have ever enjoyed a big city hotel so much that you call it ""home away from home"" then you just stayed at the Stafford, St. James in London. The level of service is so friendly and genuine you cannot help but feel this place is Yours. The Stafford is just the right size, rooms are smartly elegant, restaurant of the highest quality(with a wine cellar to match) and the American Bar lives up to its name and profession.  I have walked through several other hotels in the area and have walked straight out and back to The Stafford.  This is my home in London.",5,2016,04,02
142,Lovely hotel in a quiet corner,"TheStafford never disappoints.  Quiet rooms, nice beds, and friendly staff.  The American Bar is a fun place to kick back and relax with some snacks  and bespoke  drinks. It's a short walk to Piccadilly.  Also right next to the Green Park Station.",5,2016,03,29
142,New Year's Eve stopover,"Great welcome... and a 1/2 bottle of Laurent Perrier to boot.

Room service was awesome and great value.

Rooms are luxurious but verging on the slightly smaller size for two people.

Bathroom needs updating but the experience was extremely relaxing nevertheless.

Although we had booked breakfast for two the next morning (£50), we had a 20 minute wait in the foyer before a table could be provided - the only downside in the whole experience.",4,2016,03,26
142,Visited our daughter studying in London and 25th wedding anniversary trip,"Superb. Quaint, memorable, fabulous location,... Just the place when you haven't been to London in 30 years. The concierge and staff were outstanding and accommodating but not overbearing. Very traditional. We were there 6 days and could have stayed longer!",5,2016,03,26
142,Luxury and Style,"This hotel is not a bargain by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are able to splurge, this is the place to be. Ideally located near St. James park easy walking distance to Westminster, this is the kind of place that checks you in at a desk with a personal greeting from the manager. The rooms are beautifully appointed, with all the amenities.",5,2016,03,25
142,Wine cellar ,"A trip or event to the wine cellar venue at the Stafford is a wonderful experience. It is full of history and poise, a great venue to host events. It is large and spacious with great acoustics.

I particularly enjoyed the quiet and opulent style of the hotel and the hotel staff were faultless.",4,2016,03,23
142,The Stafford Endures,"The Stafford is both professional and efficient while also warm and friendly. I've been guest many times over many years during which the hotel survived many ownership changes, yet the the standards of the staff alway have remained high.",5,2016,03,17

142,Relaxing break,"What a fanatic weekend break, from the moment we arrived, we enjoyed a five start service.   A welcome smile at reception, help with our luggage to our rooms and the most comfortable bed we have slept in .  A full and hearty breakfast was just what we needed to set us up for the day.  Perfectly located for a weekend of sightseeing and shopping .

We all really look forward to returning soon.",5,2016,03,15
142,Great Stay,Very Comfortable and friendly.  Centrally located in the heart of London.  Food is good but expensive.  Staff if very attentive and helpful.  Internet connection was good.  Overall experience was very good,5,2016,03,14
142,A nice surprise in the middle of London,"It was a very nice experience to stay at the Stafford. Atmosphere is very british, location is excellent in the middle of London, close to the commercial center. Finally, staff is extremely nice! I will stay again!!!",5,2016,03,14
142,Business trip,This is a great hotel in a wonderful location. I stayed for one night and the service was excellent. The staff couldn't do enough and in particular Andrew Thorp was a great help. The rooms were really comfortable and breakfast was great. Will certainly be staying here again.,5,2016,03,12
142,Wonderful Visits,"I have actually stayed here twice, once in the Mews and once in the main hotel. Both offered cozy, comfortable rooms with modern amenities. The American Bar is a unique setting for a drink or casual meal while the main restaurant offers delicious traditional food. Gregory H. is the charming concierge who recently spent some precious time giving me a tour of the amazing wine cellar and briefing me on the history of the hotel and its surroundings. He was wonderful to pay such attention to me. The hotel is steps from St James park as well as great restaurants and shopping. ",5,2016,03,11
142,"Charming, Cozy and Central - the 3 Cs","One of the best boutique hotels in town. I love the overall ambience. You feel u like in an old palace - It is very classy. Rooms are nice, but bathroom is very small which I didn't like. 

The breakfast is very nice and the staff are very friendly.

Very central as well , 5 minutes walk to Piccadilly Circus. 

If you visit the bar, have a nice Hendricks martini and enjoy. The barman, Lionel, is very friendly and definitely adds to the nice experience.

Highly recommended.

142,Bar visit,"Called in for a drink to meet friends who were staying here.

Great wine list. 
Will definitely return
Friends said their room was delightful.

142,Classic old fashioned hotel,"First stay March 2016.  The Stafford is a historic hotel in St. James's.  It comes with all the things that typically accompany that description - good service and a sense of esprit de corps among the employees, tiny rooms, and creaky floors.  There are some nice positives - the room was mostly quiet, the location is a plus for those visiting the Mayfair area, and the room had a Nespresso machine.  And on this visit the price was good.  On the downside, the room was fairly diminutive and decorated in that fuddy duddy historic fashion.  The bathroom wasn't as clean as one would hope.  And the room service selections are extremely limited and mediocre.  Overall it is worth considering if the price is right and / or if one has a taste for classic, historic properties.",3,2016,03,07
142,Outstanding Hospitality,"On Friday February 19 my sister and myself had the good fortune to come across a gentleman by the name of Gregory on a London Street. He instinctively knew we needed directions to an establishment in the area.  He pointed the way and in turn invited us to visit The American Bar at The Stafford Hotel where he worked.  We went to our destination and were poorly treated and left. Taking Gregory up on his invitation, we were greeted at the front door and welcomed by the entire staff. Gregory took us through the beautifully appointed lobby and explained it's history and led us to The American Bar where we had a well needed rest and refreshment.
I cannot say enough about the hospitality of the staff and the beautiful surroundings.  
If you find yourself in London wanting to feel welcome and have an exceptional cocktail this is the place for you. Comfortably upscale but in NO WAY snooty.

Thank you Gregory and the rest of the staff at The Stafford Hotel for making two weary American ladies feel so welcome.

Bernadette Jahns ",5,2016,03,03
142,Another Great Stay,"The Stafford is a home from home: an excellent place to stay for a week in London with a business and leisure agenda. The concierge service is outstanding: Chris and the team were able to get us best same-day tickets for the theatre we wanted most to see, on very short notice and a reasonable price which gave us a memorable and delightful experience. Staff is very friendly and efficient without being intrusive. Everything was great except the size of the room, which was very small but comfortable nevertheless.",5,2016,03,01
142,Relaxing stay at the charming Stafford Hotel,"The Stafford hotel is lovely hotel tucked away from the busy city. It has a really relaxing feel about it and we  had an extremely comfortable stay. All of the staff were very friendly and the rooms furnished to a high quality with very comfortable beds. The American bar is unpretentious and cosy and you could easily stay in there all evening. The bar food was excellent and had the novelty presentation of a lap tray! Breakfast was very good too and a decent size, the eggs Royal was substantial and much better in value than at other 5 star hotels. There is a lovely outdoor courtyard area which would be nice for a drink in the summer. The hotel is just around the corner from Green Park for a lovely morning walk. Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2016,03,01
142,Timeless Classic - Impeccable Service,"This hotel, tucked away close to St James's Palace, provides a well-hidden address and ideal venue for a drink with friends, meal or celebration.  You are made to feel welcome at the outset with a warm welcome from the doorman, expectant staff ready to assist and a delightful interior rather like that of a gentleman's club.  We enjoyed a pre-meal drink at the American Bar which in itself is a charming setting complete with club ties, signed photographs, framed letters from members of the Royal Household and baseball caps suspended from the ceiling.

We were able to study the menu for the Lyttelton restaurant over drinks and were then ushered into the dining room for a wonderful meal.  The staff were helpful but not overbearing with our Italian waiter, Luca, and his colleagues only too happy to help make our dining experience exceptional.

After our meal we were invited to visit the cellar which has much history attached to it and includes an area for private dining, illuminated recesses stocked with wine and an area devoted to WW2 memorabilia as the cellar was used as an air raid shelter.

This is one of many visits to this establishment and we always feel valued and are never disappointed.  We will certainly be back.",5,2016,02,29
142,Meal with friends,"Last week I dined at the restaurant at the Stafford in London for the second time; thinking that I might be disappointed on a return visit, I was not, happily this wonderful gem hidden behind the Ritz continues to delight and deliver.  The master of a chef came out to greet us and wish us a pleasant meal and the staff were attentive and charming as ever.  They are making improvements to the kitchen so the menu was limited in choice but no worries the choices given were plentiful and diverse.  Another wonderful evening in a most charming environment with wonderful staff.",5,2016,02,27
142,Stafford Hotel,"I've stayed at the Stafford many times over the last twenty-plus years, most recently in January 2016, and it is my favorite London hotel.  It is centrally located, a historic building, and a very helpful staff.  One of the best things is that it is next to beautiful Green Park which is very nice, especially for the kids to play and roam around.One of my favorite things is the cozy tea room. I came in after a long walk on a cold and blustery day.  I was seated next to the fire and they brought me tea, finger sandwiches and warm scones - I was in heaven.",5,2016,02,25
142,Perfect London experience,This was one of many stays for me at the Stafford.  The hotel is extremely well appointed and the rooms very comfortable.  The staff is superb and the hotel amenities top shelf.  I find the location ideal.  It is away from the bustle of central London but perfectly located for access to all sites.,5,2016,02,25
142,The Stafford Hotel,"Staying at The Stafford was an absolute joy. A short romantic stop over in London was just what we wanted and staying at The Stafford was perfect. Met personally by the General Manager, Stuart and his team could not have made us more welcome.",5,2016,02,23

142,Our London Home,"We have just returned home after a wonderful half term break at The Stafford London. From the moment we arrived, we felt like the most important family in London, and were looked after at every moment by the delightful staff.

We had adjoining Mews Junior Suites, which were beautiful, with tons of space for a family of 5.  Our sons loved the kids bath robes and slippers they'd been provided with! 

Following a brief description of what we would need (family friendly most importantly) a dinner reservation was sorted by the Concierge staff at a lovely Italian 5 minutes from the hotel, breakfast the following the morning in the American bar was a great start to the day.

I cannot recommend this hotel and it's staff any more highly.",5,2016,02,18
142,Sumptuous,"Such a lovely oasis in busy London... great hospitality, martinis, and very comfortable beds! I've stayed several times. This trip, I especially enjoyed the traditional English Breakfast served in bento boxes at The American Bar. The staff at The Stafford make you feel very spoiled.",5,2016,02,17
142,Great hotel!,"Great location; quiet and safe area, beautiful big and clean rooms; very good service; helpful, kind and polite staff.   Bar is nice and different!   Easy to get early check in, just need to contact hotel before arrival.",5,2016,02,15
142,Afternoon tea for two,"Delicious, intimate champagne afternoon tea for two, sat beside a roaring fire. Perfect afternoon after a busy morning of sightseeing. Close enough to Sights of Buckingham palace, fortnum & mason, yet set off the tourist trail and in touching distance of Green Park.",5,2016,02,14
142,The uniqueness of a boutique hotel:   The Stafford,"For any traveler, there are hotels, and then there are hotels.  We are all familiar with the big houses with the legendary names, like Palmer House, Waldorf Astoria, Ritz, Ciragan Palace.  These are usually opulent, luxurious and expensive.

Boutique hotels, such as the Raphael in Rome and the Londra Palace in Venice,  also provide extraordinary comfort at an extraordinary price.  The Stafford in London can be added to the short list.  What is the attraction?

First of all, privacy.  The Stafford is small and easy to miss if you are not familiar with the hotel.  The main entrance is located near a dead end, limiting the amount of incidental pedestrian and vehicular traffic.  There are no neon signs announcing the hotel.  The back entrance is similarly understated.  

Second, location.  It is right in the heart of central London, with easy access to the major attractions and the Underground.

Third, the staff.  Without exception, the staff has been trained to convey the perfect combination of respect, attention and cordiality that makes guests feel welcome.

Fourth, the rooms.  All the appointments in the rooms were of the highest quality.  The rooms are smaller than in the USA, but are immaculately clean and comfortable.  The bathrooms were luxurious.  Like most of Europe, they have yet to discover the usefulness of a shower curtain; bathtubs are narrower and crowded with plumbing.

Fifth, the restaurant.  The Lyttleton, as they call it, is a small, cozy, ""white tablecloth"" restaurant.  The menu is limited, but most guests will find several items of interest.  The service was gracious and the food stupendous.  Luca, the maître d' and host, is very polished and gracious, just like the reception staff.  We liked our dinner so much that we returned the next day for another superb meal.  (Four course dinner for two, with wine, tax and gratuity, about $300.)  If you are an adventurous diner, just ask for the chef's choice.  Breakfast was included with our room, elegantly served, with hot entrees cooked to order and a very attractive spread of fresh fruits, cereals, pastries, tomatoes, cheeses and beans.  

Sixth, we were invited to tour the wine cellar, which was used as a bomb shelter during the London blitz.  We saw priceless bottles of vintage Bordeaux, and quite a few Burgundies.  A large room in the cellar may be used to host a small private tasting.

We noticed a number of ""access-limited"" rooms off the lobby and the restaurant where, I imagine, very private luncheons or dinners can be arranged.  The hotel bar appears comfortable and inviting. The Stafford does not have a parking ramp or a swimming pool. Most guests do not drive to the Stafford, but are driven to the Stafford.

Privacy, location, luxury, comfort, calm and superior gastronomy and enology add up to a winning combination.  London has always been an expensive city, and so is the Stafford.  If you appreciate what you get, you will be very satisfied.",5,2016,02,13
142,Many reasons why I am a long standing guest at The Stafford Hotel,"I have been a regular and frequent guest at The Stafford Hotel for the last 6 years, there is a very good reason why!

The hotel is in a great location in St James in the west end and is a boutique hotel maintained to the very highest standard with lots of atmosphere.

It is very easy to get to any of the main London attractions from there.

From the moment one arrives to finally departing all the team at The Stafford Hotel are professional, friendly and keen to help.

The American bar is a great place to have a drink with a good wine and cocktail list, plenty of choice of other drinks with lots of memorabilia on the walls, a great menu, friendly and efficient service with again a great atmosphere.

The restaurant is also worth a visit with a good menu and wine list, as is the tea and coffee room.

The rooms are spacious, well appointed, very comfortable and well maintained.

If you are visiting London and wish to enjoy one of London's best hotels this is the place I recommend you stay at, I stay at no where else!",5,2016,02,13
142,Pure Englishness with a touch of the US,"Not that is a bad thing. 

It's a splendid place in the best area of town in my view, St.James' in where the heart grows fond of London.

This reassuringly expensive place is run very well and those seeking just enough Englishness without it being a 'Brit Disney' ride this works. But do be prepared to pay high end for small rooms though but that's a given in central London red brick hotels.

The American bar was fun and well served, excellent check-in staff and room service too, great breakfast if a little slow (we are workers eating too please note). The only downer was a haughty afternoon tea manager who should remember we are paying guests, and paying handsomely.",4,2016,02,09
142,Chris Holmes 2.2.16,"Hidden gem in Pall Mall Great find. A small hotel but up there with the very best! The staff are welcoming and friendly. Looking out to help you all the time. My room.

142,Excellent place for family in London ,"We stayed at this place in summer of 2015. The hotel is located in St James neighborhood. Close to Buckingham palace and all the nice attractions. Very quiet and serene place yet close to all of the action. 

Service was excellent. Will go back any time.  ",5,2016,02,07
142,Excellent Hotel,"Totally enjoyable stay.  Very Central for London, eating, sightseeing, would highly recommend.

142,Coming home,"I have been staying at the Stafford London many times for the last 35 years or so and have always felt at home. The staff gives me the feeling to be personally welcome and taken care of, some of them having been around for years. IT is a safe place with respect to quality, elegance and convenience.",5,2016,01,31
142,Weekend away,"Weekend of show and shopping, decided to try the Stafford hotel. We were not disappointed. Had a double room which was of medium size and very comfortable bed. All usual room facilities worked and great great coffee maker . 
Evening drinks were a bit cramped in the bar , which was full of people , mainly Americans  
Breakfast was really good 

 We shall return",5,2016,01,28
142,"West End glamour, comfort and style","I work in the West End so knew and loved the American Bar of the hotel, but arranged for my family to stay to see a show I was in and was blown away by the quality of the Stafford's rooms, the attention to detail and comfort and by staff who couldn't have been more helpful and charming - it combines old London ambience (open fires, historic building, even some former mews 'cottages' with 5 star amenities and finish all slap bang in the middle of St James's but tucked away from the traffic. Truly a hidden gem. My very well travelled (spoiled?!) children rated it one of the finest hotels in the world; which may have been the breakfast waffles!",5,2016,01,28
142,The Best Small Hotel in London,"From the moment you arrive at the Stafford you are treated as a most-welcomed guest.  The staff is friendly but always professional, with the best concierge team (Brett, Peter and Fernando) in London. Every guest is made to feel valued, The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the location cannot be topped.  I cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2016,01,27
142,"Romantic Rooms, Excellent Service, Central London Location and ""Apartment Like"" Living","The hotel was a historical residence of the Lyttelton & Spencer family going back to the 17th Century. Near the location are residences, office space and embassies; it has a neighborhood feel and is very quiet.  It is a great location near Buckingham Palace and St James Palace, Piccadilly Street shops such as Fortnum & Mason and many restaurants.  For getting around town, a few feet away through the connecting corridor to the park is the Green Park tube stop.  St James Street is just a few steps out the back entrance from the hotel.  The pleasure of this trip started with contacting the excellent staff in helping us plan our trip prior to arrival. Ms. Sarah Pendrigh was particularly helpful with our plans. Upon arrival, Alex greeted us at the front door and Michael & Elizabeth checked us into our room. Daily we were greeted by the staff by our names as we came or went on our travels. It felt very much like living in a home. Alex and Gregory really made us feel at home during our stay. Reading the hotel website you will find they have an extensive wine cellar and Mr. Gino Nardella will be happy to give you a tour.  He is master sommelier with only a few people in the world holding that distinction.  Items from WWII remain at the far end of the cave as it was used during the war during bombardments; many of the papers are from Ohio. If you like wine and history, this will be of interest to you.  The cave location is well known for hosting wine dinners and events. The American Bar ceiling has a particularly colorful display of visitor items such as hats, ties, planes with the wall covered with pictures of various artists. The day we arrived we had a pleasant dinner at the hotel dining room.  Our room was a spacious king size room.  We were made to feel at home by the staff and this added to our experience.  The Stafford is now our London home when we visit.  Nearby - Green, St James and Hyde Parks.  Wolseley Restaurant, Cafe Murano, Paul Bakery, Laduree, Maison duChocolat and Patisserie Valerie. Pubs dot the area and finding a pint is no trouble.  The oldest hat shop in London LockHatters is close by and the Jermyn Street shops as well. Harrods is nearby and so are the theaters of the West End.",5,2016,01,25
142,Very Nice,Tucked away off St James St it feels quiet and private with a beautiful facade. Stayed in the main building and the room was very nice - bathroom was modern and spacious with a separate bath and shower (the shower was excellent). The staff and level of service were excellent! Room was missing the in-room dining menu. The American Bar is a great spot that I highly recommend. Overall a very good hotel with an excellent (and different) bar that is a must visit.,4,2016,01,25
142,A PROPER 5 STAR EXPERIENCE - TOTAL EFFICIENCY,"This fantastic well located hotel has the right balance of privacy and efficiency with the very attentive impressive staff and General Manager Stuart Proctor on hand providing first class service. Having stayed there on numerous occasions socially I returned 3 days for business and utilised the public room facilities for various meetings.
I would highly recommend The Stafford to anyone travelling to London socially or for business, this has got to be one of the hidden gems of the London 5 star hotel scene. Lovely accommodation, brilliant location, amazingly attentive staff, fantastic breakfast and of course the American Bar which is a great meeting place.",5,2016,01,24
142,"An elegant, boutique hotel facing Green Park.","This small hotel has beautiful rooms, personal service and a great English breakfast included in the room fare. It is located near the tube and walking distance to shops and restaurants. The staff make you feel it is your home away from home. It's expensive but worth the splurge. .",5,2016,01,21
142,"Location, location, location","The title says it all. it must be one of the quietest hotels in London - bliss! Small but perfectly formed, the hotel is an excellent place to stay for both business and pleasure. The facilities are as expected from a small boutique ""club"" in Central London with very good cuisine. The bar is a long established watering hole in St. James although it is difficult to get a seat at peak times.",5,2016,01,18
142,excellent London hotel,Stafford is a great hotel and one I would recommend   Friendly staff   Lovely classic rooms and also possible to stay in 2 bedroom suites for families   Breakfast included and service excellent   Great location and easy walk to West End and Trafalgar Sq and Hyde Park   Near PIcadilly Circus,5,2016,01,18
142,So good we came back,"We stayed at The Stafford in March '16 for a one night honeymoon! We were  amazed and delighted with everything and I reviewed it then. well we have just revisited for a pre-Christmas stay. The Stafford adorned in its festive livery was just a perfect Christmas scene. Arriving at the hotel was like being transported back to a London of yesteryear! We shopped lunched and dined in town but constantly popped back to our suite throughout the day. The pull of the ""sanctuary"" of the hotel from the throng of London was constant and as its unbelievable convenient we couldn't resist stopping off every once in a while. we even had pre-dinner drinks outside in the courtyard in mid-December! A totally unexpected but delightful experience. We were remembered by the Staff who were all superb. it really was like coming home in everyway. Thank you everyone at The Stafford, you made our Christmas. We cant wait to come back.",5,2016,01,14
142,Classic Elegance and Superb Service,"We stayed in the Stafford in Spring of 2015.  We moved there after discovering that the hotel we'd initially booked was far more noisy than we'd anticipated.  We were looking for something quiet and comfortable, with the sort of seemingly effortless service that a great hotel has. 

We were not disappointed.  They were warm and welcoming without being chatty and familiar. The were elegant and refined without seeming stuffy.  They amused our 7 year old daughter while making my husband and me still feel like grown-ups.

We've traveled to many places and stayed at lots of great hotels, but this is our favorite and the one by which others are measured.

The location is great, too. It's tucked away and quiet, but within easy walking distance of a park and lots of shops and restaurants.  Couldn't have been better.",5,2016,01,08
142,Home Away From Home,"My family and I stayed at the Stafford, Christmas week. It was my first time in London and we couldn't have selected a more perfect hotel to help make the trip truly memorable. The hotel was festively decorated and our room was spacious and comfortable. The decor was very richly elegant. The staff was professional, kind, courteous and helpful. No one was without a smile and the overall experience truly made us feel as if we had come ""home"". The hotel is conveniently located near Buckingham palace and the Tube (Green Park station). Definitely within walking distance of Piccadilly - about 10 minutes for shopping. Great restaurant / Bar (American Bar) in the lobby for drinks or food. Looking forward to our next stay there!",5,2016,01,07
142,"Nicely located, well appointed, extremely quiet",What a lovely place!  We arrived a bit harried and the staff quickly and expertly put us at ease.  Flawless check-in and service for 3 days to the point where we hated to leave!  It looks like we may be back in February or March!  Cannot say enough about The Stafford.,5,2016,01,07
142,A Christmas Secret,"What a fabulous way to spend Christmas Day - The Stafford Hotel in London was perfect!! The beautiful suites we were allocated for our family were unbelievably luxurious, Christmas lunch was delicious, the staff were wonderfully attentive, and the excellent GM introducing the Queens Speech was a lovely touch. 
The special atmosphere was one that we will always remember, it was a perfect day for our family of four - The Stafford is hidden away in the centre of St James' and the surroundings and central location speak for themselves. 
I would wholeheartedly recommend The Stafford if you are after a typically English elegant, comfortable and welcoming break - top notch, we'll definitely be back!

142,Flawless hospitality,"Is this place the best kept secret in London? From the phonecall to book a room for a surprise ""big birthday"" stay for my husband, through to the stay itself, right to check out, I can't think of anything but excellent comments for The Stafford. We had stayed before, decades ago, and loved the experience then - a real treat - so I was hoping to revisit that quality - and was not disappointed. Having booked a perfectly nice room, we discovered on arrival that we'd been upgraded. The room allocated was terrific. Not vast, as we were in the oldest part of the hotel - our choice - but elegant and perfect - a bed which seemed to be the size of a football pitch, lovely bathroom with plenty of soft, white towels, velvety robes and slippers, glorious Floris toiletries, a Nespresso machine and coffee capsules hidden in a cupboard. The surprise arrival of a complimentary bottle of chilled Lanson champagne with a dish of delicious macarons and a Happy Birthday message from the management completed the picture. They  reserved us a table in the sitting room by the fire for tea and champagne - a lovely relaxing hour or so. Later that evening, after returning from a concert, we settled in the wonderful American Bar and enjoyed some delicious wines, and polished off a delicious and very tender New York strip steak cooked to perfection.  We slept so well - can report that the bed and the pillows (all detailed in the 'room menu') were blissfully comfortable.  The next day, we invited some friends for coffee and all had a fascinating visit round the 380 year old wine cellars. A real treat. Thanks to all at The Stafford for looking after us so well, and making my husband's seventieth birthday very very special.",5,2016,01,04
142,Quiet Elegance,"We stayed here for 2 nights.  It was elegant and quiet.  The neighborhood rolls up the sidewalks at night, the hotel is on a hidden back lane.   We were in 416, a junior suite with a view of the top of the London Eye at night.   The American Bar is a quiet place for a sandwich or a drink.   The restaurant is lovely.   WiFi was free but spotty coverage.   Best part of the stay was a visit to the wine cellar and a surprise, the underground bomb shelter with a lot of WWII memorabilia.  Glad we stayed here once, may be a bit too British uppercrust for us to stay again - just not our style.",4,2016,01,03
142,An exquisite place for drinks,"We visited the Stafford for drinks after a lunch at the nearby Quagkino's. There was 10 of us and we had 3 rounds of drinks. The courtyard where we sat was lovely, quaint, quiet and decorated beautifully with lit Christmas trees. We drank the house bitter which was gorgeous. As we only drank I can only offer my recommendation on the staff which were great (very attentive), the venue (lovely) and the beer (wonderful). I will be visiting with my wife for luncheon as the food look very, very good.",4,2016,01,03
142,Best London small hotel,"The Stafford has reclaimed its former elegance and hospitality! It had a bad time in the 1990's, but is now a very enjoyable small hotel located in the heart of the west end. Highly recommended! It's dining room is quiet and elegant, and the food is good, although not excellent. The front desk is very helpful, and always willing to try to give us a favourite room.  The rooms are small but very attractive and very quiet. It is located right off Piccadilly with Green Park behind it.",5,2016,01,02
142,Elegance and Pampering Defined,"I checked into the Stafford after quite literally running a 10K at midnight, clubbing, packing, catching a 6am flight with the children from Bangalore, India and arriving in London without hotel reservation. My requirements were simple: give me a suite with a separate bedroom, comfortable pillows, and let me sleep. Please. 

The Stafford picked us up in a swank grey merc, whisked us off, had me and the girls checked in in 6 minutes flat. I proceed to collapse into a featherbed heaven for the next several hours. The next morning we enjoyed a lovely breakfast with waffles, proper maple syrup, housemade jams, and deep, dark coffee to cut the sweet. Perfect. The staff was delightful and knew just how to keep my young girls in giggles. They got us sorted for a quick shopping adventure before our flight and sure enough, we found Santa! Our stay at The Stafford was a marvelous Christmas stopover that ended far too soon!!",5,2015,12,31
142,British Elegance and Warmth!,"We just returned from a wonderful week long trip to London where we spent Christmas at the Stafford!  Stay here if you want a 5 star hotel that is steeped in history (steps from the St. James Palace and Buckingham Palace, cigar shop where Kings and Sir Winston Churchill purchased their cigars, etc.) and also very well maintained and elegant.  Our tour guide told us that hotel restaurant is where the Queen Mother would always sneak off to to have a bite when she gave her cook the night off! The morning breakfast was both buffet and made to order...with French pressed coffee of course!  The staff is so wonderful..they all treated us like family and helped us with everything.  The American Bar was awesome!  This is the perfect place to stay if you want a tucked away piece of English paradise!",5,2015,12,29
142,Outstanding Experience,"Probably the finest overall home away from home for Christmas that you could ever find!  The entire staff from the GM to Housekeeping was focused on making the stay outstanding.  The rooms, restaurants and overall hotel exceeded our very high expectations.  My family and I (eight altogether) had an incredible time with no complaints!",5,2015,12,29
142,Well appointed. Well located,"Enjoyed this hotel immensely. The staff was very accommodating and the location of the hotel was convenient for shopping and fine dining. Our room was small, but it was a package deal with AA which usually means not the best room at the hotel, but it was fine for us for a long weekend.",4,2015,12,27
142,Great!,"Have stayed several times over the years and enjoyed the rooms, hospitality, staff, atmosphere. It really does feel like home, and you are made incredibly welcome. The rooms/suites in the mews area are particularly impressive.
Just recently I went with some friends to the American Bar at The Stafford for pre dinner drinks. It has great atmosphere and memorabilia in a classic  clubby bar setting. It can get very busy but a limited number of tables can only be reserved by residents. Good bar snacks available. Service is excellent and started the evening off well. I am told by my wife that there were several celebrities enjoying themselves discretely in the bar, but I wouldn't have recognised them in any circumstances!
Good bar that reflects the ethos of the rest of The Stafford.
Recommended.",5,2015,12,24
142,Fantastic!,"Great hotel, great breakfast, beautiful rooms, lovely staff, and great with kids. We travelled with one baby and one four year old child + my in laws and we were all very pleased with this hotel. Good location too.",5,2015,12,22
142,The very best of hospitality ,"This hotel easily ranks among the top five of the, literally, hundreds of hotels I have stayed in during 50+ years of heavy global travel for business and pleasure. The hotel runs like a well oiled machine, responsive to any need yet not intrusively so, so that there is a peaceful mien so rare in today's world. The suites in the attached building exhibit a level of attention to detail planning that just has to be experienced. From the dual towel heating racks in the large bathroom, to the night light adjacent to the base of the bathroom door, to the oversized shower with rain head, to the most comfortable and luxurious bed and bedding, to the good sized work desk and separate dressing table there is nothing to find fault with. One exception is that the switching plan for room lighting needs a guide and the intensity of the lighting could be higher. The staff are efficient, well trained and have that rare characteristic: they demonstrate a level of care that one is enjoying their hospitality. The hotel is convenient for business and pleasure and the restaurant is so much more than a hotel dining room. For my money, as a boutique hotel, it is the best in London.",5,2015,12,21
142,Fantastic restaurant - great food,Had a very special meal with the wife on Saturday 12th December 2015.  A lovely quiet atmosphere with great service and fantastic food - Highley recommended are the fish dishes.  Will definately go again. 10/10,5,2015,12,18
142,A spectacular boutique hotel. Perfection!,"A hidden jewel with 5 stars hotel standards. Bedding is spectacular: you are cushioned in smooth, feather light duvet with airy pillows. The very best a hotel can offer. I loved the very British interior of impeccable taste with great attention to detail. Service is outstanding and personal. Staff is very dedicated (even though smiling sometimes seems optional). Great location and food is to die for. Excellent!!!",5,2015,12,18
142,Home Away From Home,This was a real treat to stay and explore and relax! A beautifully appointed hotel with attentive service in a desirable location. Great smaller group event space including an historical working cellar. Steven and Rachel were a delight heading the Sales Team!,5,2015,12,17
142,hidden gem,Very close to Green Park and tube this quite hotel is actually in the heart of everything. Easy walk to Picadilly. Quite and unassuming this small hotel is worthy of 5 stars. Food is expensive so best to get the breakfast plan,4,2015,12,17
142,Excellent hotel in a quite corner of St James,"This is an excellent quality hotel that deserve many acolites. It is very well located, but in a quite area of St. James where you are close to the action but far from the noise. I adore the bar with amazing decoration and waiters that read your mind and are ready to serve you without being invasive. My only critics is that they usually bring you little snacks with your drinks. These snacks appear to be extremely cheap, cheap olives, cheap Japanese rice crackers. When you are enjoying an amazing 18 years old scot whisky (they have a great selection) they really spoil everything 
For the rest  is a great place and great service. Just that you expect greater attention to details.",4,2015,12,17
142,Comfort in central London.,Excellent hotel of high standards for special treat in St James area of London. Very good for theatres shopping and galleries. Service and attention to detail perfect. Very good staff doing everything to make your stay a success friendly and helpful too. Hard to say how our experience could have been improved,5,2015,12,14
142,Christmas Treat,"Arrived to a warm welcome, the Hotel was decked out in a truly Christmas atmosphere. Enjoyed a lovely two days. Great location to visit the RA, National Gallery and Fortnum and Mason's is on the doorstep.  Our first visit but we will certainly return to this friendly Hotel.",5,2015,12,14
142,Back at the Stafford!,"Always a pleasure to stay here.  Great location and service. The new management has eliminated the nightly shoe shines, rubber ducks in the bath and the custom Floris lime shampoo (it's just regular Floris now) but these are quibbles.  Always feel special coming to St. James and this fine property.",5,2015,12,12
142,Spot on! ,"Love this place. It's been a while since our last visit but we have been enjoying every bit of our 5 night stay. Form the concierge team, front house staff, housekeeping and restaurant we've been looked after and feel as though all our needs and expectations have been met. A winning team here and it shows. 

The location near Green Park is perfect for getting around especially if your are walkers or using the tube. It's an older established property so don't expect a huge room but do expect service because that's what you'll get. Our Jr. suite was plenty of room complete with a decorated Christmas Tree. 
Dinner and Breakfast in the Lyttelton Restaurant superb! 

One thing to take note on however, the hotels infamous American Bar gets very full with outside local guests so be patient or book a table in advance. But not to worry there's a handful of great established pubs near by to get that locally brewed bitter or larger.

142,"Very good, but not excellent","A classic hotel in need of a refresh. Excellent service and terrific location! The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable!  However, the overall physical condition is disappointing. My room in Main House was small and in need of an update. Corridors were dark and gloomy and also in need of an update. The Mews felt like an alley, not pleasant at all. A few dollars spent on a physical refresh would make a huge difference. My only meals were breakfast. Hard to disappoint with an English breakfast, but  they did. Some would say  breakfast was classic, I say dated. Easy to fix, so please fix!",4,2015,12,10
142,Made me love wallpaper again,"Lovely and quiet location. Close to the delights of the West End. 

Quintessentially British in every way. 

Superb service from staff and especially the concierge chaps. Ask them if you can see the underground cellar space which is used as a private dining area and which has an unexpected museum down there. 

Breakfast buffet has the usual items and hot items can be ordered including porridge and you can specify whether you wish it made with water or milk. Nice touch.

A little pricey, but well worth the splurge.",5,2015,12,09
142,Superb Hotel Experience,"A lovely quiet hotel yet in the centre of everything in London. A perfect gem and a staff that meets all your requirements. Cannot praise it highly enough.  Christmas decorations were tasteful and appropriate.  Service is most efficient, professional and friendly",5,2015,12,09
142,Exceptional London Hotel,"This was the second time my husband and I have stayed at the Stafford Hotel.  It remains the high standard all other hotels should try to achieve. Bedding and room amenities are exceptional. The staff are helpful, warm and sincere.  Our room was lovely.  The dining room and American bar are not to be missed. Wonderful location close to a tube station and within walking distance to several destinations. We will definitely return to the Stafford.",5,2015,12,09
142,Beautiful meal,"A beautiful evening at the wonderful Lyttleton restaurant. A fabulously elegant welcome into the relaxing and sedate restaurant. 
Our meal was beautiful in every sense and the atmosphere added to the experience. Particular mention for the hens eggs starter which was exceptional.",5,2015,12,08
142,Great neighbourhood and good service,"When we checked in the staff kindly show us the rooms in the 2 storey former mews, and then the rooms in main block.  We chose the one in the main block because there were people sitting for afternoon tea outside the mews room door when we tour around.  We preferred to have more privacy.  The rooms are medium size and clean.  Most rooms do not have view.  There is a dining room and not much of amenities.  What is great about this hotel are good service and great location and neighbourhood.  The front desk and bell captain will run out to the main road to call a taxi and ride it back for us.  The hotel is located in a cul-de-sac, quiet upscale neighbourbood but minutes from Green Park and Buckingham Palace.  Hotel is only minutes from the metro station and shopping areas.  We initially took the subway to the theatres, but later we can learnt to many theatres.  We recommend this hotel to those who wants a hotel in a quiet neighbourhood and less than half an hour walk from theatres and restaurants.",4,2015,12,03
142,Fantastic City Bolt hole,"My son and I just stayed here for the first time. The hotel is situated in a quietmews near to Green Park station and a short walk from Picadilly Circus. The street into St James Place is peppered with historical plaques and there are a number of smart cafes in the vicinity. 
Admitadely this is a five star hotel but we got a reasonable room rate and the service was truly top notch without being pretentious. On arrival we were surprised by an upgrade to a junior news suite which was a beautiful retreat from the bustling city. The room featured a Bose sound system, sitting area, extensive range of glossy magazines, coffee machine and really comfortable beds with a range of pillow types made available to choose from prior to our arrival. The bathroom featured underfloor heating and Floris toiletries. Slippers and gowns were available as you would expect.

Nothing was too much trouble - including sourcing a shirt for my son with only 20  minutes to spare before attending a presentation nearby! Lunch in the iconic American bar was a treat and a lovely atmosphere to relax and soak it n.
Staff throughout the hotel  were attentive,  friendly and helpful. This place
 really has got customer service nailed!

142,Great Experience,"First time in London: Me and my wife spend a week in this fabulous hotel. Comfortable room, Great Bar, awesome restaurant and excellent and helpful staff. Very close to a Metro station and to Buckingham Palace...",5,2015,12,02
142,Almost perfect,"The staff are superb and very helpful.
The room was not big but pleasant. The bathroom was never very warm. The radiator did not work in the bathroom at first. The consierge came at once and was superb sorting out the problem. But unfortunately the radiator did not heat up the bathroom as much as I would have liked.
The bed was very comfortable indeed with wonderful pillows.
We were disappointed that there was an optional addition of daily tips for the staff. We had agreed a price and liked to tip the staff as we wanted to and found it embarrassing having to ask for this to be removed.",4,2015,12,01
142,The hotel for a perfect stay in London !,"Excellent location, perfect service, very warm and friendly atmosphere and extremely comfortable room: there is no good excuse to miss this perfect address for a stay in London. Very well located, few 100 meters from Buckingham palace and few steps to Green and St James park but yet in the middle of the living St James/ Mayfair and Piccaddily areas. Underground station few meters away allows to go very quickly anywhere in London (3 lines available). Just perfect !",5,2015,12,01
142,Like a delightful stay in a stately home,"The Stafford did not disappoint on any level for my husband and myself.   We stayed in a Jr. Suite in the newer building, which had a nice, quiet ambiance, was quite close to the American Bar entrance and a quaint side alley exit to the street-which had great taxi pick up!    The room was tremendously comfortable, the mattress perfect, the bathroom gorgeous.  With the  central location and beautiful atmosphere, we will stay there again, for sure.",5,2015,12,01
142,Classic setting,"The Stafford is an old school hotel in the very best sense of the word. Fantastic, attentive staff, quirky nooks, bursting with character and beautiful surroundings. I will definitely be returning. The external courtyard is also a gem and with the ideal geographic setting, the Stafford is a real winner.",5,2015,11,29
142,Pleasant experience at the Stafford,"The Stafford London is a fine hotel. I spent two nights in the hotel, and during that short stay I experienced excellent service. The room was of decent size for a London hotel and had a very comfortable bed. In terms of location, it is tucked in a tiny street away from the noise, but very much in a central location. Approximately 10 min walk from the Regent street. For a short stay in London, those are the things that I am looking for in a hotel, and was very satisfied with the Stafford.",5,2015,11,29
142,Stafford Hotel Surpasses Expectations,"Beautiful gem in London.  Well located to many sights from Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus.  Accommodations are  lovely, quaint, excellent staff, comfortable room and most comfortable bed, everything is immaculate.",5,2015,11,28
142,A Gem in the Heart of London,"I'll not stay anywhere else in London, after experiencing The Stafford London.  It has a very priviledged location in St. James's, with something like a secret passage directly over to Green Park.   Rooms can either be very traditional, or more modern, or even an option of rooms in what was originally the Mews horse stalls  (yes they are as well appointed and comfortable as the other room types)    The iconic American Bar is cozy, especially on a dreary or rainy afternoon, but it also has an inviting outdoor area overlooking the Mews. Watch out for a sighting of a member of the Royal Family whilst there.",5,2015,11,27
142,Recent experience at the Stafford,"Upgraded to a junior suite in the mews annex we had a marvelous time and the sitting area worked specially well for a business meeting.  The bed is superb.  Service staff were excellent.  We have stayed there before in the basic room which is good value for the price, but this was exceptional.",4,2015,11,27
142,The only place to stay in London,"This hotel  providess impeccable standards with professional staff, in an atmosphere which is always friendly and welcoming.  The American Bar is an absolute must, full of atmosphere yet personal service.  All this coupled with a perfect location makes it the only place to stay in London.",5,2015,11,27
142,Truly a home away from home,"I just came back from another stay at the Stafford London, I believe my 5th to 6th visit and, as always, it is a spectacular hotel experience.

The physical:  I've always loved the building and location.  It's a traditional hotel, where the luxury lies in the beautiful building, the layout and elegantly appointed interiors.  London has a ton of luxury hotels to choose from, with lots of big bells and whistles...but this luxury is intrinsic and in the hotel's DNA.  Not ""built"", but naturally there without a plastic facade.  It is the real thing, full of Old World Charm.   I stopped by the classic American Bar for a glass of Single Malt, and felt like I was sitting in a piece of living history.  The breakfast room, equally what one would expect.  And the suite I enjoyed...perfect.  Spacious, comfortable and warm.  It's the only hotel I would want to be if I needed a long term stay.

The experience:  it's hard to capture how welcoming and authentic the staff are.  Once more, it is in their blood.  Headed by Mr. Stuart Proctor (so glad he is back at the helm) and the familiar face of Frank Laino, the Head Concierge, the Stafford team are outstanding at serving guests and making them feel at home.  It's unpretentious, just sincere and from the heart.  From the General Manager to the gentleman who brought my bags to the suite for me, everyone on staff deserves a standing ovation.  It's one thing to have a nice hotel, but this team of professionals makes it home away from home.  Without a doubt, I will be back and cannot wait to finally share it with my wife!",5,2015,11,24
142,Superb Hotel Experience,"We had a junior suite which was lovely. The dinner we ate in the Lyttleton restaurant was exceptional, the soufflé being a particular delight.  The staff were attentive and expert in their respective fields. The American Bar was great, they make a hell of a vodka martini!  I would thoroughly recommend the Stafford Hotel to anybody who wishes to stay in a quieter part of London.",5,2015,11,23
142,A exquisite little gem in the bustle of the west end.,"We ate at the hotel restaurant for my wife's 50th and it was a great experience. The staff were exceptional, knowledgeable and discrete. The Sommelier offered us a trip to the wine cellar which was great (many thanks). The food was perfect and the setting, tranquil and exquisite. 

A big thank you to all the staff for making my Wife's birthday a wonderful experience.",5,2015,11,22
142,very enthusiastic expérience,"Great hotel near Buckingham Palace. Best situation between Picaddilly Circus,Trafalgar. Green park station at 2 min. Staff kindness,nice,professional and attentive.

We with the English charm sought. We will return with pleasure.",5,2015,11,21

142,London hideaway,I spent 4 nights at the Stafford. The pros are a great location tucked away in a cobblestone muse with a great outdoor bar area. Friendly staff although it seems as if a lot of the staff is new and thus the service was spotty. The hotel is very pretty but it is beginning to look a little tired. The breakfasts were very good yet the dinner was average at best but with a great wine list. I would go back but hope to see some improvements by my next visit,4,2015,11,16
142,Wonderful Hotel!!!,"Stayed at the hotel for three days and it was absolutely WONDERFUL!  The room, the service the location.  A very attentive staff and wonderful room to relax, work and sleep great beds and bedding. Thank you for being a wonderful property from the time of check in until check out!",5,2015,11,16
142,Fantastic Find. The Stafford London,"This charming luxury hotel had everything. The food was excellent, and staff and service extremely accommodating . We had a master suite in the Mews and it was beautifully decorated and done to meet every need.  The hotel was quiet and had great character, located in the heart of everything.  Every time we came back to the hotel after being out it was like coming home.   Don't miss the American Bar or Wine Cellar. Just exceptional!!",5,2015,11,11

142,Stafford Hotel London,"We stayed at the Stafford Hotel in London for business, the staff were friendly, efficient and the service was top notch, very personal.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and we would highly recommend the Stafford to anyone going on business or leisure.",5,2015,11,09
142,Fabulous hotel ,"From the minute we were greeted by the concierge, my wife and I knew we were in for a treat. Our stay only got better. Beautiful bedroom with a lovely view over London. Breakfast was cooked to perfection and the fast check out option really saved time. It's well worth staying at this hidden gem.",5,2015,11,08
142,The Best Hotel in London,"An elegant and beautiful hotel! You will be treated like a VIP and enjoy a luxurious ambiance plus the most gracious staff ever.We stayed here twice and would do so again if we return to London. The breakfast buffet is wonderful, The American BAr is elegant, and the rooms perfect.  When my husband had  a medical issue the staff put us in touch with a doctor and they were all very supportive and helpful. They provide for all your needs.",5,2015,11,05
142,Gem in the heart of St James,Extremely comfy beds ensured really good sleep at night. Friendliness and helpfulness of the staff excellent and the breakfast menu is superb. The American Bar is cosy and has a lot of atmosphere. Lovely old Victorian internal decor. Quite expensive but great value for money,5,2015,11,04
142,Not Top Drawer,"Our frequent travels often take us to London, and on a recent journey we decided to try a night at The Stafford, after several friends recommended it.  Our favorite hotels in London are The Lanesborough, The Goring and The Connaught.  We were intrigued with the history of the hotel, and were keen to experience, what we had been told, was one of the great London hotels.  We could not have been more disappointed.  Our Virtuoso agent booked our stay at the hotel.  It was booked for one night as a Classic King with an upgrade upon arrival with breakfast in the morning.  The hotel was definitely not full, but they refused to honor the upgrade that comes with a Virtuoso reservation.  

We arrived at The Stafford after spending a few days in Florence.  After the rather new, and inept, desk clerk checked us in, we went up to our rooms.  We asked the desk personnel to bring our luggage up as soon as they could, as we had a dinner reservations at Wilton’s shortly after we checked in.  The porter took 30 minutes to bring our luggage up one floor.  

The rooms were simply ghastly!  The bathrooms had mold growing in the corners, the shower door was rusty and there was no ventilation at all to speak of.  The physical condition of the room itself was completely filthy.  The wallpaper was ripped and splattered with red spots – which we were sure was dried red wine or blood.  The ceiling in the bay window area overlooking the Mews was so cracked that we feared it might collapse.  The molding around the room was all beaten and cracked, as were the interiors of the closets.  The carpets, for two inches around the room walls were covered in thick gray dust. As I was drying my hair, with the hotel hairdryer, sparks flew out of the outlet and it fried the outlet and the hairdryer.  The mattress on the bed was lumpy, and tilted so that our feet were higher than our heads.

When we stopped at the desk to talk to the manger about the appalling condition of the room, we were told that there was no manager on duty, and no one was authorized to do anything about the state of the room – including the electric outlets shooting flames.

The next morning we went to The Lyttelton for the breakfast that was included in our rate.  We were seated at a nice enough table, and preceded to wait for over 20 minutes before anyone on the staff bothered to approach us.  In the meantime, we watched as four different parties, seated after us, were waited on, brought drinks and coffee and were well attended.  Finally a waiter approached us, and we were allowed to order.  The juice was nice.  The coffees were cold – just like the food.    My sons ordered the waffles and which we had to send back twice because they were literally cold – on the third try we gave up.  As we left The Lyttelton, I asked if it was possible to get a refund on our “free” breakfast.  If we had known what a disaster The Lyttelton would be, we would have stayed with our initial thought of walking up the street to The Wolseley.

We could not wait to get out of The Stafford!!!  But alas – the doorman wasn’t even able to get a taxi properly.  After waiting in the lobby for 50 minutes, the hotel finally did one thing right – and they called their car for us – to take us to The Goring!",1,2015,11,01
142,Where has The Stafford quality service gone?,"This time of visiting, The Stafford was a real let-down. We've eaten and stayed at the Stafford several times before and always raved about the experience. But now it's not in the Kempinsky stable, things have gone downhill. The location and greeting were as good as ever, and the hotel did recognise the special occasion behind our stay with a celebratory portion of cake in the room. The room quality was good and the shower was great, but our bed was an ultra-soft uncomfortable model, out-of-keeping with the overall hotel quality. 

We'd have left with our usual positive vibe BUT for the awful restaurant experience. Breakfast service was so poor, it was almost comical. And seeing fellow guests having the same experience was in a small way reassuring that it was down to the poorly organised staff, not something personal. With delays clearing tables to get guests seated, the table not being laid with the basics, four different mistakes in a simple order, items forgotten, slow service and even, at the most basic level, running out of spoons! And there was little engagement by the generally off-hand European staff.

I'm sad to say, it feels like I've lost contact with a good friend. Would I go back again? I don't think so unless there was a convincing explanation that they'd heard and acted on feedback like this.

I initially posted this review for The Stafford but Tripadvisor mistakenly reallocated to the hotel restaurant site.",3,2015,10,27
142,A WEEK AT THE STAFFORD,"The Stafford is my home away from home where I return again and again.  The service is truly excellent and the word no is non-existent. This time I was travelling with a girlfriend The hotel arranged for two junior suites interconnecting in the Mews which we loved.  We had complimentary breakfast daily, one 3 course dinner in the restaurant, wifi free, and one night complimentary as we stayed more than 4 nights.  Frank Laino and his concierge team are superb - they obtained dinner reservations at very hard to get spots.",5,2015,10,27
142,A hidden beauty,We had a most wonderful 4 days and 3 nights in this hotel which is extremely centrally located just 5 minutes from Picadilly. The staff were very friendly helpful and courteous at all times. The bar is a treat and without a tv and has a nice buzz at all times and the cocktail menu has some beautiful choices. The bedroom was exceptionally well appointed and comfortable and quiet. The ensuite was large and we'll equipped. The best about this hotel was its location and having stayed in the area a number of times before in different hotels we will be back to this one it has everything. ,5,2015,10,27
142,"Great location, nothing special","Wifi is so bad that it is impossible to work consistently while staying at this hotel.  Simply inadequate for business purposes.   Otherwise, decor average with nothing particlalry distasteful, rooms are clean, nothing spectacular.  Staff and service very helpful.  An average experience and cannot go back.",3,2015,10,26
142,The best in so many ways!,"We've stayed at The Stafford London many times over the years. It is simply the best! It's a beautiful, small hotel perfectly located in the center of the city. Many of the associates at The Stafford London are people we have the pleasure of reconnecting with each time we return. They are simply the best!",5,2015,10,24
142,London visit,"Good Hotel in a good location, worth a visit, room very clean and comfortable, staff welcoming and always ensuring you needs are being met, breakfast was very good and lots to choose from, selection of bread was very good.",4,2015,10,22
142,Excellent,"Stayed for one night with my daughter in August. Lovely hotel, very professional but friendly staff. Our room overlooked the courtyard at the back of the hotel .but although it's in a very quiet street, it's also very handy for many locations. We weren't having dinner in the restaurant but we enjoyed a very good gin and tonic sitting outside under cover in the pouring rain
Breakfast was very good with a choice of various cooked items and cold items.
Hope to return one day and would recommend",5,2015,10,21
142,A gem tucked away from londons bustle,A wonderful hotel which is just tucked out of the way> The outside space is fantastic for those of us who enjoy a cigar and a bottle or two of really good red wine or excellent martinis from the American Bar. This hotel is alway a joy to stay at.,5,2015,10,21
142,Elegant,"If you are looking for a taste of English elegance in the heart of London, The Stafford is a perfect fit. Their hotel oozes luxury from the foyer to its beautifully decorated rooms.  Step out into Piccadilly and enjoy London.",4,2015,10,20
142,room size,"Be careful some very small rooms with bathrooms no larger than water closets. Main hotel building very old and quality of room not vey impressive.  Excellent location, very expensive bar charges and food prices.",3,2015,10,19
142,Good quality hotel,"After staying in many hotels in central London - this one actually makes effort. They can all charge whatever they want and still have guests - tourist or business people. The Stafford felt slightly different. Not only was the reception welcoming and presentable, so were the rooms. Well decorated and not dated unlike many other 'modern' hotels. Really enjoyed the stay - the location is above excellent. The only drawback was the soundproofing - I could hear our 'neighbour' snore and mornings are very noisy with slamming bedroom doors.",4,2015,10,16
142,It was Sufficient and Adequate,"The Stafford is located in a quiet dead end street with a ""secret"" entrance to Green Park. As others had described, it is a sanctuary of quiet in the middle of London. The hotel does not have a spa or pool facilities. There are no views whatsoever. We stayed in a Mews Master Suite and I found it wasn't large at all, perhaps 600 square feet? There are better options in London at this price point......",3,2015,10,16
142,City romantic,"Already in the reception area you understand that you have chosen the perfect place for your London stay. Soft lightning, comfortable sofas and easy chairs. A grand father clock. Through glass doors you see the open fires from the lounge where in the afternoon people enjoy their afternoon teas. You almost see Miss Marple in one corner and Hercule Poirot in another. If you continue further you end up in the American Bar. A perfect meeting place for a light lunch or drinks.
My room was in the main house and so English. I am very greatful that there is one remaining hotel in London which has not been converted in to a ""boutique"" or a ""design"" hotel. The location is perfect just around the corner from Jermyn Street and Piccadilly in St James.",5,2015,10,15
142,Great Stay,"We are frequent visitors to the UK and every time we come to London we stay at the Stafford. Great location within walking distance to many sights and shopping. Staff is great and very friendly and useful. Rooms are a nice size, especially for European city standards. Beds are plush and very comfortable and bathrooms are a nice size. Rooms were very clean and looked very classy. The hotel defiantly has a regal feel to it. Afternoon tea is great too and the American Bar is always fun to visit for a drink. Will definitely continue to visit on my trips to London.",5,2015,10,13
142,Old Style Elegance,This hotel is beautifully appointed and in a great location. Quite pricey but great for a special treat. No breakfast included. Rooms are very small but comfortable.. American Bar is a hoot. The hotel is at the end of an alley and the front and lobby are old style elegance. You know this is a special hotel.,4,2015,10,13
142,wonderful warm hotel in London,We loved this intimate hotel in the center of London.  Wonderful room and excellent service.  We felt welcome and very well cared for and would highly recommend it to friends and other visitors.  It made our short stay in London delightful and hassle-free.,5,2015,10,13
142,First Class With a Personality!,"We spent a week enjoying the comforts of The Stafford in late September 2015.

We were able to locate and book their 3 for 2 night stay which for us was a great deal at 6 nights for the price of 4. As far as I am concerned this is most likely one of the best value deals for a first class hotel in very pricey London.

Front office staff responded to our request for an early check in as we were arriving at LHR at 6:30 on a flight from Washington D.C. We arrived at The Stafford at 9:45 and were warmly welcomed and felt at home quickly. We were given coffee and tea with cookies in the restaurant area and we were in our room by 11:00. This was very much appreciative as their normal check in begins at 3.

We were able to unpack, change, refresh and head out on a BIG BUS Tour from their stop #1 at Green Park. It is kind of remarkable that a quick walk out the door, thru thru the shortcut to Green Park and just up the hill and you are minutes away from the Green Park Bus and Tube Station.

We ate 6 breakfasts in the dining room each morning. The staff was friendly and efficient and the food option choices very varied. Although not 100% clear from the menu, you can basically order whatever you want for your main cooked breakfast and supplement from the buffet. It was super convenient to walk a few steps from our room to the elevator and to the dining room. 

Fernando at the concierge office was able to get us great tickets to two plays on short notice.

If we do make in back to London I look forward to another first class stay at The Stafford!",5,2015,10,12
142,A Regal English Hotel,"My sister and I stayed here last year and it was an incredible first foray into lovely London. The suite was fabulous, and honestly the dinner we had in the restaurant was the best meal we ever had. You know the type of meal that turns dinner into a dining experience? That was it.
The room really had that classic English furniture you wished you could decorate your house in. The beds were really comfortable and the service was outstanding. But you know what I think the best part of the stay was? When we got home after a long day of sight-seeing, the Stafford staff takes care of you. You feel like you're being welcomed home and someone invites you to put your feet up, mixes you a drink and makes you feel wonderful for chosing this hotel..",5,2015,10,11
142,Should be 5 stars,"There is a very special feel at the Stafford. We have stayed there for a number of years and would not stay anywhere else in London. However, like any business it must continue to strive to stand still. On this occasion it had gone backwards. Still the Stafford, but not the attention to detail that is vital in a top class establishment. Staff not up to scratch in the breakfast room, check in/out lacked the personal touch, meagre fruit in the room. The rooms are still wonderful, comfy bed, linen and pillows. Bathroom excellent. And the location is perfect, walking distance of Green Park, Piccadilly and St James.",4,2015,10,09
142,Wonderful Hotel,Absolutely love the Stafford. Rooms are very clean and quiet and the staff is very attentive and cheerful!! We will definitely return in the future. The restaurant has very good food and the hotel is in a very clean and quiet area of London.,5,2015,10,06
142,Excellent quiet hotel in the middle of everything,"We had a fantastic stay at The Stafford from start to finish. We had a beautiful quiet junior suite in the newer part of the hotel. It was so quiet you forgot that you were staying in London! The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower was excellent and the room was large for city standards. My only tiny complaint was the master light switch that we managed to hit while someone was in the shower etc... I think we needed a bigger Master sign so we didn't manage to hit it while scrambling for the bedside light.
We had a nice lunch at the bar outside and enjoyed the courtyard. We had drinks in the bar later in our stay and had nice service. The concierge was excellent and recommended great restaurants that fit our personality-- he didn't just shuttle us to the ones he typically would send a guest. 
Overall a great hotel with a nice staff.",5,2015,10,05
142,Charming hotel with great location,"The Stafford is in a great location, within walking distance of many of the cities noted attractions.  The hotel offers a very warm, small hotel, English feel with its decor and the staff.  The hotel is old but in good shape.  The only negatives were limited access to outlets that are 110 volt for American appliances and it took quite a long time for the shower to warm up when taking an early morning shower.",4,2015,10,05
142,Frequent Stayer,My wife and I are frequent stayers at the Stafford.  The location is excellent as is the service.  We have always enjoyed both our rooms and the other facilities of the hotel.  The quick access to Green Park and the Underground are especially valuable.  We consider the Stafford our little piece of London.,5,2015,10,04
142,Wonderful Triip,"Very good facility and staff was excellent  Would return in a heart beat.  Location is great and as mentioned the staff, particularly the Concierge staff was very helpful.  Our room was very nice and in room service very good and quick, Internet excellent.   All in all very fine time.",5,2015,10,02
142,Elegance and location are tops!,"We had rooms 302 and 303. Both were great but 303 a little bigger. Hard to know where to start.........accomodations excellent, staff terrific, food great. Fireplaces to sit around before going into the restaurant. So much is within walking distance. Green Park is only about 75 yards. I would not stay anywhere else.",5,2015,10,01
142,Perfect location for London visits,"Perfectly located, the Stafford is a wonderful English hotel abutting Green Park! We enjoyed the room, the staff, the restaurant, the bar - everything.  We were able to walk to the Underground, to the Hard Rock Cafe, to several wonderful restaurants and to Buckingham Palace. We would stay there again anytime and would recommend to anyone!",5,2015,09,30
142,Lovely,"This hotel is a hidden jewel two minutes walk from Green Park. It's extremely quiet considering it's just around the corner from busy Piccadily.

The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful, and nothing is too much trouble.

The American Bar is lovely for a late night drink or a snack.

One piece if advice though - the standard
bedrooms are tiny and old-fashioned - so make sure you ask them to describe the room you will be getting or you could be disappointed.ask what kind of r

142,Room change,"A lovely hotel in a great location, staff very helpful. On arrival we were shown a stable type room, it had a row of tables outside the window where people could eat, drink and smoke until around 9pm, definitely not for us, we were given another room in a quieter location. Our room was a suit ( extra for the upgrade) which was very nice.
Breakfast was very good however the chairs and tables are not the most comfortable.",5,2015,09,28
142,Comfortable beds...stuffy vibe,"Our party of four couples stayed in the Stafford for four nights. Some things we agreed on: the wonderfully comfortable beds, and the friendliness of the restaurant staff. All our rooms (Classic Queen) were small and the bathrooms were super small. One couple had reserved a larger room with king bed and their reservation was somehow lost. It took the hotel several hours to finally get them a small room. On the positive side, the management treated us all to drinks as we waited. 

Our first night there, we asked for a “casual” restaurant nearby and the Concierge recommended Richoux (Piccadilly). Ugh!! We didn’t ask again!

We ate the breakfast buffet each morning, as it was included in our room price. It wasn’t until we checked-out that we learned that the a la carte items were included in our breakfast package…we were disappointed that we didn’t know that, as the food was delicious. 

Our party left for Stonehenge at 4:30 A.M. one morning. When we told the gentlemen in the restaurant that we wouldn’t be coming for breakfast that morning, he offered to have coffee waiting in the lobby for us at 4:15 A.M. and he did. The maid service was top notch. They came in twice a day to make the room and then to turn down my covers for the night (but where was the chocolate on my pillow?lol) 

I found the lobby to be quite inadequate for a party travelling together. I think it would be nice if they had some comfortable seating to wait for companions. 

Even with the good service and great beds, I wouldn’t stay at the Stafford again for two reasons. First, I didn’t like the location. It seemed to be in a business part of town, a fancy business…for example there is a yacht store around the corner… yacht store!? I guess they have to be somewhere, but I’ve never seen that before. There didn’t seem to be much nightlife that we could find. At 10:00 P.M., the alley way that cuts into Green Park closes and that means that you have to find your way through the side streets. Forget your walking GPS, it can’t find this hotel! Our party did a lot of walking and used the public transportation, neither of which, I believe, is common for the typical guests of this hotel. 

The other thing is that I had an uncomfortable feeling of not fitting in. The hotel gives off a stuffy kind of vibe. When I came downstairs in my jeans and sneakers ready for a day of sightseeing, I felt like a fish out of water. 

In fact, on day 3 my husband, one of our friends and I walked into the hotel and over to the elevator. I had my room card in my hand and pressed the elevator button. Up walked (a doorman, room clerk, concierge?) someone and he asked us if we needed to check-in! It felt like he was checking us out to see if we should be in the hotel. I let it go, but it really bothered me and I wish I had addressed it with him and/or his superior.",4,2015,09,24
142,Perfect London Hotel,"Great location, solicitous and knowledgeable staff, fantastic bar, well-appointed (albeit cozy) room:  what's not to like?  Not for the budget minded, but a great complement to you stay in London.  Americans might want to ask for a sheet under the very warm duvet.",5,2015,09,24
142,Stafford London Home Away from Home,"This hotel has been my repeat home in London since 1995.  It is the best small Hotel in London.  I would never stay anywhere else in London.  The majority of its guests are repeat customers.  I have stayed at the Stafford on Business, Family, and Holiday visits over the years and always been satisfied.  The Conscierge can arrange tickets and pre theater dining at great and ofter hard to get venues.  They are great.",5,2015,09,23
142,Perfect London Hotel,You cannot find a better location and the staff (especially the concierge staff)  will do everything possible to make your stay wonderful.  The American Bar is a fun place for a late night drink and the proximity to Green Park is wonderful for walking or jogging in the morning.  We look forward to returning.,5,2015,09,23
142,Short stay at the Stafford,"Very nice quaint hotel in one of the best locations. Staff was top notch. Our room was bit small, internet off/on and slow in addition to low water pressure for an expensive hotel.  That said, the staff is top notch, the hotel is really nice, the gym is terrific, the ambience excellent and the location cannot be beat.   I'd go back.",4,2015,09,23

142,Great Weekend in London,"The staff at the Stafford hotel were great.  From the moment we pulled up to front door, the staff tried to make their hotel feel like your home in London.  Need a reservation?  They were on it.  Beds were comfortable.  Rooms are clean.  Public rooms have kept the feeling of a manor house in the shadow of St. James Palace.",5,2015,09,18
142,Our home away from home,"The service is superb; the atmosphere elegant and comfortable without being glitzy.  We stay at the Stafford whenever we are in London.  After less than perfect stays at a number of the other better known luxury hotels, we have settled on the Stafford and are never disappointed.  And the location is outstanding...very close to the Green Park Tube station, St James Park, and all major attractions.",5,2015,09,15
142,Weekend Escape,"Perfect for business or pleasure the Stafford can cater for either. First time stayer booked a standard room but was kindly upgraded to a Junior Mews Room over looking the courtyard which could have been in the country side but set in the heart of the west end!  Staff were very friendly, room was clean and stylish (lovely bathroom) and as mentioned the mews and courtyard are very quaint and refreshing for a London Hotel. Also had a tour of the 400 year old wine vaults (wine tasting an option but did not have time) and also private dining area surrounded by history of the 2 world wars. Fantastic nostalgia in the American Bar as well where gifts have been left by patrons over the years. Overall excellent hotel will definitely visit again! Mickey and Dawn",5,2015,09,14
142,Posh West London Sanctuary,"Great rooms, great staff, excellent location, and lovely decor. Highly recommend!  This is a lovely, quiet, beautiful hotel in the middle of everything. Very close to Green Park yet somehow incredibly peaceful and located on a quiet square. The staff was excellent and very helpful, and as it was my birthday they delivered a surprise Happy Birthday brownie to our room, which was a nice touch.  Our room was in the main building (there are 2 other annexes - one a converted horse stables, one a modern new build), and it was very clean, nicely decorated and felt lush. We also loved the American Bar decoration though we didn't drink there, but we did visit the Lyttleton Restaurant for a 3 course dinner, which was DELICIOUS.",5,2015,09,14
142,Recent stay at The Stafford,Was an excellent experience and the Bellman James was exceptionally nice and helpful.  The hotel is small enough that the staff remember your name and when you come back for the day often greet you by first name.  Would definitely stay there again.,5,2015,09,14

142,Fabulous and luxurious stay,I just returned from a 2 night's stay in London.  Hotel and location were amazing.

I felt extremely safe and delightfully pampered,5,2015,09,13
142,Tops for our Family of Four,"We visited London at the end of August and I am so happy that we chose The Stafford.  The rooms were great and the staff was even better.  Extremely helpful and always catering to our needs.  Our kids, 13 & 10, loved it.  They liked the breakfast choices and enjoyed long, hot showers & baths in the tub (super comfy beds too).  Nothing beats clean, happy and well rested little travelers!  It was more expensive than other places but all the little touches and amazing location added up to a perfect visit.  Absolutely worth it.  Also noteworthy & jaw dropping was an early check in.  We took an overnight from NYC arriving 10:30am on a Friday thinking we could leave luggage until check in after 3.  They gave us breakfast and by 11am we were in our rooms - including our luggage.  Mom felt quite pampered by this experience.  To book our stay I called the hotel direct to reserve our rooms.  I got a general impression that the ""discount sites"" can result in unforeseen problems at hotels - not necessarily for the Stafford.  We traveled to other cities thru early Sept and direct booked all hotels and had no surprises.",5,2015,09,09
142,Best place in London,"Very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. Great bar and dinning room.  Rooms were very nice and adequate size. Location was the best Just overall great place to stay!   Highly recommend the Stafford-definitely will return",5,2015,09,09
142,A fabulous hotel,"We booked into The Stafford for our wedding anniversary. We stayed in a luxurious junior suite in the Mews part. 
We had breakfast included in our rate, and that was wonderful too. The lunch menu looked very good and very reasonably priced but unfortunately couldn't fit that in as well after such a delicious large breakfast.
We will definitely be recommending the hotel and will be back soon!",5,2015,09,08
142,4 Delightful Days at the Stafford,"From the moment I walked in the door received excellent service.  Staff were more than helpful, from getting my IPhone connected to the internet, to the concierge helping plan activities and giving directions.  The American Bar and restaurant were exceptionally good both service & quality of food. The location is not only charming but well located for site seeing.",5,2015,09,08
142,Excellent location; Excellent Service,"The Stafford is tucked away near Green Park, giving a sense of privacy and an escape from the hustle and bustle.  It offers easy access to shopping, restaurants and the Underground.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The  rooms are clean and well appointed.  Some of the rooms in the main building are a little tight, but choose the Mews for larger rooms.",4,2015,09,08
142,Amazing staff and location...,"We stayed here over bank holiday in August and I couldn't fault the service and hotel! The staff were unbelievable attentive, even remembered how I like my coffee each morning! The location is fantastic, we walked everywhere and knew we could easily get the tube back to green park if we wanted to be directly back to the hotel....
I would highly recommended this hotel in London... !",5,2015,09,08
142,High-end comfort and attentive staff,"When you lift a real silver tea pot at breakfast and the weight of it nearly cracks your wrist you understand that this is not your run of the mill hotel.  Everything seems to be well-thought out with an eye towards a luxury experience.  My friend and I stayed for business and found the space to be a mix of traditional London chintz with a slight modern bend. On a quiet side street just off of Green Park this hotel is unusual with a layout of room offerings between a variety of buildings (we were in a newer annex) but brought together by attentive staff who care about the customers and are concerned with a pleasant stay. The King bed was very comfortable.  We had a giant bathroom with a separate tub and shower.  We never heard any noise from other guests or the street our windows looked out on.  Would recommend for couples looking for a unique, small luxury hotel.",5,2015,09,07
142,Excellent Experience ,"We spent 2 days here with friends, and all of us were impressed with the wonderful service at this charming hotel.  The staff went out of their way to make certain that our stay was memorable.  We loved the comfy beds, large fluffy towels and lovely amenities. Don't hesitate to reserve a room at the Stafford when you are in London!  It is a first class establishment!",5,2015,09,06
142,Outstanding concierge station,"We had a standard room in the main building that was sufficient, a bit close but wonderful bed and linens.  It was a great value as we were on their 3 for 2 offering.
Food was average but only ate breakfast.  Ideal location to bucking ham palace, green park, picadilly and a short cab ride to theatre district.",4,2015,09,03
142,Beautiful and Cosy,"We stayed overnight to attend a wedding nearby. What a lovely, luxurious hotel. Rooms are wonderfully appointed with everything you need and a lot more besides. Our room and bathroom were a bit on the small side, but this is a hundred year old historic hotel, so allowances have to be made. Staff were impeccable, concierge cheery and helpful. The American Bar is a must visit, very atmospheric, would recommend the Stafford Garden cocktail. Two slight niggles - wifi was very poor and kept dropping out. There was also a queue for breakfast, we had to wait a while for a table, but when it arrived, breakfast was delicious. The Stafford is a marvellous luxury hotel in a great location, highly recommended.",5,2015,08,30
142,Noisy,"We have stayed in one of The Carriage rooms for the last five days. Across from our room is the American Bar. People flock to this bar after work and are quit noisy until well after midnight, There is no chance that you will be able to sleep in this noise. The rest if the stay at The Stafford is a positive experience .",3,2015,08,27
142,Allow yourself to be pampered....,"The Stafford, in St. James' Place, is an island of peace and tranquillity right in the center of London. For English standards, the rooms are quite spacious, well equipped, have plenty of storage space and a superb bathroom (watch out for the shower: it is rather forceful and reminiscent of experiencing a tropical downpour). The beds are extremely comfortable, with ample pillows to select soft or hard.

The service is both attentive and friendly - regardless of what it is you require or when.

The breakfast is English (of course), but a Continental Buffett is also available. Be warned: the English breakfast includes Black Pudding!

Highly recommended and more than a step above the rest.

BTW: Perfectly working WiFi!",5,2015,08,24
142,Birthday weekend,"really nice hotel, beautiful room. great service! really friendly staff.  i had a surprise in the room in the evening.  I had a cake waiting for me in the room saying Happy birthday. It was really nice i felt very special. Breakfast was very good delicious food.",5,2015,08,24
142,Beyond my expectations,"I travel to Europe every year among other places throughout the year. Food and Hotels are very important to me so I try to find something special. The Stafford is one of the cutest hotels I have ever stayed and it is nestled on a little side street perfectly located. From a location standpoint, you can go left and be at high end shopping in a 2 min walk or you can turn right and be at Buckingham Palace within 2 min walking through the park. You can't beat that. But it isn't the location that made this hotel so special it was the people. So helpful, so nice and friendly that you couldn't help but feel at home. The rooms were perfectly clean, very nice size especially for London and very important for me the WIFI worked perfect. I always book through Amex Platinum Travel and because of this the Hotel upgraded me as well which was nice. On multiple occasions they had their driver take me places so I wouldn't need to take a taxi at no charge. Its not large, its quant and its wonderful. Behind the hotel on an adorable cobblestone street sits the Americana restaurant which is part of the hotel. I love that locals come there for drinks or food and blend in perfectly. It seemed even the locals enjoy the stafford. I will be back in London and for sure, I have found a repeat hotel time and time again. This is the perfect place to stay for 1 person or for a whole family. Every aspect was spectacular!",5,2015,08,23
142,Wonderful Stay at the Stafford,"I'd recommend the stafford to anyone visiting London, particularly if you have business in St. James/Whitehall. Incredibly convenient, terrific service, wonderful beds (if the rooms are a bit small). Couldn't have asked for a nicer stay.",5,2015,08,21
142,London Stafford Hotel / Fabulous Stay,"We had a fantastic two night stay at the Stafford hotel. The entire staff ~ from check in, restaurant, bar, concierge to check out were lovely! We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to London! Thank you Stafford!!",5,2015,08,19
142,Family trip to London,The Stafford did an excellent job in making our family trip to London excellent.  The staff gave us suggestions on traveling on the tube and several outside pubs for eating. We have stayed at the Stafford before and this time it was excellent as in the past.  The food in the dining room and in the American bar was excellent.,5,2015,08,19
142,Service is second to none,WOW - What an incredible stay we had at the Stafford London. I am in the service industry and the service we received was absolutely second to none. Location is also superb to all major tourist attractions. You will not be dissappointed in this amazing hotel.,5,2015,08,17
142,Stafford,"Excellent Hotel in a great location.  Service is excellent, everything is clean, very good bar.  Location makes getting around very easy.  Also close proximity to parks for running.  Have stayed there on numerous occasions and plan to stay there again on future trips to London.",5,2015,08,17
142,Outstanding in every way,"We chose this hotel because we like the smaller boutique hotels with attention to service.  The staff are a tremendous team who treated us with a personal touch at all times. The hotel was located within close proximity of Buckingham Palace and we were able to walk to many places on our list to see.  Also, we have to say that the breakfast there is superb,  also, the wonderful concierge staff showed us the wine cellar which was a former bunker room for American officers during WWII.  Fabulous hotel!",5,2015,08,15
142,A haven in the heart of London,"I've stayed at the Stafford four or five times now, and always look forward to returning at the next opportunity. It is large enough to afford one a sense of privacy and small enough to be welcoming. I am always glad to realize my plans require me to be in London again; it's a little bit like coming home.",5,2015,08,15
142,Quaint and cozy.,"The Stafford is quaint and cozy. The rooms are small, so is the bathroom. But everything is well maintained and the staff are great at keeping it clean. 

We were there during one of the worst heat waves that hit in July 2015 and the hotel's air conditioning just couldn't handle it. The room was hot and muggy and everyone had to suffer through it. 

Breakfast buffet is small but serves quality food. The eggs Benedict are a must.

Staff is helpful, very friendly and attentive. 

Location is awesome! Shopping and theater, subways and bus stops all a few minutes walk away.  There's also a park very nearby which is wonderful for a stroll or run through.",3,2015,08,15
142,It's as close to staying in a club as a long time member,"Under the new ownership the hotel has gone from strength to strength. the management problems which caused me to find other accommodation while visiting London have been addressed and the hotel has returned to it's former position as one of the best of the smaller hotels in London.

As a long term user of the hotel it has become ,if anything, more aware of the needs of visitors to London. Don't expect glitz and if that is what you're looking for go somewhere else. Their bar remains a highlight of the hotel from drinks to lunches and dinners plus the excellent service of the staff. The only quibble why can't they serve good bread for breakfast --there must be an alternative to packaged bread.",5,2015,08,15
142,Six nights in central London,"Friendly, helpful staff, great location and great rooms.  We spent six nights with two boys 11 and 13 and we were very comfortable and treated very well. We will go back!  The location behind the Ritz and close to Green Park made it very convenient.",5,2015,08,14
142,Excellent!,Fantastic hotel.  Rooms are small by American standards but beautiful.  Bathroom beautifully appointed and spotless.  I never take baths in hotel bathtubs but did here.  Quiet.  Complimentary mini-bar such a plus!  Unlimited bottled water.  No concerns at all.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2015,08,14
142,Stafford Hotel,The hotel is located near to the St. James Park and a walking distance to the Buckingham Palace. My wife and I enjoyed walking through the park during the Big Bike London ride. The hotel is situated in the cup de sac and very quiet and the service was excellent.,5,2015,08,14
142,Your home in London,"This boutique hotel in London's St James area is so cozy and welcoming.  It really feels like staying in a (rich) friend's townhouse.  Location is perfect and there are plenty of restaurants and sights within easy walking distance (Buckingham Palace is a 5 minute walk).  Staff is warm and friendly, breakfast is excellent and beds are super comfortable.  The American Bar is a great place to hang out, but it will cost you dearly to drink there.  Ask for a tour of the cellars - its a real treat.",5,2015,08,07
142,Convenient Luxury in the heart of London,"Great hotel very conveniently located on the tube Picadilly line, the most convenient line for sightseeing. The American Bar is full of character with outdoor seating that is very nice in summer weather. The staff were very friendly and helpful in all sorts of ways.",5,2015,08,07
142,It depends what you are looking for!,"We have stayed at the Stafford a number of times previously and have just spent 2 weeks at the there again. 
The main reason we continue to use it is the location. At the rear in Blue Bell Yard are the stable block & a block of suites. The suites are laid out in such a way that three suites takes one floor and for us this is perfect. Staff tend to be very friendly BUT - this time we noticed (felt) some discontent amongst the staff, a number of staff changes and got the impression some of the staff really did not care. 
Dining - quality has plunged - room service menu has been changed and reduced and the quality delivered to the room - very poor.
Rooms were not always prepared correctly and it seemed   reliant on which members of staff was on duty .",4,2015,08,04
142,Outstanding London Hotel,"We could not be more pleased with our stay at The Stafford London. The location is wonderful, and everything about this lovely British hotel sparkles with posh perfection. From now on, we will make this our London address whenever we visit. It was by far the best night sleep we had on our 3-week trip. The beds and pillows were so comfortable! The fitness center was nice, and the breakfast was elegant. It looks like a formal place, and it is, but in many ways it really is casual, comfortable, and friendly. The staff was so helpful, too. Ask them to show you their wine cellar--and maybe book a special tasting there if you can. Fantastic!",5,2015,08,03
142,An Absolute Gem!!,"Walk south from Piccadilly on St. James, turn right onto St. James Place and head into the quiet terminal corner of this side street.  You'll feel as if you stepped back to a time of quiet London elegance.

This is one of the top 5 hotels we've stayed anywhere in the world and is the best hotel in UK or Europe that we've enjoyed to date.  Service is first class.  Our 3rd floor corner room was large and quiet with a magnificent bed and a good sized shower in the en suite.  

We had an opportunity to have lunch in The Lyttleton and were not disappointed.  Highlights included Dorset crab and mango parcel, Loch Duart salmon, and Suffolk pork filet - yum!!

The staff was beyond accommodating and always eager to please.  The location provides walking access to a large area of central London, and the Green Park tube stop is only a short walk away.

We don't think we'll stay anyplace else when our travels take us to London.",5,2015,08,02
142,The Best of The Past Lives on...,"Charming, old world hotel tucked away in a quiet cul de sac off the stylish St. James Street and Piccadilly. Recommend staying in the Mews Suites for the full experience, plus it has a covered walkway directly to St. James. Service impeccable and their restaurant is excellent. Don't miss afternoon tea in the hotel's living room. ",5,2015,08,01
142,"Excellent service, amazing and spacy rooms","Our room was not in the main building but in the Mews. While I knew the it would not be the normal matchbox you get in downtown London I was not prepared for this. It was beautiful, it was spacy and the bathroom was huge. It felt like a shame to go out as it made you want to stay in...
The service was all you would expect from a luxury 5-star and more. I need to mention their award-winning concierge service - can confirm the awards were well deserved. I contacted hhim in advance re booking tickets for my kid, and not only he helped me on that but also shared in advance the programs for all relevant attractions and helpful advice. Net, fully recommended.",5,2015,07,30
142,Gracious English Elegance in a Great Location,"The Stafford is about two blocks from St. James Park and about a block from the luxury stores on Bond street and Mayfair. Though it is in a busy section of London, it is away from the commotion, as it is tucked down a chic side street. The hotel is divided between two adjoining buildings: rooms in one being more traditional in style and those in the other more au currant and more spacious. All are luxurious, exceedingly comfortable and have sophisticated amenities. The staff are expeditious and friendly, as are the concierges, who are quite knowledgeable about what to see and do in London. The hotel guests seem well heeled and understated - well maybe not the sheikh who arrived with his family and two vans full of luggage for a six week stay on the top floor. I look forward to returning.",5,2015,07,29
142,Fantastic experience,Our family had a great experience at The Stafford because of the service provided by Paul and Gregory.  They were so helpful and went out of their way with exemplary and personal service.  Whatever was needed in our rooms was taken care of very quickly.  Paul provided us with great restaurant recommendations and followed up asking about our experience. True gentlemen who care that their clients are happy.  ,5,2015,07,22
142,"Wow, we'll be back!",We traveled to London with four teenage sons. The adjoining rooms in the muse section were absolutely perfect for our family. The staff was friendly but not too over the top. The maid service was impeccable and the location allowed us to walk to Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus in 6 minutes. Perfect!,5,2015,07,21
142,An incredible luxury experience,"I booked to stay here with my wife for her birthday and I must say that both the hotel and staff were incredible. 

The hotel is very well decorated and kept in great order, it is very luxurious whilst remaining very comfortable. 

The staff are very friendly and can't do enough for you. Unlike some luxury hotels The Stafford does not feel fussy rather you feel pampered and at home. 

We had a fantastic stay and I would defiantly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,20
142,Quintessential Brit,"While they've changed things around a couple time in the last few years, this is the ultimate British experience.  Intimate location, great food, with a wonderful location near Bond Street and secret gate to Green Park.",5,2015,07,19
142,Good Stay,Stayed in room 8.Very stately.Enjoyed the room and the staff.The front desk staffing was was attentive ans welcoming.We would visit it again. The staff provided excellent service.The location was central to downtown.,5,2015,07,18
142,The Stafford,"We had an absolutely wonderful time in our ""home away from home"".  The Stafford is tucked away in the best part of London.  it is perfectly appointed, the food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  We can't wait to return!",5,2015,07,18
142,Great Hotel - Casual yet elegant.,"Excellent location, secluded but short stroll into the heart of Mayfair. Staff friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the Mews Suite, American Bar and Courtyard. Nice change to the bustling glitzy Mayfair hotels. Would recommend and return.",5,2015,07,17
142,The Stafford - five star classic ,"This my second stay at the Stafford having stayed last year when still part of Kempinski. I had wonderful stay the last trip and I'm pleased to say as good or better being owner-managed. Many of the same staff remain, the level of service, professionalism, thoughtfulness without being intrusive - of virtually all of the staff I encountered during a nearly two week stay was first-rate. 

The location is great.  A nine minute walk to Whole Foods if you don't want to eat at restaurants or have room service every meal. Convenient for most meetings I had and walking distance or short taxi to most places I visited in London 

I love both the restaurant and the bar.

Rooms - here is where to pay attention. The Stafford is an expensive hotel and while well worth it, the entry level rooms might be smaller than some people might expect so be sure to inquire specifically if this is a concern. I stayed in a classic king room which was very comfortable, nice bathroom, good workspace and lots of room for someone who tends to spread out. Not much of a view but good light and I was happy. I am not that easy to oleae so kudos to the staff and the hotel overall. 

highly recommended ",5,2015,07,17
142,If You Want to Feel Like a Member of THE CLUB,"Start strolling through St. James and pass by iconic British institutions like Truefitt and Hill and James J. Fox and make a quick turn to the left and keep walking about 100 meters and dart right onto a small cul-de-sac and you'll find the Stafford now part of the Kempinski Brand. You're in Central London, indeed only about three minutes from one of the busiest and most recognizable streets in the City, yet things are generally quiet with a dozen or so residents going to and from work and an occasional taxi dropping someone off. Otherwise there is little trace of the noise, rush, or rumble of the city around. 

Indeed, the entrance to hotel stands unassumingly on one corner of the street, the only sign of commerce is perhaps a few flags flying out front and the discreet presence of the one of the hotel's doormen. The facade of the hotel looks like a distinguished private club or professional society dating back decades, if not centuries. It is quintessentially British and utterly charming. The location alone and its ability to put you right in the center of London without feeling as though you are in the Center of London merits 5* alone. Yet, having stayed in a dozen different hotels in the City and a number of lovely properties around the world, what I found in the Stafford was an exceptionally luxurious experience, which had the warmth and welcome of a private club with none of the pretentiousness or snobbery. Details follow-

I stayed for night in May 2015. I found a last minute deal on a third party website which included breakfast for under 300 GBP. Considering this was a very busy and desirable period I thought I had done well. Several, far inferior, hotels were asking this and more for the same night. 

The first mark of a good hotel is do they have enough staff. As I walked up the stairs, I was greeted by two bellman and saw at least two to three concierges on each shift during my stay. Next, in talking to everyone it was clear how much they enjoyed the property and how much they actually knew about the City. Most of the staff had grown up there. I asked about a couple shops and one of the concierges could rattle them off in exact order as they lay on the street and drew me a diagram. I want to emphasize these were not common tourist faire but more specialized food stores. (impressive). It's so hard to find this level of familiarity and professionalism even in good hotels, such is the job market for hospitality. 

After a few minutes I was checked in by a friendly and professional young man from Hungary (or was it Romania?) and he apologized that they were having some work done on the main elevator but he could escort me to the service elevator. Even though I arrived before 10 am they had a room ready and offered to show it to me. He opened the door to my room on the second floor and it was a jewel box: cozy (without being compact) with a full King bed, sitting area with two full arm chairs, a chair with a work desk, and multiple closets. The room had a yellow and blue color scheme with matching fabric patterns throughout. 

Admittedly, it was a very classical design that fans of a more modern and sleek decor may not full appreciate but it played to its strengths and was in keeping with both the look and feel of the entire building. The entire room was perhaps 350 square feet (33-34 Sq. Meters) but everything was so nicely placed that the room had a nice sense of both flow and space with distinct areas for sleeping, working, or having a nice conversation. I've had rooms that were double the size but with half the usable space. Additionally, there was a tremendous amount of storage given the size of the room. The mattress, linens, and toiletries were what I would expect from a hotel of this quality. Internet signal was strong and constant (and as I recall totally free!). 

Service was magnificent throughout my stay. I needed a significant amount of express laundry done and I sent it out at about 11:30 am and it all arrived back promptly. Danny from the Bellstaff could not have been more helpful (my thanks!). Waiters and maitre'd staff at breakfast were equally both welcoming and accommodating. The bar, lounge, and breakfast room were both discreet and luxurious while still offering all the modern comforts. It was one of the few hotels in which I have stayed that I genuinely did not want to leave. 

I've tried so many different hotels in London and the Stafford is better then them all. I've tried the big titans of luxury on Park Lane, The Stafford is better. I've tried the charming hotels in Knightsbridge and Kensington, The Stafford is better. I've tried the business hotels on Canary Wharf, the Stafford is better. I've tired big, small, chain, and independent and the Stafford is the best by a wide margin. If you can afford it, book it. My only caveat is you must like the classical design and feel of the place. If you expect bedside iPads and minimalist design or if you expect a row of luxury cars ringing the exterior and the latest celebrity chef cooking your meals, it is probably best you look elsewhere and leave this wonderful gem to the rest of us. 

In short, the Stafford delivers a level of luxury and charm that so many London hotels promise but many more fail to deliver. I look forward to returning. 

Happy Traveling!",5,2015,07,17
142,Pitched as home from home,"I hadn't realised that I have indeed stayed at this hotel once before some years back. I was just here the one night. First thing i noticed was how friendly and helpful the staff were.This hotel does pitch itself as a home from home, and it really felt like it. I had a nice standard type room, well appointed with a small ensuite too of course. Rooms are smaller in London generally, and this was fine for a night or two when busy out and about. The hotel was quiet, in easy walking distant of main shopping area and Brooks Club I was to be at later so was perfect in every way. Breakfast was very good, hotel was quiet, they just need to fix the curtains so they close completely, which I hope I mentioned to them as it is summer and the sun is up early.",4,2015,07,15
142,Absolutely fabulous ,"Staff was great, extremely helpful and the rooms were exquisite.  They had both regular outlets that needed an adapter to use your American products and outlets wired for American products.  Breakfast was great everyday, but be ready for your coffee to be french-pressed and no cream unless you ask for it.  The bar was cozy but food selection was limited  (we got in too late for dinner).  The entire family enjoyed our visit, thanks.",5,2015,07,09
142,Beautiful boutique hotel in THE best London location,"The Stafford is a jewel on the crown of London. Tucked in a quiet corner right next to Green Park, 2 minutes from Buckingham Palace, Mayfair and Trafalgar Square, 10 minutes from Oxford Street, The Stafford is just wonderfully elegant. I love how The Stafford presents you with personal cards that say ""The Stafford - my address when in London"". The service, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff was fabulous. The American Bar divine. The Lyttleton Restaurant was superb for breakfast and dinner, with real silver cutlery and teapots ! If you can, treat yourself to the top floor room overlooking the rear courtyard with its magnificent view over London - you can see the London Eye, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben ! The marble bathrooms are exquisite as well. There is much to love about The Stafford !",5,2015,07,09
142,Wonderful stay,"Our large family stayed for 6 nights.  Staff was great, helpful and quick.  Room was clean and the bed comfy.  Can't say enough good things about it. Food was excellent whether breakfast, lunch or dinner.",5,2015,07,08
142,Excellent Stay,"We stayed for 1 week and received excellent service from the staff.  Very helpful concierge, bell staff, laundry, food and bar.  Outside seating for evening drinks and cigars was peaceful and wonderful.  Room was cleaned well in the Am and then cleaned with turn down service in evening.  we will return.",5,2015,07,07
142,Very pleasant stay,"The Stafford provides high quality service, an excellent location and generally excellent rooms. This is not my first stay at the hotel and I come back because of the quality, comfort and consistency of service. Would certainly recommend.",5,2015,07,03
142,The Stafford is Great,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Stafford. The room, the service the food and location were all top notch. Value is what you get for what you pay and this is not an inexpensive hotel.  Highly recommend it to anyone traveling to London especially couples.",5,2015,07,03
142,"great location, great staff","Location, furnishings, staff, room are all first class.  didn't eat there, so can't comment on that.  concierge was very helpful, can arrange pickup from the airport, but taxi would be cheaper .  Work out area is small.  Has rooms in main building and some outside rooms in what used to be carriage houses",5,2015,07,02
142,"So British, so nice! Good proximity.","The Stafford is nestled in some buildings and makes you feel like you're away from the hustle & bustle of the city.  It's also conveniently located within walking distance to Buckingham Palace (changing-of-the-guards takes place everyday @ 11:30 am so be there way before to get to view it!), shopping areas, restaurants, Westminster Abbey, etc...
The staff are very courteous, friendly, and very helpful (thank you, Oliver, Daniel & Noemy!). The restaurant, which serves breakfast, lunch & dinner, does a really good job. Food is delish! I'd booked our room through Amex Platinum and it came with really great perks like room upgrade (unfortunately, the hotel didn't have any availability to upgrade us), complimentary lunch or dinner (we saved 90 pounds on lunch!), late check-out.  We also had a bottle of wine and welcome fruits.

We were given a room in the main hotel, which is more traditional than the 2 other options (you can check them out on their website or from other reviews). This was appreciated since it was raining when we arrived and wouldn't have to walk out to the other 2 buildings. The room was very tight  but very cozy and had the most comfortable bed I'd ever slept on! It was also very quiet and very clean. The bathroom, however, was quite spacious and luxurious. Bedroom slippers and fluffy robes are also provided. The Stafford does it right!

The courtyard is in the middle of the 3 room-buildings and is very pretty, that makes it conducive to just rest and relax with some snacks and drinks - especially after a long day of walking.

Overall, I will definitely come back to The Stafford and would highly recommend it! Oh yes, there's free wifi as well.",4,2015,07,01
142,Exemplary Service combined with Understated Elegance,"Review of Nov/Dec 2014 10 night stay.

The Stafford London is the PERFECT respite from the hustle and bustle of London. 

My husband treated me to a surprise (year ending in zero) birthday stay and it was magical. We experienced sterling service from the moment we booked; the staff is ridiculously talented and the attention to every little detail is just incredible. I want to thank Sophia, Olivia, Gino, Peter and so many others again for their kindness and professionalism, they all go above & beyond to make one feel valued and welcome.

The American Bar is treat steeped in history and offers the best cigar area in tandem with an addictive cocktail/food menu with all day/evening service. 

Again, it was an occasion and the staff of The Stafford made it so special for me, champagne in the room, a delectable cake and everyone greeting me/us in every area of the hotel etc.

The location is unbeatable too! The hotel is LITERALLY a 5 minute walk to either Green Park or Piccadilly Circus. So many restaurants, shops and tourist attractions are w/i walking distance.

I simply cannot wait to return to The Stafford London, it is fabulous.

Thank you again for everything!",5,2015,06,30
142,Quiet elegance next to Green Park,"Wonderful sleep quality in a blessedly quiet room in central London. We were able to sleep with the window open and were never aware of street noise; no corridor noise; not a hint of elevator noise. Bliss. Wonderful bed with high quality linen. Elegant room and charming bathroom. Beware though, the queen-sized room is tight for two when travelling with two carry-ons and  two large suitcases. Loved the alleyway to Green Park which allows you to get to the tube without actually walking on the street! The staff (reception, doormen and room staff) are exceptionally helpful and proud of their hotel.",5,2015,06,27
142,Rough start Incredible finish,"So, we usually stay at the Savoy, but AMEX Fine hotels really was high on this hotel, and I thought I would give it a try.  I am in the  business, and I understand that sometimes an issue just can't be fixed.  But this one could have been.  One of our rooms was ready.  It was nice and clean, with a great shower.  The other was not, and herein is the problem.  The front desk is inexperienced and disorganized, but I saw the training, and I think the issue will be resolved,   And  there was also a train strike issue.   Senior staff is very good.  The concierge James is a credit to the hotel.  So is Darcy.  He accepted responsibility and made me glad to stay here.    Once their front desk is sorted out, I will give this five stars",4,2015,06,25
142,June 2015,"Overall, didn't match past experiences at this hotel.  Changes made by new ownership are not for the better.  Rooms small, but nice.  Great location. Feel like hotel squeeze money out of guest rather than feeling appreciated.  Don't feel guest is made to feel special.",3,2015,06,25

142,Why stay anywhere else?,"Returned to the Stafford after a great visit 2 years ago, and unlike many return visits, this experience was as good as the first. It is an elegant hotel but not the least bit stuffy. The staff are friendly, helpful and always smiling. Our room was very comfortable with a great bed and linens. And The American Bar is a special place to have a cocktail and relax. We love the location as well as many sights and restaurants are an easy walk away. This is where we'll stay again on future trips to London.",5,2015,06,22
142,Great stay in a luxury setting,"A superb experience from check in to check out. Nothing was too much trouble.

142,The Stafford never fails to provide a great experience,"I love the location and charm of The Stafford. It is tucked away on a quiet street in St James, yet is a quick walk to Green Park and Picadilly- right in the middle of everything!! The room was small but, for a single person traveling, perfect. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had everything that I needed.",5,2015,06,16
142,My husband's 79th birthday,We were up from the country for my husband's birthday to visit the Churchill War Rooms and the Imperial War Museum.  The hotel was lovely in every way except that we had the smallest bedroom I have ever been in at very high London prices!,4,2015,06,16
142,A gem,"I travel globally, and this is my favorite hotel.  The service is excellent; the location is great; the room was nice; and the breakfast was one of the best.  I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.  It compares with the world's finest hotels.",5,2015,06,16
142,Better the last time?,Not my best stay in the Stafford. I think standards have gone down from the last time I stayed in the hotel and I believe it is because there are so many new staff and not all of them speak or understand English.,3,2015,06,16
142,An elegant gem,"The Stafford is an elegant gem in the midst of a bustling neighborhood, a quiet oasis of peace and calm, in the heart of the city.  Service and accommodations are first rate.  Convenient to transportation and shopping, the hotel is surrounded by excellent restaurants.",5,2015,06,16
142,Heavy and stuffy,"This hotel is located in a posh area of Mayfair, close to a lovely park. It is a little hidden, in a kind of backstreet. A tube station is nearby. The hotel exudes Britishness of the old Victorian type. The atmosphere is heavy and stuffy. Most guests seem elderly Americans on a Europe Nostalgia Tour. Rooms are small, cramped with dark oak furniture. The bed is so high that you almost have to climb onto it. The bathrooms have the usual British plumbing problems. Both the flush as shower pressure were feeble.",3,2015,06,14
142,"Location, location, location!","We could not find a better hotel than The Stafford. And the location is excellent, with parks and restaurants nearby.

Every aspect of our stay was exceptional. The room was very nice, and we slept very well. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty in assisting us. We used the concierge every day, and they gave us great advice on restaurants, and made our reservations. We are very glad we stayed here, and we will recommend The Stafford to everyone we know.",5,2015,06,11

142,Best hotel in Central London / St. James,"The Stafford is a gem. Hidden away between St. James Street and Green Park it has a great location close to shopping, the Palace, the parks and good restaurants.

One of London's great unknown private art galleries is within a 100 years - Chris Beetles Gallery - the world authority on British book illustrators, and some great sculpture.

Beautiful rooms, built around a quiet mews, very nicely decorated, and for London, quite spacious.

The pub is great. the staff very courteous and attentive.

My wife and I love the Stafford - for both business and pleasure.Our 'home away from home' in London",5,2015,06,07
142,"Old fashioned elegance, small and very British",This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel. The ambience is that of a private estate. The staff was extremely helpful in making  restaurant reservations even before we arrived. The food is excellent. The location is near St. James Park. The hotel is expensive but worth it.,5,2015,06,07
142,St. James,"Excellent location for walking around to all the areas from shopping to tourist site. The hotel was excellent, quiet and restful and had a lot of American history to it. One must go through the American Bar and see the wine cellar. The Lyttelton restaurant was excellent and may appear stuffy but it was not and the staff were wonderful.",5,2015,06,06
142,Outstanding in every respect,"We have stayed at the Stafford Hotel on at least 5 occasions. It continues to get even better. When we checked in we were told that the new General Manager wanted to speak to us. He came out of his office, personally greeted us, and told us how glad they were to welcome us back. We were shown to a deluxe King room which had been completely refurbished. It was sumptuous and lacked nothing. Even had a Nespresso machine. Breakfasts are always a pleasure there with service to match. The American Bar is a jewel and makes the best Martinis in Europe. Perfect service. Perfect stay. We can't praise it enough. It's expensive but worth every penny.",5,2015,06,05
142,A little jewel in the heart of London,"I only stayed one night at The Stafford but I honestly I had one of the best experiences of my life. Located in May Fair next to the Green Park, the hotel is easily accessible. The area is extremely quiet however you are close to everything (bars, restaurants etc.). My room was allocated in the Carriage House, a charming English style building in the courtyard of the hotel. The service was outstanding, the staff extremely helpful, polite and charming. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2015,06,04
142,"Great service, great location","Staff is terrific.  Very helpful concierge.  Lovely accommodations, although room was a bit cramped. We arrived in the wee hours of the morning and found the staff to be very solicitous. The breakfast buffet is very nice.  Fresh squeezed orange juice was a treat. Close to Green Park Tube, Jermyn Street shops and Buckingham Palace.",5,2015,06,02
142,Love The Stafford London,"I visited this hotel last year with my girlfriends.  We loved the hotel, so I decided to bring my husband back this year. As we arrived late in the day, we were greeted by a John who remembered me from last year and welcomed me back. We were quickly checked in and went our room which was in the annex building. The junior suite couldn't have been more lovely with english charm and plush mondern conveniences. We then headed to the bar down stairs which is small, cozy, and very English.
There is nothing not to love about this hidden treasure, from the location, to the staff, to the decor of the hotel. If you want to have an outstanding hotel experience stay here. I'm already planning a trip next summer to bring my sister and her kids.",5,2015,05,31
142,Luxury Boutique Style Hotel,"We managed to get a fab deal for this hotel via Lastminute.com's top secret hotels. When I discovered which hotel we had booked I was super excited as this had been on my list of London hotels to stay at!

Arrival: 
We arrived via cab and were greets by a very pleasant door man who led us inside and took care of out bags.
Inside we were greeted by an equally lovely and very friendly member of reception. 

Check in: was quick and smooth and the great service continued with a tour of the downstairs areas of the hotel, the same member of staff then showed us to our rooms upstairs and again showed us around the room. Excellent customer service!

The room: Was just lovely. Decor very tasteful and luxurious! A good size bedroom and bathroom with plenty of electrical points. Tea & coffee facilities were readily available along with a mini bar full of goodies. The bed felt like sleeping on a cloud, seriously, I have never been so comfortable, I even looked at the mattress and pillow labels!

We didn't use the hotel facilities but there seemed a nice bar and restaurant. The location was perfect, a nice walk through the surrounding streets with high end shopping on very corner! The tube stations were very near but we enjoyed walking everywhere.
I would highly recommend this hotel, it ticked the boxes in every area!",5,2015,05,30
142,Outstanding,"This is a perfect London location. Easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, parks, underground, restaurants and shopping. We stayed seven nights. There was a bit of a hiccup with our check-in. We arrived mid-morning and understandably our room (upgraded by the way) was not ready. A promise of 20 minutes turned into several hours. There was a disconnect with the housekeeping staff. Other than that, we enjoyed every moment. 
The bedding was luxurious, the double door entry foyer blocked hallway noise, bathroom products were very nice. We were even invited to the hotel manager's evening gathering for wine and hors d' oeuvres. She and the entire staff are just lovely people.",5,2015,05,26
142,Classic British Hotel,"Beautiful spot. Exceptional staff. Everyone was so helpful. Small room, but it was fine as I was traveling alone. Would have been tight for two. Quiet and conveniently located in Mayfair. Excellent breakfast. Wonderful afternoon tea.",5,2015,05,26
142,Quintessentially English,"We had a lovely four night stay here. The rooms (like most in London) are a little small so we had to be very organised with our luggage as we had quite large pieces. It is beautifully decorated and the bed needs a special mention as it was so comfortable. The bathroom was a good size with a shower over the bath, and the Floris bath amenities were spot on. One minor point was that the water pressure was a little low. 

The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent. The hotel is in a really good location with Green Park tube station nearby. There are also many different types of restaurants and pubs nearby if you do not want to eat at the hotel.

All in all we really enjoyed The Stafford and would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,05,23
142,Wonderful Stay,"This is one of the finest hotels I've ever stayed at.  We were treated like family.  Breakfast was excellent and the afternoon tea was so nice.

142,The Most Gracious Hotel in London,"I cannot say enough good things about this property. The location is great. The service is world class, quiet , cozy , comfortable, well manged and so beautifully luxurious in the best London Townhouse kind of way. After a very busy day and evening, I couldn't wait to get back to my sumptuous room for a sleep in a most incredibly comfortable bed. The hotels  American Bar is my favorite bar in London and I've been going there for years but this was my first time staying there but it will definitely not be my last.
I must say , the hotel is so extraordinary because the management and staff are extraordinary in every way. I say Bravo and well done to General Manager Spencer Yeo and Executive Concierge Frank Laino, Sarah and Edward in the office and all the wonderful doorman and staff in The American Bar. Most luxury hotels could learn many lessons from the Stafford.",5,2015,05,20

142,Exceptional In Every Way,"The Stafford Hotel exceeded our high expectations for luxury and service.  The hotel is lovely, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, and it is on St. James, which is in an absolutely wonderful part of London right by Green Park (excellent for runners in the morning).  It was very quiet at night, so sleeping was a dream. The staff were friendly and helpful, which was perfect for our party of 6 lively adults. The chef is talented; the food was delicous from breakfast to dinner. The American Bar has a great atmosphere. We highly recommend The Stafford Hotel for adults and families!",5,2015,05,13
142,my home while in London,Few hotels in the world can match The Stafford. Certainly none in London that I have stayed at provide that feeling of tradition & being part of the history of a London which seems to be bent on change. The staff make that feeling real for me.,5,2015,05,09
142,Elegant and fantastic location,"I visited here as a guest and although I have seen many hotels in London there is not one quite like this. Set just off St James Square the location is perfect, very quiet and peaceful. Apart from the main hotel, there is separate accommodation in the courtyard. Of special note is the wine cellar, tastings and tours with the in house sommelier, the ebullient Gino, very entertaining.
Excellent food, and the lounge and dining areas are very comfortably appointed, just like a country home
The bar is excellent, atmospheric and the lighting just right. Well stocked",5,2015,05,07

142,"Wonderful,secluded boutique hotel.","This hotel set back from the hurley burley of London up a tucked away side street off St James offers a completely different stay from that of large corporate hotels. Staff are friendly, courteous and efficient and are very much a part of the distinctive atmosphere of the hotel. Bedrooms are large, furnished with extremely comfortable beds, fitted out with wonderful linen. The bar, covered in photographs of hundreds of celebrities is a must, though cocktails are an eye wateringly expensive, the price redeemed to some extent by an ever flowing supply of delicious nibbles! This is a glorious place for a real treat.",5,2015,05,02
142,Tucked Away Gem,"On our previous trips we had stayed in what we thought was the best location n town.  After staying at the Stafford, we've changed our minds.  What an absolute delight.  Great location.  Attentive dining room and bar staff.  Quiet.  Would stay there again!",5,2015,05,02
142,Great experience! We will be back!,"Excellent experience at the hotel, staff were very friendly and the rooms were clean and to perfection. The food in the American Bar was fantastic.

142,A real gem,"If you're looking for the real ""British hotel experience"", I recommend The Stafford.  I was warmly greeted and though I didn't book direct with the hotel, they made me feel welcome and offered both a great stay and a good value.  The reasonable price included breakfast and wifi, the surprise was all non-alcoholic beverages were complimentary. The staff was very helpful and I would stay there again.",5,2015,04,29
142,very comfortable and well placed for shopping,Discretly located and very well appointed hotel. Comfortable with a pleasant staff. Located in a quiet part of the center of London. Traditional styled rooms with all the necessary amenities. Perfect for shopping on Saville row or Jermyn street.,5,2015,04,27
142,Edwardian luxury,"Set in tranquillity off St James Street. A five star hotel in a beautifully decorated former Edwardian town house, within easy walking distance of Green Park tube and a short walk from Trafalgar Square. Highly attentive staff.  First class service. The American bar has a great atmosphere and is very popular.  Food and service in the dining room was excellent. Bedroom was a good size and bathroom/rain shower good. Room decorated in the Edwardian style but with modern conveniences (inc a Nespresso coffee maker), minibar soft drinks free. Complementary paper and breakfast included. 5 star hotel in St James, Westminster prices, so don't be surprised.",5,2015,04,25
142,A wonderful small hotel in London,"Small, historic, elegant. The rooms are traditional & elegant. They are small but have everything that is needed.

It is in walking distance of all of St. James and Mayfair.",5,2015,04,25
142,Prime Green Park Location,"Unique Setting Next to Green park, tucked away in St. James area.  Only 5 minute walk from Green Park Tube Station.  Very friendly service.  Quiet Rooms.

142,"Perfection is not attainable, but if you chase perfection you can catch excellence... The Stafford you are excellent.","Absolutely fabulous experience from beginning to end! The Stafford have just provided us with memories for life. 
I recently married my Wife at an intimate ceremony in Chelsea and in preparation for our special day we wanted a centrally located London hotel with a homely feel, for just 2 nights. Fortuitously, my business Partner strenuously recommended The Stafford from a previous stay and we were not disappointed. 
From the moment we made contact with Sarah Pendrigh we were treated like returning friends. Rooms were booked and a raft of well-chosen recommendations made for an intimate breakfast brunch were supplied by Frank Laino their Executive Concierge. The Wolsey was chosen and booked for us. Seamless.
My Wife stayed the night before our nuptials with her maid of honour and were warmly welcomed and spoilt throughout their stay. 
After our Wedding ceremony we briefly returned to the hotel prior to our brunch at The Wolsey, but were warmly greeted by Sarah and her team proffering perfectly chilled Champagne! After a wonderful brunch (Frank had arranged further Champagne on arrival at The Wolsey!) we returned to The Stafford alone, to relax after a hectic few days. 
The Hotel totally surprised us with a room upgrade and we were escorted to a Master Suite in the Mews. Stunning luxury!  Not a room at all, but your own home right in the centre of Town!  We threw open the balcony doors and popped the cork on another complimentary bottle of champagne and beautiful wedding cake! 
Later, after a romantic evening stroll around beautiful St James’ and Mayfair we sampled the delights of the hotel’s wonderful American Bar and their fabulous cocktails, followed by a great meal enjoyed back in our room.  
After a sound night’s sleep in our huge, cosy bed and a great British Breakfast we took a stroll through Green Park and visited the Royal Academy of Arts for the Rubens exhibition. However, the most difficult part of our stay loomed…… leaving. So to stave off the sadness a while longer we took a tour of the Hotel’s historic wine cellars. What a dinner and party venue they are! 
We are already planning our next stays for Christmas shopping, our first wedding anniversary, and our next Birthday celebration in the Wine Cellar!! 
We cannot express our gratitude enough to Sarah, Frank and every single amazing member of staff for the genuinely best hotel experience we have ever had. You completed our wedding and we feel truly blessed. The Stafford, you are truly excellent. Thank you. Caroline & Tim x",5,2015,04,23
142,Such a nice place.  Superb.,"A high quality traditional hotel in St James.  Very nice room with four poster bed which was not king sized as requested so we were a bit cramped.  However, bathroom and room facilities which included expresso machine were very good.

Fantastic breakfast.  Good food in the restaurant and room service.  Wine was very expensive though.

Service everywhere of the highest standard and nothing was too much.",5,2015,04,19
142,Leisure,"Had a wonderful time at The Stafford the hotel is very central. The hotel is of a high standard the service was excellent. The rooms were spacious , the hotel has lots of character we thoroughly enjoyed our stay",5,2015,04,14
142,"Wonderful location, exquisite service!","We loved our recent stay at The Stafford!   The terrific location (one block off Piccadilly, a short block from Green Park) ensures easy and convenient access to everything ... easy walks or speedy access to the subway/underground.   We also can't say enough about the wonderful service at the Stafford!  The hotel is small, so the staff is very focused on each guest.  Every request or question was addressed with the utmost skill and attention.   From the doorman, to the concierge, to the front desk staff, to the restaurant staff -- absolutely perfect, warm, friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, caring service!
For our family of 5, we were guaranteed adjacent rooms connected by a small foyer - a very nice amenity in an older historic hotel.   The rooms are rather small, but the beds were exquisitely comfortable and the bathrooms were of the highest updated standards... again a wonderful treat in combination with the historic charm of The Stafford.  We will definitely be returning on our next visit to London!",5,2015,04,13
142,What an undiscovered gem,"I'm just back from a site visit for an event. This truly is an undiscovered gem in the heart of St James! The peace sad tranquility means it's like being out in countryside. 
The public areas are beautiful, the meeting rooms great, bedrooms are gorgeous and the added working wine cellar for wine tasting adds a special something to an event. Franzi who was my host for the visit was simply DIVINE and one of the best contacts I have come across. Well done to you all on a beautiful venue....",5,2015,04,08

142,Great Hotel,Boutique hotel in great London location.  Wife and I were there on business/pleasure and stayed at Stafford.  First time there.  Service is unparalleled.  Hotel is traditional and rooms are very nice.  Location near Green Park is superb.  The staff is first rate.  They cannot do enough for you.  Breakfast was included in our rate and it was wonderful.  Gulten Free options as well.  This one is a gem,5,2015,04,06
142,Best Hotel in Mayfair,"What is it not to like about this hotel? It's like coming home to a perfect home and as always, the staffs are friendly, happy and very professional. Perfect location, walking distance to all major things in London.",5,2015,04,03
142,One of the highlights of our trip!,"The Stafford is everything we'd heard, and more.  Location can't be beat.  Walking distance to almost everything in our favorite part of London.  I agree with others who rate the service exceptional..... very personal service and a very personable staff.  They've hired well here.  Any time we asked for something, it arrived promptly, even quickly! Our room was in the main part of the hotel (not the newer addition, which looked more modern but less charming to us), and not in the rooms directly off the mews.  The mews, by the way, was a charming open-air location for an afternoon cocktail, but as I saw people coming and going from their rooms (which open to the outdoors, to be clear ---- not onto a hallway), I was very glad I wasn't one of them.  Strangers right outside my bedroom door isn't my idea of privacy.  BEST BED EVER.  We took a peek under the sheets to find the mattress brand.  Not a name we recognized, probably bespoke.  Every day we remarked how great we slept in that bed.  (This is a huge statement --- Hotel beds usually fall short for us because we both have horrible back problems.) We only tried room service for breakfast, and it was exceptional. Scottish oatmeal was divinely creamy.  We also loved the American Bar.  Great old school service, excellent bartender.  Atmosphere was ""clubby"" without being kitschy.  The only shortcoming I could find in the whole hotel was the bathroom in our room.  I know it's an old building and space is limited, but the bathroom was tight and the bathtub was tighter. Would love to have seen a newer, deep soaker tub, newer fixtures.  With Molton Brown bath amenities, however, which were delivered in abundance, I forgave the old bath and bubbled-up!  Not enough to cost them a star...",5,2015,04,01
142,Elegant and Welcoming,"This hotel was perfect from the minute we stepped up to the door. I have never stayed anyplace where I was made to feel so welcome. This is an elegantly decorated hotel, quiet and charming.  The staff were friendly and accommodating and went out of their way to make us feel at home.  The location was perfect for visiting London.  The Green Park tube station is a very short walk away, but you can actually walk to many restaurants and sights from this Central location. The room was lovely with a comfortable bed and a very nice good size marble bathroom.  Breakfasts were very good and served downstairs in the Lyttleton restaurant.  There is a nice fireplace and comfy seating downstairs for a cocktail or glass of bubbly.  I want to thank all the staff, especially Christine, David, Edward, (thanks for the herbal tea to help me sleep) Martin and Fernando and all the rest whose names I cannot remember.",5,2015,03,30
142,"Service, service, service!","Perfectly located, this beautiful, quiet hotel offers the best service I've ever experienced.  Never fussy, just genuine concern for you complete satisfaction with every element of your stay. Worth it!",5,2015,03,30
142,Absolutely the best!!!!!,"My son and I stayed here for six nights and we felt like we were constantly pampered.  The staff and Peter, the concierge, were absolutely wonderful. We had complimentary breakfast and it was simply delicious especially the bacon and eggs.  The breakfast staff work quite hard to please and ensure that breakfast is a dining experience.
Room 312 was large with very comfortable beds, make up table, refrigerator, large closet and a large bathroom with thick towels.
The rooms were serviced twice a day with hard working staff.  They add to the special touches.  For example, my charger cords were nicely tied with ribbon and if my son threw his clothes on the chair, they were neatly folded.
We were also given a complimentary afternoon high tea.
The location is superb with a five minute walk to the Green Park underground and to Fortnum and Mason.  St. James Park is very close as well.
Thank for making our trip special and truly an English experience.  
WiFi is complimentary.",5,2015,03,24
142,"Quiet, Luxury and Fine Service, Don't Miss the Bar","We just spent almost a week at the Stafford.  It was our first visit and we were close to overwhelmed.  It is relatively small, discretely located on a back street in St. James and thus well located for sightseeing, shopping and just taking in London.  The staff was wonderful and the Concierge certainly earned his crossed keys during our visit.  The breakfast buffet (with a cooked option) was more than adequate.  Our room was handsome, spacious and well equipped. The bed was among the most comfortable we've ever enjoyed.  The American Bar with hung with personal mementos, ship and plane models, photographs of celebrities and others and good stuff (we loved the Russian medals from the London Olympics) is a great place for a drink, lunch or a late night dinner.  Our only quibble was the relatively small shower. 

We thought this a real discovery (believe me others have discovered it before us), and I think we'll be back.  Clearly among the better hotels we've ever been to.",5,2015,03,23
142,in my opinion it is one of the best hotel,in my opinion it is one of the best hotel in london almost you have whatever you need i feel i am at my home also  in terms of quality  the hotel have very high standard plus its very clean and the staff are great yet the room value is high,5,2015,03,21
142,Premiere hotel experience in central London,"My husband and I went to London for work but stayed in central London for a long weekend prior for fun. The Stafford is very conveniently located next to Green Park and the tour buses, next to the Ritz Carlton, and a 8 minute taxi to almost any of the theatres and shopping experiences. It's also close to a couple tube and bus stops. For location you can't go wrong.  PROS:  how comfortable the beds were, the quality and variety of breakfast offerings, fitness center availability, concierge recommendations for food and bev, friendly and helpfulness of everyone on staff.  CONS: Price and size of room. It is central London so expect about $500/night for what in America would be a very tiny room though it was beautifully appointed with every necessity it was very small (understand suites at about $900/nt are spacious but we weren't in one of those).  Overall if you have the budget or if you're on business travel and you want the most convenient location to everything, I highly recommend it. It's on par with but more intimate than both The Ritz next door and The Mayfair a few blocks away.",5,2015,03,17
142,Definitely a must,"Exceptional location, warm and cosy design, superb bathroom, friendly and efficient personnel. The American bar is a reminder of the war days when US troops were stationed; the cellars were once used as a bomb shelter; the courtyard happens to be indulgent to smokers.",5,2015,03,17
142,Excellent option for London,"Great Location, close to the heart of London. Excellent service in room and in the facilities that the hotel provides. I would use this hotel everytime I go to London not only for business purposes but also with my family. Staff very well prepared and kind. Great atmosphere in general.",5,2015,03,17
142,Excellent from Start to Finish,"I am an industry professional and paid for my stay at The Stafford as part of a family vacation.  This was my first stay at the property.  As I've inspected more than 25 top-tier hotels in London, I can safely say The Stafford ranks at the very top of the list and is rather distinctive as compared to other, upper echelon properties.  Why I like this property:  1) It is an intimate, very British property with the perfect balance of strong service, classic styling, and up-to-date amenities.  If you like the intimacy of a small luxury hotel, where staff do offer personalized service, definitely consider this spot.  We like the fact that U.K residents select this property.  It is elegant without being stuffy in the least bit.   2) The location for leisure travelers is exceptional.  St. James's is a fantastic center of city district with great history and some upscale shopping.  The particular location is very quiet.  A handy passageway nearly across the street from the main entrance, provides access to Green Park in just 2 mip.  Buck Palace is 7 in on foot.  The heart of Mayfair is about the same.  We walked to the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and back to The Stafford post theater.  3) Staff were quite responsive to the many requests of our family.  4) The American Bar was great.  It has a great private club feel and the fish and chips, while expensive, were a hit with our family.  5) Beds are VERY comfortable.",5,2015,03,17
142,Bliss,"For a top, prime central London hotel the guest is made to feel very much at home. The location, style, comfort and attention from all staff cannot be faulted. We live in London but wanted to stay somewhere special for the weekend where we could be spoiled. We were not disappointed. A huge thank you to all the staff.",5,2015,03,10
142,Brilliant venue.,"I had arranged an early evening business meeting in the American bar.  The location is great, the staff were excellent and the choice of wine was exceptional.  We had a light meal in the bar and it was excellent.  I will be back soon.",5,2015,03,09
142,this is a review of the American Bar,"Had a drink and a lunchtime meal here on Saturday 7/3/15. The ambiance was excellent. The service was excellent. The feel of the place was wonderful. The burger I had was ok ( £17.50 plus 12.5% service ) and the kitchen refused to cook it rare for ""health and safety"" reasons. Chips were frozen so some mixed feelings as to this place. A pint of bitter was £7.50 plus the 12.5% service.

However on balance worth coming here.Could not find a separate entry for the American Bar on Tripadvisor.",4,2015,03,09
142,Top Notch All the Way,"The hotel was beautiful, and the staff was amazing.  Anything you need, they were there to help and very friendly.  They went above and beyond what was expected, as did the entire experience at The Stafford.  We had the pleasure to eat at the American Bar, and it did not disappoint either.  When we return to London, we will definitely stay here again. A++ accommodations.",5,2015,03,08
142,Simply stunning.,"A simple lunch time visit turned into 3 hours of sheer decadence.  The hotel is ideally placed near St James's Park and easily accessed from Green Park Tube.  A warm greeting from the reception staff was the beginning of a very relaxing afternoon.  A cloakroom and bag drop is available. After being seated in the lounge we had a beautiful glass of champagne. Our table was simply dressed and ready without any fuss.  

Our meal started with a wonderful amuse bouche followed by a sample menu of what can only be described as plates of heaven from God's kitchen.  Divine, sumptuous, and tantalising with every taste bud being excited.  

The slow cooked beef just melted in my mouth.  The roasted vegetables were simple and perfectly complimented the main course.  

A dessert sample tray was complimented by a delicate Italian dessert wine, not overly sweet but enough to make the finale of our meal end on a perfect note.  

The restaurant manager and his staff were attentive without being intrusive. All staff knew each plate and described them on delivery.  The somellier's knowledge is a true credit to The Stafford.  
Recommended for any occasion.",5,2015,03,06
142,The American Bar review ,"I was surprised that I did not find a separate entry for the American Bar, that's why I am submitting a review here. 

We went there for a drink after we had dinner at a nearby restaurant.

The atmosphere was amazing (it felt very cosy), the service excellent (the French guy who was serving us was very polite and helpful) and the drinks very good (I had an amazing cherry brandy). We were also served nuts, crisps and olives with our drinks which was very generous.

I would definitely go back there. 

",5,2015,03,01
142,FIRST CLASS,"The hotel, staff and location are first class.  I would not change a thing and will recommend this to anyone going to London.  The staff ""get it"" when it comes to making you feel special.  Make sure you stop at the American Bar - great ambiance and drinks.",5,2015,03,01
142,A splendid stay at The Stafford London,"The downside of giving a great review is that i wouldn't want this gem of a hotel to become too popular and difficult to book.  Ambiance, staff, dining, comfort, all are top-notch. A great location very near Green Park tube station and easy walking distance to all that you would want in the West End.",5,2015,02,27
142,Amazing Luxury Hotel with fantastic staff,"I spent last Friday night at The Stafford with my girlfriend. This was my first visit and I have to say the hotel was fantastic.There is a little hidden alleyway that leads from inside  Green park to the hotel, a handy little short cut! 
The staff in all parts of the hotel were efficient and discreet. There are 3 parts to the property , the main house, the carriage house and the mews. I stayed in the mews which has a separate entrance to the main hotel. I had a junior suite which was amazing. the bed was without doubt the most comfortable i have ever slept in.The coffe maker was a nice touch too.
We had a couple of cocktails in the American bar, a buzzing little bar with great cocktails and lots of interesting memorabilia on the walls and ceiling.  This set us up nicely for dinner.
I thoroughly reccomend the Stafford, and can't wait till my next stay",5,2015,02,27
142,A hidden institution,"Top class service for this hotel tucked away near Green Park. Expect the city's best concierge, and quiet efficient luxury. Pity about the little yellow plastic ducks who have vanished from the bathrooms, and go there also for the bar, full of character (s). Breakfast however can be missed without regret.",4,2015,02,26
142,Excellent stay at The Stafford,"I can warmly recommend a stay at The Stafford hotel in London! Great service, lovely rooms and outstanding dining at their restaurant. Just loved the American bar! Do not visit London without visiting this fabulous hotel!",5,2015,02,26
142,Wonderful and Charming,"A lovely hotel for both business and pleasure.   Very comfortable with excellent staff who are presentable, appraochable and very efficient.   Holding business events there is easy and the catering provided is of high standard.  The staff themselves assist with all your needs throughout the day.  I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in London or for those who need to hold small - medium sized business seminars, functions and training events.",5,2015,02,26
142,Luxury at its best,"I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful historic hotel. The staff looked after our every need and the beds were the most comfortable beds I have slept in. A perfect location for business or leisure. A short walk to Buckingham Palace, they even have a secret passage to Green Park. The food and beverage is delicious!",5,2015,02,25
142,A Civilized and Comfortable Place to Stay,"Perfect location, hidden away but near the heart of things (restaurants, museums, shopping, parks). Beautiful rooms, well equipped and maintained. Pleasant and efficient staff. Great bar, with terrace on a mews.",5,2015,02,25
142,London is Style,We booked through Orbitz for a two day break in London. We were not quite sure what to expect but after arriving we were so happy to be met with 1st class service and wonderful staff. Our every need was attended to promptly and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.,5,2015,02,25
142,"Stafford Hotel, London","We have stayed at The Stafford several times over a number of years and the overall experience, first class service, comfortable ambience and extensive facilities have not changed - it is excellent. We would recommend The Stafford without any reservation. We do miss not having the hotel cat around - it added to the cosiness!",5,2015,02,25
142,A Lovely Break,"After a recent business trip, treated myself to a long weekend here and loved it.  The level of service was extremely high(from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant and bar staff).  The room was large (for London) and very well appointed (plenty of drawer and closet space to unpack, nice sitting area, desk with multiple US/UK power outlets). Bathroom was spacious too (but shower was awkward--about the size of telephone box).  Room service was swift and helpful but menu was a bit fussy. Minibar well stocked and non-alcohol complimentary (a nice gesture reflecting the gracious attitude of the hotel in general).",5,2015,02,25
142,A gem in St James,"Old timey hotel in a quiet part of London.  Convenient location and service is excellent.  Very close to Buckingham, nice parks, tube stations and Piccadilly.  The concierge service is the best.  Very helpful with directions and booking reservations.",4,2015,02,25
142,Wonderful Stay,"We have been staying at the Stafford for at least 15 years (sometimes more than once a year) and have always enjoyed our ""home"" whilst in London.  The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of most West End theatres and great dining.  The staff, especially Frank and his concierge staff, are brilliant.  They always manage to get us the restaurant reservations we want and the best theatre seats.  We will continue to and only frequent the Stafford when we are in London.",5,2015,02,25
142,Great lunch..,"We went as a group of 15 ladies after a tour of nearby Spencer House (another hidden treasure). We were offered a set menu with choices for each course. The food was amazing, and as a set meal, excellent value for money. Not sure if they offer the same to individual diners. My only complaint is that the wine was too expensive, and kept us to one glass. The ambiance is lovely and the restaurant manager made every effort to look after us. He is a great asset to the establishment and should be commended. Will return in the future, but wont drink too much.",5,2015,02,24
142,Cozy hotel in a great location,"We spent three busy days in London staying at The Stafford. The hotel is in a great location, just off St James' and also just off Green Park. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms spotless and comfortable. Its a traditional London hotel so the rooms are not large but ours had good storage space and an adequate  bathroom (we paid slightly more for a bath). The only slight negative I had was that the mattress was far far too soft. We only had one meal at the hotel - afternoon tea when we arrived, which was good albeit predictably expensive.",4,2015,02,18
142,Hidden Gem of Mayfair,"My stay at this traditional English hotel, in a very private setting, was incredibly indulgent. Not only you have hyde Park on your doorstep, but also Bond street and some fabulous restaurants are just few steps away. Not mentioning the 'dangerously' close vicinity to amazing wine merchants Bross Brothers. 

However, This is only mere half of of the great things about this hotel. What I liked most was the the size of my room. It was pretty large for London standards, And the beautifully decorated bathroom was just like another room ( in terms of size ) I can't fault cleanliness in this place. Air - conditioning was spot on. Even though we had some sub zero temperatures, my room was very warm and cozy. Decoration of the room was tasteful mix of antique furniture and modern appliances. Heavy curtains and lots of wallpaper.

Best thing of the room were freebees. Not only I got some high end chocolates and nuts, but also a bottle of red, which came very handy in the evening.

I would certainly stay here again, great for families, couples or fine holiday makers",5,2015,02,13
142,immensely pleasurable,"Our stay at this hotel was immensely pleasurable, from the moment that the doorman opened the door of the taxicab before we registered until our departure.  We had a sort of suite, both rooms on the small side, but with absolutely excellent closet and storage space, and all together was more than enough.  The level of service, the quality of the breakfast, the attention of the staff was outstanding. HIghly recommended.",5,2015,02,12
142,Wonderful in every way,"A short walk to Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square, and many other fantastic places, the Stafford is the perfect place. The staff overwhelms you with attention, the rooms are a delight and so well appointed. This property has earned it's reputation as a truly fine property. Also a short walk from the underground so transportation from Heathrow is easy.   ",5,2015,02,10
142,Flawless,"We choose this hotel for it's proximity to Buckingham Palace. A friend's investiture as an OBE occasioned this trip to London.  No way was I going to let London's awful traffic make me late for what one can only assume will be my sole invite to the Palace. The location was perfection. The room lovely with endlessly adjustable temperature control, a nice feature during a cold winter. My  main requirements in a hotel are good wifi, good bar, and good bed. The Stafford triumphed on all three. And, an unexpectedly delicious breakfast. A really fine kitchen whoses efforts are fully supported by the wait staff.

I've never had ""my"" hotel in London in 30 years of traveling there. I do now.",5,2015,02,09
142,Corporate event in the wine cellars,"The Stafford has what are meant to be the oldest wine cellars in London.  Taking a rather strange and none too pretty route through the hotel, you get to a set of domed rooms.  Wrought iron gates guard some of the wine, and there is one long room used for dining purposes.  Just beyond this, there is another small area which has been set up as a WWII ""museum"", to reflect how the cellars were used by American and Canadian soldiers as both an air raid shelter - and a source of easy drinks.  Food quality was superb: service excellent.",5,2015,02,06
142,"Best in London, hands down","For quiet and calm, perfect but unobtrusive service and an all around sense that everything is right, there is no other hotel in London that comes close.  As close to the feeling of home that once can get while traveling.",5,2015,02,06
142,An Inclusive Club Atmosphere,It is  like having your own inclusive club in the center of London.  The staff are professional and caring and the facilities are world class with a unique touch of history and England that is charming and sophisticated.,5,2015,02,06
142,"Perfect for a short stay, attentive staff","We stayed one night at the Stafford Jan 1-2. The staff was very attentive. I received an email prior to our stay to confirm that we are travelling with a child and to ask if we needed additional accommodation. The hotel is in an older building, hallway is rather narrow especially having to push a small stroller but otherwise fine. We reserved a Jr. suite. It was not a big room, we would probably feel cramped for a  long stay but it was sufficient for a one night stay and it had a comfortable couch pullout for our 3 year old daughter. 

The room we were in was nicely updated (though the carpeting could use some additional updating) and clean. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was nicely updated and clean. The location was great, especially after finding out that there is a shortcut tunnel that would take us straight to Green park. The staff was very attentive, always helping us with our stroller. Overall we had a very lovely stay at the Stafford.",4,2015,02,02
142,Nice,"A nice traditional hotel on a great location. 

The service is attentive, the rooms functional and the overall experience very nice. 

It is not a high end luxury hotel but a very pleasant hotel with a warm and friendly staff. 

The rooms are small and the bathrooms could use a little updating. 

But overall quite nice. ",4,2015,01,31
142,Felt like Royalty,"My stay at the Stafford was awesome.  I travel internationally and normally stay at 4 and 5 start hotels (based on the hotel  being priced reasonably).  The Stafford has it all, and was 5 star and great value.  It is one of the best places I have ever stayed.    The staff was great, the bed was so comfortable, the location is excellent (only 200 meters to the subway),  close to shopping, great restaurants,  the theater district, Buckingham Palace.   The concierge was very helpful and booked our dinner reservations.    Upon departure the bellman walked me in the rain with my luggage to the subway.    If you have chance to stay at the Stafford, DO IT!",5,2015,01,27
142,Stafford Hotel,"Hidden away behind Green Park, the Stafford is like coming home. Personal, friendly, small, with the best concierge staff in London, There should not be any reason to look elsewhere. Walking to most important areas in London is easy. The American Bar is festooned with reminders of Football, Soccer, and The Stiff Upper Lip!",5,2015,01,27
142,We always stay at the Stafford,We always stay at the Stafford when in London. Never occurred to us to stay anywhere else. Never found a reason to stay anywhere else. Perfect location. Elegant accommodations Wonderful bar. Comfortable rooms. Great service.,5,2015,01,25
142,Utterly magical hotel experience,"My wife and I have stayed in some wonderful hotels over the years but never have we experienced anything like The Stafford. We had the best afternoon tea, ate the best ever breakfast, slept on the most comfortable bed, encountered the most friendly staff and enjoyed the best ever overall hotel experience of our lives.

Imagine that Downton Abbey had suites available to stay in, throw in fabulous food and relocate to Central London - that'll give you an idea about a stay in the Stafford.

If you are travelling to London and want THE quintessential British fine-dining and luxury hotel experience then I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Yards away from Green Park, walking distance from Soho, Theatreland and Covent Garden, it couldn't be better situated for visitors seeking the best that London can offer.",5,2015,01,24
142,Less is More,"This is a small hotel on a quiet cul-de-sac near Green Park.  The amenities are grand- the American Bar is a joy, the food is very good at Lyttleton's, the service is top notch and the rooms are fresh, spotless and spacious.  Good desk and internet and free soft drinks and coffee in the room.  In room dining should be this good everywhere- prompt, hot and delicious.  The location is perfect- loads to see and do within short walks.",4,2015,01,23
142,Exceptional quality & customer service,"Stayed at The Stafford three years ago and this time found the hotel had lost none of its charm, luxury and exceptional customer service.  We enjoyed an evening meal then breakfast and were bowled over by the attention to detail and service we received.  The quality and standard of the food is very good.  I had the crispy bacon, pancakes and maple syrup.  Delicious! The American Bar is   worth a look also.  The bedding and bed were of the highest standard and so comfortable, having our bedding turned down and slippers by the bed was lovely.  We felt really spoiled.  Without doubt would stay at this hotel again and again.  The very helpful and courteous staff is the icing on the cake and makes the hotel outstanding quality.  I've stayed in a few hotels around London and had never had such a great stay.",5,2015,01,20
142,A Secret to be held on to,"The American Bar here is one of the best in London.  Such a great atmosphere and always consistently good and great fun to spend a few hours in.  We love the ""All American"" theme here and you slways get tlaking to interesting people",5,2015,01,07
142,A cozy hotel to stay when alone in London and be pampered,"There were several people who could attend to you - all the concierges madean effort to help me and text and call me with updates. Oliver managed to get me a last minute tea reservation at Fortnum and Masons
A cozy room with great bedding.
A large range and many choices of food for breakfast, during the new years all day brunch - my favorite was their smooth delicious oat porridge which is hard to come by.
The  bar area that was cozy but the rule that one cannot eat at the bar especially since my friends were drinking there and I was hungry but they would not let me eat there seemed a bit silly and certainly turned off my visiting bar mates as they ordered their last Black Label.

My last supper... actually a late lunch - the Chefs set menu included a lobster bisque - quite tasty (a tad too much salt) a risotto with sweet peas and cheese - Bravo and an Endive, blue cheese and walnut salad was very yummy and complimented the end of a rich meal.",4,2015,01,07
142,Like a Second Home in London,"This is an outstanding hotel with an enthusiastic and very helpful staff.  Like some other people decribed, the first room they showed us was beautiful, but cold & the heat didn't seem to be working.  They moved us to a suite immediately, and sent up tea, fruit, and a bottle of champagne.   For the rest of our three night stay, everything was just about perfect  The location is ideal, right on Green Park & we walked everywhere from Westminster to Covent Garden.",5,2015,01,05
142,Warm and welcoming,"The Stafford has a wonderful location, on a small quiet street, tucked into a busy location in the center of London.  It is close to many bus lines and the Green Park tube station.  The rooms are attractive, the staff professional and friendly, the food excellent.  We keep coming back.",5,2015,01,04
142,Very nice!,"My cousin and I went to London this past September and we stayed at the Stafford. We had rooms in the Carriage House. We loved it!  The staff were amazing too. I highly recommend this hotel. 
I look forward to returning this upcoming March/April with my sister.",5,2015,01,03
142,What a difference a year makes.,"We really enjoyed our stay here last New Years Eve so booked again for this year.  I wish we did not as it really dampened our night.  We had stayed at the Penthouse last year which was lovely and warm with a contemporary style but this year were in a Master Suite in the classic style.  It was freezing when we entered and we turned it up (or so we thought) the heating dial and went down to the American Bar to be cosy and warm.  However it was quite busy and when we took a seat by the entrance we were ignored for ten minutes.  When I approached the bar for a food menu I was told we will get to you in a minute, a waiter then took a drink to another table and took menus from a passing empty table and threw them at us, he did not even offer a drink or a hello.  After waiting another ten minutes with no attention we decided to leave and eat outside of the hotel whereby we had to go out without coats in the cold.  When we got back to our room it was still cold so we called for help, an engineer came quickly and told us a coil was blocked and it would not be working!!!  He offered to bring two heaters but for over £1,000 per night we thought this was outrageous.  Luckily one other room was available and the manager agreed we could move.  However, this really ruined the ambiance and feel of the stay and when we got to the other room it was time to go out anyway.  It is very sad the hotel even contemplate putting people in cold rooms, the staff must know it is cold in there and a previous reviewer has commented on cold rooms.  Never again sadly.",2,2015,01,02
142,xmas,Lovely 5 days at Stafford over the Christmas period. good service and great atmosphere. Staff very helpful. American bar and breakfasts particularly good. Stayed in a beautiful suite. The position of the hotel in St James is excellent for shopping and many of the best sites in london.,5,2014,12,31
142,The Stafford is Top Notch,Fantastic Location -- Excellent Staff.  We have stayed multiple times and the experience has always been top-notch.  The rooms are well appointed and the Restaurant and American Bar are great.  Will definitely stay again.,5,2014,12,29
142,great great great,What a great stay in such a special hotel. Also the location is perfectly within minutes you can reach all down town. The guys at the entrance fantastic always with a smile. Reception staff great and not to forget the French connection in the Bar. Fantastic stay you have all made for me.,5,2014,12,29
142,Luxurious hotel,"A wonderful hotel in perfect location for both business, couples or family. Helpful and professional staff, top standard of the hotel especially recommended to you who prefer the traditional English style.",5,2014,12,26
142,stafford hotel review,"i like to travel in luxury, so i took the Carriage House Junior Suite, with breakfast. the room is located in a nice area but you don't get what you paid for, its not a suite, and its a bit overpriced for what it is. plus had to argue with them just to get the breakfast which i have already paid for. overall not worth it.",2,2014,12,25
142,London  -- No Worries,"A fabulous place to stay. I could settle in for days! Staff is very attentive, and prompt. Nothing is beyond them. Food at breakfast (only meal I had there) was terrific, and again the staff was totally accomodating",5,2014,12,24
142,MikeD,A charming small hotel in St James' near the Mayfair shops. Not a cheap hotel but you get what you pay for with a smile and efficiency. It's nice to be remembered when you stayed previously at the hotel.,5,2014,12,24
142,Great rooms and location,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary with a four-night stay here.  It's a great location, the rooms and service--particularly housekeeping-- leave nothing to be desired, and it's a comfortable, relaxing place to stay when in London on a busy schedule.",5,2014,12,21
142,Expensive treat for us,"Let me start by saying we are NOT rich! We both work and enjoy splashing out on treats for ourselves. We love luxury and don't mind paying for it but it must be good or we'd feel cheated. That said, we have stayed here twice now and love it. Yes, there are so e obnoxious, very rich guests who clearly have forgotten their manners or just weren't brought up to know that all people, whatever their station in life, are deserving of respect. Ignore them. You see them everywhere. 
I find the staff here the best we have found in London. Nothing is too much trouble and their training perfect as all are equally as good as each other. 
We love the American bar. Yes, it's stupidly expensive and it can be filled at certain times of the weekday with city types blowing stupid amounts on very expensive drinks. We saw one group of 6 young men pay a bill which would have paid for our whole week in the hotel without batting an eye. Irritating as this is, I find I enjoy it more when I don't worry about the bill and just have a good time. It's only once a year that we treat ourselves to this!
The breakfasts are amazing. I'm on a  daddy diet (gluten free, lactose free...). I'm not allergic to anything at all and love all food I'm just trying to be healthy. I tentatively mentioned it to see if there was anything they could do and they were brilliant? My porridge was made with lactose free milk and I was not made to feel like an annoying freak. 
I love the rooms. They're not huge, we stay in a deluxe King in the main building, but they are plenty big enough. The heating/air con is  great and the beds are the most comfortable of anywhere we have ever slept. 
So, yes it is expensive but I think it is worth it. When they say 'welcome home' at check-in it could be weird but I love it and I just wish I could afford to come more often.",5,2014,12,19
142,"Quirky, individual hotel in great location","Frankly, you will either love this or you won't. It's very much old style comfort tucked away in St James, quietly pricey and doesn't mind. I love it, it's my hotel of choice in London, but unusually this time around the service on reception, which is usually razor sharp, was a lacking the usual zip. However, you can walk pretty much anywhere from here, and once you know the alleyway through to Green Park, the tube is only five minutes. An oasis of calm.",4,2014,12,17
142,Business Stay for US Clients & myself,"Attentive staff service with good attention to detail and very convenient location, facilities for dining and meeting are of a high standard.  I am appreciative of all of the efforts made and value my relationship with this hotel for my business and leisure needs",5,2014,12,17
142,"Excellent Stay, quiet, quintisentially English","The hotel is extremely well located, has unique amenities like an outdoor seating area for drinks, and a beautiful bar and restaurant.  The rooms are cozy, and charming.  It has not been done up like other hotels in the ubiquitious 'international' style, which is pretty boring...The Stafford remains unapologetically British, and we loved every minute of our stay there.",5,2014,12,17
142,Cold night in the city,"I am usually a generous rater of hotels on Tripadvisor but the Stafford did not live up to my expectations.  We stayed in a deluxe king room and all I can say is what size are the classic rooms as there was not much room in ours.  We found the heating to be poor and spent a very cold night huddled under the blankets.

The breakfast was not as good as I would have expected, the tea was made with very fine leaves which were so small the went through the sieve and ended up in our cup so we sent it back, they got our order wrong and the cooked food was barely warm.

Having said that the American bar is a great spot that we will use often in future and the location of the hotel is extremely convenient and central.",3,2014,12,16
142,It’s a proper London Club without having to be a member,"The American Bar. This is a great find down a hidden mews road, if you are out and about in the West End and looking for a different but really lovely place for an afternoon tea, a gin and tonic or a serious cuban cigar.

The walls and ceilings are just full of history of the many and varied faces that have been into the bar over the last 30 or so years. 

Great service and thoroughly recommended.",5,2014,12,15
142,Excellent Hotel,"An excellent hotel although a bit pricey.  Great location, great service, excellent staff.  rather quaint, with each room unique.  Tucked away behind typical London Lanes, so perhaps best to not drive there.  Fitness Centre could use additional equipment.  Will definitely return.",5,2014,12,13
142,Where foodies stay when in London,"Forget The Ritz and Connaught  this is where you stay when in London, during the war it was the American Army Officers Club, it is central to everything and the staff are all very lovely, with a pleasant smile and great you by name, the rooms are superb for London where the rooms in other high class hotels are sometimes not very grand, the restaurant is fabulous and very French. But it is in the the ""American Bar"" where they excel, it is sooooo friendly and  the barmen have been there for ever, we were fortunate enough to meet Charles the old barman who has since past away and I think has been replaced by his brother, it is the kind of place that had a pet cat called whisky, ( my wife adored that cat as she went on her own one time and the cat kept her company) but female foodies can stay on their own and no one will try to hit on you in the bar, one time we were going out and the manager come running after us to say "" you might need these umbrellas as it looks like rain"" I mean how cool is that  he was not the doorman he was the manager, you feel as if you are staying in someones home which to me is the height of hospitality I think it is one of the best hotels in the entire world. Quite often I see hotel reviews and the go on about the most stupid things that don't matter, "" The Stafford"" have got all of the real stuff that sticks in your mind forever",5,2014,12,11
142,The perfect London stay,"Our second stay in this delightful hotel.  It is such a joy to be a guest.  The decor is beautiful and the effort put into making Christmas such an event has obviously been enormous.  Everything about this hotel is gracious and discreet and the staff just want to make your stay special.  The location is hard to beat with such easy access to St James' and the West End without being on the main streets.  It has the feeling of a private club.  The much talked about American Bar is fabulous with such memorabilia on display that it will challenge any aviator, sports fan or star struck person to have enough time to see all - a good excuse to return!  The wine cellars are much talked about and a visit is on the list for our next visit.  Treat yourself and I think you'll end up returning.",5,2014,12,09
142,Just like home,"We stayed at The Stafford for the third time in two years last month and again found it unbeatable. It really is a home-from-home. Their well-stocked American Bar is a pleasant refuge from the delights of London but it can be very noisy at busy times, particularly with the higher volume that their American patrons choose for discourse so as to to ensure their being heard.",4,2014,12,08
142,Hidden 5 star luxury in a quiet corner of London,"I recently attended a small corporate event with lunch and wine tasting by one of the world's top sommeliers at this beautiful hotel.  It's tucked away in a quiet part of St James's  but is extremely smart and luxurious - a true hidden gem.  Gino, the Sommelier provided a wonderful insight into the world of wines and the food was delicious and well presented with fabulous service, all served in 300 year old working wine cellars.
Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2014,12,08
142,Quiet Luxury,"For something totally different, as Monty Python would say, try the Stafford Hotel in London. It's at the West End, near Green Park and the Green Park Tube. It is part of the Kempinski Grand Luxury collection -- and it lives up to its name. There are rooms in the main hotel, a carriage house and the Mews. 
Its wine cellar is worth a Michelin detour. It is almost 400 years old. Allegedly it was once a passage from the Royal Palace (before Buckingham) for the King to 'sneak' out for his illicit rendezvous. 
Finally it has a bar named, The American Bar. This dates back to WWII when many American and Canadian officers were billeted in the Stafford. There is memorabilia plastered on the walls and ceilings. Even if you don't stay at the Stafford, it is worthwhile to go to the American Bar for a drink and to soak in the history. 
There are more expensive hotels in London, but none that will treat you better Enjoy.",5,2014,12,06
142,a delightful small hotel in St. James,"We have stayed at The Stafford many times over the past 30 years; but stopped going in the mid 1990's when the previous owners 'Cunard' sold out. The general hotel & service declined.
We stayed in November this year under new management and found to our delight that it is back to its old standard of excellent and attentive service. The bedroom was comfortable and Edwardian in style; the food is good, although we did not have a dinner there. The location could not be better; and the concierge and reception were excellent.
A lovely hotel in the West End.",5,2014,12,03
142,Very good - yet again,"We have stayed at the Stafford several times before. It is a very good hotel in a perfect location. Breakfast was very good and service - while not quite to the standard of previous visits, was nevertheless still of a high standard. Our room this time was comfortable but a little small.",4,2014,12,02
142,Very good hotel but could be better,"I travelled on business and tend to stay in the hotel around the area in general. Normally I stay in the one round the corner but they were full so I gave Stafford a try. It's a very good hotel, absolutely no doubt about it. The room is great, breakfast was good. But compare to those near by there r rooms to improve. The thing I got very annoyed is that after the first night I got a wrong welcome letter in my room. It's a bit annoying when u have the 2nd welcome letter with the wrong name and I was worried that is there sth wrong with the computer system and they gave my room to other. I handed it back to the reception and it was just a standard apologize and that was it...and once I asked for an umbrella... they gave me one...which is from the hotel round the corner. All these r pretty minor things but really didn't expect this from a great hotel like this....",4,2014,12,01
142,Five star service at five star prices.,"As with most things in life you get what you pay for. The Stafford is an absolutely top notch establishment with smooth, elegant service and where nothing it seems is too much trouble. Of course this does all come with a relatively hefty price tag but given the setting, the service and the luxury it is undoubtedly a price worth paying.",5,2014,11,27
142,Fabulous Lunch,"Lunch could hardly get better than this. 

From the moment you walk through the door, the overwhelming feeling is one of homely quality. The surroundings are delightful, the staff very well presented and extremely helpful whilst the entire place oozes quality.
Lunch comprises 3 courses each of which was delicious. Wines were expertly presented by the resident Sommelier whilst the waiting staff set standards many other restaurants should follow. 
A truly memorable experience.",5,2014,11,26
142,The Best Hotel in London,"I have stayed at this hotel over many years on business and pleasure .After a period of time when the hotel lost direction  it has more than made up ground under the new management. Once again it is a pleasure to stay at this hotel --you can overlook the size of the bedrooms ,which are on the small size , against the excellence of the staff .My only gripe is that the meals served in the bar are not particularly imaginative or even particularly well cooked. For me this is an area that needs attention.

But overall I can't think of a more pleasant place to stay in the West End of London.",4,2014,11,25
142,"Terrific location, service and staff. Eat breakfast there.","We were there in July 2014, during a heat wave! 

First, if you're coming from Heathrow, don't bother with a cab. It is much faster to take the tube and get off at Green Park. From there, the hotel is just down the path in the park, and through an old stone tunnel. 

The location is terrific -- just down the park from Buckingham Palace, and within walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions. Alternatively, as mentioned, the Green Park tube station is a 2 minute walk away. 

Upon arrival, the staff was terrific, very professional and accommodating. 
I was travelling with my college aged son, so we had a room with two twin beds, and it was very comfy, with all amenities as in the photos. The room was quiet, the comforters were puffy, and the twin bed was plenty roomy, even for my son who is about 6 feet tall. The decor was very British traditional, with toile and historic prints. The air conditioning was a relief, and the hotel stayed nice and cool. The only issue was a minor plumbing matter (water wouldn't shut off), which was fixed immediately and quietly. Took maybe 5 minutes. Fresh fruit, wine and beverages were provided gratis, which was much appreciated.  

Breakfast was everything you could want in an English breakfast. The dining room was elegant and casual, and I was glad to see no particular dress code -- kids were in shorts, and business people in suits. Very comfortable. Dinner was also very good, although the restaurant was almost empty when we were there at dinner time. The food is extremely well prepared, modern with traditional touches, and service was exceptional. It seems like there were about 5-6 courses, including salmon mouse, various sorbet, and breads. The wine list provided a variety of wines by the glass.

The bar and outdoor area are also nice, although beware:  refills are not free for soft drinks (recognizing that's a US thing, but this was about $20 into sodas). Grill food was great, in a nice patio setting.  

Many thanks to the staff, terrific all the way around.",5,2014,11,20
142,Winter Spices Afternoon Tea,"Spent a decadent afternoon here with my daughter feasting on the newly launched Winter Spices Afternoon Tea. Petit gourmet sandwiches, scones with the traditional clotted cream and preserves (a favourite of mine)  and sweet treats to die for including a divine Christmas pudding cheesecake and mango eclair!  The chai tea perfect with it!    Excellent service and set in elegant old world surroundings. A wonderful experience........",5,2014,11,15
142,Afternoon tea,"Met a long lost friend here for tea on Friday, really quite delightful, friendly and welcoming staff,pleasant surroundings and a yummy tea whilst listening to a talented harpist. Easy to find on the edge of Green Park.",4,2014,11,11
142,Terrrific,"We recently stayed at the Stafford London.  We expected good service and they exceeded our expectations on all counts.

The front desk staff and concierge could not have been nicer and more helpful.

The room was terrific with a great bed and was very quiet.

The restaurant was excellent both for dinner and breakfast.  The service was attentive and welcoming.

And if you don't visit the historic American Bar you are cheating yourself.  The bar food is excellent, as are the cocktails and service.

You can't go wrong here.  We will be back.

thanks",5,2014,11,10
142,Deserving of its great reputation.,"This is one of the best hotels in London and deserves the reputation.  I stayed while it was still a Kempinski hotel, so I don't know if there have been any changes since it has gone independent.  Great service, the concierge service is as good as it gets, and very helpful and pleasant staff.  Restaurant was wonderful.
I had a standard room, which was small and rather cluttered.  I asked for a number of knick knacks to be removed so that I could have room for my laptop and other stuff.  I'm not sure they had though that through.  Other larger rooms I saw looked great.  
Downside: this hotel is not for travelers on a budget, even a generous budget, so be prepared to part with some £. If you can afford it, it's worth it.",5,2014,11,04
142,disappointed not any more the same since Kempinski left,"It was my favorite place in London, all changed since the management changed it is a totally different place doesn't feel at home anymore and it is such a pity.
Very few of the old staff that was perfect stayed, the rooms are still great and the hotel beautiful.",3,2014,11,04
142,Beyond Expectation,"What a pleasant surprise this gem tucked in to the St. James are turned out to be.  The hotel was suggested by an American Express travel agent and we can't thank him enough.  The staff was perfect and the room was fantastic.  We had a suite with a large living room, bedroom and bath.  

We were always warmly greeted by the staff and they provided the perfect London experience. Very formal, as you would expect, but not the least bit snooty. The bellmen, concierge, and front desk personnel were all first rate.

The location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping, dining, theater, etc.   I can't imagine staying anywhere else.  The included breakfast is great and you can't beat the American Bar at the rear of the first floor.",5,2014,11,03
142,A Gem,"Straight from the start you know that you have come to a hidden gem. The outside is as pristine as the inside. Wonderful welcome, room above expectation. We had a meal in the bar,the waiter went the extra mile. The glass of chardonnay was superb, good start as we had a long day. My fish and chips were the best i had for ages, double fried chips with a fish in light crispy batter. Heaven on earth, all hotels should be like this. ",5,2014,11,01
142,Great position,The Stafford London has an excellent position in London . Close to the Green park railway station. And many restaurants and pubs .Walking distance to Westminster Abbey and London Eye . The room was excellent . The bed was comfortable and the room was a good size. The staff was excellent .,5,2014,11,01
142,Wouldn't Stay Anywhere Else in London,"A return visit was everything as we expected  and more...room was lovely, front desk and concierge team amazing and all within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to be. Highly recommended if you want comfort and understated elegance.",5,2014,10,20
142,"Great staff, good location, decor could be updated...","I have stayed here before. Great staff, centrally located, but the decor is really dated. All needs a redo. Not cheap.
Near many of the major museums, bond street shopping, art galleries and auciton houses, really good for business traveller, not very quaint. Nothing special, just an old reliable.",4,2014,10,18
142,Slept like a baby.,Beautiful English style boutique hotel in a great location.  Staff very attentive.  Loved the bar and courtyard for relaxing after a day of touring.  I have to say that the bed was the best I have ever slept in.  So comfortable and cozy from the mattress to the bedding.  Definitely would stay here again.,5,2014,10,15
142,My Home in London,"As usual The Staford lived up to my expectations. This is my 8th stay at the hotel and I would not consider staying anywhere else. The Staff is pleasant and efficient and my junior suite was lovely.
My favorite part of the hotel is the American Bar which I have been frequenting since I was in college! I have stayed at most of the 5 star hotels in London and the Stafford is by far the best located and still retains its English country house feel. Please don't change anything.",5,2014,10,14
142,Classic hotel in central London,"Beautiful hotel, totally renovated without losing its typical British charm.  Great bar, excellent breakfast, prime location.  Service, though, is what sets it apart -- staff could not be more friendly or helpful.  Expensive but worth it.",5,2014,10,13
142,The Best Hotel We Have Stayed in Years,"Everything about our stay at the Stafford Hotel in London was perfect.  Lovely room, beautiful surroundings, outstanding staff and  the American Bar is great fun for eating or after dinner theatre. We loved our last trip to London because the Stafford Hotel staff made it so perfect.",5,2014,10,10
142,Gracious hospitality personified ,This British Classic is comfortable to the core. We stopped here for cocktails before heading out to dinner. The bar area was lively but jammed so we were shown a table in the courtyard. Plenty of nibbles and a lovely soothing atmosphere. This is a venue that really knows how to care for its guests!,5,2014,10,10
142,Another Wonderful Return,"Once again we returned to The Stafford, our home-away-from-home in London.  it was as wonderful as ever!   Excellent location, lovely room and wonderful food.  The staff is excellent, seeing to your every need.  Frank Laino, the Concierge, is the best!!  Cannot wait to go back.",5,2014,10,03
142,The best boutique hotel experience ever.,"Fantastic location and fantastic service! A truly unique boutique hotel with 10-star team. We travel quite a lot, and this hotel by far has exceeded our expectations on service on all aspects! 
Everyone from a doorman to front desk agent were fantastic right from the start! We haven't even stepped on the hotel premises yet, but we felt we were being taken care of: we arrived in a cab and the cab driver had a trouble with his credit card machine, so the transaction wasn't coming through (we had no UK cash yet, as we came from overseas straight to the hotel) - the doorman reacted immediately, they paid our cab-bill without being asked to do so, and simply posted the transaction to our room! Saved us time and stress! This is when you know you are in a truly wonderful place. Thumbs up!",5,2014,10,02
142,Stafford Hotel London,"Fantastic location, lovely atmosphere in the hotel and staff were very helpful & friendly. It has a really nice bar, which also does good food. Very close to all the major tourist attractions. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,02
142,"The perfect, intimate boutique hotel in London","Prior to our arrival, folks at the Stafford made us feel welcome and appreciated by obtaining for us tickets and making arrangements for us to visit the Palace and Parliament, see a show and so forth.  Upon arrival we had immediate access to our large, king-bed room.  We enjoyed daily breakfast  and had a truly memorable dinner at the hotel.  A highlight was discussing the wine selection for dinner with their sommelier and then having him escort us on a tour of their extensive wine cellars.  It is very conveniently located without being directly in the mainstream of traffic and noise.",5,2014,09,25
142,Super Location in London,"Many months ago we bid on Luxury Link and opted for a Buy it Now option to assure our
timing would mesh with the end of a Silversea cruise which ended in Southampton. We thought
The Stafford package was quite good, and the location exactly what we were looking for. We
were not disappointed when we finally arrived on 9 Sept. The Kempinski Corporation's hotel,
our first Kempenski experience, was in a great location and provided all the amenities and
service we expected.. Our package included a 3 course lunch in addition to full English
breakfast each morning. We like to walk, so our St. James location allowed our walking most
of our 3 days in the city. We only relied on the ""Tube"" one time, when we were ""pooped"".
Our suite was very comfortable, and our overall satisfaction level for our three day stay was
very high. We highly recommend The Stafford , especially the American Bar, which is a
unique enclave which pays homage to many past Anglo-American mutual good times.
We would definitely stay there again!",5,2014,09,22
142,Excellent location and service,"We've just come back from a trip to England.  We chose to stay at the Stafford for its excellent location. It is in the St. James' district with Buckingham Palace a few minutes walk by the way of Green Park.  Piccadilly is a few short blocks down St. James St , and the tube is 3 minutes away.
It is formerly the Victorian home of a lord and his lady – boasts quintessentially English style. We received excellent service everywhere we went within the hotel.  Lyttelton Restaurant for high tea was great.  We had lunch at the American Bar while we were waiting for our room to be ready after our transatlantic flight.  Rooms are small, as most European hotels based in old building, but they are well equipped with free WiFi, flat-screen TVs, and top-of-the-range Bose sound systems. Other perks include Nespresso machines, welcome amenities, and free soft drinks. Modern comforts include walk in showers and laundry facilities. 

Make sure to use the concierge for advice on near by restaurants, and excellent.

All in all, a wonderful experience, which we will be sure to repeat.",5,2014,09,22
142,Wonderful Oasis in the Heart of the City,"We have just returned from a stay in London. Located on quiet St James Place, just off St James Street, The Stafford is the ideal starting point to enjoy all that London has to offer. Leaving the front entrance, there is a short cut into Green Park and the tube. Going out through the American Bar puts you within a two minute walk of Picadilly. It's an easy walk to Buckingham Palace, so you can can check in with the Queen. The hotel itself is very comfortable, and we found the staff very helpful and friendly. Afternoon tea after a long day was delightful and the American Bar is really fun. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,09,16
142,Not a great stay!,"Was very excited to be staying at this beautiful old world hotel. Front desk service ok, but food & beverage staff pretty ordinary. Towels were very poor quality and I would have complained but staff were quite unapproachable. Rooms pretty small, but I guess that is what happens staying at an older hotel. Not my next place of stay in London!!",2,2014,09,13
142,A Total Joy,"Always go for a visit. Usually just a glass of wine in the American Bar but I've been going 
since my honeymoon in 1978. It is gracious, friendly and always civilized. Staff is stellar and
wonderfully British in the best of the word. Location is amazing with an entrance off St. James
Park and another from Saville Row. 
My favorite story of this hotel comes from my honeymoon. We came out of the door in the early 
afternoon and the doorman greeted with us a merry; ""Good morning."" I pointed out that it was past
noon. His response was ; ""That may well be sir but this is the 1st time I have seen you.....today.""",5,2014,09,08
142,Oustanding Service and Accomodations,"I can honestly say that my stay at The Stafford London exceeded all of my expectations.  The hotel is located in a wonderful location, close to Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace, and the Royal Parks.  The customer service we received was simply outstanding.  We were greeted warmly every time we encountered the hotel staff, they were ready and willing to assist us with anything we needed.  Our room was beautifully appointed and again, exceeded our expectations.  Our stay at The Stafford was our final stop on our 2 week tour of the British Isles and we definitely saved the best for last!  Thank you to the Stafford for making our stay in London wonderful!",5,2014,09,07
142,Understated Luxury,"This is a lovely old hotel, tucked away on a side street. The location is excellent--Piccadilly Circus is just a few minutes away, a short walk through Green Park takes you to Buckingham Palace and Knightsbridge is a short Underground journey from the Green Park Station (Hint: buy the zone 1 to 6 day ticket at Heathrow--it's a bargain at eight pounds)--and yet the hotel is an oasis of peace and quiet. The bed was wonderfully comfortable (and we did not have to pay for a single bed to be added to the room). I cannot fault the service. My one peeve was that the wifi was not very reliable. The signal dropped if more than one of us tried to get online. That apart, it was a memorable stay. A very traditional London hotel--so make sure that's what you're looking for.",5,2014,09,02
142,Stay at your own peril,"The first room my adult son and I were given was dangerous as there were stairs leading up to a landing and a tiny bathroom.  It was also too small to allow two adults to move around in comfortably.  In the middle of the night, in the dark, I flew off the landing and bruised my shoulder and knees.  Luckily, nothing was broken.  So we were given a regular-sized room with no stairs and a regular-sized bathroom.  At this hotel, the regular-sized room was considered an upgrade but in North America, this would have been a standard room.  

Two days later, my son was sitting on the front stairs of this tiny hotel trying to make a long distance call to his girlfriend back home in Canada at one o'clock in the morning.  Security at the hotel ordered him off the stairs in case patrons came in and out of the hotel.  At that time, there was no one present but my son and he would have gladly moved if he had been in the way.  The next day, the security man argued with me about his decision and no apology was given to my son.

If you choose this hotel, avoid choosing the breakfast as they charge $100 US for two persons each morning.  Instead, we found a wonderful Italian cafe close by which sold fruit cups, juice, yoghurt, sandwiches and cappuccinos for less than $20 for two.",2,2014,09,01
142,Tucked away,"We absolutely adored The Stafford.  It is tucked away on a quiet street and just steps from the hustle and bustle of busy streets.  We found the staff to be very warm and accommodating.  Our room and bathroom were a bit small but were beautifully appointed. The bed was so comfortable that we found it hard to get up in the mornings.  We enjoyed a delicious breakfast every morning and afternoon tea, as well.  The American Bar is cozy and a great place to unwind at the end of the day with a small courtyard outside to enjoy when the weather is nice.  It is a delightful hotel that invites you to relax...that is exactly what we want after a busy day of sightseeing.",5,2014,08,30
142,Anniversary surprise,"Was treated to a stay here by my husband. We were in awe of the beauty and level of service at this hotel. A real gem in the centre of London and a stones throw from harrods..
Would recommend to anyone",5,2014,08,28
142,Good location and quite traditional,"If you're looking to be close to Buckingham Palace, some luxury shopping and Piccadilly Circle the location is perfect. The Stafford is in a quiet side street, almost hidden so the rooms are quiet (and it also take some time to get a taxi since they don't park around the corner or pass by). The hotel is in several old connected buildings that almost gives it a feeling of a B&B. If you like traditional and don't mind winding stairs and very squeaky wooden floors, you'll find this very charming. If you're into modern large rooms, this is not for you. The bathrooms are particularly small. The beds on the other hand are terrific. There's a nice court yard outside seating area - a great treat in the middle of the city. The restaurant is quite traditional and the bar offers standard bar food. The service was ""understated"".  Very old fashioned everything. For this price I will go somewhere else the next time I'll be in London, not my style.",4,2014,08,24
142,It's ok....but only ok,It's in a great location if you have business in the StJames area. Rooms are small but this is the norm for London. Service is lacking. Check out took forever. Service at breakfast just plain bad. Bathroom was very small and water took a long time to heat up.,3,2014,08,22
142,Lunch,"Met an old friend for a light lunch at the Stafford , and what a wonderful experience it was , sat outside in the courtyard which is very pretty , and for central london very tranquil the three of us chose from the light bite menu I had the crab cakes which were very tasty and I think some of the best chips i have eaten, my wife had the Caesar chicken salad she said it was very good we .ordered wine by the glass it may have been better to have had a bottle . We were not rushed and sat there for three hours , the staff were charming and very attentive it was a very enjoyable afternoon, we will go back for a special occasion it was quite quite expensive but well worth the money",5,2014,08,12
142,Perfect,"We had a terrific stay in this Classic London hotel. The room was great ( we were in the mews rooms) and breakfast delicious. What really makes this place though is the people who look after you. Of particular note are Peter, a long standing member of the concierge team who is the personification of warmth and care and his team including James and Charlie.  Nothing is too much trouble and delivery is done with style and old fashioned courtesy and style. The reception team too was warm, friendly and very accommodating.   This has to be one of the best hotels around. We cannot wait to go back.",5,2014,08,04
142,Lovely bar,"If you are looking for somewhere for a quiet  relaxing drink , away from the crowds this could be for you.
We took some friends for a pre lunch drink on a Sunday . 
It's fascinating inside the bar with lots of memorabilia covering the walls and ceiling . 
Outside the converted stables are tables and chairs overlooking a small cobbles street with beautiful hanging baskets.
Service, as you would expect at this hotel is excellent .
Don't expect a cheap pint here. It's a little expensive but a nice place for a one off drink and chill.

",4,2014,08,03
142,Great things do come in small packages,"Our first trip to London, first stay at the Stafford. It is a small boutique hotel, on a rather out of the way street in London, but walk 2 blocks and you are in the middle of the London scene. The rooms are a bit small, but the service is exemplary.  Everyone on staff was gracious and helpful.  Our bedding was luxurious, the bath's were sparkling clean and well stocked. 
We did notice that the public spaces in the hotel were not air conditioned but our room was quite comfortable.(typical of many London businesses) We did use ""the Alley"" to get to Picadilly and  it was a great way to get to the heart of tourist London.We were within quarter mile of Picadilly Circus, theater district, Buckingham Palace,and Hyde Park.This also a good hotel if you like to shop as we found many places to practice retail therapy. We had afternoon tea which was everything we had hoped for, Breakfast twice in the hotel was quite pleasant and offered the only good cup of coffee to be found during our stay. Concierge service was the best ever. They arranged dinner reservations, limo service and taxi service for  us. without a hitch.All in all, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. .",5,2014,08,02
142,We loved it,"We were looking for a quiet pre cruise couple of days in London and The Stafford has it all.
Quiet location but central to everything.good food good sized bar. Very friendly staff with a great balance between approachable and efficient. We loved it.",5,2014,08,01
142,First-class experience,"My wife and I stayed at the Stafford for a holiday for seven days and nights in July.  Ambience was traditional and elegant, and the service was impeccable, provided courteously and promptly without fail.  It's always a pleasure being welcomed back by name at the end of the day. Our package included breakfast, which was superbly prepared; for example, a small silver jug of hot milk was brought to the table for coffee or tea.  The American Bar at the hotel was classy, we realized, because it didn't feature wall to wall television monitors or canned music as we are accustomed to in North America, and we appreciated the dress code.  Conversation is still valued in British pubs and bars.  Our Deluxe King room was satisfactory in size; a little tight moving around, but not unreasonably so, and above all elegantly appointed.  The hotel's location was superb as well, just a few steps to Green Park, St. James Park, the tube, and Piccadilly to the west and north, and a 15-minute or so walk to the National Gallery and Trafalgar Square to the east.  A first-class and memorable stay, all round.",5,2014,08,01
142,So nice to return to the Stafford,"It is almost a year since my last visit to The Stafford and sadly I was only able to stay overnight on this occasion en route from Paris. However The Stafford remains my first choice London Hotel. We received a wonderful ""welcome home"" when checking in and were extremely grateful for the suite upgrade. The hotel and service from its staff cannot be faulted and the introduction of coffee machine to the room since my last visit was most welcome. The hotel, rooms and particularly bathrooms are spotlessly clean and the beds must be the most comfortable that I have experienced anywhere. Excellent breakfasts. Delighted to return again.",5,2014,07,27
142,Tucked away luxury in the middle of it all…!,"Stayed for our second time at the Stafford for 4 nights last week.  We were welcomed back upon check in and shown to the Deluxe King room we booked.  It was spacious and bright (though not much of a view) but the bed was amazingly comfy and the AC worked - which is key in a rare London heat wave!  

Like other reviewers we chose the Stafford again for its location in central St James/Mayfair, in the middle of it all but tucked away, and the staff's attention to detail…not to mention the great American Bar, clearly a hotspot for locals as well in the warm summer months.  The Green Park access was also lovely for some lazy afternoons in the park & morning jogs.

Only complaint - the slamming doors each morning on our hall - perhaps a quieter closing mechanism?  They really do bang!

We will return again despite that - all in all a lovely hotel!",5,2014,07,21
142,Their restaurant,"We visited the hotel on Saturday evening as one of our friends had vouchers from Top table. A glass of very nice champagne and three courses for £60 per head. I must say I am not a fan of eating in hotel restaurants, but after this experience I certainly have changed my mind. We had a table for six in a private area of the restaurant shared with another table for two.. We all experienced superb service, wine and some of the finest food we have had for many, many years. The eventual bill with three bottles of champagne and two bottles of Rioja was £120 per head, but money we'll spent. 
The menu is not huge, probably six to eight choices per course. We will return.",5,2014,07,21
142,Superb,"Spent the weekend in London celebrating our anniversary and stayed Saturday night .........absolutely fantastic hotel ,friendly staff and superb atmosphere the American style bar is brilliant ....highly recommended,we will return.",5,2014,07,20
142,Excellent Hotel in great location!,"This a excellent hotel situated in a very good location next to Green Park and very upscale restaurants and shopping. The Staff is gracious and anxious to serve while display elegant class as they go about their jobs.
Rooms are good varying in size and size beds. Suggest you have clarity on the type of size bed when you book your accommodations to ensure your satisfaction. We had Room 217 overlooking the garden/Bar area. They have an excellent restaurant serving all meals and High Tea. The American bar is well known and is full service with both indoor and outside seating. The location at the end of an off street is quite and provides an escape from the London hustle. We will use this fine hotel on our future visits to London and highly recommend. ",5,2014,07,18
142,Most comfortable bed in all of England,"My husband wanted to stay near Green Park/Mayfair/St. James on this trip to London so I began looking for a 5 star property that wasn't ridiculous in price.  I booked my stay through the British Airways website and thought it was a very reasonable rate.  When we arrived in London, we walked briefly through Green Park and easily found the opening/pathway that lead us to the front door of the Stafford.  We were warmly welcomed by a lovely young man (I suspect he may have been Austrian, but not sure) who was very helpful.  He escorted us to an amazingly beautiful and cozy room which served as our home on our brief stay.  When my daughter and I thought we might be bumped from our BA flight a day later, her only request was that we book another night at the Stafford if we were staying longer than anticipated.

I can't say enough about the attentive, courteous, polished service we received throughout our stay as well as the comfort and elegance of the room.  It was filled with all kinds of treats & extras including a small shoe polish kit, an adorable Stafford rubber duckie, and yummy chocolates.  But it was the bed that remains foremost in my mind.  I am not exaggerating when I report that it was THE most comfortable bed that I have EVER slept in.  I felt like I was floating on a supportive cloud.  

I can't report on the restaurant as we did not have breakfast included in our rate so we did not venture to try it out.  Next time I book a room at the Stafford I will attempt to book it with breakfast.  The next morning my daughter and I needed to store a few bags with some very expensive purchases and we had no doubt that our valuables would be safely secured by hotel staff (and were politely assured by staff).  We were delighted we could explore London without having to worry about lugging our bags around or wondering about the security of our items.

My family and I are very picky about our hotels and I can happily report that I think we've finally found our home away from home while visiting London.  We can't wait to return to the Stafford.  I wish to personally thank the hotel manager as it was obvious to me this is a very well managed property and staff are happy and well trained.  Oh yes - and I was delighted to find that the wifi was free and quite fast.",5,2014,07,16
142,Don't look further,"What an amazing experience I had at the stafford!  This place is completely over the top and in the middles of everything you need.  Walk to most of the London tourist sites and a few blocks from the underground. 
I do not have enough superlatives for not only the hotel but the staff.  The rooms are impeccable. The staff is completely friendly, and trust the concierge with any food recommendation.
Stayed for three nights to see the Monty Python reunion and I could not have made a better choice.
If I were to have one suggestion -- the ""American Bar"" is a nice place for a few cocktails, but I wish it were a little less formal.
I will definitely be back my next trip",5,2014,07,13
142,How not to handle a problem,"I book 
Stafford in London by Kempinski some two weeks ago , I then travelled to Spain were I was informed by my bank that my credit card had been compromised and they would have to cancel my card 
Two days later I picked up a voice mail from the hotel to say my card had been cancelled I informed they by e mail of my problem, and offered to sully another card -- no reply 
I then go a e- mail to say my booking cancelled I then sent further e- mail and was told to speak to hotel direct this was the day before I was due to check in I explained everything and dispit me speaking to a manager I was told I could rebook same room but it was now 200 pounds more expensive . I declined that offer ---------- ibookedSt James's Hotel & club next door for half the price beakfast included and had a wonderful stay with a beautiful room and staff that went out of there way to be helpful .
If people are looking for a great hotel I this area I would highly recommend the St James's Hotel & Club and not the The Stafford",2,2014,07,12
142,A Hidden Gem,"The Stafford is regarded as one of the finest small hotels in the world. It has been rated so by many travel magazines, Fodors, and other travel guides.  The reviews are spot on, this is finest small hotel I have ever stayed in, it is near perfection.

The staff at the Stafford without exception show a gracious commitment to customer service. (special mention to one concierge Fernando) A small example, their free wi fi suffered an outage one day. Later that day we received a free bottle of champagne and a tray of petit fours as an apology for any inconvience. The housekeeping staff wrapped our tangled internet wires in white bows every day to keep them orderly. The hotel provided countless touches like this that one would never expect. 

This is perhaps the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. It is down a dead end street off of St. James just before it meets bustling Piccadilly. Quiet does not mean inconvenient. A hidden walkway across the street comes out in Green Park near the tube stop. 

The rooms are lush, the linens superb. We stayed in a Deluxe King, far from their most expensive, for eight days, and it was more the ample for our purposes. It had a small sitting area with a couch, chair and writing desk. The large king bed was among the most comfortable I have slept in. 

The Stafford's American Bar is world famous for good reason. It's walls are covered with momentos and pictures of famous guests, its ceiling partially covered with the baseball caps donated by its quests. It is small, intimate and discrete. 

Breakfasts are bountiful, offering a wide range of options from the usual full English to a wide range of eggs, kippers, smoke salmon, you could probably order anything and they would find a way to provide it. And an open bottle of Prosecco is always on the buffet table in case you want to start your day with a little bubbly. One major hint for travelers is to secure their weekend package which stretched to include free breakfast for our entire stay.",5,2014,07,11
142,Amazing hotel a spesially the fine dining restaurant,"Have recently visited Stafford hotels by Kempinski fine dining restaurant with a family friends and must say have visited a lot of good restaurants around the world and am surprised they don't have a Michelin star hope they will achieve it in the future because their chefs menu and the food was fabulous imaginative and the execution of dishes is excellent, flavors really makes your pallet work and experience something different all front of house seemed very professional and knowledgeable about foods and wines in overall was excellent experience if will be back in London in future will definitely visit again.
thank you to all hotels staff",5,2014,07,10
142,An alfresco oasis in St James,"I have stayed at the Stafford and eaten in the restaurant on a number of occasions over the past 15 years and always found the hotel's standards to be of the highest level.   However, the jewel in the crown of this establishment in my opinion is without doubt the American Bar run superbly by manager Ben and his top rate team.  The bar is accessed either through the main hotel entrance or via a very discrete alley directly off St Jame's Street opposite Fox's cigar shop.  Draught and bottled beer, cocktails and a very extensive (albeit expensive!) wine list are available and there is a wide selection of Havana cigars which can be smoked in the outside courtyard.   There is a good bar menu for 'light eating' and this can also be enjoyed in the courtyard if the sun is shining.",5,2014,07,07
142,The Stafford,"We have stayed at The Stafford in the past for it's central location and friendly, small hotel charm, On this occasion we spent five nights and were very disappointed by the indifferent service and repeated plumbing malfunctions where on two occasions our water went  off for ten or fifteen minutes in mid shower. With few exceptions staff appeared disinterested in the guests and focused on going about their routines. The breakfast buffet  at a greater price did not come up to the level of lesser European hotels we have visited. We concluded that their are better small hotels in London for future visits. Our daughter who joined us during our stay had the same reaction.",3,2014,07,01
142,Disappointing return,"This was our third visit to The Stafford and the first since the change in ownership. In the past, it has been one of our favorite places to stay, but in many ways, standards seemed to have slipped considerably. Although we were grateful to get into our room before the official check-in time, the room was hardly what one would expect from The Stafford. The bathroom wallpaper had holes in it (even with the poor lighting, these were visible), the towels were threadbare, the corners of the walls were badly scuffed, the Nespresso machine wasn't fully supplied... Had we not been so exhausted from transatlantic travel, we would have asked for a change. As well, the paper wasn't delivered as promised in the mornings, even after we mentioned it to the front desk. The public rooms are still beautiful, and the service was generally good, but given the hotel's reputation - and the room rates - we were very disappointed. I'm not sure we'll go back.",3,2014,06,29
142,Great location and service,"My husband and I stayed at the Stafford for four nights in June.  The location was great and the service was excellent.  We got to the hotel around 10 in the morning and were hoping to just leave our luggage so we could check in later, but they got our room ready for us within 20 minutes.  The doormen and concierge were very helpful and friendly.  Our room was a little worn, but still very nice.  The maid service was excellent and we really appreciated the complimentary minibar.  The hotel is conveniently located close to the Green Park tube station.  We enjoy walking and hoofed it to Westminster abbey/Houses of Parliament and many other locations.  It was pricey, but I would stay here again.",5,2014,06,24
142,Business or pleasure ? Come one come all.......,"Arriving in shorts and shirt at this pristine Hotel in mid summer heat did not at first allow me comfort as this well placed establishment is a perfect business meeting place, and i found myself surrounded by formal business attire! Despite this, the staff quickly put me at ease and treated me as if I were in full morning suit! I need not have worried as there was a good mix of casual visitors, but expect this type of mix if you visit but don't let it spoil your stay by any means. All staff excellent, and extremely attentive from Concierge to reception, bar, room and restaurant staff. 
Rooms beautiful and ours situated in the cobbled courtyard where we also enjoyed a light lunch and refreshments in a superb outdoor environment.
Stunning building, beautifully kept and bedecked with flowers throughout. 
On the expensive side, and seemingly a favoured hotel for North American visitors , perhaps the draw of Kempinski standards no doubt? 
All said and done - great experience highly recommended for a special occasion but you will need to save those pennies......",5,2014,06,23
142,June stay,"We decided to have three days in London and, having stayed at the Stafford for one night last year, decided to give the hotel an extended trial as we've been looking for an alternative to the Lanesborough which is closed for renovations. 

This hotel completely won us over, I doubt, even when renovations are finished, that we'll return to the Lanesborough. The Stafford is situated in a 'forgotten' part of St James, cabbies know it well, others struggle. This is a microcosm of old Royal London, a place where the hotel's cellars connect directly to St James Palace and rumours of the Queen Mother occasionally helping herself and leaving a note abound. There's an alley to cut through to Green Park and another that takes you directly to St James and Jermyn Street/Piccadilly a 200 yard walk that could be miles away so deeply ensconced in its own world is the hotel.

We were given a Courtyard room, a beautifully furnished and slightly larger space than a deluxe double in the main hotel. The rooms feature stable doors, a bed that requires a step ladder for those of smaller stature but which is, possibly, the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. My lady was impressed by the bathroom, everything was where it should be, everything worked properly and the amenities by Floris and others were 'welcome'. The locks on the front door to these rooms are electronic and, according to front desk, ""can be difficult"". A masterly understatement, in three days I only managed to open the door 3 times unaided. Fortunately staff were always to hand. This is a small five star and as a result the staff learn guests names very quickly and if you yearn for proper service then this is certainly a hotel for you. This is not a lip-service five star it is, in a world of wannabes, the real thing.

The restaurant is, like the hotel, small but perfectly formed, the food is very good and the service excellent, breakfasts are what one would expect of a hotel of this standard with a large choice. The Hotel's bar, The American Bar, is something of an institution and has to be seen with decorations donated by guests from all over the World (but particularly the US). On sunny days the Courtyard, which has tables, is available for drinks and excellent bar food - tip: for lunch pre-book your Courtyard table early or you will most likely be disappointed. For early evening drinks Courtyard tables are given on a first come, first served basis - early evening can be busy but the bar staff are fast, efficient and endeavour to ensure guests get what they want as soon as its available. If you fail to reserve a lunch table being a hotel resident will not get you a table any earlier than passing trade and in the early evening it makes no difference whatsoever.

Needless to say we will be visiting The Stafford again very soon, there is a very relaxing 'magic' to this hotel despite the fact that it is in the heart of the West End.",5,2014,06,14
142,Beautiful !,"Went for dinner here to meet my partners father for the first time, will lets just say The Stafford Food was a ice breaker. Food was beautiful every bite was amazing most of the food my pallet has never tasted before. I don't write review but this was a must. I will surely be back soon for amazing food, polite staff and wonderful atmosphere.",5,2014,06,01
142,"""Upscale and worth it""",Located in the St. James area of London.  Stayed in the newer part of the hotel which made the rooms more modern but would have preferred the older side to remind me more of Europe. Service it first rate and could not do enough for us.  This will certainly be my continued selection when in London.,5,2014,05,29
142,"Very nice upscale hotel, but unfortunate bathroom incident was unpleasant","The hotel is very nice and upscale, with superb service. The breakfast was very good (albeit expensive). The location is incredible, right next to St. James Park and within short walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Street, and Westminster Abbey. I would have absolutely no doubts about giving this hotel 5/5 stars, except for one unfortunate incident throughout the four nights of our stay. The toilet got clogged on the very first evening, and despite multiple attempts by the staff to fix it, they weren't able to get the water flowing properly. Flushing the toilet became an unpleasant repetitive task, which required 5-6 flushes to get everything down. The water pressure was simply insufficient and the staff didn't do anything to accommodate us.",4,2014,05,28
142,Nice property,"Pros:  Highly attentive staff, ranging throughout the organization.  There was never a misstep anywhere in the organization.  Doormen would walk a block to flag down taxis (would never happen in NY), servers in the bar were intimately familiar with various gin varietals and breakfast service was always quick and attentive.  Staff was uniformly exceptional.
Con: Although well appointed and maintained, some rooms are tiny.  We were in room 310, which has a 2-step rise to the bathroom.  While the change in levels was nice, I slid down the stairs while going through the closet - my fault, although it would have been less likely if the room was a tad larger.  This room was prettty tight for 2 people and 4 suitcases.  
The location is good, although I prefer something closer to the Thames (eg, Corinthia) and theater.  This location, however, is ideal for shopping.
I'd stay again (although I'd book a larger room).",4,2014,05,27
142,A true English experiende,"Stafford is located in the heart of London in St James'. Green Park and St James' Park are around the corner. The hotel would be great as the background of a Agatha Christie novel.
Grand father clocks, open fires and a delicios afternoon tea. You can choose between very traditional rooms or modern ones in the recently built annexe. The junior suites are located in the former mews house. The American bar serves excellent cocktails and you can also have something to eat even late. I feel that the Stafford is a real home away from home in London.",4,2014,05,27
142,A little gem in the heart of London,"I have stayed several times at the Stafford and it remains one of my favorite hotels in London. The location is exceptional. Hidden away in a little street, right behind the Ritz. A little alley connects to Green park and within three minutes I can take the tube. 
The staffis always exceptional and I appreciate the ""homw-away-from-home"" feel I get everytime I go. The Concierge has been there for ages and always has great recommendations. 
Yes, there are hotels in London with a more updated product. But the old-fashioned style of the rooms, the cozy bar and their restaurant always make me come back. 
Looking forward to my next trip.",4,2014,05,23
142,Exceptional,"Dined here for the first time and have to say what a stunning hotel the stafford is' truly blew me and my family away, the food was magnificent very well presented so detailed it was mind blowing at times.. I've dined at 1 stars and 2 stars and the stafford is truly exceeding Expectations in the michelin industry. Can not wait to dine again at the stafford hotel anticipating our return. ",5,2014,05,21
142,Very comfortable and beautifully located,"We stayed at the Stafford for two nights.  The service was impeccable as expected, and our room was very well appointed - comfortable bed and spacious marble bathroom. Tucked into a cul-de-sac, the hotel is superbly well located for getting around central London (St. James).  Fortunately our room rate included a full English breakfast, which otherwise would have been too expensive to enjoy (GBP 24 pp).  We had an excellent lunch in the dining room and enjoyed the proximity (and secret entrance) to Green Park.  This will definitely be our home base on our next trip to London.",5,2014,05,21
142,Wonderful truly British hotel,"After my 8th visit to this hotel gem in London, I once again need to tell everyone what a fabulous hotel The Stafford is. Beautiful rooms, fabulous service and the best bra in London!!  Fabulous location within easy walking distance to Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace, Green Park and Mayfair.",5,2014,05,16
142,American Bar,"Great venue for post work/ shopping drinks. Courtyard is lovely with stable doors that lead to guestrooms- staff are incredibly attentive, but not annoyingly so. Memorabilia on the walls is quirky and unending.",4,2014,05,16
142,Review of the Stafford London,"We love this hotel -very good location, rooms are lovely and breakfast in the restaurant is exceptional
Concierges are very helpful
Can walk around the corner to the main street which is Piccadilly where there are numerous small coffee shops and restaurants 
Taxis are easily accessible",4,2014,05,13
142,Another amazing stay,"This is a bit belated, but a necessary glowing review for our favorite hotel. We stayed at the Stafford in Dec 2013 for the second time in two years and once again we were blown away. I just love this hotel. The location is perfect, right in St James, and the staff goes above and beyond to make your stay there the best it can be. 

When we checked in they remembered we had stayed there before and welcomed us back. I really appreciate when hotels are aware of this. Our room was great, it was actually the same room I had stayed in when I was young, traveling with my family, so it was pretty special. All the rooms are well decorated, clean, comfortable beds, all amenities. On the small side, but totally normal for London. Since we were there around Christmas time, the hotel was decorated festively and just looked fantastic. The Christmas tree in the lobby was unbelievable. Since London really embraces the season with the Christmas markets and Hyde Park etc., to have that continue when you return to your room is perfect. 

Again, our favorite place to eat and grab a drink is the American Bar. Best burgers around. The staff also remembers what drink you order after only being there once so they make you feel so welcome. The atmosphere in there is cozy and unique. 

The staff, especially at the door, always talk to you (we got great advice on restaurants, sights, and directions to places). I was outside taking a picture of the front of the hotel and the guy came running out and asked if we wanted a picture of the two of us as well. He took our photo for us, what a nice gesture! 

I just really love this place. It has a special meaning for me since I used to come when I was a child, and if possible I think its gotten even better over the years. Everything about it makes your vacation truly special. I adore London and get equally excited to come back for the hotel as I do for the city.",5,2014,05,13
142,"Great location, clean rooms","We decided to stay here for a weekend before a hectic week of business in London.

Check in experience was average;nobody helped us with our luggage as we entered the hotel. Not picky but this is what we've experienced at other 5 star facilities, including the Kempinski group.

The local amenity for GHA Platinum members was tea or coffee. We had announced that we were running late for a dinner appointment at 19:30. It was delivered anyway at 19:25ish.... So sadly we didn't get to enjoy it.

The room was wonderful facing the inner courtyard. Very comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Internet also worked very well.. surprise considering that it is an old building.

We didn't have breakfast or dine here. Hence our interaction with thr staff was minimal.

The hotel is close to Green Park, which makes a great jogging location, as well as the Green Park tube station. We walked to Oxford street/regent street/ Leicester square from the hotel so if you don't mind the fresh air, this is the place to be. 

What disappointed us the most is that management hasn't bothered to respond to our feedback comments. Guess business is good so the Kempinski practice of getting back to its GHA members is ignored here.",3,2014,04,27
142,Anticipating a return,"I would choose to stay at the Stafford next time in London. Contrary to other luxury hotels that can be faceless, the Stafford is joyfully intimate and yet keeps the right distance. All staff are good. For the starter, they remembered name and room number, and every request, even tying a tie, was dealt with enthusiasm and none worked out underwhelmed. The atmosphere is very lovely as the hotel is housed in a former residence in St. James, the most exclusive and regal neighborhood in London. The intimate and personal service is one of a kind. Staying in the Stafford is like being a guest in true sense, as you will feel relaxed. If you feel bored, Jermyn street and the Ritz are ten-minute walk away.  
Breakfast is good. The tea is good. 
One minor issue: the hot water was not working right at first.",5,2014,04,23
142,Absolutely Beautiful,"We went to London to relax and enjoy the sights and sounds of London Town. We surely picked the right place to stay.  This is a luxury hotel at the top of its game. We stayed over Christmas and the carriage house was decked to the nines.  The food is superb, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.  My wife and I enjoyed ourselves tremendously.  We liked the fact that The Stafford is in central London, but it is hidden away- so you truly get the feeling of being in the country when you walk through the courtyard.  I would highly recommend THE STAFFORD!",5,2014,04,18
142,Great boutique hotel invery convenient position,"This is a small traditional boutique hotel. The hotel is really very good, well maintained and very clean. Lots of staff. Attracts an older clientele. Food good but expensive. Hotel accommodation is also expensive. . Plumbing an ongoing negative issue. The rooms are very well appointed. Great position and location. Close to busy tube station. Concierge alwaysommewhat snobbish. 

I would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,04,17
142,Excellent Hotel in Great Location,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business mid-week and found it to be a very good hotel right by St James' Park.

I didn't have too much interaction with the staff but what I did have was very good both at check-in and at breakfast (continental breakfast was fine but the choice wasn't astonishing) where the service was very good.

I also sat in the bar for a while which was pleasant and, again, service is very good although it was pretty pricey and it was very busy and I'm not sure whether the clientele were guests or just well-heeled locals - everyone seemed to be suited and booted.

I was also a little surprised at how many bar tables had 'reserved' signs on them. I didn't know people reserved tables in a hotel bar.

My room was excellent, decent size for a London room and well appointed - nothing I could complain about there.

The only thing that I can't comment on is the price as someone else picked up the tab for me but I suspect it's pricey based on where it is and that might be the only thing that might stop me staying there again.",4,2014,04,05
142,"Arrogant Management, small Rooms","Outstanding location but the intransigence and arrogance of the hotel management  ruins it. Mostly obnoxious yanks stay at this hotel. Stay away. Rooms are tiny, food mediocre, service is lousy and way, way over priced",1,2014,04,03
142,My favourite luxury hotel,"I can't fault this hotel (well only that they modernised the American bar so it lost its atmosphere. This bar has many memories for me.) I have been coming here for decades and it continues to be pure pleasure. It is small, superbly located, with personal attention from the staff and luxurious rooms (on the small side by international standards). I always have smoked haddock and poached egg for breakfast and this time was better than ever. I got a better room rate this time than the last occasion a couple of years back and for the standard of the hotel it really wasn't expensive. I was cautious about the ""Kempinski"" name which it has gained since I was last there but I needn't have worried.",5,2014,03,16
142,Unique and well positioned hotel,"We stayed here for the first time for four nights. We managed to find a price good price, wanted to try a different hotel and the reviews we read we're very positive.
We had a very pleasant and warm welcome, and during our stay the staff was very helpful and kind.
We were offered an upgrade from the kingsize room we reserved to the stable rooms and we were taken to room number 5, Copenhagen. The rooms in the yard were used as stables at the time and were converted into very nice specious hotel rooms. Our room was big and comfortable. It has high quality shampoo and soap etc. The room also has a complimentary mini bar with soft beverages. 
We did experienced few issues at the room. 
The rooms are in an open courtyard, were cars can access and close to the bar. This can be very noisy sometimes, during early morning (we were very annoyed by that...) and in the evenings. 
The second issue was the heating in the room. We were staying at a very nice weather, I'm not sure how the air-condition would be able to keep the room warm when it is cold outside. 
The third remark is that the wifi, although free, was poor and sometimes didn't work at all.
These issues aren't appropriate for a five star hotel.",4,2014,03,07
142,A Quaint Hotel near St James Palace/Ritz/Green Park!,"Stayed at the Stafford November last year. It is very centrally situated amongst old histoic buildings not far from St James Palace and the Ritz London, as well as the Green Park stop on the Underground. You can easily access London by cab or subway, or walking, like we did. It is not far from the busyness of Piccadily and the Regent/Oxford shopping area. The check in was very courteous, and we got a nice small (by US standards) long room with 2 beds and a step up to the bathroom! We had to rearrange the furniture so we can open up our luggage! If you put the 2 beds together it will be what is standard in the US for a King bed. The bathroom is nice with marble floors and an old fashioned tub, and very small shower space. The hot water is a premium if there are a lot of people using it at the same time. Be careful! The towel rack pipes are heated so don't touch or hold on to it for support-they are hot! Many an ignorant American (like us) have been burnt because of it. The toiletries are wonderful and the rubber duckie is adorable and can be taken home for a souvenir. The hotel is old, so we still used old fashioned keys that you surrender to the front desk whenever you leave. The hotel's strict security is good, but discourages you to bring friends or have visitors over to drink or party. The walls are thin and the hallway is very narrow-you can stretch your arms and touch opposite walls at the same time. The restaurant downstairs leads another access to the pub then the street which is at the courtyard of other different historic buildings. The building is beautiful and old fashioned and the interiors are regal and formal, as it befits the history of the building and the area where it stands. It would be incongruous if the interiors were boutique or contemporary. So if going back in time to merry olde England is your cup of tea, this hotel with its decor and central location will suit you just fine.",4,2014,02,24
142,Wonderful Small Hotel,"I spent three nights at the Stafford and I only have positive things to say.  The hotel is small, sort of ""hidden"" from the chaotic, busy and noisy life that is London, but conveniently located from major shops, attractions, pubs, restaurants and public transportation.  The staff were cordial and very professional.  The room was very comfortable, clean with a modern bathroom.  There were robes, slippers and hair dryer available in the room.  Free internet available as well.  Highly recommend it.",5,2014,02,22
142,"Very cosy, convenient with lots of charm","We only stayed for one night and did not eat there so it is difficult to give a comprehensive review. I would say that the staff were knowledgable and helpful and someone always available to assist. Our main complaint was there was no hot water early evening when we were trying to get ready to go out...it was fine the next morning so whether the system was unable to cope....? Also be prepared to be awoken by your neighbour's door. The rooms appear to be very close together so someone exiting their room and not being careful with the door sends reverberations into your room.
That being said the room was very well appointed and the bed was really comfortable. Would definitely stay again if in that part of the city.",4,2014,02,21
142,Absolutely Devine,"Top drawer service from everyone! We ate dinner in their restuarant, the food was exquisite with variety across the seasonal menu, beef carpaccio and rabbit Wellington topped of with the passion fruit parfait. Beautifully decorate throughout, not cheap but worth the money!",5,2014,02,19
142,Stunning hotel,"A beautiful hotel when visiting London. We stayed for a week. Had a warm welcome and were shown to our rooms which were beautiful. Although the rooms were not very large, they contained everything that was needed....slippers, dressing gowns, toiletries, etc. we all slept very well.
Breakfast was lovely. A great selection of fresh fruit, cereals, breads along with champagne and freshly cooked food. Service was fantastic!
The location of the hotel is great for many parts of London along with underground stations.
Will love to come back again!",5,2014,02,16
142,"Charming, convenient luxury",Have stayed at The Stafford twice and have booked again in April.  This is a wonderful upscale St. James Hotel with a very helpful staff and great location.  Not inexpensive but just a lovely experience.  Plus you get to keep the rubber duck that's in the bathroom.,5,2014,02,03
142,Perfect London Stay,"My Family and I used to live in London and had an apartment in nearby Mayfair, so we know London well and the hotels in this area. This was the first time we tried the Stafford, as we normally stay at the Berkeley, but we didn't care for it the last time we stayed there. It was too noisy and the crowd was not ours. My Mother wanted to try the Stafford and we booked a one bedroom suite in the new building. When we arrived in the evening after a day flight on BA from the States, they had upgraded us to the penthouse suite. Which was fabulous and a good move by hotel staff as now we're spoilt and must stay there next time in London. The penthouse has a beautiful bedroom, one and half baths, a roof terrace, office and living room. It was also very quiet, with a separate entrance which we really liked. The evening we arrived we had some sandwiches and wine at the American Bar, very relaxing, and good service. We really enjoyed our long weekend and I can't say anything negative about it. It is close to everything, with easy access to Green Park, but extremely quiet and tucked away. We will return!",5,2014,02,02
142,Cosy & Central,"Very enjoyable stay. Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. 

This is the second time we've stayed at a Kempinski hotel & both have had 1st class lobby service. I'm not usually one for sitting around hotel lobbies but the ambience, staff and service were wonderful. 

The room was very small and there were no tea/coffee making facilities but it was comfortable and nicely decorated. 

I didn't like that they added £11 a day service charge which I didn't pay as I like to decide who I tip as I'm already paying top dollar for service in a 5 star hotel.",5,2014,01,27
142,Nicely understated,"As always the Stafford and all the staff provide a comfortable and relaxed place to stay whenever we are in London. Good service, as you would expect. Good food, as you would expect. No need to go anywhere else.",5,2014,01,17
142,Quiet an Elegant Oasis in St James,I stayed at the Stafford for two nights on business in December.  What I really liked was the quiet but convenient  location in Central London. The rooms are a little on the small side but are well appointed.  Food is excellent and the staff helpful. ,5,2014,01,16
142,"Great service, otherwise decent","Stayed here for three nights part of the family. The service in the hotel is excellent as it should be for a 5 star hotel. Very good concierge service. Location is excellent, you can't be close to everything, but trafalgar square, picadilly, hyde park and expensive shopping choices. House of parliament and westminster abbey are relatively close-by. 
The thing that drops my review are the bathrooms. In both our rooms (different floors) it took a long time for hot water to come. And my father had to wait 20 minutes for hot water, which is unacceptable in a 5-star hotel. Granted it is probably due to the building being older and if many people shower at the same time there just isn't enough hot water to go around. Also the toilets flush was extremely weak, which at first didn't bother me. But after a couple of days it started to annoy me, since it couldn't flush down 1 piece of paper without flushing twice.  Another small problem was the fact that we found old underwear in one of the rooms. It was slightly hidden as it was inside the closet at the back of the hat rack, but a room should be checked/cleaned thoroughly after each visitor. Otherwise the stay was enjoyable.",4,2014,01,08
142,Hotel Stay at The Stafford London,"I recently visited London and stayed Dec 28, 2013 - Jan 3, 2014 in the Stafford London by Kempinski, St. James Place, London, UK.  The entire stay was delightful primarily due to the Stafford's staff.  Their consideration, kindness and assistance was invaluable, especially since this was my first time there.  From the registration process to check-out, all involved were pleasant, helpful and professional.  All questions and requests we had were immediately addressed and answered much to our satisfaction.  The dining room, lounge/bar, concierge, registration and housekeeping employees showed us the utmost respect and consideration, and we enjoyed many conversations that were both informative and pleasant. The entire visit with the Stafford was enjoyable and I look forward to again staying there.",5,2014,01,06
142,Shhh dont tell anyone.,"Tucked away in the oasis of 1900s England is The Stafford. Only had breakfast this christmas which is a shame. Having stayed several times , i can confidently stay its one of the best in London. The worlds to big to say all of it. Fabulous staff, superb surroundings, exceptional location. Have a Gin and Tonic, read the walls in the American bar, its not footballers (though there are a few) and TOWIE. Its presidents and prime ministers.  It is and has remained superb, as they say about Zermatt, ""go here before you die"".",5,2014,01,03
142,Great staff,"This is an amazing boutique hotel, within walking distance of major London attractions, it is small enough to be quaint and cozy but large enough to have great facilities but what makes this hotel stand out are the staff, truly wonderful. From the moment you arrive nothing is too much trouble and they go out of their way to help. 5 star luxury with a fab American bar.
Only very small niggle the cooked breakfast was not that great but the buffet breakfast was very good.",5,2014,01,02
142,A cozy stay,"We booked last minute and were very happy we did. We visited London between Christmas and New Years and loved the city. The hotels location is super to access the underground or even walk to the Big Ben and London Eye! The breakfast in the hotel was yummy although very English style, with maybe a bit more variety needed. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. We really felt comfortable and cozy during our whole stay!",5,2014,01,02
142,Loved this place.,"We booked quite late on a website so I did not know what to expect, just glad to get somewhere for New Years Eve.  On arrival, the hotel looked charming and all the christmas decorations looked fab.  The room had been ready from very early in the morning and my husband had dropped off our stuff.  We had been upgraded to a suite on the 6th floor which was excellent, very smart furnishings and fittings with a small outside terrace.  We polished off the complimentary champagne and then went down to have some lunch.  The American Bar was very quaint and cosy and the staff here were excellent, very attentive bringing extra nibbles when we ran out and the food itself was very good.  We returned to our room to get ready and enjoyed a hot shower and treading on the warm marble floors, a lovely touch.  Our room was turned down at 6pm and there was water provided and free soft drinks.  Also a coffee machine which I personally did not use but other reviews have said there wasnt any, maybe they are only in the suites!

I was sorry to leave and would highly recommend this place which isnt the cheapest but it is nice to treat yourself now and again.",5,2014,01,02
142,"Traditional, quality, London hotel done well!","A very nice hotel, in a traditional style. 

All of the elements of service, etc that you expect from a 5* hotel, on a smaller scale with a feeling of exclusivety. 

Lovely rooms with space and plenty of storage - small niggle would be size of shower cubicle. 

Very good service. Great breakfast. American bar is a London tradition for those in the know. 

A great alternative to the big name establishments in London, in a great location. 

Enjoyed the 4 night stay very much. ",4,2013,12,28
142,Excellent,"From the moment you sit down to check in until the moment you leave, this was just perfect. Quick service, quick room service, a cup of tea, yes it's not expensive or much, but arriving in pouring rain, a bit early, ten minutes waiting with a cup of tea is just what you need, before getting your room. The doorman could be a little bit lighter on his feet, and that is the absolutely only thing, and that is if I'm really picky. Excellent stay. Perfect location for shopping as well.  Hope to be back.",5,2013,12,27
142,It really is home from home...,"we stayed here for 6 nights recently. From the moment we arrived we enjoyed superb service and attention from ALL the staff there - not just certain individuals. Our room was wonderful. Lots of storage space and surfaces - which we needed as we were shopping madly in the week before Christmas! The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas - so cosy and twinkly with trees and fir cones galore. We enjoyed 2 nights at the American Bar - great cocktails, lots of memorabilia and a great ambience. Breakfast was really good too. And we really enjoyed the location - close to Bond Street and Piccadilly.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for something traditional, homely, friendly and convenient. We'll be back!",5,2013,12,27
142,Long very enjoyable weekend in London,"This hotel was exactly what we were looking for in London. It's location was perfect, convienent to just about everything.  We could walk most anywhere to shop or eat in minutes. The rooms were luxurious and comfortable.  Very old world and yet with all of the contemporary amenities.
Staff was superb and we more than accommodating! Breakfast and dinner was very good.
We will return!",5,2013,12,25
142,A lovely hotel,Situated in a quiet enclave off St James Park this is a gem of a hotel. We stayed one night in a deluxe room.  The room was very nice with a large and extremely comfortable bed. The staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The lady who freshened our room after we left for the evening deserves special mention for her attention to detail.  Breakfast was very good with an extensive choice and attentive service. It was a delightful place to stay and I would love to return.,5,2013,12,16
142,"A great hotel, but with niggles","The Stafford has long been one of the smartest hotels in London. Very well located in St James, it has a wonderful setting and ambiance. Great welcome. Very comfortable rooms and one of the finest bars in London. It is not cheap. That said, it is surprising, perhaps, that there are no tea or coffee facilities in the room, no trouser press and the lighting in the room was very poor for someone with bad eyesight. No doubt, management would argue that all we had to do was to ring for whatever we wanted - and I am sure that that would have been the case, but there are times when one just wants some privacy.",4,2013,12,06
142,Sadly not long enough!,"Had a very short, but very sweet stay at The Stafford last week, and I am sure that it won't be the last.

From start to finish all the staff seemed to want to go that 'extra mile' in delivering the high quality of service that you would expect from a hotel at this level - and they did it in such an unassuming way that it made us feel as if we were regular guests, even though this was our first visit.

The hotel - public areas and bedrooms are superb, and could not be faulted at all.

The consistency and the attention to detail were spot on, whether in the breakfast room, the lounge or the American Bar and they were even flying the Stars and Stripes on Thanksgiving Day!",5,2013,12,02
142,Welcome Home,"Whenever I stay at the Stafford, they always say "" Welcome Home"" when I arrive. I'm not a frequent visitor, but they treat me as though I have just been gone a week. And it seems genuine. The service is above and beyond anything you could expect, the staff is friendly, the location wonderful, the food delicious, and the beds are the most comfortable that I have slept in, anywhere, ever. Yes, it is pricey. But if you want to feel like you would not want to be anywhere else in the world, stay at the Stafford. You won't regret it. I can't wait to come home again.",5,2013,12,01
142,"lovely place, great experience","Second time in London, i chose this hotel because it was luxurious and near picadilly circus. i couldn´t have made a better choice. the quality is superb, the staff are dedicated, helpful and kind to any request, and the whole place is just gorgeous. i would like to mention the great breakfast buffet (really great fruit!).",5,2013,11,29
142,Highly professional and personable,The Stafford is very detail oriented and attentive. The staff are very professional and able to produce high quality standards with calm and decorum. The food is excellent and the service is perfect. The room is very good we had an upgrade to a suite which was most welcome after our last hotel... Highly recommended for those who favour traditional hospitality with flair.. Bit pricy though.,5,2013,11,21
142,A Wonderful Stay in an Ideal Spot,"The Stafford Hotel is a beautiful hotel that prides itself on its outstanding service and hospitality.  The hotel itself is a stately remodeled old city home for one of Britain's historic well-to-do families.  The architectural elegance was maintained despite the need for upgrading and remodeling to meet the standards of a modern hotel.  The location is ideal. If there is a fault with the comfort of the hotel, it is that the plumbing is still old and in some cases needs a little additional upgrade.  Staff accommodated us without question and in reality, the problems are minor.  The Concierge service was particularly excellent. It would be helpful to understand the tipping policy in advance, as the tip is added to the bill at the end of your stay.",5,2013,11,19
142,The Best Visit Yet,"We've been to the Stafford many times but our last 5 day visit was the best one yet. As a result of booking through the ""Small Hotels"" program offered by American Express Platinum Travel Service we received a great room up grade as well as other benefits. The hotel has been refreshed since our last visit which added to the attractiveness overall. The American Bar is not to be missed and we didn't.  We ha d drinks there each day and enjoyed the service and the clientele.  Our upgraded room was a king and the bed was spectacularly comfortable. The amenities are first rate. The staff is incredibly welcoming, efficient and responsive. We cannot say one negative thing about this hotel.  We look forward to our next visit.",5,2013,11,18
142,"Charming, Comfortable and Central","The Stafford is tucked away in St James's Place but within a three minute walk from Green Park tube and Piccadilly and the sundry delights which central London has to offer. We stayed here for a long weekend and whilst much of that time was spent out of the hotel, the comfortable room offered a tranquil oasis to return to. As many others have remarked, the staff were friendly and helpful and the staff of the American Bar accommodated our gregarious group without batting an eye lid. The Stafford is to be recommended as a discreet hotel in a superb location.",5,2013,11,03
142,Lovely small hotel in Mayfair,"We stayed here for 5 days during a trip with friends. It is a small charming hotel with a pleasant courtyard, a nice bar, and a good breakfast in the morning. Service was very pleasant, and everyone who worked here seemed friendly and helpful. It is very well located with just a short walk to the Green Park tube stop, and within easy walking distance of some wonderful small restaurants. Our room was in the hotel itself, and was small but comfortable. Our only complaint is that it was a terrible shower--the water pressure was so low that it took extra time just to wash my hair, and the temperature changed constantly and the only way to effectively manage this was to just step out of the water when it became either scalding or cold. This did not seem to vary with either the time of day or with toilets flushing. It happened every time we took showers. I thought perhaps it was because we were on the 6th floor (the top floor), but our friends on lower floors experienced the same issue. So just be aware when you get in the shower that it will be difficult to manage. Otherwise, really liked this hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2013,11,01
142,"Fantastic location, traditional styling","I booked a room through Amex Plat and got a good deal + perks that include an upgrade for a friend and myself and no difficulties in having them set up two twins instead of a king bed.  We ate the Amex-included breakfast every morning, and it was plenty with yoghurt, cheese, fruit, croissants.  The room, although tight in size, was fine, and the beds were extremely comfortable although the closet space was limited.  The marble bathroom was pretty and included both a European tub and a separate tiny shower-- plenty of counter space and light.  We didn't hear any noise at night.
Not only is the hotel quaint, pretty and quintessentially old English, but the location is superb.  You are within easy walking distance of two different Underground lines or a 15 minute walk to Buckingham Palace or Parliament.  The staff was attentive and helpful, and any requests or questions were addressed immediately.  We visited the American Bar twice, but we were not wow-ed, although it appeared to be very popular with the cigar-smoking crowd.  The fitness room was in a separate building and equipped with the basic essentials--we did have access to a larger gym down the street, but we didn't use that option.
I would definitely stay at the Stafford again.",4,2013,10,25
142,Enchanting Hotel in a perfect location,My husband and I celebrated our 40th in London.  We could not have picked a better hotel for our celebration.  The entire staff was so accommodating and the concierge  booked all our trips and tickets around the city.  Our room was so beautiful and the room service was excellent.  We'll definitely be back.,5,2013,10,22
142,Perfect location; elegant hotel,Stayed there four nights last week.  The room was perfect in every detail and totally quiet (important to me).  The included breakfast is a good deal;  you can eat so much food that you don't have to worry about lunch.  We especially liked the America Bar for a late night snack and a glass (or two) of wine.   The lobster/pork belly sandwich was so good that I ordered it every night!,5,2013,10,21
142,Secret hotel at the heart of London,"Rooms are large but restroom is relatively small for a family. Concierge personnel is very nice and helpfull. Breakfast is great. Clean and nice hotel. Since it is quite old, maintenance is a must. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,10,16
142,Quiet reserve,"The Stafford Hotel may be one of London's best kept secrets.   The hotel exudes old luxury and refined charm.  It is tucked away in a quiet mews in St James Place.  The bar called the Amercan Bar attracts a lively after work crowd.  The main dining room is what you would expect in a 5 star hotel.  The service throughout the hotel from the reception, the concierge and the staff was warm and very friendly. 
Whenever we were asked about where we were staying,  the response to the Stafford seemed to be bewilderment.   Has no one heard of it?  We enjoyed the hotel very much and would recommend it.",5,2013,10,14
142,A wonderful London hotel,"We chose The Stafford for it's location as much as the facilities and were delighted in every way during our 2 night stay. The hotel is particularly easy to drive to and the valet parking service takes any possible stress out of trying to arrive at most other London hotels due to it being tucked away in a very quiet street just behind The Ritz Hotel.  To be able to walk to theatres and restaurants was greatly valued and there was an endless supply of hotel umbrellas in the event of rain. The Stafford has the feel of a small but luxurious hotel and we found everyone very attentive and friendly. We stayed in one of the King rooms in the courtyard which was very comfortable and offered free soft drinks and water. A must is to enjoy a drink or two in The American Bar which is filled with memorabilia of various sports and show biz personalities. We were celebrating a special wedding anniversary and, to our delight, found a bottle of champagne in our room with the compliments of the hotel team. One of many very nice touches that went towards making our stay very special. Will certainly return to this lovely hotel.",5,2013,10,14
142,Quiet luxury in the midst of busy London,"Had the most marvelous stay at the Stafford together with my sister last August. 
The location: in the middle of the Mayfair district, in a quiet street behind the Ritz.Right next to Green Park, it's only a short 5-minute walk to the Buckingham Palace or Picadilly Square.
The room: We stayed in a beautiful room with a king size bed in the Mainhouse. Fluffy pillows (and pillow menu in case you had special requests), Molton Brown products, bathtub (with its own rubber ducky!). I just wished the mattress was a little harder, but that's probably a personal preference.
The breakfast: We pretty much sampled the entire breakfast menu during our 3-night stay at The Stafford and loved the quaint breakfast room. Particular favorites in no particular order included: fresh berries salad, the thick-sliced bacon&waffles, the eggs benedict...
The service: Outstanding. Everyone was extremely helpful and pleasant. from the waitstaff to the concierge through the receptionist. We arrived at 11PM and were able to check-in quickly. We were also able to change dinner reservations last minute, get tickets through the concierge, book transportation early morning, all without problem. 
The price: We were lucky as my sister works for another Kempinski hotel and we got a staff rate, so I can't comment on the regular rates.

Overall, The Stafford made our short stay in London a memorable and most comfortable one. Would come back anytime if I had the chance and recommend to whomever wants to experience a little bit of quiet luxury in the middle of busy London!",5,2013,10,08
142,The Stafford London,"My wife and I spent a week in London and stayed at The Stafford and all I can say is what a great hotel and what a great location.  Everyone we encountered during our stay went out of their way to make us feel welcome, especially Rebecca at the reception desk.  The room was not large but quite adequate and the bed was fantastic.  There are several Underground Stations within close walking distance.  Make sure to have at least one meal at the American Bar.",5,2013,10,07
142,Great Hotel - can be even better!,"The hotel is located next to Green Park and close to some of the best shopping and sight seeing in Europe. The Stafford was an institution, and the recent blend with Kempinski has brought with it a more updated feeling through some recent renovation. The American Bar is still the same fantastic bar. The rooms are great, the service is very good without feeling 100% on par with the best of London (Lanesborough, Berkeley). To be able to eat outside at this location at a 5 star hotel (in the summer) is almost one of a kind in London.",4,2013,09,16
142,Wonderful Hotel Great Location,"We stayed at The Stafford after we found out The Park Lane was in need of refurbishing, and we could not have been happier. The Stafford is a small hotel in The Mayfair District, adjacent to The Park Lane underground stop. You can walk right to the hotel through the park, without having to cross a street. It is very convenient to Buckingham Palace, right around the corner from The Ritz and a short walk to Piccadilly Circus. You can even walk to the theater in Leicester Square if you want. Service at the hotel is friendly and very efficient, and our room was well appointed and a decent size for Central London. Our room came with a very nice continental breakfast, which I highly recommend. There is a nice restaurant on the premises as well as a pub with an outdoor seating area.",5,2013,09,13
142,Perfection!,"We treated ourselves to a night here on our 25th wedding anniversary and will definitely be back. This is how a top hotel should be run, the service is fantastic without being fawning and the room was marvellous and the bed amazingly comfortable. The location is brilliant but the hotel is tucked away - we had no noise issues. The bar is a great place to spend a few hours and there are nice nibbles that come with the drinks.",5,2013,09,05
142,The Stafford,"Amazing hotel and location.  The food in the dining room was really good.  The lounge and outdoor patio were gorgeous.  It was walking distance from Buckingham Palace, Westminster, etc.  It is within view of St. James Palace.  It was also a short walk to Fortnum Mason, Dunhill and other nice shops.  I would stay there again in a heart beat.",5,2013,09,03
142,A stylish gem in an enviable location,"This is a well managed property in a terrific and quiet location as highlighted by other contributors.

We stayed in one of the Master Suites which was very well appointed, high quality fixtures and fittings with good lighting and a real sense of space.  Only minor fault was with the water pressure in the shower. Americans always complain about British plumbing and in this case, they would be right, a mere trickle and not too much by way of temperature variation. A fixable problem in a bathroom that is larger than many hotel rooms I have been in.

The American Bar is great and has a loyal clientele who seem to drift from lunch to evening quite effortlessly and food is good with competent bartenders - not mixologists, as they wear ties and have combed their hair.

What doesn't work is the restaurant, it lacks physical appeal occupying the centre of the hotel but looks more like a temporary installation, hence other than at breakfast, it is empty which must be dispiriting for the staff. Management needs to provide it with some independent identity and a reason to be there.  The Capital Hotel managed this extremely well until they went off piste with their new and disastrous venture but that's another story.

Would highly recommend as I think the hotel offers pretty good value and despite being ""chain"" managed, has retained a lot of character and independence.",5,2013,08,25
142,Excellent service and a great location,"Just returned from a 4 night stay in the Main House Master Suite. Meet and greet and check in were excellent with coffee sent to the room for us whilst unpacking - a nice touch. The accommodation could not be faulted with superbly comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom. The suite was excellent. The famed breakfast, which we took in our room, lived up to expectation and set us up for the day. Room Service was always punctual. Location is very central, ideal for shopping or site seeing with Green Park Tube only minutes away. The American Bar must be experienced with excellent service, a good atmosphere, and a very good bar menu. This hotel is a hidden gem! We were sorry to leave!",5,2013,08,19
142,Anniversary Trip,"Staff were very polite and helpful, but would of liked to of been advised of the lack of complimentary tea/coffee in room. Only after reading others comments that I am now imformed we should of requested complimentary coffee, we have never been in a London hotel and had to request a hot drinks tray! Carriage rooms very nice but noisy at times from doors being slammed, so we were woken during the night at least three times.
Breakfast was a nice experience, staff very friendly and food good quality.",4,2013,08,18
142,Outstanding service,"Our group, my husband and me, my husband's brother and his wife, my daughter and son-in-law, and my daughter and her boyfriend, arrived from the US at 8:30am and were shown to our rooms right away. This was a second visit for my immediate family. We had 2 Mews Jr Suites and 2 main house rooms. The rooms were fabulous but the room the boys shared had 2 beds that were quite close together.  Each room had a complimentary bottle of Cabernet. The Mews rooms had mini fridges stocked with soda, water and juice. 

What stood out the most was the service we received, mainly from the Concierge staff. We requested dinner reservations most evenings and received a table for 8 at each place we requested; most often the only table for 8 in the restaurant. Bentley's was great, as usual, but the real dinner treat was at Wolfgang Puck's Cut. Recommended by Fernando, we enjoyed a lovely anniversary dinner with a very attentive wait staff and perfectly prepared steaks.

We took a day trip to Paris and Fernando even secured dinner reservations for us there (made in French!) We also day-tripped it to Liverpool to watched their match against Tottenham. Through the work of most of the staff, we secured tickets and a pre-match meal plus a driver who dropped us off and picked us up at the gate. Peter, even though it was his day off, arrived at the hotel VERY early to see us off. 

We began each evening in the hotel's American Bar for cocktails before dinner. A quick call ahead reserved our table, which was needed due to the popularity of the bar. We did not dine at The Stafford but enjoyed tea and desserts in the lobby. We love this discreet, charming, boutique hotel and recommend it highly.",5,2013,08,12
142,Amazing property - amazing service - amazing location!,"The Stafford London is absolutely central to London, yet still somehow relatively secluded and quiet.  It is absolutely enchanting.  The service was phenomenal.  The rooms, very well appointed!  Very comfortable.  Delicious food.  The bar is fantastic.  Awesome wine cellar.",5,2013,08,10
142,A marvelous oasis in busy London,"Superb personal service from everyone at this hotel. And such a treat to leave the noise and bustle of central London. A very quiet and comfortable stay, but only yards from the park and the tube. Great food for all meals, both in the dining room and the wonderful American Bar ",5,2013,08,05
142,London excellence,The Stafford is in a quiet mews just off St James and therefore very centrally located. Taxis are easily obtained as they come up from Pall Mall and there are fabulous restaurants within a few minutes walk. Our room was everything you expect of a five star hotel especially the well appointed bathroom. But it is the staff that sets the Stafford apart. The concierge desk efficiently arranged everything we asked from a car & driver for the day to bookings at hard to get into restaurants. Likewise the staff at the American Bar who look out for the residents when tables are hard to get. Special mention of the incredibly speedy room service every morning.,5,2013,07,30
142,A London gem,"I would return to The Stafford in a hot minute. It has all the amenities and top-notch service you would expect from the best luxury London hotels, but with the feeling of a small boutique hotel. It's also well-removed from the noise and bustle of London on its cul-de-sac street but easy walking distance to the West End and a number of attractions including Hyde Park, St. James Park, the Churchill War Rooms, etc. The rooms were simply lovely. I felt like I was staying in someone's home, not in a hotel. Classically decorated in an English style. I enjoyed a comfortable king sized bed, two writing desks, a comfy couch and seating area with a flat screen television and ample closet space, and a lovely bathroom with beautiful tiled walls and floor and even bath salts provided. Couldn't have been more comfortable.

The American Bar is a nice place to grab a late night drink and/or snack, but its popularily with locals at lunch means getting a table at that time of the day can be tricky. People with allergies or aversions to smoke, beware: as with most places we've been in the UK, smoking in outdoor seating areas is allowed and very common compared to the U.S. The American Bar sells cigars and there were always a couple of people smoking them, which is not so great if you're not a fan of secondhand smoke. It didn't bother me but someone in my party is allergic to smoke and it's hard to get away from here. 

Hotel personnel were very helpful with fetching taxis for us and advising on transportation options generally. Although some of the staff could be a bit standoffish, others were extremely welcoming and friendly. I had a lengthy discussion with my travelmates about this earlier tonight and we agreed that staff at UK hotels have to walk a tricky line between the friendliness many American tourists and business visitors might appreciate and the more removed tone of service that appeals to continentals and perhaps to the British themselves, so I'm certainly not marking the Stafford down for it (I'm just noting it for those who put a premium on feeling warmly welcomed by everyone they encounter at a hotel). Still, the place is not overly stiff or formal compared to some other London hotels where I've stayed and the rooms, while incredibly expensive, deliver on the promise of luxury, quiet, and exclusivity.",5,2013,07,24
142,Exceptional in every way,"I travel extensively for both business and pleasure and regularly stay in very nice hotels.  I've probably stayed in a dozen different hotels in London in the past, including the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental.  The Stafford exceeded my expectations in every way.  Quiet and elegant, ideally located, attentive and ""real"" staff, fantastic food (restaurant and room service both), and an unbelievably comfortable room and bed.  Afternoon tea was a real highlight.  I will definitely stay at the Stafford during future trips to London.  It's my new ""home"" in London!",5,2013,07,16
142,Nice and comfortable,"This hotel is nice and clean. The staff at the front desk was nice, but I found the staff in the American Bar to be inattentive and kind of rude. 

Location is nice, right next to Green Park and the metro. A little bit of a trek to Trafalgar Square and Westminster Abbey. ",4,2013,07,14
142,Classic Boutique Hotel,"This was our first stay at the Stafford and we were very satisfied.  We stayed in The Muse, which is like a little apartment.  It was very comfortable, spacious, clean and had a small beverage refrigerator with unlimited beverages. It seems very private and is quiet in that area of the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful from arrival until checkout.  The location of the hotel is excellent so that you can walk to many different sights or get on a bus or the tube easily.  We enjoyed breakfast  in the diningroom every day and they offered lots of choices and the food was delicious.  The servers were attentive and accommodating.  I don't have any negative comments except to say that I was shocked and disappointed there weren't any Green Bay Packers hats or gear in The American Bar but I will take it upon myself next time to bring something along to add to the sports atmosphere in that great bar!",5,2013,07,02
142,"Still our favorite, seems like home","We have stayed at the Stafford a number of times over that last 4 or 5 years.  We love the newest section of rooms, The Mews.  They are beautifully decorated, spacious and comfortable.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  The concierge staff does a wonderful job serving and expediting anything you might want while in London.  

The location while quiet is about as central as you can find in this incredible city.  While we typically like to try different hotels each time we travel to a major city we feel like the Stafford is home and don't look at the many extraordinary choices that London has to offer because of this.  My only comment is that since Kempinski has taken over things are busier and some wear and tear is apparent, I hope they don't lose their edge as London's best small hotel.",5,2013,06,18
142,Excellent in every way!,"We recently stayed for 5 nights at this beautiful hotel.  The location was superb.  Literally a 2 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, 10 minutes to Piccadilly Circus and a stone's throw from fabulous restaurants and shopping.  Although the location and hotel were outstanding, the real standout for me was the superb staff.  I have never encountered hotel staff that was able to combine genuine warmth, graciousness and hospitality so seamlessly.  From the concierge who booked our restaurants to the cleaning staff who made sure our room was spotless, British hospitality at its finest.  I highly recommend the Stafford.  Not inexpensive so be forewarned but certainly memorable in every way.",5,2013,06,17
142,Beautiful,"Stayed overnight as this was booked by one of our suppliers.  I thoroughly enjoyed staying over, the hotel is steeped in history and the bar was amazing.  Room was superb and the breakfast in the morning was outstanding, very elegantly English, the staff could not do enough for you.  Fantastic!",5,2013,06,15
142,a week in london,"We stayed a week in this hotel in May 2013.  great location! walk to just about anywhere, or tube 1 min walk away.
Lovely sized rooms, clean and well appointed.
Breakfast service was ok, but food and choice great.
Wifi great.
tThe only negative was the cigar smoke that wafted in from the courtyard. we were going to have afternoon tea there one day but the smell permiated through the whole ground floor of the hotel, so we went elsewhere.",4,2013,06,12
142,Amazing Location,"Great location in central London.  American Bar is worth a visit to see all the momentos and have a drink. Front desk staff helpful.
Bed was too soft to our liking and breakfast was disappointingly average.",4,2013,06,07
142,Nice hotel tucked in a quiet spot next to Greenpark,"Well located in St James's place but tucked away in a nice corner. Rooms are nice and comfortable and service is excellent. Internet speed is good. Good place to stay if you are organized and not in a hurry, getting a cab is only a short walk out through the alley at Greenpark Station entrance.",4,2013,06,03
142,Fond Memories But Not This Time,"We were last in the American Bar in 2000 and had two amazing meals.  This time, we were so eager to return to this beautiful hotel and found renos and changes but then found the bar we so fondly remembered.  We had a delightful drink in the old bar area and then were overwelmed by cigar fumes that came from those that were smoking cigars they bought in the bar.  Ventilation failed to keep the smoke out of the inside bar area and we were forced to flee to the lounge area in the hotel.  We ordered a great bottle of wine and waited over an hour for our food which finally came after some false starts.  Needless to say, there was no effort to compensate us for two simple meals which were very late and would have lessened our feeling of disappointment.  Please find a way to keep the smoke out of the hotel in this era of smoke-free living and allow your patrons to enjoy this beautiful setting.",3,2013,06,01
142,Great location and friendly staff,"We booked this hotel via a secret deal with lastminute.com (unique mayfair property next to Green Park), receiving about 50% off the rack rate for our Queen non-smoking room.   The location is a good one, in a quiet mews (an alley leads in 2 minutes straight into Green Park near the tube exit during the day) whilst another exit via the old stable yard goes straight out to St James.  It is safe and clean to walk even late at night.    It would be very easy to walk to many of the popular tourist sights from here, and just as easy for good links across London via the tube and bus to those further afield.    The ambience of the hotel is quietly luxurious, but with very friendly staff who make everyone feel very welcome.   There are some lovely rooms in the old mews section of the hotel, but we were in a small room in the main building.  It was well appointed, with high ceilings, comfortable bed, and immaculately turned out.   The beds were turned down later in the evening with free mineral water provided.   I have to say, I missed a tray for tea or coffee in the room (of course two teas from room service or served in the lounge were available, for £11), but sometimes you like to be a bit self-sufficient for the odd hot drink!   There wasn't much of a view from the room, and the bathroom was very cramped - but on the other hand it was very quiet and comfortable, even though we were near the main staircase.   If you were to do a checklist of facilities in the room itself, without looking at the cosmetic dressing, it would not score much higher than a premier inn - so you are paying for the location, and the sheer character of the hotel as a whole.   I would recommend this hotel - but I don't think I would ever pay the rack rate for the room I had.   Get yourself a great rate, have a good night's sleep, then put the £25 breakfast on offer to one side, walk out into the park and have an even more delicious one at Café de Pierre.",4,2013,05,25
142,Nice stay,"The Stafford was a very comfortable stay for 4 nights.  I recommend getting the high speed internet as the lower option was somewhat unreliable.  The restaurant and bar are very well run and managed.  The hotel is centrally located for the older part of London and is just next door to Buckingham Palace.  Due to its cost, I probably would not stay here if it were not for work.",5,2013,05,22
142,American bar,"Met here for a quiet drink after work. It is quiet, private and great for a meeting or a social encounter. Bar has a subdued atmosphere and is perfect balance to the hustle and bustle outside in the city. Was able to reserve a table which was great and the food we ordered was very good. 
Will be back.",5,2013,05,22
142,Beautiful hotel,"Great find which is off the main road but still close to all the attractions including Buckingham Palace.  Great for Green Park underground station.

Beautiful bedroom, complete with its own rubber duck in the bathroom.  Lovely, welcoming staff.

Bar is very pricey, but atmosphere is worth at least one drink during your stay.

Would recommend.",4,2013,05,18
142,Great boutique hotel in London,"Great location, very central to everything. Amazing staff, from restaurant to check in to housekeeping and especially the concierge team, they do miracles.
The staff anticipate your needs, if you even look lost or confused, they approach you.
Lovely rooms, a quiet location despite being so central.",5,2013,05,09
142,"If you are looking for a small boutique hotel in great section of London, this is the hotel.","WOW! This is my home away from home in London. Very attentive staff who somehow know your name and remember it as soon as you check in. Their bar is best in London! Rooms have beds with great mattresses and linens are highest quality. If hotels could be rated higher than 5 star, this would be 8!",5,2013,05,07
142,Elegance at a price,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Stafford for my birthday. On arrival we we informed we had been upgraded to a carriage room. Unfortunately this room was a smoking room, which was directly outside the bar. There were diners sitting right outside our window talking and smoking cigars. Not such a great upgrade. On booking i had requested a no smoking room. We rang the desk and they agreed to move us into the main hotel. This room was very small, but peaceful and quiet. The beds are incredibly comfortable. On the website it states that king bathrooms have separate showers. This rooms bathroom was too small to do this .and we had an over the bath shower. The Stafford does not provide in room tea making facilities, I had to call and request a kettle. I have stayed at the Langholm ,royal horse guards , cavendish, and other up market hotels they al provide in room facilities. The Stafford is an extremely elegant hotel. The furnishings are beautiful. The staff extremely knowledgeable and friendly. There was very little atmosphere in the American bar and the staff rather unfriendly, compared to the rest of the staff we met during our stAy. They stood behind the bar discussing the fact that they could not wait to go home. The bar prices are jaw dropping, even for London . Breakfast was delivered seamlessly with charming attentive staff. £5 for a glass of orange juice did leave me husband gasping for air slightly! I'm unable to comment on the restaurant as we dined at the wonderful Bentleys on Piccadilly . ADVICE if booking a carriage room do not have room 2 it is far too noisy and I'm sure they have had complaints about it before. The stable doors give no soundproofing at all the diners outside may as well have been in the room with us.",3,2013,05,03
142,"Beautiful, simply beautiful","We treated mother in law to a stay here for her 70th.  Having eaten in the restaurant a few times we were hoping the rooms would match the excellent service and standard we had experienced so far - we were far from disappointed.

The rooms were beautiful, well appointed and so comfortable it was a real treat.  Everywhere was spotlessly clean and fabulously decorated.  We really couldn't fault it.  Even father in law couldn't find fault and that has to be a first.

The staff are brilliant - they left birthday cake in mother in laws room and a bottle of champagne with our supper.  They remember your name, they remember the birthday, they constantly check you are ok without being intrusive. 

They reserved a table in the bar for us after our supper to ensure a smooth move for our night caps.

The breakfast was beautiful and plentiful again with excellent service. 

As father in law so aptly put it, we were not visitors, we were guests - a subtle but very important difference. 

I can highly recommend - we will certainly be visiting again.",5,2013,05,02
142,weekend in London,"Our first time at this hotel, great location, beautiful building,lovely decoration very good service, good staff, we loved the atmosphere of the American bar. Rooms were rather disappointing , quite small for the price. Bathroom poor,I think the bath was quite narrow,standing in the bath for a shower, you have a curtain very tight on one side of you with a very big fixed handle at chest hight on the other side. Therefore taking a shower is not particularly easy, you feel cramped and hemmed in. It must be really difficult for a large person.
 Also Mrs L likes a cup of tea so she was disappointed that there were no tea making facilities in the room.
Better value at other hotels.",3,2013,05,01
142,Live like a lord in London.,"My wife and I stayed in the hotel, and loved everything about it. The property is three regency houses, just aroudn the corner from St James Palace, in the heart of Mayfair, and the discreet entrance let's you know right away that this is NOT a property for those who want people to know they have ""arrived."" It is quiet, discreet, and extremely pleasant.
On arrival the doorman had our car parked, not to be used until we left central for the country, and our bags were efficiently handled, as was the check in procedures at the comfortable front desks, where we sat opposite the reception clerks. Everything was efficiently handled, and as it was early in the morning we set out on visits, while the hotel prepared our rooms.
We had a well appointed room as did our travelling companions, and extremely comfortable bed. We also were fortunate to have a lovely patio where we could enjoy a drink in the afternoon.
The breakfast was outstanding, and the food and service at dinner was tremendous. We also enjoyed the American Bar, both the food and beverages.
The only small thing was the room above had creaky floorboards, and we could hear the people occasionally moving around. Other than that it was a most enjoyable stay.",5,2013,04,30
142,"Cosy, but missing finesse.","At face value the Stafford is well kept, traditionally charming, but when compared to other hotels in the area is average. There is a mix of modern amenities and contemporary styling that is very welcoming.

The room itself, although lacking a minibar, tea and coffee making facilities, an ironing board, trouser press, and two single beds pushed together for a queen, was homely and comfortable.
I was 'upgraded' to the courtyard suites, which I would thoroughly recommend avoiding. If you have an aversion to others' smoke or noise. There is a smoking area right outside the doors, and the rooms are cold, unless you have the noisy heating on, and the cobblestones outside are used to transport incredibly noisy rubbish bins in the early hours

Ensure you request tea and coffee making facilities, (and a stocked minibar) upon your arrival, one would expect this to be asked when checking in!

The location is great for shopping, and is just a short walk away from the tube. 

Having seen that the breakfast was a nothing special over expensive continental, I decided to opt out and pop out around the corner to Patisserie Valerie and Paul, for better croissants and coffee. 

I'd recommend this hotel for Business stays, but for couples I would look to other nearby hotels in a similar price range.",3,2013,04,24
142,amazing hotel,"myself and partner spent a night here, and it was amazing. Our room was really nice, with the biggest, most comfortable bed ever! especially loved the walk in shower.... we ordered breakfast to be delivered to our room, and were not dissapointed! smoked salmon with cream cheese on crumpets, bacon with syrup and pancakes, venisson sausages, coissants, coffee, well, all i can say is absolutely fantastic! and it was all presented so well.staff were exceptionally friendly, and we felt very welcomed. it was so quiet and peaceful here, we almost forgot we were in London. Perfect location, especially if you are going to the Theatre/ Soho, clubs and nice restaurants. (we walked to all) we didnt eat in the hotel restaurant, but we did have a drink in their bar (the American Bar) which was very nice (although a little expensive) if you are thinkimg of visiting this hotel, then do it....you wont be dissapointed, highly reccomended....",5,2013,04,16
142,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Spent 1 night at the Stafford over the weekend and I have to say that it is by far the best hotel that I have ever stayed in. It's luxurious and classy without being stuffy and pretentious. 
We stayed in a junior master suite in the courtyard. Our room was fitted with the highest quality fixtures and fittings and consumables. The bed was huge and comfortable and there were so many nice touches (Magazines/Compliemtary Papers/Soft Drinks/WiFi/Sky TV). 
The American bar is great for a pre/post-dinner drink and is decorated with some really interesting artefacts, and the breakfast was suitably impressive. The staff were very friendly and accomodating. Yes, it is expensive, but it is definately worth it. We will definately stay here again (and we live in London!)",5,2013,04,16
142,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here on the lead up to Christmas and it was very special. The decorations made it feel very Christmassy and walking out from the American Bar through the news was very ""ole worlde"". Rooms were lovely and clean and the lunch we had in the restaurant was very good . Nice for a special occasion.",5,2013,04,14
142,"Fantastic, Oasis of Calm.","I have just returned from spending a night at the Staffod Hotel and WOW, not only it is well located in St James but it is beautifully furnished, the staff were fantastic, nothing was too much trouble. 

It has a nice bar, called the American Bar which again had great service and a good atmosphere.
Our stay was faultless, give it a try, you won’t be disappointed.",5,2013,03,31
142,"Lovely Hotel, Fantastic Service","Stayed here for work for one night. Rooms on the small side but lovely and very comfortable. The hotel itself looks fantastic inside. The American Bar is particularly interesting. Lots of history. However the best by far was the service. The staff were all very helpful, kind, attentive and professional. They make you feel special. Very rare in my experience.",5,2013,03,26
142,Great just great,"the perfect hotel, boutique, but the service of a palace, staff is very efficient professional and friendly, the rooms are fantastic, the breakfast perfect, it is charming, and is for me a dream hotel.",5,2013,03,25
142,The best kept secret,"I'm sorry - I saw an earlier review recommending the Connaught as an alternative which is entirely missing the point of this superlative hotel.  The service & rooms are exceptional & the point is it's hidden away in St James & not many people know it's here.  There are reasons a well known media mogul who has a flat opposite goes here are - it's entirely discreet, has wonderful service & frankly thank god it's not the Connaught.",5,2013,03,24
142,Feel at home in London...,"In an average year I tend to stay at over 150 hotels and I rarely find time to write a review. But certain hotels really need to be talked about. I had the pleasure of staying at The Stafford between Christmas and New Years.  No this hotel is not the Ritz or the Dorchester nor will you see a ton of rich/elite or famous people always walking around it. Thats because those that do come here are able to hide and feel at home. Having 3 buildings for the hotel you do not even need to go through the lobby to get to your room. I had the pleasure of booking a Mews suite and then being upgraded to the Penthouse... So I can not answer to any rooms being small as this room seemed to be the entire top floor. Having a bedroom, huge closet, main washroom, office, sitting room, dining table, guest washroom, and terrace. There was also my own private Christmas tree in the room.  I had the hotel reserve a car transfer to and from Heathrow in an S-Class and the trip went flawlessly and when I arrived at the hotel the staff knew I had and greeted me promptly and brought me to the room. Breakfasts were included in the package I had reserved and were very good. The only complaint I can make against this hotel is regarding the room service.. both days I needed to call back several times before any one even answered and then it took well over the 30min mark that they told me it would take. This is something they definitely need to improve on, especially since I was the guest staying in the best room in the entire hotel. Other than this the hotel is in an amazing location. Having only stayed 3 nights the first day I had the hotel book a car for 7 hours in which I was able to see Tower Bridge, the Tower of London, The British Museum, St Paul's Cathedral, the National History Museum, Royal Albert Hall, the V & A Museum as well as Harrods, John Lewis, Harvey Nick's, and Selfridges..  The second day I could out just how close a walk the other monuments and shopping are.  Across from the main building is and alley that you walk though to Green Park and can be at Buckingham Palace in 5 min, there is a shop on the far side of it, and I bought so much I said I'll just take the quick walk back to the hotel as its so quick.. It was then also an easy walk to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, St James Palace and then on to Bond St, Fortnum and Mason and the Picadilly Circus.  the courtyard in the back of the main building where you need to go to get to the 2 others opens onto St James St.  For location this hotel is flawless, staff make you feel at home and it is a true 5 star hotel. I only peeked into the American Bar as I was so tired both days I couldn't be bothered to go in but apparently most male royals have all been here. This is a real must stay at hotel and I was a long time in choosing a 5 star hotel in London as there are so many. I was really happy with my stay, and I do not think I will ever stay at another hotel when I am in London. When leaving though there was also a bit of confusion that should be looked into as my car was already waiting and there was a long wait for me to check out and get a receipt as there are only 2 desks to apparently check people in and out, was a minor inconvenience but can still be improved upon.",5,2013,03,24
142,"Small, but convenient, and a home like atmosphere","Our recent visit to London found us back at the Stafford which seems to be our home whilst in London.  Everything about the hotel has proven favorable to us.  The rooms are exceedingly nice and comfortable.  The staff is first rate and friendly, seeming to learn your name after only a couple of days.  The ""American Bar is something to see with its pictures of the famous and not so famous, yacht club burgees, hard hats from various companies, airplane models of patrons now and in the past, and some of the best barmen to be found. 

The location is reat for us as we visit some of the shops along Jermyn Street, close by.  I will probably stay there the next visit as I have found none other that is exactly the kind of hotel I am looking for.  (If it ain't broke, don't fix it.)",5,2013,03,18
142,Very nice and convenient business hotel,"The Stafford is a very nice property in the very centre of London.

The staff is very serviceminded, the restaurant representative (works well for meetings), the bar has a good ambience, there is no noise as the property is drawn back from the main street and you are close to nice restaurants, the parks and the tube.

I have stayed there several times - and it has always been a pleasure.",5,2013,03,15
142,"Lovely location, wonderful concierge, disappointing breakfast.","I'm going to sound incredibly picky, so my apologies.  My family stayed at the Stafford for 10 days on the recommendation of my parents, who adore this little hotel.  The room is lovely, the location is perfect if you're partial to St. James (as we are) and Ferdando, our wonderful concierge, could not be kinder or more helpful.  When he found out our son had a fatal nut allergy, he actually went to two markets to find him biscuits that were safe to eat.  He was also incredibly helpful with safe restaurants for dinner.  My only gripe is with breakfast, which we usually love in the hotels we stay in.  At the Stafford the waffles and pancakes were not home made (what?!) so we couldn't confirm that they were nut free, and the service was slow and forgetful.  We ended up paying £75 for 2 rubbery pancakes, a bowl of muesli, and two poached eggs.  Eek.  We discovered Franco's two blocks away and have been going out for breakfast ever since.  I'm afraid we will probably go back to Duke's or The Connaught which are both the total package.  If you don't have concerns about breakfast, the Stafford is lovely.  Seriously.",5,2013,03,14
142,An hidden gem,"I've been going to The Stafford for over 20 years, it's survived it's fairly recent modernization , without any loss of its undeniable charm, the staff are always friendly helpful and consistent, it's a real gem , great martinis too!!",5,2013,03,07
142,An amazing weekend!,"We were fortunate enough to spend a long weekend in this beautiful hotel with a group of friends, we had an amazing time. It was Christmas, the whole place was trimmed up and looked so cosy and warm. On our first night we ate in a private dining room, it was out of this world. The staff were great and the food was amazing. Our bedroom was decorated really nice, was spacious and very clean. On our second night we all went to see a show and eat out in London, we came back to the hotel and relaxed in the American bar which is a very, very interesting room! Overall we had a fantastic weekend and we hope to visit this hotel again soon! Highly recommend to anyone.",5,2013,03,03
142,Characterful  Comfortable but busy breakfast,"If you like a hotel that oozes character, has really comfortable quiet bedrooms and lovely bathrooms the Stafford is for you and us.The reception and room service are impeccable
nothing is too much trouble and the staff very friendly. The price is on the highish side but
given that there are many characterless and cold hotels in London charging the same, it
is not unreasonable. The location in St James's Place is perfect for Central London.
We arrived on Sunday night after a 15 hour flight and after room service and a glass of
wine, drifted away in a large very comfy bed, perfect. In the morning somewhat jet lagged
we went down to breakfast and were dissappointed to discover that on monday mornings the
breakfast room completely stuffed with business bredakfasters from outside the hotel, not
a single table for residents available and a long queue, we were asked to wait or have breakfast in the room, we were not offered a cup of tea or coffee and ignored by the
restaurant manager. Ummmph we went down the road to the excellent Sofitel St James's
hotel and had a couple of their excellent buffet breakfasts. On returning to the hotel there
were profuse apologies from management and they offered to pay the bill at the Sofitel.
So it was put right to our satisfaction. Tuesday morning the restaurant breakfast was quieter
and we had a pleasant breakfast in the hotel as you would expect. So the recommendation
is for Monday morning breakfast is to reserve a table in advance !",4,2013,02,26
142,Still a superb place to stay,"I hesitate singing the praises of the Stafford in case too many people come and it becomes too difficult to find a room! A smaller, intimate hotel where the staff make you feel very special and very welcome. We prefer the more traditional rooms. but the mews rooms are more modern style. Great location, excellent American Bar, fine Lyttleton Restaurant...what more could one ask for?",5,2013,02,25
142,A wonderful little gem,"I am actually not sure how big or little the Stafford actually is. Part of the hotel seems inhabit an old 17th or 18th century building from when St James's was first laid out - mostly because of the squirrely twists and turns of some of the corridors. It all adds to the charm, though, and because of the fine sevice the Stafford certainly feels small and personal. My room was large enough ( it was business travel) and the hotel certainly can accommodate business travel even though I would say the ambiance lends itself slightly more to personal or vacation travel. The location is awesome -- near Green Park tube station, just off the park. Overall a very well run hotel.",5,2013,02,25
142,Dependable Consistent Experience,The rooms are small but very well appointed. I love the service minded hospitality at this hotel.  Everything is super clean and cozy.  This is my go to hotel in London particularly considering its West End location. Very easy to navigate business and shopping. I ordered room service and was pleased each time. The American bar is also a great cozy little spot for a quiet cozy conversation and cocktail. ,5,2013,02,22
142,Superb London Hotel,"I lived in London for 20 years before moving to Asia, but now i am a visitor.  I chose The Stafford based upon clients recommendations, and I wasn't disappointed.  It is a quintessential London Hotel, with great staff, superb service.  My room was large and very comfortable.  The American bar is excellent for lunch or drinks in the evening. Breakfast was good too.  I didn't eat in the restaurant - which whilst I am sure is very good, is also not a particularly special place, and as your surrounded by great restaurant locations in Mayfair was not top of my list.  All In all, I will return and use this as my london base!",5,2013,02,06
142,First class hotel,"This was our second stay at the Stafford and hopefully it won't be tha last. The rooms are beautifully furnished and the beds exceptionally comfortable - just right for a good night's sleep. The location of this hotel is ideal, right in the heart of the west end and yet in a wonderful quiet location. The staff are attentative, friendly, helpful and polite making a stay here into a wonderful experience.",5,2013,02,03
142,Just Perfect,"I absolutely love staying at the Stafford!  I was there last week for one night and, once again, it was just wonderful.  I like the unprentious and warm welcome by the staff, the immaculate rooms and the haddock and poached egg at breakfast.  It is perfectly situated just off St James in the heart of the West End and yet lovely and quiet.  Delicious hamburgers are to be had at the bar and service is impeccable throughout. There is no question that this is my hotel of choice for a stay in London.",5,2013,02,01
142,very disappointing,I have no idea why this hotel is so expensive. The normal rooms are small which is acceptable for a period property. However emptying the bath caused the shower tray to fill up with the bath water and the most abominal smell of raw sewerage which is totally not acceptable. Not exactly what is expected is a 5 star expensive hotel.,3,2013,01,28
142,Nice stay,"The room was small but beautiful, we were made to feel very special, and I would defiantly book again for a special occasion. The location is a little bit quiet, I personally like a bit of buzz, but each to their own. Luxury with a luxury price tag!",4,2013,01,24
142,Lovely stay,"This is a friendly and elegant hotel tucked away in the centre of London. We were wonderfully well looked after - the staff are delightful. The location is excellent in a peaceful street in one of the nicest areas, a short walk from all the activity in the heart of London and we warmly recommend it.",5,2013,01,23
142,brilliant as usual,"what do you say..kempinski is becoming a known name for luxury and consistancy ...great stay , pleasant staff. Room sizes are as expected in UK but still very comfortable......The location is wonderful",4,2013,01,20
142,Tutored by a great Master - Gino,"I had one of the most memorable nights of my life in the Stafford's cellar with a friend, Gino Nardella (a master sommelier (one of sixty in the world)), and around 16,000 bottles of wine.

Gino of course is indisputably one of the capos of the wine tasting, if not the capo di tutti cappi, and was a fantastic teacher and story teller of the three wines we sampled (French, Spanish, and South African). We spent a good two hours tasting the wine, touring the wine cellar and asking Gino an innumerable number of questions.

The hotel also offered some canapes (salmon on bread, pate on toast and tempura prawns) to help clear the palette between gulps and they were suitable, tasty and well balanced bite sizes pieces in themselves.

Finally we retired to the lounge with the rest of the wine and were served some bar snacks as well as some water by the very friendly waiting staff.

Whether you are a wine novice or expert I would say this is an experience you will enjoy and remember forever. I don't think there is anywhere this side of the Channel that can really offer such a wine experience.

From now on, every time I raise a glass I will remember Gino and the enthusiasm and inspiration that he has instilled into me.",5,2013,01,19
142,Wonderful,"This was my third overnight stay at the Stafford.  Hopefully I'll find another excuse to stay again.  The staff have mastered that wonderful combination of friendly, caring, & professional.  The location is wonderfully quiet yet perfect for walking into the West End, Covent Garden, or shopping Mayfair... The interior design is warm, comfortable, & of the highest quality.  A stay at The Stafford is a real treat!",5,2013,01,17
142,Wonderful find!,"Stayed overnight in this really delightful hotel! Very friendly welcome, pretty room with every conceivable extra, luxurious bed and linen and toiletries. Delicious breakfast. Tremendous attention to detail and super location. Will definitely return as soon as we can! Highly recommended.",5,2013,01,16
142,WOW - I cannot wait to return,"My husband and I stayed at the Stafford in April of last year for a long weekend.  We had a fabulous stay from the moment we arrived until check-out.  We stayed in a carriage house which had a lot of character and looked absolutely gorgeous. Breakfast was delivered to our room every morning on time and presentation was always lovely. 

we look forward to staying at the stafford again and again!

Thank you to the whole team for making our stay so special.",5,2013,01,15
142,Perfect,"The Stafford London is a wonderful hotel. From entry we were made to feel welcome, all staff are friendly and accommodating! The room was also lovely! Location is great as this hotel is pretty central you can mainly walk everywhere or a tube is just around the corner too. I found no faults with this hotel and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,01,14
142,"Lovely hotel, small room.","Very nice hotel in a great location in central London. Easy check-in, although I arrived pretty late and was the only person there at the time. Slower to check out in morning - only a couple of staff and terminals available in the lobby. Excellent small bar, with great staff. Didn't try the evening meal, but breakfasts were really good as well. 

Downside was the room. High quality furnishings inside, spotlessly clean, great bathroom, but very very small. I'm used to London hotels so know what to expect, but this was something else. Hardly room to walk around the (very large) double bed. I'm absolutely sure there are much better rooms here, but hey if its pot luck what you get, then for 400 quid a night, I'd rather not take the chance. Minor quibbles, but noisy in the corridors (slamming doors, creaky steps) and the room door didn't fit well and so had to light spilling in overnight. 

Has a very small gym in the basement of the stables building with OK equipment, but only really holds a couple of people. No showers or changing and you have to walk through the restaurant to get to it. 

Overall, I liked the hotel a lot, plenty character, good location and helpful staff, but the room size let it down a lot and I wouldn't go back because of this. This is a top priced hotel and for that you should be confident you'll get a decent sized room.",4,2013,01,07
142,Fantastic stay,"Spent two nights here at the beginning of January and loved it. This hotel and staff are really great at doing those little things which make your stay extra special. The attention to detail in the hotel is fabulous, I thought the staff throughout we're polite and conscientious and went the extra mile. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone !!!",5,2013,01,06
142,Old tradition,"A super location in the middle of one of the nicest districts of London , the building is a wonderfull contition , the people very friendly and the rooms wide and bride. They have a excellent roomservice and a nice sigerbar ! the backentrance overlook a magnificant yard with former stables and places for there grooms ,where transformed to nice suites , nice detail the all have names of famous racehorses",5,2012,12,08
142,Homely Hotel,"We stayed at The Stafford which is in the heart of St James's but just off the beaten track.  The hotel staff are warm and welcoming and the decor of the hotel is very 'homely', yet modern.   We stayed in a Queen sized room on the second floor of the main house, but there are other options in The Mews or in the Carriage House (part of the old stable block).  

When you look at 5* hotels in London, some are overly priced and a bit in your face with either too much bling, or very 'old style' decor, but this wonderful gem is discreet and felt very 'homely' with a warm intimate atmosphere.   The food and overall service provided by the staff is excellent just as you would expect from this level of hotel.

Would we return back again? This is one hotel that is definitely worth a return visit.",5,2012,12,06
142,Coming home,"We used to stay at the Stafford years ago and this was our first visit under new management.  The most lovely surprise was that the staff had not changed and was as friendly and helpful as years gone by.
The hotel has been updated; the lighting is greatly improved.  The food and service is excellent.  We were upgraded to a king room, but the maid's closet was opposite and it was a bit noisy in the morning.
We used to stay in the mews but the American bar overflows outside now so I imagine it is not the quiet oasis it used to be.  It is incredibly expensive but the location is wonderful, especially when you know about the tunnel directly to Green Park.  The only thing that was lacking was internet.  The free internet connection was useless, and six pounds an hour is out of line for access.  Amazing, that really could make a difference in whether we returned.  Catering to business expense accounts I suppose.",5,2012,12,03
142,My favourite hotel of all!,"We stayed for one night at The Stafford and I can honestly say this has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in and having experienced some of the top hotels like The Savoy and The Dorchester that is a huge compliment. A lovely quiet intimate atmosphere pervades the hotel and the staff are efficient, smiling and discreet. Fantastic location within 15 mins walk of Oxford Street. We had a gorgeous room in the annexe if the hotel and couldn't have been more delighted with it. The only critique I have is the lack of coffee and tea making facilities but that is just a personal taste. Loved this hotel so much. Thank you for having us!",5,2012,12,02
142,"Quaint, even for London!","I had a room at the rear of the hotel in what used to be the stables. The layout was a bit odd but I liked it nevertheless. The service was so-so but all in all, a nice and very central place to stay. A bit on the pricy side!",4,2012,11,25
142,Oh my!,"What a place! Best hotel I've stayed in!
Booked this hotel through otel.com and received a large discount. We were given 5star treatment for 3star price! From the moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome and looked after by the highly professional, friendly and efficient staff. From the architecture to the decor, the fixtures to fittings, the attention to detail and the high level of execution is exceptional. If you can book breakfast with your room for less than £25 per person do so (that's the price of Full-English).
The American bar attached to the hotel is fantastic if a little pricey (high price to be expected with the location of the hotel).
Other than breakfast (which was excellent) we didn't eat in the hotel as we were catching up with friends and family around London. The hotel location is very well suited to travelling in any direction either by taxi or tube.
I really recommend this hotel,",5,2012,11,25
142,4 night stay,"We booked this hotel through Lastminute.com as one of their Top Secret hotel deals. As we paid quite a discounted price for this hotel we were a little apprehensive as to how we would be treated on arrival. We should not have worried however, as the staff were excellent and very attentive, I feel we were treated just as any full paying guest would have been.

This hotel is in a quiet corner of the St James area but is very close to Green park tube station and the bus routes on Piccadilly.  As it is beside Green Park it is only a short walk to Buckingham Palace, or onward to the Westminster area, the theatre district, Oxford Street etc etc. For sight seeing it is in a great location.

Our room in the main building was about the size I would expect for London hotels and it was very luxurious.  The room was very clean and well serviced, with only thing missing  being in-room coffee and tea facilities.  2 coffee's delivered to the room came at a cost of £11.

Other rooms and suites for this hotel are in the adjoining stables and courtyard which are accessed through a side door beside The American Bar.

We only had a drink in the American Bar on one occassion, there were only a couple of other people in the bar at this time, so not much atmosphere, however on other evenings it did seem quite busy and lively with mostly business people.  Outside the bar in the courtyard is a coverd area of 3 tables and several heaters for the smokers.  We found a few more traditional bars locally which did NOT charge £12 for a Gin and Tonic and tended to frequent those.

All in all an excellent hotel, in the perfect location, but is just a bit pricy for food and drinks.

I would highly recommend this hotel for a short break.",5,2012,11,22
142,The Best,I have stayed in many hotels around the World from the very top end to excellent but more modest eatablishments. The Stafford is simply the best. Quite outstanding. The quality of service is a wonderful balance of friendliness coupled with efficiency. There is a romantic charm about the place and the American Bar is the place to meet friends and business colleagues. Room are superb particularly those off the courtyard. Although my review is effusive it is an honest one. If you are going to stay in London you must try the Stafford.,5,2012,11,22
142,"Elegant service, cozy rooms, and lots of charm","My daughter and I loved this hotel. It has a quiet elegance, with extremely knowledgeable staff.  The rooms are very comfortable, and the food and service at breakfast were wonderful.  We enjoyed the bar for a pre-theatre dinner. Wonderful location by Green Park, which was perfect for my daughter's morning jog, and an easy walk to Buckingham Palace.  In all, a wonderful and quiet oasis in a busy city.",5,2012,11,20
142,A very British experience  in a wonderful location.,"This hotel may be too formal for young couples but it was a very nice experience for us.  We've been to London before but this hotel was a bit more conservative than our previous ones.  Lovely lobby.  Quiet, well mannered, and well trained staff.  The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We didn't enjoy our dinner in the more formal restaurant, my steak was just awful.  I understand the food in the American Bar is better. Our room (413) was elegant and very comfortable.  The bed, pillows and linens were just perfect. A great location in the historic center of the city.",5,2012,11,16
142,Our London home,"The Stafford is an oasis of calm in a quiet backwater just off St James's Street. We have stayed here many times and each time we arrive, we are greeted like long lost friends but with the respect that hotel guests expect. Something that rarely happens in top hotels such as this.

The rooms are excellent and The Mews suites delightful. The staff are all charming, attentive and nothing is too much trouble. If you want to see how a good Concierge works, then look no further than this hotel. They have the best Concierges we have ever encountered. Nothing, bar nothing is beyond them!!

A real highlight is the American Bar. To be able to sit outside in the middle of London and watch the world go by with a nice glass of Pol Roger - priceless.",5,2012,11,12
142,nice --- older rooms,"The hotel is lovely and the staff is very attentive. Perfect service. However, I thought the rooms were a bit dated. There are nice touches though, I loved  the rubber duck by the bath tub! I thought the menu in the restaurant was a bit too British...",4,2012,11,08
142,Best bed ever,"We just stayed the one night but had a peaceful and enjoyable time here and would certainly choose this hotel again. The bed was sublime, the linen was wonderful and the duvet and pillows made to be sunk into. We ate in the American Bar and it was a good choice as it was cosy and intimate on a dark and wet evening. I had pulled pork and very tasty it was while my husband enjoyed fish and chips, the only improvement for him would have been extra chips. The tables are low and we were given trays which added to the feeling of dining at a friends house. The situation of the hotel is lovely, hidden away, very secluded and quiet yet handy for a walk in Green Park or a trip to Fortnum and Masons.",5,2012,10,29
142,Super 5* London Hotel,"London hotels can be hit-and-miss affairs, but the Stafford is definitely a HIT. 

I stayed here after booking a 5-star ""Top Secret Hotel"" on lastminute.com. I had an midday flight  from Heathrow the next day, so thought I would spoil myself with dinner with a friend in London and a night at a 5-star hotel. 

It was exactly what I needed. The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating and made me feel very welcome and special. The room - oh my God! I have never slept in such an amazing bed, it was like sleeping in clouds. 

I luxuriated in the marble-lined bath for longer than is good for me then indulged in room service breakfast whist reading the paper. No one knew were I was and my phone was switched off, it was 18 hours of utter, pure bliss. The staff - who knew I was having a self-indugent jolly -  behaved like willing co-conspiritors. 

All to soon it had to come to an end and I was en route to Heathrow. 

Will definitely stay again.",5,2012,10,29
142,Charming!,My husband and I stayed here our first two nights in London as part of a multi-country trip.  We stayed in the main house on the 6th floor.  As others have noted I believe we may have been upgraded to a Deluxe King room and our breakfast was included as well.  The room was beautifully furnished and made us feel right at home.  Everything was on point.  The staff are impeccable.  The location is great for persons wanting to see major sites.  I would recommend The Stafford to anyone visiting London.  Cheers!,5,2012,10,23
142,Beautiful Quiet Hotel,"Stayed here for one night on a travel zoo promotion.  The hotel was just tucked off a side street in Mayfair.  The room was quite small (what you expect in London) but very luxurious, bed was lovely and comfortable  and extremely quiet (didnt hear any other guests at all in the room).  We had complementary tea to the room which was a nice touch.
Breakfast was excellent and the staff were great/friendly.
Excellent hotel would highly recommend.  Would love to stay again.",5,2012,10,21
142,Enjoyable Stay,"Took my wife to The Stafford for a surprise birthday treat and the surprise was well appreciated. Hotel is in a very good part of London and is close to all attractions if that is what you are after.
On arrival our room wasn't ready but the hotel took our bags (We were informed that our bags would be ready in the room but this unfortunately this didn't happen and they were left near reception in a secure room) took my number and would be contacted when ready. We took this as an opportunity to have a walk about up Jermyn street and found some very good pubs/bars especially the Red Lion. 
When we returned and went to our room, it was in very good order although a little cramped (this is explained in the other reviews) but the bed was fantastic and had everything we needed.
Booked the restaurant for 1800 that evening and was waited upon with excellent service and food was very good. The Concierge that evening was very helpful and arranged for a taxi to take us to a show.
On our return we went to the American Bar and had a drink, although didn't accept the compliments that were thrust on to our table as though it was a matter of course, would of been nice to of been asked if we cared for these rather that find out later that I had been charged for something we didn't ask for. (only a minor point)
Excellent nights sleep and a very hearty breakfast with very good service again.
Overall an excellent experience and what makes it even better was the deal through last minute, which if I am honest the staff are fully aware about but still give everybody the highest courtesy.
Will be staying again (subject to offers !!) 
Mr&Mrs Jones",5,2012,10,17
142,Great hideaway,"Despite its central location near Green Park and Piccadilly, this small hotel has a very calm and homey feeling.
Staff is competent and international and some have been working there for ages.
At the American Bar you might also have a glimpse of Prince Harry like we did :)",4,2012,10,17
142,"The American Bar, the best burger.....","Friendly, accommodating, cosy, delicious burgers and the best bloody mary in London. Fabulous. Keep it at this level guys, especially as you are only100 yards from my office. We need a good  local. Pub not separately listed on trip advisor?",5,2012,10,14
142,A very special hotel,"Cannot speak highly enough of this hotel.  We only stayed the one night, on a special promotional deal to include dinner & breakfast but if that wasn't enough, we were then upgraded for no apparent reason, given a complimentary glass of champagne and then the penny dropped when my husbands birthday cake arrived during dinner!   They had picked up on the fact it was a special occasion and a complete total surprise for my husband. The  service, food, courteous staff and ambiance really does make this hotel stand out from the crowd - the location was pretty good too!!",5,2012,10,13
142,Awesome service,"Booked two rooms and asked if we could change one so we could have a separate shower ( not over the bath), no problem we were immediately upgraded to a larger room at no extra cost, and this was during a busy weekend !!!!
I cannot praise the staff of the Stafford enough, they are a delight. The only point my wife could make was that she preferred the reception staff uniforms when the girls wore pearl necklaces, she thought it looked classier !!
",5,2012,10,11
142,Birthday Treat,"We stayed here for one night as a birthday treat for my mum, it is a lovely hotel and the reception staff were excellent and made us feel very welcome ( a special thanks to Jessica).  The hotel is centrel for shopping and theatre and the rooms are lovely clean and the beds so comfy, the breakfast was very nice but it did take quite a long time to take our order.  Would stay here again for sure.",5,2012,10,10
142,"Charming, beautiful, excellent!","We stayed here five nights and it's one of the best places I've ever been.  European hotel rooms are usually not as big as American hotel rooms. It was beautifully appointed with marble bath, fridge, very comfortable bed, desk, end tables on both sides of the bed, free Wifi.  The bath had a shower and a huge tub with shower attachment.  Housekeeping changed the sheets every day.  The room was kept spotless. She even polished the chrome legs on the basin every day.  Turn down service was excellent.  The Hotel is in a good location.  Within a few blocks is Bond Street where every store is high end.  One right after the other: De Beers, Chanel, Tiffany, Salvatore Ferragamo, Gucci, DKNY, Tod's, etc.  A few blocks down Piccadilly, is a Starbucks, (change ""non-fat"" to ""skinny"") and a beautiful store called Fortnum Mason.  Make reservations for high tea either there or at The Ritz, a few blocks the other way.  There is a dress code for high tea.  Men in suits with tie.  Women dressed nicely.  The Stafford is within walking distance across Green Park to Buckingham Palace. ",5,2012,10,08
142,Perfect,"This is an amazing hotel. On arrival we had coffee's brought to our room. We booked a package which included dinner, breakfast and a bottle of champagne in the room, all of which were as described and delicious. I would go back tomorrow, friendly staff and no complaints whatsoever.",5,2012,09,28
142,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location.,"I have stayed here twice in two months and just love the Stafford. Tucked discreetly away behind Green Park, but perfectly located for the tube and Piccadilly it’s ideal, you wouldn’t really know you were in London. There is a handy little tunnel/walkway which connects St. James Place to the park, so you are at the Tube station in minutes.

Rooms are beautifully decorated, quiet and the bed has to be ones of the most comfortable I have ever slept in in a hotel. Public areas are spotless, elegantly furnished and comfortable. 
The fresh flower displays everywhere were stunning and added a touch of luxury, the attention to detail at this hotel is exceptional. 
The American bar seemed very popular and the cobbled courtyard seating area was just lovely for having a relaxing drink. We only dined in the restaurant for breakfast but the food and service very good indeed.

Staff are welcoming, friendly and attentive, nothing is too much trouble. I had the pleasure of being dealt with by the assistant manager, Mr. Mindermann, who I found very professional and knowledgeable and who is clearly proud of the hotel. 

The Stafford is traditional, elegant and boutique. Although is part of the Kempinski group, it has retained its individualism, which I find lacking in many 5 star hotels in London.

I highly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to return.",5,2012,09,28
142,Wonderful Hotel in a great location,"If you want a fabulous hotel in a great location, with friendly attentive staff choose the Stafford. Very close to Green Park station the hotel is perfect.  The rooms are well equipped and very comfortable the service is great.  The food at breakfast is very very good, we had breakfast in our room which was wonderful.  Everything was delightful, beautiful surroundings, lovely staff cannot wait to visit again",5,2012,09,24
142,Brilliant!,"I took a friend of mine to The Stafford as a Birthday treat. When we arrived, everybody was so friendly and welcoming. Our room wasn't ready as we arrived early but we were offered a complimentary drink while we were waiting which was a nice touch. My friend was thrilled and she even got a little Birthday cake in the room! We also had drinks in the American Bar. The atmosphere is unique so it's definitely worth having a drink. We will be back next year!",5,2012,09,24
142,"Now, this is what you want in a London hotel!!",Where to start.  Great location at Green Park with alley leading right from the hotel to the park.  100 yds from Green Park Station for the Tube.  Splendid furnishings in the rooms.  Wonderful bathrooms with super rain-fall shower.  Excellent staff.  Zero to complain about if you stay here.,5,2012,09,23
142,Luxury in a perfect location.,"We stayed at the Stafford early in September when the Paralympics were coming to a close. London was buzzing and our stay at the Stafford could not have been better. Nestled away in St James Place, we were welcomed by staff, given every piece of information and then shown to our room - delightful. Beautiful furnishings and comfort that surpassed many previous stays in the capital. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast. Its ample portions and selection, quality and presentation by the most attentive staff was simply outstanding.",4,2012,09,23
142,"Elegant & comfortable, brought to life with great staff & service","We booked this hotel for a last minute stopover due to it being in the location we required for the start of the British 10K run in July.

Whilst this was a convenient stopover for us, it struck me as an excellent hotel for someone visiting London as a leisure or business traveller.   It has a very bespoke & exclusive feel about it and yet has all the assurances that come with a larger scale operation. The location is fantastic, but equally there is a sense of peace and tranquility whilst being in the centre of the West End.

The interior of the rooms & the hotel is high end, modern elegance.   It all seemed to be about luxurious comfort and a sense of being well provided for.

The breakfast we received in our room was fresh & delicious, comprising of excellent ingredients.   The quality and service of drinks we received in the bar made for a very relaxed and enjoyable experience.

I was most impressed with the reception staff, who arranged a temporary room for us to shower and change after the run and after we had checked out - all done in such an effortless, 'no problem at all' manner.

I will now be keeping my eyes open for other Kempinski hotels!",5,2012,09,23
142,Excellent service and location,"The Stafford lives up to its claims for comfort, quiet, and convenience of location. The staff are extremely efficient and amiable, and more than deliver on the promise of good service. The location couldn't be bettered.  Just south of Piccadilly, west of St. James's Street and east of Green Park (from its main entrance on St. James's Place a short passageway leads directly into the park), it is perfectly located for theatre-going, shopping, galleries and museums (it's a very short walk from both the Royal Academy and the National Gallery, for example), and the major tourist sites (Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Trafalgar Square etc).  Despite this centrality, the room I was in, though quite small and with an undistinguished roof-line view, was extremely quiet (although it was in the main building; the more modern converted mews part looks out over the bar patio, which might well be more noisy, particularly in summer).  It was also well-equipped and very comfortable, as one would expect in the price range. One slightly disconcerting surprise was that the shower cut out for a few minutes in mid-shower on one of the mornings I was there (I assume because of the age of the building/plumbing, though when it was working it was efficient enough). I gathered from a staff member that this on occasion happens in the main building when many showers are operating at the same time.
   Circumstances prevented my eating there during my three-day stay, but the restaurant area looked attractive and the bars are comfortable and serve what looked to be good quality and well presented bar-food also.  I do have one minor gripe, which I would level at many establishments in London.  An automatic service charge of 12 and a half per cent is included in bills for drinks/meals (and I have no problem at all with that), but then the bill when it arrives also includes a space for a gratuity, without any mention in that space that a service charge has already been exacted. So anyone just glancing at the bill, and not reviewing it carefully, is effectively being given the impression that he/she has not already given a perfectly appropriate gratuity.  Estabishments really shouldn't misdirect their patrons in this way.  If service has been worth more than the service charge imposed, patrons are perfectly capable of deciding this for themselves and acting accordingly, without being nudged into tipping twice (and hence potentially double).  Cashing in on the unwariness of one's patrons is not a wise business practice for reputable hotels and restaurants to be pursuing, yet it seems to have become a London disease, even in places, such as the Stafford, that should know better.
   Overall, I'd have no hesitation in staying here again, particularly if I wanted the convenience of this location.  Given the size of the regular rooms -- or, at least, the regular room that I happened to be in -- I might well opt for a suite next time, particularly if I were travelling with my wife.  But I have no substantial complaints about the quality of comfort and service.",4,2012,09,22
142,lovely experience...,"It was our first time at The Stafford London and pretty sure it won't be the last. Everything was great since the moment my husband and i stepped in. We got the double upgrade we suppose to have when available(since my husband is a black GHA member). The suite was specious enough compared the tiny london rooms. The service was excellent. The concierge was really helpful and saved us with the restaurants bookings through out our stay. In the first night, we had our dinner in the main restaurant which was really tasty. The breakfast is good too.",5,2012,09,18
142,Excellent hotel and a would highly recommend,We were visiting London for our Silver Wedding Anniversary and wanted somewhere special to say and The Stafford ticked all our boxes as we wanted to have the atmosphere of a luxury country hotel whilst being in the City. When we arrived we were given an upgrade to the master suite in the main house and it was absolutely beautiful and so comfortable. The staff were always polite and very helpful and the restaurant service was impeccable. Although feeling away from the city you step out to the shops and just around the corner is Fortnum and Maison which is fantastic for any goodies you may want to take home. Step out of the other side of the hotel through the little alley into the Park and you are so close to Buckingham Palace so the best of both worlds are on your doorstep. The hotel has its own cellars and we had a lovely very informative tour  of all the hotels wines. We loved that you could sit outside on an evening and enjoy a drink from the hotels American bar this is so rare in London! The hotel has wonderful charm and character which is so lacking in many of the hotels in London. All in all just perfect for us and an anniversary to remember. We hope to return again. Thank you very much to the hotel Manager and staff.,5,2012,09,18
142,Lovely hotel in a great location.,This is a lovely 5 star hotel in a perfect location for visiting all areas of London due to the close proximity of the Underground.  Buckingham Palace is just a short stroll across St James's Park and the Changing of the Guards is not to be missed!  The hotel staff are friendly and polite and the service provided is of a high standard.  The bedrooms are comfortable and clean and we will definitely visit again.,4,2012,09,17
142,"Excellent hotel, great staff, brilliant location","We were really impressed with this hotel. We found the staff very professional but relaxed and friendly. The standards of service were very high, rooms spotless and the beds really comfy. We were really well looked after. We'd certainly stay again. Thanks guys. Little tip, if arriving by tube (Green Park) the quickest way to access the hotel is via a little alleyway from the park which takes you straight to the hotel entrance.",5,2012,09,15
142,lovely English hotel,"I was greeted at reception in this fairly small quintessential hotel with an upgrade to a suite which was lovely followed by a delivery of a nice pot of tea to the room.
Service was impeccable except for the check out where we had to queue as there are only 2 desks for payments. 
Lovely bar at the rear in the evening and very comfortable beds. Just off Piccadilly and within walking distance of  the theatres and restaurants.
I booked on Lastminute.com and got a reasonable price.",5,2012,09,05
142,Total Luxury,"We have just returned from our third stay at the Stafford, and this was the best stay yet. This really is a wonderful hotel - totally luxurious and the staff treat you like a valued guest rather than as an inconvenience, which has been the case at other London hotels I have stayed in. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we felt totally spoiled - the tray of tea when we arrived was especially welcome. The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was large & comfortable. The bathroom was great and I especially liked the seperate bath & shower. We ate in the American Bar & the burgers are wonderful, breakfast was also excellent, so nice to be waited on rather than having to fight your way to a buffet. I really cannot recommend this hotel enough, if you want to be looked after in a beautiful hotel book to stay at The Stafford. I hope it won't be too long before I can book stay number 4! Thanks to everyone who made our weekend so enjoyable.",5,2012,09,03
142,Excellent,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in, in the world 
I agree with everything the other reviewers have said.
I will definitely stay again.
All the staff were wonderful.
I took my Australian friend and she was very impressed.",5,2012,09,03
142,True 5 Star gem in the centre of London,"Having only made the booking the day before our arrival through lastminute.com , our expectations were a bit low and never having heard of ""The Stafford Hotel"" - my wife and I were a little sceptical to say the least! So much so we drove to the hotel and whilst I was finding it through the back streets of St. James's somewhere behind The Ritz, my wife was scanning for possible alternatives on Trip Advisor!

On arrival we were met at the door by the Hotel Concierge and our bags were unloaded straight into the Hotel lobby whilst we were checked in. Always a nervous moment when the clerk looks at the screen and, out of view, they allocate your room - But wait! the clerk at the front desk raises his eye-brows and tells us ""There's some very good news - the hotel is offering a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite!"" Well, we're off to a good start!

The room we stayed in was to the rear of the hotel in the court yard - Room 8 - up the stairs and in one of the upper floor ""English Cottage Style"" rooms. Well what could we say - a four poster bed, exposed traditional beams, antiques, a real fireplace, separate changing room and a bathroom ""with room to swing a cat""!

Complementary hot drinks were delivered to our room as was The Sunday Times newspaper the following morning.

We soon settled in and were dressed to hit the town! A short walk past The Ritz, no more than 10 minutes and we were at London's Piccadilly Circus,

We did not eat in the hotel or use any of the other facilities - so my rating of 5 Stars is based on our experience and free upgrade!

Just some notes if you plan to visit The Stafford London -
Parking is expensive - Expect to pay £60 per night for the hotel to park your car. Weekends are considerably cheaper if you can find a street parking bay in one of the adjacent local streets. Warning local ""Residents bays"" are restricted and you're likely to be towed, even in the middle of the night.
Breakfast is £20 pp for Continental and £25 pp for cooked full English - a bit on the expensive side if you're paying for it out of your own pocket - but as I normally travel on business, about the going rate for most city centre hotels.

Bottom line - Highly recommended for great service and a homely feel right in the centre of London. Give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised like we were!",5,2012,08,31
142,Good value for money,"We stayed on a travel zoo deal which was excellent value for money.  The location is the best if you want to see the sights.  We could walk everywhere including into theatre land.  The hotel staff were all very friendly and could not do enough to help, lending us umbrellas when it rained.  We were late leaving the room one evening and received a card under the door from housekeeping saying we had to contact them if we still wished to have the turn down service, we decided not to worry them but when we got back later they had been in anyway.  The standard of housekeeping was excellent, the only negative we can think of is they served my husband juice at breakfast but completely forgot me and if you asked for something it coul be a bit slow, other than that fabulous, quiet and relaxing!",5,2012,08,28
142,Excellent anniversary stay,"Nothing was too much trouble at The Stafford.  The hotel is in an excellent area, incredibly quiet - it  was hard to believe we were in London.  Our room was luxurious with lovely toiletries.  The bed was huge and extremely comfortable with great linen and pillows. It is just around the corner from The Ritz and Piccadilly/

The breakfast was the best we have ever had at any hotel, amazing quality and delicious.

  The underground etc is 5 minutes away - opposite the hotel is a passageway directly into Green Park leading to Buckingham Palace.",5,2012,08,27
142,Totally 5 star luxury,"From the moment we booked in at reception...we were upgraded because it was my partners birthday to a carriage house room which was truly amazing... We were offered coffee which arrived with a mini birthday cake for my partner..the room was beautiful a total experince to the monogrammed bathrobes to the bedding....the staff went that extra mile.
The whole experience was perfect.",5,2012,08,27
142,Superb!,"Simply superb!  On every level, this hotel succeeds in providing the absolute best.
I was particularly impressed by the service.   The rooms were exquisitely furnished and presented - we booked one in the old block & one in the new, both were excellent.  We will definitely refer other colleagues and friends to the Stafford.  Rates may be high - but there is a very good reason for this.  To Jan and his amazing team - thanks for a most enjoyable stay.",5,2012,08,27
142,Return visit to this gem of a hotel in Central London,"We were lucky enough to have a return visit to the Stafford Hotel again this year. What a truly delightful hotel it is......an understated elegant, peaceful haven in the center of London. The service was impeccable, with welcoming staff who greet you on arrival to the hotel. We had a lovely room, beautifully furnished and decorated with the feel of an elegant, stylish English home. Ideally situated to explore London, within walking distance to many attractions, Greenpark tube is five minutes away with a shortcut opposite the hotel (ask the staff and they will point it out to you)
The rooms are of varying sizes, if you travel with a lot of luggage best to let the hotel know at time of booking so they can advise you, they also have a luggage storage room. The beds are very comfortable with high quality linens and plenty of large fluffy towels in the bathroom also 
Floris toiletries supplied for you to try. There is internet access in the rooms,  TV with international stations as well as the usual English ones.  The breakfast were delicious with a lovely variety of selections, all perfectly cooked and presented. We are looking forward to returning again to delightful hotel in the future, in the meantime I would definitely urge you to give it a try if you are contemplating a visit to London.  You can probably tell that this is quite simply my favourite hotel of choice in London.  If you enjoy, old fashioned, discreet welcoming service from all members of staff, with an elegant ambiance, in a central location, then this is the place for you.",5,2012,08,27
142,My London home,"From the moment I arrived I was made to feel welcome and special. Jessica welcomed me at reception as did the warm and friendly Porter who carried my bags. 
It is impossible to single the staff out because all seemed to go that extra mile and enjoy their work.
I stayed in a suite, 416, it was the nicest place I have stayed in London extremely comfortable, everything and more you would expect from a 5star hotel. 
The Master Sommelier Gino Nardella is such a interesting person, so clever yet quite unpretentious. I only had a glass of wine with my meal but he took time to inform and advise.
The food and comfort in the hotel is excellent and I will certainly only stay at The Stafford (my London home) now that I have discovered this gem.
With regard to Green Park there is a short cut which only takes minutes, ask the staff if you need to know. I found this useful.",5,2012,08,25
142,Fantastic Place to Stay in London,"Treated beautifully as soon as we arrived. Staff so professional but not stuffy just perfect. Room fab with lovely bed, huge bathroom and great pillows. 
American bar downstairs is usually busy but great for pre theatre drinks. 
Breakfast was yummy [lenty of choice too. Had a great stay.",5,2012,08,22
142,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel in the heart of London tucked away in a quiet street, but with easy access to Green Park tube station The public spaces are elegant and extremely well appointed. The staff are polite, corteous and respectful. Bedrooms are comforatble with gorgeous light fluffy quilts and quality linen. Breakfast service is good and the food quality was excellent. I would definitley stay here again.",5,2012,08,20
142,Lovely Hotel in a Quite Corner of Central London,"The staff are warm, welcoming and incredibly helpful, the common areas are beautiful and very well kept, and our room was fresh and wonderfully appointed.  However, the best thing about this hotel is its quite location.  Just off of Green Park, the Stafford is walking distance to the Pall Mall, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Hyde Park Corner and all things central London, yet it’s location on a quite back street means the noise and crowds are two blocks away from your doorstep.  Also, don’t miss the American Bar (loads of WWII vintage photos and artifacts from “the colonies”)  or a tour of the wine cellar (just ask).  Everything about our stay was perfect.  Our new favorite London hotel.",5,2012,08,02
142,Fantastic,"Great location, fantastic staff, wonderful room.  Yes it is on the pricey side but is in central London so what do you expect...  One of the best hotels I have used in London and would highly recommend.  Look on the deal websites and get good savings as I did geting 5* for £10 more than a premier inn.  Even at full price I will be returning.  The courtyard is a wonderfull place for a light bite and a glass of the excellent house claret.",5,2012,07,18
142,Quaint Location in Bustling London,"I visited the American Bar before going out to dinner with friends. I hadn't been before but we managed to get a table outside (yes it was sunny) and we were never forgotten about by the waiter. They even served me beer in a crystal glass which was a nice touch.

Great bar, quaint location, very smart - I shall return.

Good place to go before working your way up to the west end.",4,2012,07,18
142,"Quiet, elegant, top location",The Stafford is hidden gem off Green Park. The ambience in the American Bar is special. Not cheap but fantastic.,5,2012,07,15
142,Peaceful Luxury in Central London,"I stayed here for one night with a friend and I cannot not compliment this hotel enough. We were able to check in a bit earlier than usual and the friendliness of the staff as well as the beautiful hotel made our stay an absolute pleasure.
It was minutes away from Picadilly, but wonderfully quiet. I chose the hotel partly on the basis that the description described the staff as friendly, something that is hard to find nowadays and they really were all excellent. 
The room was lovely, luxurious, with bathrobe and slippers and fresh coffee whenever we wished. We had a fantastic night's sleep and did not want to leave.
I would certainly stay here every time I go to London if possible.",5,2012,07,02
142,Lunchtime in London,"We had lunch at the Stafford Hotel yesterday and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  I review hotels worldwide so I can speak with considerable experience.  The food, service and setting was exceptional.  Well done.

Rosemary London",5,2012,06,08
142,Homely feel with 5 star service,"We stayed at the Stafford for 3 nights when visiting a hospitality event in London back in February. When deciding where to stay in London there is no need to look anywhere else. Yes their might be more famous 5 star hotel that you can stay at but I reckon the Stafford tops them all. Due to its layout and design it feels understated and homely yet it is still luxurious and elegant. 

From the moment you walk in you are warmly welcomed and nothing is too much trouble. We were given a guided tour so we knew where everywhere was and shown to our room where we were brought fresh tea and coffee.  Some people may prefer it in their room to make themselves but this way you get freshly ground coffee. 

Although I had researched the location of the Stafford before going to London I didn’t appreciate how excellent it really was. I saw was it was near the tube and thought that this would be fine but when we got there we decided that you could pretty much walk the main areas in the heart of London and trust me we are not the biggest of walkers. It was so nice to see London this was you get to see some unexpected tourist attractions as you walk to your next destination.

Each evening before heading out we went to the American bar for some drinks. Firstly they had a good range of unusual gins so it was nice to add a couple of new one to my “gin list” secondly the service was fantastic. My wife never takes ice in her drinks and in most places you have to remind the barman on the 2nd round “no ice” but here not only that night but also the following nights every time her drink came without ice whoever served us.  

Breakfast in the mornings was lovely the produced used was carefully scoured to make sure it is the best it can be and it really shows many good hotels let themselves down in the mornings but this is not one of them service is still professional, slick and yet friendly.

Another example of the exemplary service I left my sunglasses in the bar and did not realise by the time I returned to my room later still unaware I had lost them they were there waiting for me, a nice touch I thought.  

We hope to visit the Stafford again soon when we can find another excuse for a trip to London thank you very much to the whole team for making our stay so special.",5,2012,05,22
142,Perfect Home from Home in central London,"We stayed a night at The Stafford in April as base for meeting up with friends in St James, and what a wonderful experience it was. A quiet and discrete location, with a friendly but professional welcome from both reception and concierge alike. So many so-called 5 star hotels miss the important details;  being shown to your room, having the room amenities explained, and all with such a personal touch. Our room , in the Main House, was beautifully designed and equipped, with every amenity you would expect.The American Bar is just such a great place for a relaxing drink, it is filled with character and history. We took breakfast in the main restaurant - and unlike so many others we have experienced, it was a relaxed and calming experience where everything came to us, including a wonderful plate of Eggs Benedict. We thoroughly recommend The Stafford as a perfect home from home in London.",5,2012,05,09
142,Perfect room - exceptional service,"Second stay at this hotel in April 2012. Everything was perfect. The room was large, decorated in an appropriate and lovely style, and well laid out. Staff were unbelievably helpful and courteous. No amenity was omitted. The location is absolutely perfect – central but quiet. Will definitely make this my home away from home in London.",5,2012,05,06
142,Fantastic Stay.  Staff goes above and beyond.,"We stayed at the Stafford in March of 2012 for 5 nights.   The accommodations were perfect for our purposes to tour London.  The location in St. James and access to the Underground made getting around the city easy while providing a refuge as well. The staff juggled the multiple comings and goings of my children and nieces perfectly. We had two rooms for 5 nights and a third room for two nights.  The concierge arranged transportation for us seamlessly.  My wife unfortunately injured her back during our trip and her mobility became limited.  I was overwhelmed by the care and concern of all the staff for her comfort and the efforts they extended to her in this regard.  Lionel and Ben the managers in the American Bar made her feel at home and made sure she was fine and deserve special recognition for this, as well as my thanks. From management to housekeeping our stay was an  exemplary experience in the industry.   We have stayed at several Hotels in London but the Stafford will be our go to Hotel from now on.",5,2012,05,04
142,They make you feel special,"Location is excellent - in the middle of it all, but yet secluded in a very calm street. From the front desk lady to the sales manager, everybody is extremely kind and helpful. Not only I was upgraded to a wonderful suite in the side building (I had a xmas tree in my living room!), but they also included breakfast and a tea service in my stay. I didn't have the opportunity to have other meals or room service at the hotel, but the english breakfast was really good. top notch 5* property! Do consider booking it if you want to be central but feel like home.",5,2012,05,02
142,Sorry for the delay.... the BEST in London.,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in the winter of 2011 when they were doing a major renovation... couldn't have been a better expierence.  The entire staff ... from the door man to the makeshift conceirge they had -- was just ABOVE and beyond professional.  I guess what I am trying to say is if I experienced this level of perfect service during a renovation ... imagine how even better it will now be!!  I stayed in the new wing... Room 533.... awesome.  Even the automated elevator lady made me feel at home: ""doors opening"" ... Close to everyhting London: Trufitt & Hill for a hairdut,  museums, RAClub, The Golden Lion for a Guiness but nothing beats their inhouse bar/rest:  The American Bar.  Outfiited with gads of cool American sports memorabilia including my squash racquet that I left in the room and they graciously added to the bar!  Make sure you have a nice gin and tonic and cigar on the outside patio of the American Bar... service exceptional and the best olives and chips ever!  I've stayed at lots of other places in London but this place trumps... simply the best!  See you in 2013!  M. Morgan",5,2012,05,01
142,Comfort at your fingertips,"Delighted with our stay here.  Extremely comfortable, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud.  Room service excellent and the food was delicious!  Very friendly helpful team in every department.  Great location! Not far from anywhere, and yet extremely peaceful.",5,2012,04,24
142,So good we won't go elsewhere,"Just got back from six great nights at the Stafford, now flawlessly run by the Kempinski group. It has the feel of a private home, with lovely public rooms and fireplaces, and a great bar, the American Bar, dating from the Second World War. The Stafford is in a quiet lane off St. James Street, just a few blocks from Picadilly, Green Park, Jermyn Street and Bond Street shopping, the best restaurants, as well as frequent buses to Knightsbridge and the theater district. We found it easy to get around from there, and it was a wonderful place to return to at the end of the day. 
  Our room was freshly decorated to the highest standard, with warmly muted tones, great pictures on the walls, and an oh-so-comfortable bed. The large bathroom was all-marble and the water pressure was excellent. Amenities included bottled water with turn-down service. 
 This is a first-rate place, and perfect for anyone who wants to feel ""at home"" in London.",5,2012,04,23
142,very boutiqy,"This was a great stay. The main things that were good in the hotel and really stood out were the beds, restaurants, and service at the hotel. The beds here were some of the best hotel ones I've ever slept on. The bar in the hotel, American Bar, was a very interesting bar. It is fairly small with an outdoor patio, and is filled with polo and horse racing memorabilia. They actually serve you food on a tray there which you eat on your lap. I suggest you get the fish and chips if you go there. The service at the hotel was also excellent. Aside from the basic hotel things such as fetching a taxi and bringing you bags to your room, the staff seemed to all remember our names by the time they brought us up to our room. Overall, I thought of the hotel most like a boutique; The rooms were somewhat small, and it was tucked away in small ally way. This hotel might not be as large and popular as other high class hotels in london such as the Dorchester, but its in a great location and is vary quiet.",4,2012,04,22
142,"""Feels tucked away, but in the centre""","Great location if you want to feel you have got away from the hustle and bustle of town!

We stayed in the carriage houses, quite spacious for central london, the rooms have everything you need, but the bathroom had the original hand painted tiles, very nice, but a bit dated!

We stayed in Summer and when we stepped outside our bedroom into the cobbled area there were loads of people sitting and drinking outside our room, a little bit too close for comfort and you almost felt you were intruding as you stepped out!

The hotel bar is very pleasant definitely for the Americans, home from home.

The hotel put fresh strawberries in the room, nice touch.

Breakfast was excellent.

Due to the location we would definitely stay again, but we would avoid the carriage house rooms.",4,2012,04,22
142,"Friendly Staff, Great Food, Amazing Accomodations - The Best In London","I stay in 5 star hotels all over the world and The Stafford is my favorite.  I have stayed here off and on for five years now and with my business starting a base in London, The Stafford is my home while here.  I have stayed at The Stafford nearly 100 nights since I discovered the hotel and have yet to have any problems.  Any minor issues I have had are always quickly addressed with care and concern.  In most hotels I feel like just a number but at The Stafford I feel like part of the family.  It has the perfect location in the St. James area and the best of British charm.   Christian Resetarits was my first real contact at The Stafford who made me feel at home and why I stopped staying at other five star hotels in London the past couple of years.  He is a class act along with all his collegues who I have encountered while staying here.  If I ever have a question or need something, Christian never minds a call or email and is always quick to respond.  I don't get homesick much but when I do, it's for The Stafford.  If you are staying at other five star hotels in the London area, you are missing out...  Darren Julien - Beverly Hills, California",5,2012,04,19
142,best address in London,"I am writing because I have noticed several reviews that mention the size of the rooms in the main building.  I first stayed at the Stafford in 1966 and have returned many times since.  I have probably stayed in every room in the main building including a tiny attic garret.  The charm of the Stafford is that it is an old hotel that hasn't been remodeled until it no longer has any character.  Almost all of the rooms are good sized and all of them are beutifully decorated. and very comfortable.  
The Stafford has many virtues.  It has the best location in London.  You can walk anywhere in the West End or central London and the tube station is a block away.  The American Bar is welcoming and has terrific food.  You can get a lovely afternoon tea in the lounge.  Frank and the concierge staff will get you restaurant reservations anywhere.  The hotel is not pretentious and it has warmth and history, and I would hate to see it change.  It is an oasis in London to which I hope to return many more times.",5,2012,04,17
142,Helpful staff but beware odd quirky small rooms that can disappoint,"I've stayed here numerous times in the past and visited Lyttelton and American Bar for dinner and drinks with friends. It's a small boutique hotel with a great location and relatively quiet and peaceful for those who like less foot traffic and crowded places but still easy reach of tourist sites like Royal Academy of Arts, Picadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, etc You are also near two parks, St James and Green Park.

My last stay however wasn't as good as in the past. I think I was lucky in the past that I got allocated decent sized rooms in the main hotel. This time I ran out of luck. 

The front desk team now seems to have less knowledge of the hotel rooms, facilities and history. 

My sister bought me a weekend stay for my birthday recently as she knew I enjoyed staying here in the past for a nice quiet break for luxury stay and shopping along Bond Street. 

I checked in and the gent offered me a tour and tried to make up the facts as he went along. Makes me think they should include some training if they are going to offer guests a walkaround and not make up facts. That just makes the situation awkward when the guest seems to know the hotel better than the staff.

All the rooms I refer to here are in the main part of the hotel. When I got to the room #112, it was one of the tinier ones despite being told I was upgraded to a King room. The bathroom was beyond tiny and more claustrophobic (about the size of a closet). There was hardly any natural light as the view was a inner well and tiny window. I requested a change of room and they kindly accomodated me and moved me to #122 which had the dreaded twin beds mashed as a king bed. But what annoyed me was the room faced a tiny inner courtyard and a bank of air-conditioning compressors. I was assured the room would be quiet and is relatively sound proofed. I was proven right however as at night, there was a constant humming that keep me awake half the night. If you are a very light sleeper, avoid this room.

Bleary-eyed the next morning, I checked for another room move to. Hopefully, one not facing a compressor. Again staff were very accomodating and took me to see room 603 and 604 which had more light and felt a big larger. Bathrooms were still tiny and you had to sit upright at 90deg in them. I chose 603 and as I was staying one more night I didnt make such a big fuss. Then the clincher, that humming noise was back on the second night and after looking out my window to locate it, I realised there was a large piece of equipment below that room window that was generating that humming. I don't know if it was a compressor or not but it went on all night.

I ate breakfast in the hotel in the morning having lost two nights worth off sleep and it was an unremarkable affair and bacon was horrid and tasted like it had been re-cooked or re-heated and there was a horrid aftertaste to it. I had lunch at the American Bar again and it was nice atmosphere and decent bar food which hadn't lost it's service touch or quality of food. Nibbles are free although some have remarked they were charged for it. Maybe I was a returning customer so I got it for free??

They provide fridges in the rooms wtih bottles of water but no in-room mini bar items. So for people who like to buy their own drinks and want a place to cool them, you have that facility.  However some fridges are not new. Room 122 had a old mouldy looking fridge that should be replaced as it just looks unhygenic. Free wi-fi was slow and not very strong. As I moved 3 different rooms, they had 3 different levels of signal quality for both your mobile and wi-fi. I requested the hospitality trays for in-room tea making and those were provided promptly on a complimentary basis.

They use a mixture of Taylor & Harris bath gel, shampoo and conditioners and Floris soaps and lotion.

This was my first time staying on a Sunday night and I found out that they don't have a 24 hour housekeeping team in-house. I asked for my room to be made up late in the evening and came back two hours later and was told it still wasn't made up due to the housekeeping staff only coming in at 6pm for the turndown service. That was a pain as I had to wait in the lounge for it to be made up.

All in all by the time I checked out on Monday morning, it didn't feel like an enjoyable stress-free birthday weekend break and I was disappointed. Staff are helpful but need to know the hotel rooms features and differences to meet different customer requirements more adequately. Next time I book or recommend people to stay here, I have to recall room numbers of rooms I was satisfied with which makes it a pain. The St James Hotel around the corner and Connaught in Mayfair have similar quirky room sizes and different requirements but their front desk team seems to know the room differences relatively well and have always been able to accomodate my visits there to avoid noisy rooms and rooms with standing room only bathrooms.",3,2012,03,20
142,Luxuriously disappointing,"We arrived on the day of dire forecasts for snowy weather so it was good and bad news to hear that we had been upgraded to a Mews suite - the upgrade was nice but the thought of traipsing into the main hotel over ice and snow was not so good - as it turned out the weather was cold but there was no ice/snow. The suite was tastefully decorated but the bathroom and the shower were on the cold side - underfloor heating would have been a worthwhile addition in the Mews suites I suspect. As a person who finds it difficult to sleep with a duvet an option to choose blankets would have been nice. The room we had at Hazlitt's Hotel in Soho on a previous visit was much more to my taste. 
 
Breakfast was the only meal we had in the hotel but I think it may have been the best we've ever had in a hotel. The service was impeccable.

So the opulence is there but if we go back I'd definitely insist on a room in the main hotel.",3,2012,03,19
142,Wonderful London Experience in Every Way,"I stayed at the Stafford years ago with my family and was anxious to come back as an adult. I was pleased to find that it was the same wonderful hotel that I remember. As soon as you walk in, the staff is friendly and welcoming. Check in was a breeze and Jan at the front desk was a delight. Everyone was helpful and professional. 

We had booked a Queen Room but were upgraded to a King which was a great surprise. The rooms are generally on the small side, but are so cozy and well decorated that you don't feel that way at all. I think we had the brightest room in the place. Every detail had been accounted for, from the flat screen tv to the plentiful amenities in the bathroom, free water bottles, and free internet (a huge bonus). There was even a rubber duck by the tub. When I was younger we would come for Christmas and they used to set up fully decorated Christmas trees in your room- I don't know if they still do this but it was a great indication of the quality of the hotel and how well the staff treats and pays attention to you. The beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, and not just in a hotel. Housekeeping was fantastic. The one issue we had was we were in a non-smoking room, but there were smoking rooms around us and there were times when our room would reek of smoke from our neighbor. I wish they would do what other hotels do and make non-smoking floors. 

The location of the hotel is fantastic. Right by Buckingham Palace and the mall on one side, and right by Mayfair and Piccadilly on the other. Restaurants and shopping were outside your doorstep, but because you are tucked away in a little courtyard it was quiet and private. Everything we did was in walking distance, from seeing the sights (Westminster, Trafalgar, Parliament, etc) to dinners out and shopping in Soho and Covent Garden. 

I never usually eat in a hotel, but because the American Bar not only had the best atmosphere and service but also great food (try the burger and club sandwich), we ended up having 2 lunches there. Little couches and armchair seating areas in addition to the bar, and they serve your food on trays for you. We also went for drinks 2 nights. With all the history and memorabilia on the walls it is such a fun bar. Wonderfully set up and cozy. 

I just love this hotel, I would never stay anywhere else in London. I enjoyed my stay this time as much as I did when I was a kid. Everything about it is great- the staff, location, rooms, food. All around perfect hotel.",5,2012,03,18
142,Quiet understated comfort in the centre of town,"It's only two minutes away from Piccadilly, but tucked away from the noise and the bright lights. Very comfortable, very well-appointed, with friendly, highly professional staff and discreet service. Bedrooms - well, mine wasn't enormous, but it was extremely comfortable, with all the fittings and accessories you would expect - hair drier, good powerful shower in the bathroom, free wi-fi for guests. Complimentary chilled water in the room fridge was especially appreciated.

The hotel is housed in an attractive set of buildings, including the converted stable block: it's a welcoming sight to come back to after a night out in town.",5,2012,03,15
142,fabulous stay in london,I had the oppotunity to stay at Stafford Hotel on my last trip to London and I absolutely adored it! The staff was so friendly and professional and I felt very welcomed there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking of visiting London.,5,2012,03,11
142,My Favourite Place in London,"Walk round the corner from the gaudy bauble that is the Ritz, down St James' Street and in to Blue Ball Yard and you will find yourself in the cobbled courtyard that leads to the Stafford Hotel.  It is a special place.  The staff are a league ahead of their peers but two people stood out.  Frank Laino, the head concierge and Peter Hinchliffe, Assistant Manager.  When they say that they will do everything to make your stay memorable, they mean it and they do.  We had a junior suite which was perfect.  The bed is huge, soft with crisp white linens.  The bathroom is lined with marble.  There is a wonderful bath, a walk-in shower, 2 large sinks, all perfectly lit and with Molton Brown toiletries to complete the sense of cosseting luxury.  It is so peaceful here, cocooned as you are from the central London noise by its courtyard location and surrounding buildings - this in itself differentiates it from most other lux hotels.  In the American bar we were served the best cocktails by an attentive, knowledgeable staff, with great olives to accompany them.  In the morning we had a superb breakfast - lovely not to have to wrestle with a bunch of other couples at a 'buffet'.  It's efficiently served, plentiful and beautifully presented.  It's just a great place where everything works beautifully, populated by fantastic staff with peaceful, luxurious rooms.  I want to go back tomorrow.",5,2012,03,10
142,Boutique hotel tucked away in St James,"Dependable boutique hotel, tucked away in St. James - affiliated with the Kempinski chain.  Great, intimate and tasteful public areas, well-maintained (though very compact) rooms, reliably good service.  A great option in this part of London.",4,2012,03,09
142,New Year in Style,"We decided to push the boat out for new year and stay here which was probably about £100 more than our usual hotel budget. This hotel particularly appealed as it was less of a ""chain"" and seemed to offer a more personal service. This was definitely true! 

On arrival, it was easy enough to find from Green Park tube, and we were greeted well. We were shown around the hotel and up to our room where we were also shown how to use the TV and heating units. The room was in the main building so of an older style, but that was fine for us- and it certainly gives it a classy feeling. I've stayed in bigger rooms in London, but we were only there for 1 night so it was fine for us. Bed was very comfortable and slept well. Very little noise both in and out of the hotel. 

Breakfat was in a lovely restaurant, unfortunately our food was a little slow coming out but we had a late check out and being slightly worse for wear still, this suited us. We did not use the bar as had plans for the evening. There was a pianist playing in the main area which was a nice touch.

Short walk to Picadilly and onwards to Leicester Square, Covent Garden etc. Excellent location. 

I would definitely stay again although it would have to be a special occasion to justify the price tag- we paid £230 for the night, which for a hotel of this standard comparatively is a snip.",5,2012,03,06
142,"The jewel, tucked away but in the midst of all.","Stayed at the Stafford last week for two days. I had forgotten about the hotel and my travel agent knew I liked elegant  but smaller hotels. Grande in style but understated in its wonderful location,tucked away off St James. We stayed in the ""stables"", converted former horse stables in the courtyard and our room was fantastic. Perhaps the best room in London, vaulted ceilings, fireplace, quaint sitting room.

I was there for a military ceremony and was in uniform much of the time and they certainly took care of us at the American bar. Which BTW has to be one of the finest bars this side of 21. The bartender and team are extremely friendly.

The service was perfect, concierge team was first rate and the desk staff were quite helpful.
Breakfast is a fine experience and the morning dining room captain is superb.",5,2012,03,05
142,Proper lodging for well-padded travelers.,"As a first-timer at this hotel, I was delighted in all respects, save the smoke smell of my upgraded junior suite.  Excellent concierge service from Brett and Frank.  Very good food but fully priced, as are the drinks in the American Bar.  Invisible maid service of the best sort.  Delightful location for shopping men's wear on Jermyn, Piccadilly, Burlington Arcade, etc.  also great for walking in Green Park and St. James Park.  Rupert Murdock and Spencer Churchill lived nearby, so you know the neighborhood is tidy.  Plenty of royals nearby.

142,Home from home,"I stay at this hotel very regularly and would be hard pushed to stay anywhere else in London.  Over the years I have stayed at the Savoy, Dorchester and the Langham but the Stafford takes a lot of beating.  Depends what you want  - if you want big and flashy then may be the Stafford isn't for you but for me it is personal, understated but the attention to detail is amazing.  It's not cheap, granted, but to deliver this level of service and quality, that can't be achieved on a shoe-string.  I also love the breakfast and the fact that all of the produce comes from the UK - this hotel is quintessentially English - I'd be surprised if you were disappointed!",5,2012,02,22
142,Quiet haven in busy London,"This has to be one of London’s best kept secrets – a small hotel with a big heart, from the moment I arrived I felt so welcome.  The staff were really friendly and not at all stuffy as can be the case sometimes in London hotels.  The recently refurbished hotel looks stunning and still remains full of character and charm, especially the American Bar!  I only stayed one night but I would definitely recommend this hotel.  I love its location in St James’, hidden away off the main road it is quiet and ideally placed for visiting the Royal Academy and shopping in Bond Street.",5,2012,02,10
142,Great hotel in the west end,"Managed to book a very good deal last minute via expedia (less than half price) which made the stay excellent value. Friendly staff and very comfortable queen room. At full price I may choose another hotel (The Savoy springs to mind) as the rooms are a fair bit larger with a comparable level of service. We didn't try the hotel restaurant but there is a good restaurant round the corner at The Cavendish which has an excellent value £49/couple menu if booked through Toptable. The American bar is good, but expensive.

There is a useful shortcut to the hotel from Green Park tube station which we did not know about in advance of arrival. Could be a useful addition to their website. It was pointed out to us by the doorman, I won't try to describe it here for fear of getting somebody lost!",5,2012,02,06
142,A Great London Experience,"I stayed at the Stafford while on business in London for two nights and will go back every time.  The hotel is very English and elegant, but despite the sophistication, it somehow maintains a homey atmosphere.  The concierge was very helpful.  My single room was tiny!!  But I expected that and while small, it was luxurious and had really comfortable and cozy bedding.  One piece of advice:  if you want to have high tea, book in advance.",5,2012,02,06
142,Welcome back!,"This was our second visit to the Stafford which followed a somewhat mixed experience on our first visit.  During our first visit we had experienced some service issues with the restaurant which we fed back to the general manager via email.  We were invited back for a complimentary meal and so we decided to stay the night again in a mews master suite (we had received a special rate first time around which was offered again upon request).

The welcome was as good as the first time we visited – arguably better as we were greeted with the words “welcome home”.  The room we had requested was not available, however 3 alternative rooms of equal standard were offered and we were offered to view each before making a decision (we accepted the first suite we viewed which was enormous and complete with decorated Christmas Tree).

Everything this time around was perfect.  After we settled into the room we had dinner in the Lyttelton restaurant and this time around service was faultless – attentive without being overbearing and the food delicious.  The wine list although extensive was arguably somewhat lacking for somebody looking for a rose.

We had a couple of small issues working out how to control lighting and the room temperature and whilst we knew could have called reception for assistance we opted to figure it out for ourselves – we got there in the end!

Breakfast matched the dinner experience – service this time around was faultless.  The food was well prepared and everything we ordered was available and served as requested.

The general manager Leon Baum is to be commended for the way he handled our feedback – sadly all too often these days a complaint is not seen as a gift and is often met with defensiveness.  Thank you to Carsten the on-duty manager who has hidden handyman skills and who touched based throughout our stay to see how we were getting on and whether we needed anything.   We will certainly visit again as well as recommend this hotel to those wanting to experience a luxurious 5* home from home break in London.",5,2012,02,05
142,No reason to stay anywhere else,"The side street location is quiet, central and convenient, the rooms are comfortable, the service is first rate, the concierge helpful, the bar is warm and distinguished. I see no reason to stay anywhere else.",5,2012,02,01
142,Already planninf our return trip!,"Absolutely wonderful. Fantastic location, amazing two bedroom suite. Efficient and helpful concierge.  Thoroughly enjoyed restaurant and the American Bar. Highly recommend. ",5,2012,01,29
142,Just outstanding all round,"First time i have stayed at this hotel and it is very rare for me to get the "" wow"" factor on arrival. Staff very friendly and the American Bar is really cosy. I would say this is one those those discreet hotels and i didn't want to leave just hide away. Its either aspirational or you've made it if you stay here.
A must to return and i shall !",5,2012,01,29
142,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed at the Stafford Kempinski for the first time last night and what a wonderful stay it was.  The service is excellent, the rooms quiet and spacious and the team at the hotel are clearly proud to work there. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have experienced in years.",5,2012,01,24
142,The perfect medium sized hotel in the heart of the west end,"The best hotel in London.  Impeccable english service - attentive but appropriately unobtrusive.  Expensive but a truly exceptional experience.  Over the years I have stayed there 40 times once for a couple of weeks.  A pleasure to return to.  The breakfast croissants are out of this world.  If you can afford it go for it - as with New York beware peak times (Wimbledon, pre Christmas)",5,2012,01,19
142,The Best,"We have been coming back to our home at The Stafford every year for the past 15 years.  Frank Laino and his concierge staff are the best.  Nothing is too much for them and they make it seem easy.  Restaurant reservations, theatre tickets (to sold out shows) are a snap for Frank and his team.   The hotel is on a quiet street abutting Green Park so the noise of the city never reaches us in our room.  Sadly, our favorite room, Man of War, became part of the enlarged American Bar a number of years ago, so we have had to ""make do"" in Room 601 since then.  Being a single malt aficionado, I must say the Bar has an admirable selection of excellent malts.   The location of the hotel is supurb.  A short walk to Green Park tube station will get you to several major underground lines.  We typically walk to theatre and dining because the hotel is so well located in the West End.

We have tried other hotels in the past, but once we discovered The Stafford, we have never left.

We will be back there next month.,",5,2012,01,18
142,Perfect!,"I had booked a standard room but were upgraded to a deluxe room at no extra charge because of my daughter sharing the room with us. Fantastic bed - first good nights sleep in years! Staff friendly and attentive, loved the mull wine in the American Bar.",5,2012,01,16
142,Exceptional small hotel near everything,"This charming small hotel is five star for the superb service, excellent rooms and fine dining, topped off by the American Bar, where Yanks can get a good hamburger.  Costly but unforgettable.",5,2012,01,07
142,Unique,Excellent atmosphere and service at the American Bar,5,2012,01,05
142,"Great service, very attentive staff and great location!","i really loved this hotel! it was my first time staying in this area and i really liked it. the hotel is just a few steps away from piccadilly street but still in a very quite position (dead end road), so the rooms were very silent.
the hotel is in english style, which i loved! 
the public areas and the american bar were really nice. i'd recommend you the american bar for a club sandwich, even though all food was excellent.
we made a reservation online for 2 nice rooms and asked if it was possible to upgrade at least one of them and the first big surprise at our arrival was that we got upgrated to a wonderful junior suite! we really appreciated it.
we also appreciated the courtesy, professionalism and kindness of all the staff that was really attentive to any request and made our stay special.
i've been to many 4/5 stars hotels and i can say that the service was remarkable and they managed everything in the best way. a great plus! 
i guess that the reputation of the kempinski was reconfirmed once again.
i think i will make a reservation here for my next trip to london.",5,2012,01,04
142,Don't hesitate,"We stayed at the Stafford at the end of November for three nights mid-week. We had booked a king room in the hotel but were unexpectedly upgraded to a room in the Carriage House on the second floor and we were delighted. The room was charming and large by London standards. We loved the fireplace (faux fire thought it was), bed was excellent, décor classic but not trying to be quirky cute and clever – just classic, and we loved the location. In fact, it was so easy to come and go through the courtyard to St. James Street that we really didn’t need to reenter the hotel itself except for the one morning we had breakfast in the dining room, an evening in the American Bar, and to check out.  The holiday decorations had just been put up when we arrived – it was hard to believe that we were in central London and not somewhere in the countryside. It was also very quiet although that might not be the case if you are staying in the carriage house rooms in the summer. They open directly onto the courtyard which is set up with tables for overflow from the American Bar. We can imagine that it can be pretty noisy late on a summer night. Otherwise, don’t hesitate.",5,2012,01,01
142,Lovely Atmosphere and Helpful Staff,"Just to say we had a lovely pre-Xmas afternoon tea sitting by the fire here, with attentive staff and excellent service. At the end, I asked if it was at all possible for my son and me to see the wine cellars, as I had seen reference to them in the hotel brochure.  The wine cellar manager, a delightful Scottish gentleman, took us on a brief tour, in the midst of what must have been a busy time for them.  He was extremely knowledgeable and informative and this really made our afternoon.",5,2011,12,23
142,Wonderful Stafford Hotel,"I had eaten several times at the Stafford, in their private dining rooms and in the main restaurant.  I wanted somewhere to stay to celebrate a very special birthday and the Stafford didn't disappoint.  The room was lovely - the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in - the only hotel with a bed even more comfortable than mine at home!  The bathroom was beautiful, although the ceramic tiles on the floor were a bit cold.  The clever light setting to have very low lights on at night was impressive - why don't all hotels do this?

Only tiny niggle was that there wasn't a kettle in the room, although everything needed was provided as soon as we asked.  I suppose if they cater for a lot of foreign visitors to London they don't expect this as the English do.  

The dinner and breakfast were really good - delicious and beautifully presented - and all the staff in the restaurant and lounge bar were so friendly and helpful.  They all seemed to want you to enjoy yourself and weren't in the slightest bit snooty as so many smart hotel staff can sometimes be.  The ambience is elegance itself - all beautifully decorated, with added Christmas decorations, and no piped music - fantastic.  We felt we could take as long as we wanted over our meals and in fact I was really rather reluctant to go home.",5,2011,12,20
142,"Our Home Away From Home, in London","Through the years I have enjoyed the Stafford in London.  It maintains the highest level of service.  All of the people from the Stafford seem to enjoy doing what they do.  Frank, the Hall Porter is the best.  Most likely in the world!  Always friendly, helpful and amazingly resourceful.
The hotel has the charm of  London, but all of the amenities and creature comforts one would like to have while traveling.  The bar, tea, dining, gym, rooms, staff, location are all 5 star.  All located in St. James on a small, gas lit street. We will return this Christmas.  We have stayed many times through the years...any time I am in London primarily because we feel as if it is our home away from home, while in London.",5,2011,12,10
142,"Would recommend to a friend, and stay here again","Our first stay in this hotel. Great location and nicely tucked away. Staff were welcoming and very professional. The American Bar is great- full of character and very cosy. We'll definitely be back for a drink. Our room was spacious, bed, bed linen and pillows very comfortable. Bathroom large and comfortable with a lovely heated floor. All in all, a big thumbs up!",5,2011,12,08
142,The Stafford comes out tops again!,"This was our second stay at The Stafford and I can honestly say that it is, in our opinion, the best hotel in London.  The ambience, service and facilities are second to none and its location is perfect.
We have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels in London and whilst the standards and facilities may be the same as The Stafford, they are all large and impersonal and cannot compete with the small, friendly, homely feel of The Stafford.
The very individual and stylish American bar is a great place to unwind after a long day and, according to my husband, serves the best beer and martinis in London!",5,2011,11,26
142,Beautifully appointed with top-notch service,"Elegance through and through. Hotel is very conveniently located, but still tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Service was impeccable, beds lushious and television state-of-the-art. Quite pricey but worth it for the traveler who values service above all else.",5,2011,11,21
142,A true 5 star experience,"This was my 2nd stay at this hotel. My first stay was in August and I have to admit, I had a few issues with the hotel. I never posted a negative review of that stay as I felt that would be unfair of me not to give the hotel the chance to explain to me personally about the problems I encountered. I always think its a sign of a true 5 star hotel who will try their best to address any problems you have. This is certainly the case with The Stafford. 
Upon arrival we were greeted by the most charming receptionist and the room manager came over and personally introduced himself and could not do enough for us. He showed us to our beautiful suite and made sure we were all happy (we most certainly were) and the general manager sent up a lovely bottle of wine and chocolates with his compliments, which we thought was a lovely touch. The room was decorated very tastefully, it was extremely spacious and the bathroom was enormous with gorgeous Molton Brown toiletries. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. There was also a lovely turn down service.One thing I feel I need to point out is that alot of reviewers are complaining about no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. If you take Mr Baum's advice in his replies to reviewers, telephone room service, like we did, and they will gladly bring a complimentary hospitality tray to your room, no trouble at all. The breakfast is simply delicious, no horrid buffets here, just a superb selection of freshly cooked food to order. Check out was efficient and the lovely concierge staff couldn't do enough to help us, storing our luggage and advising us on the best way back to Euston on a very busy, gridlocked Sunday. 
In summary, this hotel is not cheap, but if you take all the above into consideration, and including the location, it is worth every single penny. Thank you for your hospitality, and I cannot wait to return to my 'home' in London. See you all soon!",5,2011,11,14
142,Peaceful Break with expensive food,"Stayed here for 2 nights after having my booking through Airmiles switched there as Le Meridien was full, so a little unsure what to expect as a last minute booking. Check in was easy and we were shown to the room by the receptionist and offered a tour of the room and amenities. Bed was very comfortable, but as many hotels do these day, it was two 3 foot singles zip linked together so there is always a ridge in the middle. Extra pillows were ordered and supplied. Room was clean, as was the bathroom. Would have preferred to see a seperate shower cublicle not a shower curtain over bath type but no doubt this saves space.

Service from all staff was efficient and in the background if you did not want it.

Luckily we had breakfast included in our rate, otherwise a full english breakfast would have been £25.00, and my only disappointment of the weekend was the fact it was never ever worth that much money. The bacon was simply overcooked on both mornings, and serving half a flat mushroom is just plain tight at these prices.

Bar prices were about £5.50 for a bottle of lager, which was about what I expected.

Overall a good weekend, but they could improve the quality of breakfast for the amount charged.",4,2011,11,13
142,Absolutely wonderful hotel in London,"We just returned from a weekend stay at the Stafford Hotel.  What a cozy and terrific hotel.  The location can't be beat, easy access to the tube and buses.  The rooms are a nice size and wonderfully appointed. The ""American"" Bar makes a mean martini and is a great place to end your night. 

The only thing stopping me from giving this hotel 5 stars is the bed.  One of my pet peeves about travel in Europe is when they smash two full sized beds together and call it a king.  There inevitably is a divot in the middle and you both sag inward.  That's where my complaints end.

The Stafford offers free wifi and free bottled water...every fine hotel should take notice...those two small things make every stay infinitely more enjoyable.",4,2011,11,08
142,Favorite London Hotel,"Without a doubt The Stafford is our favorite hotel in London.  Its location is ideal. It is secluded, but a few steps puts you in the center of London.  Service is excellent and the rooms are lovely.  The suites in the The concierge staff led  by Frank is the best.
Looking forward to another stay next week.",5,2011,10,27
142,excellent hospitality and service,"a good option if in your price range, good London location for jogging in the parks, shopping, social engagements, business meetings. Good for access to Mayfair and Westminster. Quiet low-key location but central, direct access from two different streets. Staff are attentive if needed and most helpful. Bar has some character and history behind it, open courtyard good if weather permits.",5,2011,10,26
142,Old fashioned British style and service,The Stafford is a fine example of British hospitality.  The location is excellent being very close to Green Park but on a side street off St. James providing quiet and privacy.  The rooms are older but have been updated with all modern conveniences.  The staff are attentive and knowledgeable.  It is not inexpensive but that is what one has to pay in central London.  I stayed on business and did not have the chance to use the lounge or restaurant but I could see that the Stafford would provide everything needed for a family visit.,4,2011,10,23
142,Special,"We spent three nights at the Stafford Hotel in London in the stable mews - quite a different experience.  We were able to walk right out onto the cobbles and then onto St James Street and up to Piccadilly - great location.  Different to have breakfast in the lobby restaurant, but very convenient.  Not overly 'posh'  very pleasant staff. A very welcoming atmosphere.",5,2011,10,21
142,excellent luxury hotel,"this was our first visit to the stafford and wont be our last ; room was spacious and bed really comfortable ,staff friendly and could not do enough for you. really enjoyed the american bar with lots of memorabilia ,facinating to learn that Nancy Wake of the SOE had lived there",5,2011,10,16
142,Really pleasant luxury hôtel,"Lovely traditionnel décor, quiet relaxing atmosphere, a real haven just off Piccadilly.  Great comfort (we were upgraded to a suite, but junior suites looked pretty good too). Very good service altogether, a little amateurish at réception/reservations. Lovely breakfast, English teas, the 'American' bar is great, and you can eat delicious snacks there, which is good, as the restaurant is quite dull. Expensive, of course, but that's London!",4,2011,10,14
142,Great location and atmosphere in the hotel!,"I had a business trip to London last week and had a great stay in The Stafford Kempinski Hotel. The room was very nice as the hotel was renovated this year. As you may know, London has plenty of hotels, which cost a lot, however the rooms are terrible. I was in London in March, staying in Hilton Metropole hotel. It was a nightmare, poor service, worn out rooms and as everything in London - expensive.
The location is also perfect, all major attractions, Buckingham Palace, Big, etc, and shops, everything is within walking distance.
Will I stay in this hotel again? I'd love too! It's one of my favorites now in London!",5,2011,09,27
142,Very special,"This was our second stay at the Stafford.  Whilst being very satisfied with the hotel and location, we had some issues with service on the first occasion but this time we were not disappointed in any way - in fact our expectations were exceeded.  We were greeted warmly and shown around and to our room.  We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a junior suite, which was beautifully appointed and luxurious.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the hotel was quiet overnight, which is a real plus in London.  Our breakfast was of top quality and the service was faultless.  We would have no hesitation in staying there again.",5,2011,09,27
142,"Small, Cozy and Friendly!","We stayed here 5 evenings last December while my husband had business meetings.  Our room, No 7, is a Carriage House Suite, and part of the old stable portion of the hotel.  It is decorated in a lovely black and white toile, has a canopy bed, and the best of all, a wonderful gas fireplace with couch making up a cozy sitting area.  The room was exceptionally quiet.  Even though we visited in winter, I could imagine sitting outside the American Bar in the courtyard in nicer weather.  We had drinks and snacks almost every evening at the bar, which is the a perfect, classic, upscale British bar.  The only hesitation we had regarding our stay was a concierge that was a little less imaginative than we are used to with respect to suggesting sightseeing opportunities and West End selections.  I was very pleased with the old charm of the room, but understand there are other rooms that are modern, in the adjacent wing.",5,2011,09,24
142,Fantastic Stay in London....,"We booked to stay at the Stafford to celebrate our wedding anniversary (30/7). We were not disappointed at all. We arrived at the hotel early 9.45 am and before we could get out of the taxi our bags had been taken to reception. We were greeted by a very friendly line up of staff at the door who gave us a very warm welcome. 
We were checked in and informed that our room was not available, which we expected. On arrival back to the hotel in the afternoon we were taken to the Carriage Suite in the courtyard, what a great room and surprise. We were greeted with a four poster bed, large sitting area with fire place, and large bathroom. Great Floris toiletries in abundance. (Our only grip would be the bathroom could do with a little TLC).
It was a shame but we had such a busy time in London that we did not have much time to spend in the room, we used the bar for a quick drink before we went out for dinner, we both had an excellent nights sleep, in a very quiet room, and breakfast the next morning was of a very good standard. Really liked the idea of the locally made jams and honey. Service was a little slow but it was very busy.
We checked out after breakfast with a very speedy process and were able to  leave our bags with the concierge as were were out and about.
We collected our bags at 4pm and again were treated with the upmost of respect and a taxis was organised for us with no problem what so ever.
We have stayed in london on many occasions and always worried about the standard of the accommodation, this hotel surpassed our expectations and we would definately go back.
(Those who moan about the price, remember you are in London and you get nothing for free, If you want to stay in a 5* hotel then expect to pay for, if you want it cheap then go and stay in a travelodge!!!!!)
We will book the Stafford next time we go to London.
Thank you to all the staff for making our anniversary one to remember.",5,2011,09,21
142,Lovely but pricey!,"I was treated to a night at the theatre and a stay in this lovely hotel by my husband on 7th sept. We had a fairly pleasant drive down to London though found the hotel a little tricky to get to (mainly due to sat nav error) as it is so quietly tucked away.. However on arrival the concierge were helpful and carried our bags from the car to the lobby. We checked in with no problems and our car was taken to be parked somewhere (however expensive at £65 per night) Though in London we expected it to be expensive! 

We were shown to our room in the quiet courtyard and were pleased with the cleanliness and comfort. However, there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which, something we would have liked and did expect! Also we were not informed at any point that we could have had them if we wished or a complimentary tea/coffee on arrival as a previous review stated. The bed was massive and bathroom beautiful with a huge bath and huge separate shower. The room was spotless and very homely. 

We decided to eat in the American bar and again, although very expensive it was tasty (although served on a lap tray) which was a little unexpected... We enjoyed it and made our way to the theatre. Concierge hailed a taxi with ease and we were at the theatre within 5 mins.

 We ordered room service breakfast for 9am and it was there, right on time. The staff set up the breakfast in our room for us (complete with a fresh cut rose) and it was very enjoyable. However, 3 times the maid knocked on the door wanting to clean the room and interrupting breakfast which was a little annoying as we had the room until 12, and therefore wanted to enjoy a leisurely breakfast at 9am without feeling we had to rush. 

All in all it was a lovely night away and we enjoyed our stay here. Although you could have had a week abroad for the price we paid, this was more about spoiling ourselves for a day. ",5,2011,09,20
142,"shockingly poor value for money, AVOID","We stayed one night here on 20th of August 2011. We had a terrible time finding it but that was down to Google Maps which cant be trusted.

We found the room via an offer and we had very high expectations: the website is very flashy and impressive and the pictures of rooms make it look good: the room was normally £350 a night and we got it at half that so we thought it would be very flashy. When I booked over the phone I was immediately upsold to the next room level at extra money but I thought it would be worth it.

What. a. waste. of. money. I could kick myself. I can only say a couple of positive things about the room. It had a wonderful big bed. Absolutely perfect, and the room itself was clean and had very high quality fittings. But oh dear! The size! I looked at our room and thought ""they charge £350/night for THIS?!?"" It was absolutely tiny - I've stayed in large rooms in a Travelodge. You'd think at £350/night you would get a bath. No. A shower. Yes, a very nice shower, but we wanted a nice soak. I expect a shower in a cheap & cheerful hotel but this was pathetically poor value for money even at our 50% discounted rate.

The food menu was very nice but again, the prices were horrendous: £10 just for a sandwich. We refused and went to a Tesco down the road and got a £2 one. Oh, you know about the tea & coffee in rooms? We couldn't find ours. We turned out all the cupboards but could find a kettle or satchets. To me this is about as basic a thing as one would expect in any hotel: again a £20/night Travelodge will give you complimentary tea and coffee, but the Stafford? No. Oh wait, you get a complimentary tea & coffee on arrival but that's a pain as you have to ring room service and wait 10 minutes for it to arrive. Then you have to phone room service to tell them you've done with it & they can pick it up and you have to be bothered in your room while they disturb you or leave it outside - what a frickin' pain.

When we complained about this bizarre cheapskate and inconvenient this policy was  we were told ""but it is convenient as room service is 24 hours you can get a drink anytime you like, just call"". A pathetic justification. How much is tea & coffee? £14!!!! And why should I call & wait when if I have a kettle & sachets I an do it instantly myself (like I can in the cheap hotels). A member of staff agreed with us: ""yea it's just an excuse to make more money of you"".

The Stafford & Kempinsky are just greedy & moneygrubbing - they nickel n dime you.

They also advertise a sauna and spa but neglet to tell you it's only in their other hotel

I've never stayed anywhere that was worse value for money than this. It was a total rip off.

AVOID find somewhere else to stay in Central London or at least if you must pay that money pay it where you get some value.",1,2011,09,09
142,Oasis in St James,Central London.  Tucked away between the busy thoroughfare of St James and Green Park The Stafford is the perfect peaceful haven at the end of a hectic day.   We had a busy 48 hour schedule and needed to stay centrally.     Luxurious inside with discrete attentive staff one can unwind and relax with ease.    Breakfast is superb.    The Light Lunch alternative in The Courtyard was innovative and delicious.    The hotel is quiet and very English in style and understated sumptuousness.,5,2011,09,06
142,A Piece of Heaven in the Heart of London,"We arrived at the hotel around 9'ish in the morning after an all night flight from Canada to London via Frankfurt and were delighted to find out that our room was ready for our arrival.   We were also delighted to discover that we had been upgraded to a junior suite in the mews.   The suite was very comfortable and well appointed.   Breakfast was included and was very good although the coffee could have been stronger!   The staff was friendly and very helpful; Peter, the concierge, suggested some excellent restaurants for dinner, both of which we tried and were very pleased.   The Stafford has an incredible location and is within walking distance of all the sights of London.   Would happily stay here again any time!",5,2011,09,05
142,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights and we were very impressed with the high standards of this hotel.
Our room was not ready when we arrived so we were upgraded to a junior suite at no extra charge. The suite was the most luxurious I have ever stayed in. The attention to detail was amazing and the complimentary bottle of wine was well appreciated.
The staff were very helpful and not intrusive. 
The service was excellent except at breakfast where taking our order was slow and the food was lukewarm when it eventually arrived.
The hotel is in an excellent location just 10 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and an easy walk to all the major attractions. The nearest tube station is just around the corner.
Overall it is a beautiful hotel and  I recommend it without hesitation.",5,2011,09,01
142,What a discovery!,"What a discovery! This was our first visit to the hotel, booked through Travelzoo for an overnight stay. The hotel is in a central location and reminded me of a country house tucked away in a quiet mews area of London. It seems to have been recently refurbished and everywhere is beautifully decorated. 
We were made to feel welcome and special from the moment we set foot on the steps of the hotel right up to the time that we left. We were greeted at the door by James and shown around the hotel by Eileen and I was amazed at how they both seemed so genuinely proud of the hotel. And why not? It’s wonderful! 
Our room was upgraded from a queen size to a king size and had a fabulously comfortable bed. The bathroom was a good size and was well stocked with fluffy robes, good quality toiletries and lots of fluffy towels. 
We had also taken up the offer for dinner in the hotel's Lyttelton Restaurant. The menu had a very good selection of food and our meal was delicious. The service was attentive without being obtrusive and this level of service was also to be found in the American bar.
When we arrived back at our room the bed had been turned down and slippers had been provided, along with bottles of water. Luxury!
Breakfast was also very good and the English breakfast included a particularly nice black pudding (not for everyone but I like it). A perfect end to a perfect stay!",5,2011,08,29
142,Superb hotel,"Stayed 27 August.  Given complimentary upgrade, huge room with incredible bed.  Great conceierge service who phoned around various restaurants for us.  Had dinner here, food was superb.  Expesnive, but you are in Mayfair, and is a superb location.  Strongly recommended.
1 negative - the pool is a 5min walk away in another building - not advertised accurately.",5,2011,08,28
142,Hidden Treasure in Central London!,"We stayed at this hotel last weekend and had an amazing experience. The staff are so welcoming, you feel as though nothing is too much trouble. The room was perfect except for no tea or coffee facilities, but we requested this and a tray was delivered in half an hour!!! Bathroom was a delight except bath was so huge I struggled to reach the far end!!  Breakfast was brilliant and evening meal absolutely delicious. No complaints at all. During our visit we had afternoon tea at the Ritz, I have to say the staff at the ritz and their attention to detail  was no where near as good as in the Stafford. Ritz staff would benefit from some training in the Stafford hotel.",5,2011,08,27
142,Loved It!,"We initially booked here as we got a great deal and had no real preconceptions other than a niggling fear that the hotel might be a bit stuffy. Actually we had a completely wonderful stay. The hotel is in the perfect location, really central to everything but tucked away in a quiet mews. We were in a classic queen room, I think, but the bed was enormous and one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. My husband wanted to bring it home with us! The bathroom had a separate tub and shower and was wonderful, although the plumbing was a bit ancient! Free wi-fi was much appreciated and worked brilliantly. We had breakfast included as part of our stay which was absolutely delicious but I probably wouldn't have wanted to pay £25 for it when there are so many great coffee shops in the area and The Wolseley is just up the street! 
We didn't make use of the restaurant or bar whilst we were there as we had other plans but both looked very nice. 
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, particularly if you can get a great deal on it.",5,2011,08,26
142,An oasis of calm in this hectic city.,"We had a wonderful time in the Stafford in May. Our room was most comfortable and luxurious and quiet. Staff could not have been more helpful.The weather was very good, and being able to sit outside and and have pre dinner drinks in the beautiful courtyard was a bonus.Its proximity to most of the sights was great.It was a lovely restful hotel to come back to after a busy day sightseeing. Breakfast was very good considering that the dining room was not available at the time due to work being carried out on it and consequently was served in the american bar.We will certainly choose this hotel on our next visit to London.",5,2011,08,20
142,Hidden Gem in Central London Location,"We have just returned from a two night stay at the Stafford Hotel,  a hidden gem of a hotel, situated just behind the Ritz,  in central London. What a lovely hotel it is.......with understated elegance and charm, further enhanced by the excellent service that we received from the moment that we arrived until the moment we left, from all members of staff.  The room that we stayed in was on the small size but suited us just fine as we do not travel with large amounts of luggage. Itt was  very well equiped with a Bose CD/ radio player, television with multiple channels, including international ones, a fridge to store cold drinks etc., and an extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was a good size, equiped with both a shower and bath, large fluffy white towels in abundance and good shower/bath gels, hair shampoo & conditioner.  I enquired as too how they managed clients with large amounts of luggage, and was told that the rooms all vary in size and if there is a requirement for extra space, just to mention this when you are booking the hotel and they would do their best to accomodate the request.  There is also a luggage storage room for excess baggage.   Our deal included breakfast which was delicious, with an excellent selection to choose from, including a full English breakfast,  fresh fruit salad,  ham & eggs to mention but a few. There is silver service in the dining room, I would have to make a special mention of Mr Luca who went out of his way  to ensure that we had everything we could wish for.  We also had a nightcap and a meal in the American bar, once again the service was faultless, the Martini hit the spot and the food was delicious.  Yes, prices are a little high, but you expect this in a five star, central London hotel. If you decide to stay, do make a point of  experiencing the ambience of the American bar which should not be missed.. The location of the hotel makes for a peaceful oasis of calm away from the hurly burly of busy London. You are excellently situated to enjoy all the usual London attractions,  Buckingham Palace is just a stroll away through Green Park., as well as Trafalgar Square and all the usual tourist attractions.  One of Londons's premier department stores, Fortnum & Masons is just down the road, (not to be missed) Also check out Floris, a wonderful Perfumery that has been in the same family and on the same site for the last three hundred plus years,
I understand that there is a gym on site, also you are just next door to Green Park if you are a jogger/ runner.  Finally I must make a mention here of Mr Jan, who welcomed us to the hotel and showed us around, escorting us to our room when we arrived. He certainly created the right impression and set the tone for our stay. Would we go back? In a heartbeat........ no hesitations at all! 
Book your stay and enjoy your time in London at this fantastic hidden gem of a hotel, I know you won't regret it.",5,2011,08,19
142,The Best!,"Love this hotel. I have stayed here twice with my partner. We love it! Stayed over New Year last year in one of the suites you get via the courtyard and then again for my birthday this month. Its location is perfect with so many sights to see within walking distance. ( not to mention all the shopping opportunities!) 

We have never eaten here though apart from breakfast which was divine. The eggs benedict were so delicious I have yet to have one as good. 

The American bar is fab too and so many photographs and things to look at. 

I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. We will be back.",5,2011,08,19
142,"Fantastic hotel, we loved it !","What a find. We booked through Superbreak and were not disappointed.
As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel special. We were shown around and were bowled over by the decor, cleanliness and atmosphere.
The room was spotless, when we arrived back from the theatre our bed has been turned down, our slippers put by the bed and a welcoming bottle of water left for us to enjoy. Breakfast was a wonderful silver service experience !
We will definately be back !!",5,2011,08,16
142,"Some Changes, Still Very Good","The hotel has changed a bit since it was taken over by new management in the last year or so.  The dining room isn't stodgy -- that whole front area has been opened up, creating a nice, warm atmosphere and the food has improved.  The American Bar seems busier and the rooms, especially in The Mews, are as roomy and comfortable as ever.  A little of the can-do spirit lags in some of the newer (non-British) hires, which could pose a threat if allowed to grow (I was stunned to hear the word ""no"" uttered to a fairly reasonable request only to have a ""yes"" provided by a manager.  But we still had a breakfast turned in fifteen minutes when we decided to change our departure, which we decided to do on the unsolicited advice of the concierge, just the kind of personal service that brought us back to the hotel.  The atmosphere in the outside area could be improved by getting the St. James Hotel to do something about its vent system, which spews noise into the American Bar courtyard.",5,2011,08,15
142,"Not cheap, but very worthy","It is dificult to describe the entire experience, but every thing was very very ok. The location, the service, the everything.  I will be back",5,2011,08,15
142,A Truly Fantastic Stay,"We booked this hotel through a Travelzoo offer, but we didn't realise how good an offer it was until we arrived. The location of the hotel is hard to beat.  St James's Place is a small quiet side road set next door to the Ritz and Green Park.
The reception staff were very friendly, showing us round the hotel facilities before taking us to our room. 

The room was on the small side, but perfectly formed and spotlessly clean. The bed's were extremely comfortable and the air conditioning easy to control, as it is normally too hot in hotels. Two bottles of complimentary water are left in the room, which you don't get in every hotel. A nice touch. Only bad comment would be part of the housekeeping routine should be to check the Bose alarm clock setting ,as it went off at 6am, which I was not best pleased about as we were having a quiet weekend away without our children waking us up early.

After our shopping expedition we stopped in the hotel's Amercian bar for a drink. Again the service was great and the Sauvignon Blanc was chilled and delicious.

We had also taken up the Travelzoo offer for eating our dinner in the hotel's Lyttelton Restaurant. When we come to London for a weekend aways we normally eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, so this was a change for us, but it was actually the best bit. Our food was delicious. The menu had a good selection of food. The service was attentive and the wine advice excellent. My only comment would be they need a desk just outside the restaurant to greet their customers and check their booking arrangements. At the moment you walk into the middle of the restaurant and stand there until a member of staff comes over and show you to your table.

Our offer included breakfast. The restaurant was alot busier, than the evening before and staff did not seem totally organised, but breakfast was delicious.

Overall I think there are few v small teething problems, but would certainly not stop me staying there again. Next time I will bring our children too.",5,2011,08,15
142,A true home away from home,"My wifw and I have just completed a weekend break in The Stafford and had a fantastic time. The location and service from the staff could not have been better from our check in to check out nothing was too much trouble.

It's like a home away from home (except with better toiletries).

We shall be back again soon.",5,2011,08,14
142,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at,"This Hotel is outstanding in every aspect. The service, food and quality of the rooms were faultless. My wife and I regularly go to London and stay over night after watching a show so having stayed in many similar graded hotels I can safely say that the Stafford Hotel was superior to them all.  The bed was large and cozy (great nights sleep),  the room was newly decorated with good fixtures and fittings and the TV was connnected to a Bose sound system all making for a great overnight stay.  I will definitely be re-booking within the next six months and I have my fingers crossed that they can maintain the level of quality",5,2011,08,08
142,Difficult to fault it!,"We booked the Stafford in response to an offer on the internet through a third party.
Having paid for the offer we then contacted the hotel to book a specific date.
No rooms at the offer price were available for any of the dates we requested but
upgrades were available at additional cost. We reluctantly paid the difference.
We arrived before the stated book-in time to simply deposit our bags before site seeing.
We were advised that our room was in fact ready & we had been further upgraded.
Once escorted to our room we were pleasantly surprised to find we had been allocated a suite. Both the lounge, bedroom & bathrooms were tastefully furnished to a highly acceptable standard. Some very nice touches – Bose wave radio/alarm/CD & Bose i pod dock.
Responsive temperature control/aircon. Complimentary water/soft drinks in the mini bar together with all other features one can expect from a genuine 5 star establishment. There are king-sized beds & king-sized beds. Our room had a king-sized bed! On opposite sides of it, I swear myself & wife were in different postcodes. It was amongst the most comfortable I have encountered whilst travelling.

Situated in a cul de sac, the location is extremely quiet.
There is a courtyard with mews apartments and another alleyway leading off as a shortcut
in the direction of Pall Mall/Trafalgar Square etc. During our stay, from our room we heard no sounds of other guests whatsoever.

The Four Seasons, Beverly Hills (another offer!) has been the only hotel we have stayed in that matched the experience here.
We are too embarrassed to disclose the price we paid for our stay at the Stafford but can honestly say that we would have considered to have received excellent value at twice that sum.

A direction tip – looking at the map from Green Park underground, it appears you have to circumvent 3 sides of a square to access the hotel (Picadilly, St. James Street & St. James Place). Proceed along Queens Walk next to the station and an alleyway on the left leads straight to the Stafford’s front entrance – a few minutes at most. From the hotel by this route, Buckingham Palace & The Mall are also only a few minutes away.

We found all the staff to be extremely helpful without being sycophantic, with nothing proving to be too much trouble. Incidentals (food, drink etc) are not the cheapest but hey! – this is London, this is 5 star, this is luxury!

The management & staff are to be complimented on the hotel & standard it sets.
If like us you don’t get pampered very often, try the Stafford. If our experience is anything to go by, you won’t regret it.",5,2011,08,07
142,"A splendid place to stay, well taken care of, a home away from home.","My husband and I stayed at The Stafford with our 3 daughters/son.  We could not have asked for any better care, attention and warmth from the staff. Excellent concierges, front desk staff. Wait staff at breakfast were always courteous and attentive, and we also enjoyed an excellent dinner. The American Bar is one of the best places in all of London to relax and enjoy a drink.",5,2011,08,04
142,The Best Location in London,"This was our second trip to the Stafford and it remains the best location and best BED in London.  Tucked into a corner right off Green Park in St. James Place, it is just steps from the tube, the fantastic royal parks, and many of the great historic sites of London.  

The rooms are quiet, spacious (for London) and definitely LUXE!  The four poster bed was heavenly!  Even the roll away bed for my daughter was wonderfully appointed and a fresh baked gingerbread man arrived on a china plate when we returned from a day a site seeing.

Thank you Stafford Hotel!  You are my home in London!",5,2011,08,04
142,special hotel,"i stayed at the stafford hotel with my family,
this hotel is truly special, its very quiet at night
the location is great, its located in a walking district from bond street which is great for shopping, its also 5 minutes walking from picadilly circus, regent street, mayfair, ritz hotel, and green park.
the staff are very friendly
the rooms are very clean
and the food is delicious, the breakfast is amazing",5,2011,08,01
142,Absolutely Perfect!,"We have stayed in hotels in London and many other cities,  but this has to beone of  the very best in our opinion!

The staff were very welcoming and extremely  helpful and courteous and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite in the Mews on arrival  which was absolutely wonderful.

We had lunch out on the terrace which was a very peaceful location. You would never imagine you were in the centre of London and yet we were only a walk away from Soho where we were meeting for dinner in the evening.

What else can I say but "" A perfect hotel in a perfect location""",5,2011,07,30
142,Great location and a charming hotel,"The Stafford is located in the heart of Mayfair and has great access to shopping, public transport, and the parks.  It is in a quiet location at the end of a mews that keeps the outside noise to a minimum and combined with very comfortable beds, makes for a great nights sleep.  Despite being an older, quaint building, the hotel has very modern amenities including a modern fitness centre.  Given its proximity to Green Park, I didn't use the facilities often a I chose to run in the parks.  The food was pricey but was of great quality.  The staff were both friendly and professional.",5,2011,07,28
142,good but not coming back because of personal taste,"I've been to this hotel for 5 nights on July 2011. The location is great - 5 minutes walk from Green Park station tube and 5 minutes walk from Piccadilly Street. In spite of the central location it's a quiet neighborhood. 
Because the hotel building where I've slept is all wooden built, you hear creaking and squeak sounds whenever your neighbors of other rooms - move, a phenomena which required inserting ear plugs from time to time. I've been in the main building, as I requested, but maybe other parts of the hotel are newer and thus with less creaking sounds. One has to find out and write it here.
I got a very nice room: no. 326 but with no view to the court yard (although I've asked as per other tripadvisor recommendations). The bed was huge and comfortable; I wish I could have it at home.
The fluffy white towels in the clean bathroom were pampering and sweet smelling.
The dinning room is beautiful and there's a service with a-la-carte menu. This fact though has 2 disadvantages:
1. it's very slow - usually you're asked to sit aside and wait for a free table. Also it affects the service for your table - because everything is cooked especially for you. If you value time it could be a problem.
2. Because there is no buffet you order for specific dishes from the menu and you cannot choose small bites from a range of delicatessen. For someone who appreciates rich morning breakfasts it's a shame.
There was free Wi-Fi which enabled easy Skype talks and surfing.",4,2011,07,21
142,"A dry Martini in the American Bar at the Stafford is one of life's ""must do's""!","Order a Tanqueray 10 Dry Martini and circumnavigate the American Bar at The Stafford looking in wonderment at the World War Two memorabilia, and more, that adorn the walls of this fine establishment. Eat and drink outside in the sheltered courtyard on a sunny day in London before visiting the many historic shops in nearby St. James'. Highly recommended.",5,2011,07,19
142,Quiet sanctuary in a great location,The Stafford is very well located in the heart of old London and in easy walking distance to the main attractions and shopping areas. We stayed in a suite in the main house which was spacious and unbelievably peaceful given the location. A little bit stuffy (ie no shorts allowed in the bar despite it being 30 degrees when we were there) but that's probably to be expected from a traditional London hotel. Would highly recommend.,5,2011,07,07
142,Not what we hoped for,"We stayed at the Carriage House annex during one of the snows in December 2010.  I brought my 12 year old son.  i did not think that the hotel was particular kid-friendly, even they were certainly not hostile.  It just seemed to me that they were prefer to have adults, rather than children.  I really did not like the Carriage House.  You had to go outside and negotiate icy and dark cobblestones and metal steps.  There was no effort to light the way or escort us. The snow was cleared but not the ice.  The courtyard through which we passed had no charm as the hotel used it to park cars, which I thought was inexcusable for a 5-star hotel.  Maybe our stay would have been better if we had stayed in the Main House.  I keep looking for the hotel in London that I will have to come back to year after year and have yet to find it.",3,2011,07,03
142,Our residence while in London - one can but wish,"There's truth in the adage 'you get what you pay for.' The Stafford is not cheap but what you get is a perfect location and exemplary service. We booked a weekend break to celebrate my wife's birthday and waiting for us in our Carriage House room was a most beautiful bouquet of flowers and champagne (paid for) but also, compliments of the Stafford, a wonderful chocolate birthday cake and a bowl of strawberries. Touches like that mean a lot and are greatly appreciated, as is the charming courtesy of all the hotel staff who are never stiffly formal and are happy to exchange jokes - as was much needed early on Sunday morning when I thought I had witnessed a car driver just off Pall Mall toting a sub machine gun only subsequently to discover it was a film shot! 

The refurbishment of the main house is, in our view, a big success but pleasingly the American Bar remains unaltered and we enjoyed an excellent meal there on Friday evening. The ambience of the bar is one of its great assets although that does have its downside because our room was immediately adjacent to the outside seating area and, late on Saturday evening the raucous banter of some American guests was annoyingly intrusive. A word from the front office staff following a phone call moderated their exuberance. On arrival at the hotel we were advised that the room might be noisy but on Friday night, despite guests sitting outside, it was not disturbing. But Saturday was different and I'd advise others to hesitate before booking this room if staying in the warmer summer months.

Apart from intrusive noise from the guests on Saturday night, we were delighted with our room. It was spacious and immaculately presented, even having a wardrobe light that automatically came on when you approached. Quality complimentary toiletries, fluffy towels and bathrobes, and ample Stafford notepaper are welcome bonuses. There are no drinks making facilities in the room but a tray of tea in a silver teapot and with a lovely flower on the tray arrives no sooner than ordered. The bed was extremely comfortable and there were ample sofas, chairs and desks in the room. The marbled bathroom was superb with a huge bath, a separate shower and underfloor heating. A welcome addition to the room might be the provision of a couple of glossy lifestyle magazines: the in-house Kempinski magazine is, frankly, a poor substitute. A complimentary copy of the Times is very welcome.

Breakfast in the room on Saturday morning was a real treat but, wishing to sample the decor of the refurbished Lyttelton, we took breakfast there on Sunday. We enjoyed it immensely: hot, well cooked, well presented and with an excellent choice. There was, however, a minor criticism: no toast arrived and when we asked for this it arrived looking as if the bread had just be cursorily introduced to the toaster as it rushed out of the kitchen, The waiter, when clearing the plates, was full of apologies and immediately offered us proper toast and not warmed bread.

We did not take full afternoon tea at the Stafford and I am sure it is excellent judging by the wonderful complimentary birthday cake, but, in passing, can I recommend champagne tea at Brown's - a real treat. 

We wanted the weekend to be special because it was to be a new start after a horrendous past couple of years of a brain tumour immediately followed by very aggressive breast cancer. The Stafford did not let us down. We had a perfect weekend that was then augmented by being invited to a garden party at Buckingham Palace three days later. Unable to stay, the Stafford immediately offered us the use of their facilities to get changed and, again, we had a great lunch in the American Bar. The garden party was an experience that we will always remember but, let it be known, the Stafford chocolate cake is considerably better than that served at the Palace! 

Next year we will be back at the Stafford; when we are in London it really is our residence.",5,2011,06,30
142,exemplary service and priced accordingly !,"stayed for 5 nights in June 2011 , I hadn't known of the hotel before . The location is perfect  , 2 adjacent London parks , the glitz of the West End nearby  and the more sedate St James's shopping/galleries and Mayfair across Piccadilly , all in easy strolling distance . The City is 20 minutes by tube .
This is not an inexpensive hotel however the attentive and personalised service makes it a worthwhile pleasure to stay here . The American Bar has an excellent single malt selection and the senior staff are urbane and professional , this is a watering hole of distinction.
The internet  menu puts the pricey paid options first and a rather secluded final option is the free service , which was completely adequate for email and internet . I suggest that there's a sign on the desk in the room guiding free internet access .
Room was smallish but comfortable , good wardrobe space and great marble bathroom with separate shower and tub. All spanking new .
Turndown service included shutting drapes which was thoughtful .
I will return without hesitation .",5,2011,06,29
142,"Nice Hotel, but watch out for the hidden charges!","If you want free highspeed wifi and internet in your rooms -- look elsewhere.   The hotel is quaint, if a little old fashioned, and I agree with the reviews that question the heating -- lobbies and stairwells were freezing and room thermostat was iffy at best.   Staff was very nice and responsive and location is good for Mayfair/Piccadilly area.  My principal beef and warning to all travelers is over their so-called ""free"" wifi internet in the rooms.  They advertise free wifi (and I booked through Expedia on this basis).  Then they hit you with hidden charges for wifi if you click on the higher speed wifi alternative.   Frankly, my experience with business hotels in London is that when wifi is free -- it is free.   If their Ibahn requires you to accept charges to access the internet, these are reversed when you check out.  I checked out with no charges, and then TWO WEEKS LATER, charges appeared on my credit card, which the hotel refused to take off.    Frankly, I found this extraordinary and will make my choices elsewhere next time I go to London.",3,2011,06,26
142,Perfect hotel in London,"Just arrived home from a fantastic 5 day stay at the Stafford.  It is situated in St James.  Just a few minute walk through Green Park to the Tube.  We arrived early on an overnight flight and they checked us into our room early.  We have traveled all over the world and stayed at 5star hotels everywhere and this was the best as far as customer service!  Laura, the front desk, employee was very courteous and took the time to show us around the hotel and our room directly.  Later in our stay I wanted to see other rooms for my information and she obliged without question.  Paul, the concierge, not only took time to walk us away from the hotel to show us directions, but also followed up to make sure our needs were met.  When we left, we left him a generous tip which he thanked us for and sent us on our way in our taxi.  A few minutes later he phoned the taxi driver to ask if we really meant to be so generous!  Can you imagine???

The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms have to be the best in London.  Separate all marble bath and showers.  US outlets in the room so power convertors are not necessary. 

We had 1 small issue with a pull out bed not being made one evening.The manager was there immediately to handle the issue himself!  Just amazing customer service.  

Location is exceptional with many great restaurants very close by.  Easy access to the Tube, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus, Browns hotel for Tea, ect.

My only suggestion is that they should have a take-away coffee station in the morning and a welcome reception with wine in the afternoon.  This would work very well in this style of boutique hotel.

I have already booked my return trip next year to stay at the Stafford!  It's expensive but well worth it!  (remember the VAT is 20%/day)",5,2011,06,20
142,exquisite,"second stay in the past year - surpassed expectation again. good kitchen, great american bar. the refurbishments are exceptional - the restaurant is much, much-improved. great standards throughout and good staff. has an air of grandeur and gentility. very enjoyable.",5,2011,05,16
142,The best hotel in London!,"We recently stayed at the Stafford while on a family outing in London.  A few days prior to our arrival we recieved a courtesy call to say there were renovations ongoing in one part of the hotel but this did not affect our stay at all and we barely noticed.

The staff at reception were ever so friendly and showed us to our room.  We were lucky enough to stay in one of their Junior Suites which was perfect.
Beautifully decorated, huge comfortable bed and a bathroom I would LOVE to have at home.  The room was very luxurious and had everything we needed and more and the complimentary chocolates delicious!  We had the best nights sleep and would never have thought we were in the centre of London.

We enjoyed our breakfast in the American Bar and we both had fruit salad, juice, coffee and Eggs Benedict which was delicious.

There is nothing about this hotel we did not like and if we ever go to London again this would be our first choice.",5,2011,05,13
142,Expected More,"This hotel has small rooms, a drafty lobby areas and offers not inroom snacks (for purchase or otherwise).  It's bright spot was the sunken bathroom, which I enjoyed, but for the price I paid I expected more.",3,2011,05,04
142,FABULOUS,"Spent four glorious days at The Stafford for my first visit to London.  The staff is top-notch.  Could not have been nicer. Helped planned numerous excursions prior to arrival and assisted with every need once we arrived.  Very good location - within walking distance to a number of attractions.  The American Bar was the only restuarnat serving meals as the dinning room was being renovated. The breakfasts were incredible.  Great outdoor patio to have a relaxing glass of wine after sightseeing.  

We stayed in the Mews - highly recommend an upgrade if you can.  Lovely linens.  Super comfortable bed and pillows.  Good amount of room for two people.  We also had an electric fire place with a blower to take the chill off the room without turning the heat on.  The bathroom was beautiful - decnet amount of room and wonderful towel warmer!

I cannot wait to return to The Stafford.  I will not even think about looking for another hotel.",5,2011,04,07
142,Charming and Beautiful,"Wonderful hotel in an amazing location.  Silence in a hidden courtyard.

Staff great, very friendly but do see your every move (have to hand key over and collect when you are coming and going).  Very typical in a boutique hotel such as this.

Room was beautiful, clean and included all the amenities.  King bed was very comfortable, view was of the back of the St James' hotel.

The American Bar was perhaps the highlight of the stay.  Barmen was fabulous and it was just a great place to relax after a day of running around.

If you're looking for a great boutique hotel, this is the one.",4,2011,03,27
142,perfection in a tiny boutique,"we were recommended to stay at The Stafford because of its location, beautiful and historic interiors and the superior knowledge and helpfulness of the concierege, Frank. Our children loved the American Bar, the location to shopping, Buckingham and the Mall.  It is a hidden gem that only those in 'the know' hear about.  If you want something modern, sleek and full of either tourists or gliteratti....don't go here.  This hotel is about atmosphere, indulgence and location!  Highly recommend.",5,2011,03,24
142,Small and cosy..,"A quick one night stay in early February. Very nice establishment. Considering we were a stone's throw from Piccadilly circus it was very peaceful. In fact, maybe due to the fact that we occupied one of the rooms in the courtyard (ex stables) you could believe you were in the country. It is currently being refurbished and did not get round to have a look at the rest of the hotel or the restaurant so can't comment on that. One thing I would recommend however is the bar, loads of character and charm. Have a nightcap there after a hectic night out in London, you will love it. Very much a boutique hotel, pretty much like the St. James club round the corner. Recommended.",4,2011,02,19
142,2nd Time Around Brilliant,"What a contrast to the first time I visited The Stafford. Everything was perfect in every way. We were welcomed by name by the duty manager, remembering me from my last visit. The tour of hotel was done properly this time. Receptionist was perfect. The suite was outstanding. Everything was clean and very new. Bed was comfortable. Every amenity you could want, from air conditioned wardrobes, to bath salts and personalised business cards and letter headed paper were provided. Everything to make our stay perfect had been thought about and provided in advance. There is no real outlook at The Stafford which is a minus offset by the fact you can sleep in peace with no road noise. This time we went in the bar (had brought a jacket this time) and Mrs C had oysters. They were perfect. Breakfast was served with such professionalism this time. The waiter could not do any more for us. We were allowed a very late check out of 4pm which again was ideal.

What a contrast compared to the first visit. I cannot recommend this hotel enough if this is the standard of service that is given to every guest. My only word of concern is that the main house is being renovated and the older rooms may not represent what I was given on this visit. If the Hotel is refitted to the standard of the suite, This will be my home in London for all future stays. OUTSTANDING.",5,2011,02,17
142,Missing a few beats -- not a five-star hotel,"I stayed at the Stafford for five nights.  Good points: room nicely appointed, for the most part; exceptional housekeeping staff; free wifi throughout hotel many nice details in service; nearly all staff very friendly and helpful but seemed more training than sincerity in some; great, quiet location.  

Issues: cold room (heat seemed to magically come on Dec 1st) on an unusually cold week in London; lounge area furniture tattered and spotted; lounge wait people were dismissive; breakfast chef made the worst overly-salted scrambled eggs and leather-tough pancakes I've ever had; bathroom was unheated, with a floor literally like ice, and very cramped; shower dribbled water, not a power shower for sure!; desk chair was a banquet chair and way too short for use; free wifi incredibly slow.  

Hotel is being renovated in early 2011.",3,2010,12,07
142,Above expectations,"We stayed at the Stafford over Thanksgiving with 2 adults and 3 kids, ages 14,11 and 9.  We had 2 connecting rooms in the main building.   The big positives for the hotel were:
-- Location.  St James is very convenient, and the hotel is on a small, dead end side street.
-- Quiet.   Not a peep from the neighborhood at night. 
-- Water pressure.  This is not normally a category, but in London it should, and nice to have a warm shower with good water pressure. 
-- Concierge.  Really great service and a small enough hotel, that they remember your itinerary, and were very helpful with suggestions.  From great seats at events to recommending the perfect soccer store for my kids, this was top notch service. 
No real negatives that we encountered.",5,2010,11,29
142,Perfectly located and keeping the English traditions,"All in all a fantastic stay in the centre of London. The Hotel has exellent staff treating you with the utmost care. Hotel manages to keep the English tradition in a more modern style. 
There is a hidden secret in the hotel which is the wine cellar...this is a must to see. 
The rooms are fairly sized keeping in mind it is a city hotel. The sleeping quality is outstanding. Definitely a spot in London to recommend",5,2010,11,24
142,Good value if you can get a deal,"Excellent staff , excellent comfortable bar and facilities.
However our special deal room ( 603 ) was small and not really 5 star standard , ok for two days but not longer.Bathroom tiny and shabby 3 star at best.Breakfast on saturday excellent, sunday there was a wait ,no tables available,fruit cocktail not quite as good same for bread selection poached eggs overcooked.very good location and quiet.At £159 a night would revisit .would recommend but only at this price",4,2010,11,08
142,Gem in the Heart of Mayfair,"Fabulous, tradtional hotel. Staff all excellent and friendly. American Bar atmospheric. Could not have wished for a better place to stay in London, tucked away but close to shops, restaurants and theatres. Would be a lovely place to stay in the Summer with the outside terrace.",5,2010,10,26
142,The creme de la creme,"It is always important to know who is writing a review, to best understand it and to put it in context.  I am a travel professional, over 50 years old, specializing in higher end unique properties in Europe and North America.  I have been privileged to stay in many of the finest commercially available properties and travel often.

The Stafford has a unique old world charm with grace and well done English style.  The service is constant but never officious or pretentious.  Every patron I saw was treated well, whether they wore blue jeans or stylish suits.  The staff anticipated but was restrained and never obtrusive.  

Unlike some of the finer hotels available, the Stafford lobby and public rooms are quite small, intimate and understated.  No grand entry ways or large ball rooms here.  This is a small hotel excelling in subtlety, quality and service.  I did have the chance to look at several levels of accommodations during my 4 night visit in mid-October.  The entry level rooms are small but well appointed, quite clean with very nice bathrooms. The deluxe king rooms in the main building are very nicely done, with room for a sitting chair, fine bathroom, but still not large, especially by US standards. Where the rooms at the Stafford truly excel is with the junior and full suites both in the ""mews"" and their newer building contiguous to the original older structure.  The suites are accompanied by a bar, fridge (stocked with light beverages free of charge), a fantastic and large bath area, 2 closets, incredible beds, individual air and heat, an entry way and so much more.  No two rooms in the hotel are alike.  Free wifi.
 
The suites are nothing short of sublime with all the amenities you can think of.  The American Bar is wonderful with the ""old fashion"" attention that you'd expect from quality bartenders.  It is, quite expensive, but a unique and very enjoyable experience.  We visited three times during our stay, with nuts served to your heart's content. There is also an excellent gym on premises, with towels and freely available cold water. 
 
We ate one dinner in the main dining room and found both the food and service outstanding.  No breakfasts taken at the hotel, but instead elected nearby quick coffee bars. It is noteworthy, that the Stafford attracts a very high percentage of business guests, judging by both dress and the conversations being had.  This is neither bad or good thing and in no way detracts from the experience. It would appear that the Stafford is not a hotel where you'll see a preponderance of tourists or families.  
 
It should be noted, that the location is perhaps as good as any in London.  Many other commentators have discussed this previously, and the convenience, quiet and safety of this location cannot be overstressed.  It is on a cul du sac with no through vehicular traffic in front of the hotel. The concierge was always helpful, usually remembered our name and was quick to answer our questions or to offer up suggestions.  We had the hotel book us a car to the airport upon departure (95 GBP), and when the driver was delayed, the concierge made great efforts to keep us updated while being very apologetic, though, it was not the fault of the hotel.  The car was a very comfortable, new Mercedes and for little more than a taxi, I highly recommend this alternative.  It was a wonderful send off after an unparalleled stay.
 
The Stafford is indeed a special place, but it is not for everyone.  Not only is it quite expensive, but the level of service, coupled with the location, public areas and high quality rooms cater to those guests who seek a higher level of attention without the pretense or notoriety that often accompanies glitzy 5 star hotels.  I recommend this hotel without reservation.  I must say bravo to the Stafford and their superior staff.  It will indeed by my preferred destination whilst in London.  I cannot wait to return.",5,2010,10,26
142,Elegant and extremely comfortable.  Felt like home.,"The outside of the hotel is unassuming and the lobby area was a bit dated, but the service and the rooms could not have been better.  I received a complimentary upgrade and was incredibly impressed with the size and quality of my room. It was so comfortable, it felt like home. I wish I could have stayed longer! The service from the hotel staff was exceptional. I strongly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,10,25
142,"high end luxury, standards of gentility from a golden age","a wonderfully-refurbished hotel that is evocative of a golden age. it's easy to understand why it's so popular with americans, the stafford is so terribly, terribly english. you almost expect mary poppins to dance along the rooves. great rooms, well appointed, with good food and high standards of service; what's not to like. exceptional.",5,2010,10,25
142,Pure Luxury,"We stayed one night in a Junior Suite and what a beautiful suite it was. Decor was absolutely gorgeous, quality furnishings and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud! Easy walking distance to Piccadilly Circus right in the heart of town, but very peaceful location. Service was first class. Loved the American Bar. Pure Luxury!!!!",5,2010,10,19
142,Luxurious comfort in excellent location,"We stayed 3 nights at the Stafford and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in an excellent, quiet location despite being in the very heart of London. Every member of staff we encountered was charming and helpful. Our room was well appointed, breakfasts were first rate and the the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. This is a luxury hotel with a friendly, welcoming face. We would have no hesitation in returning and would thoroughly recommend it.",5,2010,10,18
142,Very disappointing on many levels,"The Stafford was unacceptable on many different levels.  I stayed in room 207 for 3 nights, and considered leaving after the first night but did not want to be bothered.

The Room: The room was small, which one would expect in London, and not very nice.  The wallpaper was peeling and the shower rod was broken.  Worst of all was the bed.  The mattress was absolutely terrible, the worst of any hotel at which I have stayed;  Moreover, there were only two pillows, and a threadbare blanket.  While I was in the shower my last day, there was obviously an electrical ""spike"" that took out half of the lights in the room, and killed my $150 flat iron.

The Service: I walked down and asked for a cab one day to get to a meeting.  The doorman went out to look for one, only to come back 10 minutes later saying that he couldn't get one.  He recommended that I walk out toward Picadilly (in rain and 3"" heels) and try to get one myself.

The American Bar: The service was disappointing here too.  The ambiance was great, there was good, palatable wine by the glass, but the wait staff forgot about my order.  I overheard them discussing it; instead of just apologizing and re-doing the order, they served me a stone cold burger and fries.  It was a shame because the flavors were good. 

Bottom line: find somewhere else to stay in London.  I certainly will.",2,2010,10,15
142,An Absolute Gem,"Just back from a weekend in London and stayed at the Stafford. This is an absolute gem of a hotel. Felt at home & very welcome as soon as we arrived. The staff were all pleasant, friendly & very helpful. The food was great & the attention to detail was appreciated - no buffet breakfast here - food was cooked to order so hot & fresh & the waiter service made us feel very spoilt. We will definately be staying here next time we are in town. Just one suggestion - tea making facilities in the room would make everything perfect.",5,2010,09,27
142,Real british hospitality you really feel...,"Real british hospitality you really feel at home and taken care at all times by the staff. The rooms are just fantastic. Internet was free, finally I find a hotel that's inteligent.  Food was great especially at the American bar and the English breakfast was perfect real black pudding and great sausage. The location couldn't be better as you are in the middle of everything but with no noice from the city",5,2010,09,04
142,Great Find in Central London,"My wife and I have just returned from a three night stay at the Stafford booked through a Travelzoo deal  £159 including full English breakfast and upgraded room.  The hotel is a great little find situated behind the Ritz and so convenient to Green Park underground station.  There is a shortcut which is only open until 10pm from Green Park to the hotel and it takes less than 5 minutes to the station.
The deal included an upgraded room which was delightful and was furnished with a king size bed, large bathroom with bath and separate shower, Bose radio/CD, Lowe TV, electric blinds/voiles, complementary water and newspapers (on request), slippers, dressing gowns, lots of toiletries etc etc. - little things which make a stay special.  The inclusive breakfast was a delight.  Great selection of fresh fruit juices, fresh fruit - we received a bowl of strawberries, blueberries, loganberries, raspberries and grapes followed by tasty bacon, sausages, eggs, mushrooms and, if you so desired, black puddings, kidneys, tomatoes etc.  This was followed by a selection of pastries and delicious Welsh honey and jams.  The breakfast was all waiter service - no queueing for lukewarm bacon and eggs from a bain marie!!  One of the delights of our visit was a knock on the door - a member of staff brought us a bowl of fresh strawberries and a small box of excellent chocolates.  This really made our stay so enjoyable - apart from In Cuba, we have never had a surprise like that before.
The downside - there are always downsides but nothing which would spoil our stay: there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms - this is something we always appreciate.  I did mention this to a member of staff when asked about our stay and was told it had been commented on previously.
I would certainly recommend this hotel especially if you can obtain a good deal.  There are cheaper deals around and we do tend to take more breaks as a result of deals but I think you would find it hard to beat this one.
Previous comments regarding staff not being helpful were just not applicable to our stay - ALL the staff were helpful and friendly and not a bit snooty which can be the case in some posher London hotels.",5,2010,08,31
142,"This hotel could be any place, anywhere; lacks personality and care","Not my favourite spot to spend the night in London; rather small suites and rooms, rather big bills.",3,2010,08,26
142,Outstanding,"Stayed for one night with my wife and elder daughter. On arrival we were greeted warmly. My daughter initially thought it was a bit twee, not to her usual taste but after a while came round to it. She now raves about it and will not stay anywhere else in London.  It is very well located being close to designer shops and yet is very secluded and peaceful at night. The staff were a delight, rooms were very clean and well appointed and breakfast amazing. Its not often, in even five star hotels, that breakast is served to table. The only thing which we felt a little tetchy about was being made to wear a jacket after five o'clock in the bar, but rules are rules no matter how silly. My wife has informed me that this will now be our base anytime we return to London.",5,2010,08,23
142,What a disappointment!,"My husband and I took my 80 year old disabled parents for a very special trip to London and stayed one night in this five star hotel. Even though I rang and emailed the hotel three times before our stay  to try to make sure all went well, it was a disaster as soon as we walked in the door. The attitude of the staff was condescending and supercilious.
There was a catalogue of events that made our stay at the Stafford Hotel a nightmare especially for my elderly parents. For them on their very first trip to London ,it was exhausting and disappointing.
If you are thinking of staying at The Stafford just beware that it is not all it's cracked up to be.",2,2010,08,20
142,Perfect location - an oasis of calm and elegance,Room was rather small and view limited to say the least when one considers it was a 5 star hotel (booked a special offer at a good price through a general site - was this a factor?). Everything else was wonderful - the ambience and the location. Felt spoilt. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. Enjoyed the atmosphere in the American bar. Would love to visit again but would need to look for another special deal as it is beyond our usual budget. In a perfect world I'd upgrade and go there at every opportunity.,4,2010,08,17
142,"Personal, Stylish - a quality hotel that really cares for their Guests","What a wonderful place to stay.  The staff are attentive & offer just the right level of personal service.  This was my 2nd stay at the hotel - both suites we stayed in were individually designed (1 contemporary, & 1 traditional) , spotlessly clean, perfectly maintained, & looked gorgeous.  I really appreciated the complimentary access to the Third Place - a fantastic gym & pool in the heart of the West End.  The hotel's location is quiet & perfectly positioned for a short walk to Mayfair, Covent Garden, & the Theatres.",5,2010,08,17
142,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"Stayed at the Stafford St James's in August with my wife and 10 month old child for four nights. The hotel itself was just fantastic; the rooms are what you would expect for a boutique hotel in its locations, luxurious and a reasonable size.
The location is fantastic with great access to Buckingham Palace, Oxford and Piccadilly Circus within a very short walk.
The reception and concierge were exceptionally helpful and courteous and really made you feel welcome.
The only disappointing part was the restaurant and in particular the service or lack of. Wait staff were literally missing (even the reception staff couldn't find anyone to serve us for over 20 minutes). Orders were more times than not incorrect and the really made you feel like they didn't want you there.
Aside from that our stay was very enjoyable and would absolutely recommend this hotel to other travelers.",4,2010,08,17
142,"Without question, the best hotel I've ever used","We booked the Stafford months in advance, wanting a small, quiet hotel with a central location.  When we arrived we found we could stretch the budget a bit, and upgraded to a suite.  The result was well worth the money.

We started with a tour of the hotel.  We needed that, just to find the room.  From there, it just got better: heated towel bars, windows that actually open wide, good lighting, a 120 V outlet, fast wireless internet included in the price (you listening, American pseudo-4 star hotels?)

As for ""quiet,"" the Stafford's front entrance is in St. James's Place, a deadend street with no traffic at all except a few taxis coming to the hotel.  The ""back"" entrance is in the mewes off St. James's St., a busy central London thoroughfare.  But the mewes itself is very quiet and has an outdoor extension of the American Bar for relaxation.  We never heard any traffic noise.

The location is perfect: 5 minutes by foot from the Green Park underground stop, 5 minutes from Buckingham Palace and 10 minutes from Picadilly Circus by foot, and taxis available day and night either from the front door or by hailing one in St. James's St.  There are restaurants and pubs to suit all budgets within easy walking distance.  Hatchard's (books) and Fornum & Mason are both within a few minutes' walk, as are Regent and Bond (New & Old) Sts.

The staff are capable and competent.  We found the pillows a little hard the first night, but after mentioning this to the concierge we found softer pillows on the bed for the rest of our stay.  The complimentary bottle of plonk and free minibar were friendly touches, too.  

All in all, I don't know why anyone would use any other hotel in London.",5,2010,08,11
142,A real birthday treat,"What a find (and it does take some finding!!). Hidden away in a cul-de-sac in the St James area of London the hotel gives excellent access for theatres, restaurants and sightseeing but is in a lovely quiet location.
Better than this, it brings back all the olde worlde standards of service and quality that is now so difficult to find. Check in was a delight and included an offer to give us a guided tour of the hotrel before being shown to our room. Our room was super - quality furnishings and decoration, seperate dressing room, excellent marble bathroom and a really comfortable bed.
We had both dinner and breakfast at the hotel and several drinks in the bar. Service throughout was top quality and the food could not be faulted. One short session in the bar was after 5pm so one had to wear a jacket - a very nice touch,
We will certainly return. The hotel is part of the Kempinski chain.",5,2010,08,08
142,A Little Gem,"I booked this Hotel through an agency and thought I had got a good rate but maybe the room might not be so big. I should not of worried ,as I was upgraded, furthermore I could smoke in it, nowdays this is a real plus. The room was a shear delight, spacious,quiet, well laid out, extremely restful. The breakfast was freshly made and afternoon tea so much we had to leave some. The staff in all departments are eager to please and nothing is to much trouble, its easy to see why as Stuart Procter, the General Manager is constantly at the forefront of the operation. Loved the bar and outside seating area in the mews, on a sunny evening I could not think of anywhere better in the West End of London to enjoy a drink of something. Thank you The Stafford.",5,2010,08,05
142,Worst Room I have seen in a 5 star Hotel......BUT...............,"I booked this hotel having read the glowing reviews about it on Tripadvisor. To be honest I wish I had read the 2 star reviews, before booking this hotel. I booked a special deal that included an upgrade to a Deluxe King.

I arrived by underground from Heathrow, after a 10 hour flight from Siberia. I met a colleague outside the hotel and entered to check in. It was obvious we were being looked at by the doorman, and was asked if he could help us. I said I was checking in and my colleague, who was not staying at the hotel sat down in the small sitting area near the door. The doorman never took his eyes off either of us. We did not look completely scruffy, but I was not in a suit. We both felt very uncomfortable.  Not a great welcome.

I had to wait at the reception whilst the receptionist talked to another receptionist and then took a call whilst I stood there. There were apologies but it was not a good welcome. I was asked about my requests, including 2 newspapers. The hotel sends a guest request sheet to fill in, before arrival. I was given a brief tour of the hotel, but some vital things such as the internet connection in the lobby, breakfast serving times and gym were left out. I dropped my bags in the room, had a wash and left for the afternoon.

On my return with my colleague, we went to the bar but were refused entry as we were not wearing a jacket. I do not mind this at all, as I was informed in advance no jacket no entry, but we were not offered a drink in the room or lounge. We went out to a local supermarket and bought a bottle. After my friend had left I ran a bath. I noticed that the bath water had a lot of long black hairs floating on the surface. It was also obvious that the shower curtain did not smell very nice. I drained the bath, showered it down and rinsed the shower curtain. I was amazed that such a hotel could have a bathroom that was not cleaned properly. It was at this point that I noticed other things that were wrong. The side panel on the bath was falling off. There was red mildew on the grout around the bath. A strip of wood on the bath holding the panel was brown with stains. I look at the pair of scales under the sink and they were broken, glass cracked and one of the feet were missing. This is not what I had expected from such a prestigious hotel. I entered the bath and the soap holder fell off the wall. It had not been attached properly. In essence the bathroom had many maintenance issues, as you can see from the pictures.

I left the bathroom and then noticed that the carpet was filthy, behind the door was a large square patch of dirt and along the edges of the room, where the hoover could not reach was black.

Turn-down was just that, sheets turning down, no slippers or a chocolate.  Once again I felt this was a minimal effort given the reputation of this hotel. The bed was a king but it was in fact two singles put together with a join in the middle.

In the morning no newspapers had been delivered. I had requested them and the receptionist had mentioned them, but non were delivered. I went to breakfast. During breakfast I was asked if everything was OK. I answered no and the waitress suggested I talk to the manager.

After breakfast I talked to the Resident Manager about the issues as detailed above. In all fairness he listened and wrote every concern down, but he answered some of my issues with an attitude that ""This is The Stafford"". Please do not get me wrong, he was very helpful but his attitude that this was The Stafford, was very slightly insulting. I know what I had seen and had some photographs to show what I was saying was the truth. I returned to my room and proceeded to look at every aspect of the room. I found a number of other issues. The headboard with full of bits of white fluff, it had not been cleaned properly for quite some time. The rod that should have been attached to the window was missing 2 screws. The window pane was filthy. The leather panel on the desk was curled upwards exposing the glue and wood. The skirting boards were chipped in many places exposing wood. There were plugs protruding from the walls by the curtains. Overall the room was not clean and there were a lot of maintenance issues.

I received a phone call from the Resident Manager, who informed me that the Hotel was refunding my money and if I would phone him, when I next wished to visit the hotel, he would make sure all would be OK.

I checked out of the room and asked to speak to the manager, Stuart Procter. I took my camera with me and showed him some photo's. I explained to him what the Resident Manager had said about it being ""The Stafford"" and had looked and found more problems. I was told that the room would be refurbished in 2011. We had a very pleasant chat and I was assured that he would personally ensure my next visit would be exceptional.

I have to conclude this review in this way. For me it is a puzzle how a room in such a condition, could be sold by such a hotel. It is very puzzling as it can only damage the reputation of the hotel. There were failures of housekeeping, maintenance and customer service in terms of the newspapers, bar and the welcome. Quite frankly this is the worst room I have seen in a five star establishment. In my opinion it should not have been sold, until all the issues had been resolved. If the matter had been left like that  then my review would have given the hotel a rating of 1 star.

BUT

The story went on. Without any argument and without any problems, my money was refunded. The hotel manager listened to me and apologised for the failures. Too often nobody cares about the issues raised on check out. It would be a very easy thing to rubbish this hotel for the room and below average service, but at this hotel two managers tried to put things right. There was no arguing about the condition of the room or staff failures and I saw a PRO ACTIVE approach, money refunded and a complimentary stay at my convenience.    

I could quite easily give this hotel a 1 star rating, but in all fairness I could not ask for much more from either manager, in finding a resolution to what had happened. This managerial approach is sadly lacking from so many London hotels.

I hope the room is cleaned and all the maintenance issues are rectified and a quality check system is put in place, to prevent this from happening again. I will be more than happy to give this hotel a higher rating if it deserves it, after my next stay.  

I would recommend this hotel, so long as the issues that are outlined in this review, are dealt with correctly and I have faith they will be.

Thank you Mr Procter for your time on Thursday morning.",3,2010,07,30
142,quiet elegance within walking distance of great shops and restaurants,"Stayed for business on many occasions.  Suggest you ask for the rooms in the Carriage House.  The decor and architecture will make this a more rich experience.  The service from all the staff is impeccable.  Expect to be known by name if you are there more then a day. the American Bar in the hotel has mostly locals in the late afternoon, for a post work drink.
Minutes away from Hyde Park, and Royal Gardens.  A short walk to Soho, and many shopping areas.",5,2010,07,23
142,A truly British feeling quality experience,"Upon arrival we were slightly under whelmed by the reception area at the front of the hotel, perhaps needing a bit of an upgrade and some decoration plus some air conditioning. As you move deeper into the hotel there is a much grander feel about it than reception area would suggest. The bar is just fascinating we spent a good 25 minutes on Sunday morning just studying the incredible amount of memorabilia on the walls and ceiling.
We were pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded to a Mews room which was both large and beautifully furnished.
The cobbled courtyard seating area at the rear of the hotel was a fantastic place for a warm summer evening drink.
The hotel makes a huge play on its heritage and tradition and it provides an experience that is quite unlike any other we have had in London. You just get the feeling that if you were to ask why a thing was done in a particular way, the response would be because that is how we have always done it sir!!
Lovely staff, lovely place.",5,2010,07,05
142,Disappointing for a 5 star hotel - avoid Room 123!!,"Having traveled extensively for both business & pleasure, I was somewhat surprised to find the room that we had at The Stafford fell well short of my expectations of a 5 star hotel. We booked though Last Minute.com & were offered a 5 star hotel in a ""mystery location"". We expected a discounted rate but not a ""discounted room""!
The bathroom was uncomfortably small, with barely any room to move. The shower was totally inadequate - a shower-head over the bath in a very restricted space with a shower curtain that had to be fought off constantly (& we are both very slim!)
The bedroom, whilst adequate was rather dark & gloomy as it was situated on a low floor with a window that looked out onto a wall & therefore very little daylight.
On the plus side, we found all the staff to be very professional & helpful & the location is great but I'm afraid we would not choose to stay here again or recommend it to friends or colleagues. 
Maybe Rm 123 is the only poor room & we were unfortunate to get this one, but we have had far superior rooms in other top hotels for the same price or less & were very disappointed! Ours was not a 5 star experience at all!!",3,2010,07,04
142,Excellent friendly hotel in a great location in London,We booked this hotel as a mystery choice through Lastminute and what a stroke of luck! We stayed two nights in one of the Mews rooms which was way above our expectations a nice big room very comfortably furnished.  The service was friendly but impeccable and the concierge staff were also excellent and helpful.The attention to detail was superb- including a free bowl of strawberries delivered to our room.The room service was good value and beautifully presented. It really did feel like home and we were very reluctant to leave. Our only regret was not having breakfast at the hotel but using the Wolsely restaurant around the corner which was overpriced and disappointing.We can't wait to go back and would not stay anywhere else in London.,5,2010,07,03
142,great hotel in a great location,"lovely staff who made us feel very welcome.
the room was small-ish, but it is the centre of London, and it was very well laid out for maximum effect.  There was plenty of storage and the bathroom was a good size.  There was a ceiling fan as well as air conditioning, both of which worked.

The only thing that happened was that a bulb blew and took out a fuse.  But the hotel had someone up to fix it within about 5 minutes and everything worked great after that.

We spent most of the day doing tourist stuff, and ate out in the evening, so really only slept in the hotel, but it was lovely.",5,2010,06,29
142,The most friendly and comfortable hotel in which I have ever stayed,"This is the hotel in which I shall stay on every future trip to London.  My stay was made memorable not only by the wonderful comfort of the room but even more by the exceptional helpfulness and friendliness of the staff.  Examples include the receptionist who took time to personally give me a tour of the hotel; the barman who was thoughtful enough to bring me a newspaper and snacks while I waited for lunch; and the valet who cleaned my shoes with great care and returned them to me very quickly in time for me to go out to a meeting.  The best rates for the hotel are to be found on its own website, specially if you book 15 days in advance.",5,2010,06,27
142,Happy guest - will be back as soon as we can!,"My husband and I have been to London before and were always perplexed by the plethora of hotel choices - we never found ""the one"" until now.  This was our first stay at The Stafford and now it will be ""the one"" for us in the future.  It is in a fabulous location, close to all the action, but is an oasis of calm and discretion.  We loved the staff.  Look forward to returning next year, if not sooner.",5,2010,06,24
142,"If I could live in a hotel, this would be the one","Ok, so the location is a little tricky to get to .... but once you're there you don't want to leave.  My all time favourite hotel in London was the now sadly departed 22 in Jermyn St.  I tried to book 22 days before it closed and they recommended the Stafford and gave me an email for their GM, Stuart.  And credit to the lovely Laurie from 22, the Stafford has become my new favourite in London.  

Its elegant, well located, and really, kinda like living in a lovely royal palace minus the slightly nutty family.  The staff are fabulous and answer every question with care and concern - even my questions about how to tip hairdressers and getting to Heathrow at 5am.  They keep a quiet eye on you so much that I hadn't noticed until I was clearly minus a husband and they informed me he was having tea in the lounge (he was a pig in mud there).

We had breakfast at Fortnum & Mason (2 mins walk away), went walking through Green Park to Buckingham Palace and up to the HorseGuards (laneway leads straight onto the park), and the Green Park tube station is 2 min walk away.  Dinner options are sensation with Rowleys, the Wolseley and Langans all within 2 mins walk as is a Marks and Spencer with all you need for a great bed-picnic after a full day sightseeing (this is the home of the 2 min walk!)

We spent four nights a the Stafford in Oct 09 (I'm a late poster) and this was pre-Kempinski takeover.  But if they have kept Stuart Procter in charge, they are clever folks. The Stafford puts the L in luxury and the L in London.  This is how the other half live!",5,2010,06,08
142,Perfect in every way,"A wonderful British style hotel which offers the highest stardards of service. Having stayed a several hotels, this is my favourite hotel in London. The very helpful concierge and reception staff are superb. Also the restaurant is something you must try, very high quality and the private trip to the wine cellar is priceless! As a regular Kempinski guest, I am happy that I have a home away from home in London.",5,2010,06,04
142,What a treat...fantastic hotel!!!,"4 members of my family stayed for a week at the Stafford and it was truly a wonderful trip. The staff is wonderful. The level of service is fabulous. Here are some details:

We stayed in rooms 415/416 at the end of a hallway. 416 is a two room suite and it can be easily paired with 415 to accomodate 4-6 people vey comfortably. Our room had a very deep bath, seperate shower, refrigerator, and 110V plugs to acocmodate our US devices (like computers, ipods, camera chargers, etc)

The key system is very old fashioned and charming...real keys that you leave at the desk when you go and then claim when you return.

The food at the various places to eat is delicious. We had dinner at the small restaurant, lunch many times at the American Bar (outside dining is great in the nice courtyard and I highly recommend the smoked haddock fish cake, poached egg and hollandaise) and we also had tea in the lounge. My 5 year old son loved the tea! The Wolsey restaurant is withing walking distance as well and a great choice.

The location is just across Green Park form Buckingam Palace, which makes seeing the changing of the guard remarkably easily. It is also within walking distance of the Hard Rock Cafe and only steps from the Green Park Tube Station (only two stops from Knightsbridge and Harrods).

The staff is truly remarkable and the front desk is beyond accomodating. They always had an answer, a cab, a smile, whatever you needed. If you are looking for top tier hotels in London, stay here.",5,2010,06,02
142,Best hotel experience,"I stayed at The Stafford Hotel last autumn. We ended up here because of problems with the electrisity at the hotel we have booked.
And we were not disappointed. In fact, The Stafford Hotel gave me my best hotel experience ever. 
The room was fantastic, it felt more like a home than a hotel room. And the staff was all so nice.
In august I will go back to London with my daughter. This will be her first time in London, and I know that the stay at The Stafford Hotel will be something she will never forget. To stay at a hotel as The Stafford Hotel, makes the journey from Norway to London something even more special, and it really complete the feeling of beeing in one of the nicest towns on earth.",5,2010,05,26
142,"Essentially British - Old school, detail oriented, sophisticated","The hotel sells a sense of place with a refined & traditional decor in the public areas. My room was not very big but very comfortable, including everything a Palace would offer, the intimacy as a bonus. The bathroom was cute but the shower a bit tricky for a bigger frame like mine :-).
Now, I loved my stay. I like to walk to places, sleep in a quiet environment - waking up & knowing where I traveled to while dealing with kind & helpful people. The Stafford sells just that.",5,2010,05,22
142,Perfect,"An excellent hotel.  Staff were friendly, approachable and proud of their hotel.  The room was of a very high standard, and the breakfast was just fantastic.  The ""Simply Stafford"" package was well worth going for, with champagne in our room on arrival and full english breakfast thrown in.  

Overall extremely highly recommended.",5,2010,04,26
142,worth coming back to,We stayed at the Stafford Hotel which is ideally situated to visit London as it is very centrally located. One minute from Piccadilly and near to Buckingham Palace. Helpfull staff. Clean room with marble bathroom. Breakfast room (also restaurant) is grand and breakfast was very good. As the hotel is sitauated in a cul de sac there is no traffic passing by and at night you could not hear anything. We will certainly return here. Good offers to find via booking.com.,4,2010,03,16
142,Like a Second Home in London,"After full days of business meetings in the Financial District, The Stafford is a true refuge and I instantly relax coming through the entrance.  I usually have trouble sleeping in hotels, but I actually sleep better here than at home!  Wonderful marbled bathrooms with plenty of towels (great bath products!).  The location in terrific and the staff really goes out of their way.  I get the feeling that the staff knows me and knows who I am and they always make me feel welcome.  The American Bar alone is worth the visit.
In short, you don't feel lost here as I sometimes do at the larger ""chain"" hotels - it has the feel of a private exclusive club of which I am a member!  If you are a shopper, this is a great home base.",5,2010,03,15
142,Nice rooms and great location,"Stayed at the Stafford based on a friend's recommendation. Have been trying various London hotels for a while, and small rooms,  and high prices along with stuffy lobbys dominate the landscape. At the stafford, the entrance is unobstrusive. The St James Place location is just a boon whether you want to walk out for a quick dinner after a tiring day or to get a cab.  The lobby alas its London! cramped as always. The new wing in the Mews behind is excellent, clean rooms and for once a bathroom where I can stretch without hitting the wall or the roof. The staff is attentive. The american bar is well known and a good place to down a drink. Despite the location, the rooms are quiet. Very nice stay, I enjoyed a hotel in London and that has not happened in a while!",4,2010,03,05
142,A lovely hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for the second time last December.  We loved it just as much this time as the last.  The first time we stayed in the main house this time we stayed in one of the beautiful rooms in the courtyard.  They are beautifully decorated,  lovely linens and towels, a splendid bathroom with wonderful shower, gorgeous homemade bisucits on arrival and the offer of tea served in the rooms, great beds, very very quiet  -  I could go on.  We found the staff to be more than helpful at all times and the concierge desk in particular were very helpfu.  And we loved the clubbey  bar  and enjoyed a lovely casual meal there ono our laps.  We will definetely return.",4,2010,02,25
142,"Should be called The Service, not The Stafford","I was traveling with a small child in tow. Therefore, I communicated several times BEFORE I arrived with the Concierge. The entire Concierge team was so helpful. Everything was pre-arranged, anticipated and organized by the time I checked in. Other hotels would have been tired of me and my thorough-to-an-extreme travel plans. Ironically, upon arrival and faced with an emergency (I forgot my credit cards!!) the Concierge team put me in touch with American Express and kept me calm and feeling secure. The stay at the Stafford went like clockwork. With the help of the Concierge team, I truly made the most of my time in London. We had a marvelous time. I just can't say enough about the Stafford Concierge team. Thank you so so much. Will certainly return.",5,2010,02,18
142,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Stafford on New Years Eve.  Upon arrival we were greeted straight away by reception staff and once checked in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a junior suite.  We were personally taken to our room, which was lovely.  The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  The hotel was located close enough to all the main sights and a 5 minutes walk away from Buckingham Palace.  Would recommend this hotel to anybody, we had a fantastic New Years Eve!!",5,2010,01,26
142,Great British Hospitality,"I recently stayed at Stafford for 6 nights. And All I can say is the best of the best should only be consider your hotel. From the doorman to Housekeeping and staff at the American bar along with Breakfast crew reminded me the true British Hospitality..
 
As a Company we will make your Hotel part of our home as we travel constantly from Miami to UK/London.
 
Great location, Great Concierge and best stay in London..",5,2010,01,25
142,The Good & The Bad of The Stafford,"I agree with most of what the other travelers wrote about the Stafford. Wonderful location, good value for the money. Generous extras such as the drinks in the minibar as well as free internet. The bar is charming and relaxed, the service warm and friendly. The food in the hotel is fine, not great, not bad. However, the staff is another matter. Upon arriving, no one greeted us with a welcome. Yes, they took our luggage but there was absolutely no personal feeling. At the checkin desk we were met by a woman who seemed to not know very much about the hotel. Several of her statements were corrected by her fellow front desk mate. It seemed funny at first but overall it didn't instill confidence in the hotel. Again there was no small talk such as how was your flight.  Small details but something one expects in any well run hotel. Often you would pass several staff members mysteriously lined up in the lobby as if there to greet you but instead they all stood as still as statues as if we hadn't passed. Weird. And most uncomfortable. That said room-service was quick and efficient  (although there is no button on the phone to reach them thus necessitating a call to the front desk and being transfered...minor glitch but slightly annoying every time you try to order). All small-ish quibbles but all add up to detract from an otherwise very pleasant hotel.",4,2009,12,19
142,Simply the best hotel we have stayed in,"We visit London alot for weekend breaks and have stayed at many good hotels there including Claridges and Browns.  After our visit to The Stafford this is now the only hotel we will use when in London. A hidden gem ideally located with friendly staff , gorgeous rooms and a fabulous bar. Cant wait to go again.",5,2009,11,26
142,A sophisticated hidden gem with wonderful rooms and lovely service,"We travel a fair amount and for our last weekend in London in 2009 stayed at the Berkeley where the suite we had was so outdated it looked like it was last decorated in 1985. So, we tried a completely different hotel and opted for The Stafford. Tucked away behind St James palace it's a 5 minute walk from Bond Street and light years from the Berkeley. We had one of their new mews suites and it was wonderful. Beautifully decorated, very spacious (easily suit a family with a few kids and not feel crowded) and it felt luxurious. At the price of a London suite when little details are missing it really grates, no so with The Stafford. Free soft drinks in the mini bar, night lights in the floor and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  Finally the service, understated and very classy. No wonder it's a hit with the Americans. I never write reviews, but The Stafford deserves it, I had no complaints at all (rare) and recommend it.",5,2009,11,03
142,Totally and Utterly Compelling!,"Having stayed in hotels in all over the World and in particular in London The Stafford beats them all into a cocked hat! It has recently beeen bought by a wealthy private individual I am told and I see that someone has warned us all to beware. Well that is not my experience. The rooms are quite outstanding, generous in proportion with many thoughtful extras. On my last visit service was seamless. The Concierge are the most helpful and knowledgable I have come across and the American Bar has the best staff ever, mixing formality with humour in a way that has become a dying art form. I love it! The Managers are always in evidence and seem to know everyone by name which all adds to the 'home from home' atmosphere that i have yet to experience elsewhere. Every time I go it just gets better and better. No Big Shots here just wonderful hospitality in a beautiful hotel. Long may it continue.",5,2009,10,30
142,Lovely and Perfect in Every Way,"This hotel is fabulous. We stayed in one of the suites in their carriage house and it was beautiful. The room and service were fantastic. The staff really go out of their way to make you feel welcome! Also, the location could NOT BE BETTER! You are walking distance to some of the best restaurant, the Buckingham Palace, and the green park tube! You will not be disappointed!!!",5,2009,10,29
142,Warning - hotel has been taken over,"We have been to this hotel before and found everything to be perfect. However on our most recent stay it wasn't the same. The location is still wonderful but there were little things wrong everyday. The newspaper didn't arrive the first day, we had no bath mat the second day, no face towels the next day and believe it or not no bitter in the bar (translation: bitter = real beer) on the last day. It then all became clear when the bar staff let slip that the hotel had been taken over 3 days before we arrived. Let's hope that things settle back into their old routine. The hotel is expensive so you expect things to be perfect.",4,2009,10,03
142,World Class Hotel,"The Stafford is a wonderful hotel, brimming with style and charm.  The location is ideal: on a very quiet side street just a couple of minutes' walk from bustling Piccadily, not far from Buckingham Palace.  The standard rooms are elegant and functional, with comfortable beds and luxurious furnishings.  Service is superlative -- every member of the staff I encountered was exceedingly friendly, helpful and professional, and they really went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect.  The food was excellent, and room service was always prompt.  Overall, one of the best hotels at which I have ever stayed.",5,2009,09,14
142,"Incredible style, service.  Traditional elegance.  Incredible decor.","The rooms here are decorated so beautifully and individually.  Real style.  No fru-fru and not that antiseptic contemporary style in so many gutted old British hotels.  Service was amazing. Location is just perfect. St. James's, near Buckingham, Westminter Abbey and the Churchill War Rooms.  Beautiful St. James's Park down the street. Green Park tube stop right there.  Hotel breakfast, though not included, is an amazing value. Best we had in Britain, including many hotels.",5,2009,09,08
142,Adequate but not compelling,"Our family of 3 stayed at the Stafford for 7 nights during the last week of August. I picked it over the Four Seasons Canary Wharf due to its great reviews and excellent location despite a much higher rate. The pre-paid non-refundable rate for a suite that accommodates my family of 3 at the Stafford was double that of the Four Seasons.
The location of the hotel is indeed perfect, located in a quite back street in the very posh St James areas. Minutes to tube, theatre, shopping, parks and Her Majesty's residence.

It has been many years since I visited London for pleasure and I came mentally prepared that things are expensive, compared to Asia where we live and also to
the US. Still, at 500 pounds a night I think it compares poorly with the Dar Al
Masyaf Jumerirah Dubai where we vacationed earlier this year (similarly priced),
not to mention Asian hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental,  Aman resorts or Bayan Trees.  There is nothing wrong with the hotel. The room is of a reasonable size so
that the three of us can move around without bumping into each other. I even
enjoyed the period features such as the wooden floor (instead of marble) in
the toilet and the fact that our room door doesn't open properly because it
was converted from a stable. What is lacking is warm of service. Perhaps
they were trying to emulate the feeling of service by a proper English butler.
Only the youngest employees ever wore a smile (such as the young American
lady at reception and the very green waiters in the dining room) and I dare 
say 7 days is a proper observation period. Compared to the Paris hotel
where we stayed also for a week, it was miles apart but then it was rated
No. 1 in Paris by Trip Advisor. 

My wife's only real complain about the hotel is the lack of an in room electric kettle
for making tea/coffee. To charge people another 5 pound for a cup of tea
in such an upmarket hotel is kind of parsimonious. 

I would not go back nor would I recommend it to a friend. As I said there
is nothing wrong with the hotel, just not my cup of tea.",3,2009,09,08
142,"Proper poise, polish and panache","It was a pure delight to stay here.  I had read all of the glowing reviews of the Stafford Hotel prior to booking a stay here, and our time at the Stafford exceeded my expectations in every way.  This is an extremely well managed and well run proper British hotel.  It's elegant and comfortable at the same time and the entire staff makes you feel right at home from the minute you walk in the door until the time you leave.  From reception to the concierge desk, the bellmen and the nice people who work in the restaurant, I felt very welcome here.  The central location gives you quick access to the best that London has to offer.  Being adjacent to Green Park keeps things quiet at night but it's a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly, etc. (Be sure you know about the pedestrian walk-through shortcut tunnel which will save you a lot of time!) Underground stations are quite close, too and there are a number of quite nice restaurants nearby within a five minute walk.  We had two connecting rooms, #216 and #217.  While the rooms were certainly nice, they seemed a little ""crowded"". Maybe one less piece of furniture would help open things up a bit to make it easier to get to the windows or walk around the room.  My only ""complaint"" (and it's not much of an issue) is with the decor.  The older part of the hotel seems a little matronly for my taste.  I think I would have preferred the updated style and modern furnishings of a Mews unit. Perhaps next time.  While the bathroom of #216 seemed to be more contemporary, the one in #217 seemed older, cramped and the shower/tub was a little awkward climbing in and out of.   We ate continental breakfasts each of the five mornings we were there, and they were superb.  The staff was so attentive that we felt like we were the Royal Family and being treated accordingly.  We didn't eat any dinners in the restaurant at all, but enjoyed a casual meal in the American Bar.  A tip of the cap to Yannick, an excellent barman who makes a wonderful Pimms Cup! Ask for a tour of the wine cellar, which has some amazing bottles and also features some very interesting World War Two memorabilia. (Apparently, it was used as a shelter during the bombings.)   I did, however, find the caps hanging from the ceiling of the American Bar to be a bit gimmicky, preferring instead to study the framed historic objects on the wall and ignoring the caps that previous guests had left behind. And why is there an Oakland Raiders helmet jutting out from the wall?  Strange.  All in all though this is a terrific place.  I looked forward to arriving and hated leaving.  I hope to return.",5,2009,08,27
142,A little corner of tranquil luxury in London,"You should always get an immediate feeling  you are staying somewhere that is delivering a service at the top end of their game.. An attentive doorman, hall staff standing almost to attention giving the feeling of presence, well dressed, well spoken reception teams. This place has it all. In spades. Immediately calming from the moment you step through the door, leaving the frenetic hustle of London and St James St behind you. 
No chinzy, mass produced vases and furniture in this lobby, all antiques and originals. My room was smaller than the major chains that sprawl around Picadilly, but as we all know size means nothing, it's the attention to design and detail that makes the mark. And that eye for detail is superb. Again, original art, decorative crematics and furniture, a BOSE audio system, branded wooden coathangers. 
A full marble bathroom of a refined opulence that you could almost imagine the floors below the building straining  under the weight of, dressed with fine accessories from Floris. Abundance of fluffy white towels, and even a night light under the sink. 
The room had a large fridge stocked with complementary  mineral water, and so rare in many hotels, genuinely plenty of space for your own purchases.
The food was excellent on both nights I ate there, my corporate budget did't quite justify the £60 necessary for the two courses and wine in the main restaurant, however the very welcoming yet exclsuisve feeling public bar delivered some cooking with flair. 
I used to wondwer what a £20 'burger would taste like (paying towards the rates perhaps) however  I was suprised to find that the £19 Stafford Burger was actually good value for money considering the quality of the meat and accompaniments). The pan fried calves liver was a homely and perfect as if cooked by my great Aunt with no other covers to cater for.
Improvements? Now we are talking minor niggles. An i-Pod dock on the BOSE  system, and a DVD player would be welcomed. And even sometimes the most well heeled traveller would prefer a kettle in the room rather than have to order room service. I'm sure that The Staffordf would make it either unitrusive or perfectly formed. 
Apart from that, what a brilliant hotel. The owner should be proud of their team's achievements. I only fear that I will never be able to afford a stay here unlewss it's picked up by the corporate tab. Never mind.",5,2009,08,21
142,Ideal hotel in central London... a pleasure to stay here,"A trip to London normally means business and a multi-national corporate hotel. This time the trip was personal (Royal Opera House and shopping) so I decided to treat myself to something different.

From beginning to end, my stay at the Stafford was first class. The staff (especially the conceirge and in the American Bar) were by far the most polite and courteous I have ever experienced in a hotel and in London. The room, although slightly small, was ideal for me as a single traveller; quiet and cool it was lovely to come back to after a night at the opera. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of storage space (and hangers).

The location is ideal, only five minutes walk into the centre of London with Green Park tube station very close by. And if you need a taxi, the porters will go out to the main street to fetch one for you... even in the pouring rain!

The complimentary newspaper was also available at the weekend (how many hotels do this!). Breakfast was probably the best I have had in a hotel and had great selection available. 

On checkout, I discovered that there had been a communication problem between my travel agent and the hotel regarding extras included in my booking (complimentary breakfast and a credit for food in the restaurant/bar) which resulted in a higher than expected final statement. On production of my booking confirmation sheet, the hotel agreed to honour what I had expected to pay for, which meant that they lost out financially. It wasn't a large amount of money but I wouldn't expect many hotels (especially in London) to agree so readily to do this!

Would I return to the Stafford? Most definitely.",5,2009,08,08
142,"Very accessable, very quiet hotel, with courteous attentive staff","Spent 10 nights at the Stafford in July 09.
Very quiet and relaxed hotel, yet in the heart of London, with access to all of the capital, via Green Park tube. Though we walked everywhere. Visited Borough Market, Canary Wharf and all the usual sights.
When you come back to the hotel, it is with a sense of delight, that you will get peace to enjoy the rest of the evening. Free Wifi and good TV channels, all of Sky Sports channels plus the business channels.  Read or sleep - all possible with peace.
What did we not like? Really there was nothing I can complain about. Anything we asked for was delivered immediately. The rooms are beautifully furnished. Some may be a bit smaller than rooms in the US or other cities. But this is London, and as far as I am concerned this is the city where it all happens. The bathroom was very large with a walk in shower and a bath. Towels were always hot and very comfy.

Been to London twice a year for the last twenty years and this is the hotel I have been looking for. Going to go back? Yes!!  August 09.",5,2009,07,25
142,London Pride - a home that's dear to us,"The Stafford oozes class and makes for a perfect weekend break. The moment your taxi draws up outside and a courteous doorman opens the taxi door and takes charge of your luggage you know you are staying at a hotel where guests' needs are paramount. At every turn there were helpful, professional staff and we were given an unhurried tour of the hotel before being shown to our (upgraded) room. The heating/air conditioning worked very effectively and though the room had double glazing, this was scarcely necessary to keep out the noise because there simply wasn't any. Despite being in the very heart of London (2 minutes from St James Palace, 3 minutes from Fortnum and Masons) tranquillity is guaranteed due to the fact that the Stafford sits at the end of a mews terrace. The room was beautifully appointed with a superbly comfortable bed - so wide I think the bedside tables were in different postcodes - and the bathroom was elegant marble with extremely fluffy towels and bathrobes and quality  Floris toiletries. Room service was excellent, tea and coffee arriving almost instantly and served from stylish pots into bone china cups. A rose in the vase on the tray is a simple touch which was noted and appreciated.

We ate in the American bar and it certainly lives up to its billing. It was convivial with excellent food but the main restaurant looked equally appealing and proved to be so because that is where we had breakfast next morning. Yes, you can get  a much cheaper breakfast in the arcade round the corner but you pay for the style as well as the substance and the Stafford has both in spades. In some ways the Stafford reminds me of a scene from Miss Marple with its elegant yet homely atmospere but this is to ignore the fact that the hotel has also firmly embraced the 21st century with Bose CD players and free internet connections. There really is nothing to fault with the hotel; it is expensive but it's worth it. We will surely return.",5,2009,07,22
142,"Pompous attitude, presentable suite","On a whim, my partner and I stayed at the Stafford this weekend, selecting a mews suite (approx £1200 per night.)

The suite itself was of an excellent size, pleasantly furnished and well-maintained.  The living room was somewhat too small for the amount of furniture and, really strangely, only one of the bathroom's two sinks was supplied with toiletries.

We were advised on arrival that the restaurant required gentlemen to wear a jacket.  A pompous attitude in the 21st Century, and I noticed in passing that there were few restaurant patrons.  Quite right!

Aside from a few minor oddities (DVD player in the bedroom but none in the living room; a hallway almost larger than the living room) and the most mediocre breakfast I've been served in an alleged 5-star, no major complaints.  But, on the whole, the Sofitel provides superior comfort minus the attitude, and the Stafford is not somewhere I would rush back to.",3,2009,07,15
142,"Charming hotel, wonderful staff","Like a country house retreat in the centre of London, so quiet you would have no idea you were so close to bustling Piccadilly, which was great as we were able to stroll to the theatre. I was only here for one night, but I found the hotel to be very welcoming and the staff friendly and helpful. 
The decor is very traditional, so if you are a lover of the modern look, I wouldn't recommend it, if you prefer traditional you will absolutely love it. The room is cosy and the beds are huge and ridiculously comfortable.
But be warned - their famous martinis are absolutely lethal...",5,2009,06,23
142,Best Hotel in the World,"My wife and I decided on a weekend trip to London to celebrate our 32nd Annivesary.  We saw a review on the Stafford on a TV travel show and decided to try it.  From the moment we arrived when Richard the manager  said ""welcome home""  we felt this was something special.  We were fortunate to be upgraded from a queen double to a king double.. The room was light and airy with plenty of cupboard and drawer space.  The public rooms are beautiful especially the American Bar where we ate on more than 1 occasion over the 3 days.  We asked Richard about the wine cellar where the American and Canadian officer sheltered in the blitz during Worls War II. He offered to take us down to view this 380 year old store.  A museum has been set up with items of memorbilia  which were  extremely interesting.   no sooner had we told the receptionist that we were celebrating, a cake appeared in out room.  Even the bellman offered to walk us accross the road to show us the shortcut to Green PArk.  They just seemed to want to go that extra mile.  I will certainly go back when I next stay in London.",5,2009,06,09
142,Wonderful weekend,"Can't disagree with any of the glowing reviews elsewhere on the page.  We were only in town for a weekend, so thought we'd treat ourselves; and the Stafford proved well worth it.  Welcoming staff, extremely well-appointed room (especially after finding we'd received an  unexpected upgrade) and brilliant location.  Can't comment on the food, as we had dinner plans of our own on the Saturday, and had our Sunday breakfast round the corner at the Wolseley (also highly recommended).  Something to look forward to next time!",5,2009,04,29
142,great little hotel,"The Stafford is a little gem tucked away In St. James' Place London. The hotel is old though it has been recently refurbished. The lobby and lounge are quite small though charming and the rooms are cozy, though it had LCD tv and high-speed internet. The restaurant/coffee shop served a nice breakfast and decent food. The staff are extremely friendly and were even went out of their way to help. 

The down side is that because it is so tucked away, even London cabbies are unfamiliar with it! (luckily they have GPS). The hotel is just behind Green Park and is a 2 minute walk from Green Park Station and a 10 minute walk from Piccadilly Circus.",4,2009,04,29
142,"Great location, great service","Lovely traditional hotel, in a quiet but central location. Our room was very comfortable, though perhaps a bit on the small side, with a great bed and nice bathroom. Service is welcoming and very professional. Free internet and laptop use is a bonus. 

The hotel is expensive, but worth it if you can afford it. We definitely would return if planning to stay in the St. James/ Green Park area.",4,2009,04,21
142,Style in St James',"An outstanding hotel in every respect. 

I had read on Trip Advisor how friendly the staff were and thought that some folk must be exaggerating a little bit. To my delight this accolade was right on the mark. I have never experienced such friendly, helpful and diligent hotel staff anywhere.

Our room was very good, the bed in particular was an excellent size. It was by no means a top of the range room but could not be faulted.

The bar was very good too and very well stocked -however, I must warn those on a tight budget, don't get too carried away as this is an expensive place to drink. That said, I had the best 'whiskey sour' I have ever had!

Definitely a hotel I would recommend for anyone who wants homely comfort and style in the centre of London's West End.",5,2008,12,02
142,The only place I stay in London,"When I travel to London, its the Stafford or nothing.  simply the best in location, atmosphere and SERVICE.",5,2008,10,24
142,Superb Stafford,"I have never written a review before even though I have stayed at some top 5 star hotels in London (Covent Garden etc). However, I have just spent a weekend at the Stafford to celebrate my 40th birthday with my husband and I can honestly say it was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in. Our room (a suite in the mews) was beautiful and the service provided by all of the staff was exemplary on every level. When we arrived back at the hotel on the Saturday evening I commented to one of the concierge that my feet were aching and his reply was 'never mind you're home now' and that is exactly how the hotel feels-like your very own exclusive home in London. We are already planning our next trip and can't imagine going to any other hotel in London.",5,2008,10,22
142,So glad we chose The Stafford,"First-ever trip to London this past summer. Originally had other hotels on my radar screen but TA forums led me to The Stafford, for which I am grateful.

We (family of four; two college-aged sons) spent five days in a suite and a room in the main building and another five in a suite and a room in the Mews. The main building is more traditionally English; the Mews more modern and felt a bit more spacious. We enjoyed falling asleep to the sound of gentlefolk in the courtyard below sitting at the famed American Bar's outside tables. 

In the states we'll generally choose a Four Seasons, or a Westin or Hyatt depending upon what's available. I was initially wary of staying in a smaller, non-chain hotel but quickly came to appreciate the benefits of The Stafford. The custom is to leave room keys (yes,  actual keys!) at the desk when going out,  which means there is a fair amount of contact with staff. Everyone - porters, concierge, business office personnel - was unfailingly friendly, professional and helpful. 

Continental breakfast was included with our room cost. We expected a hard roll and coffee, but instead enjoyed beginning each day in the hotel's lovely dining room, where breakfast (French press coffee, generous baskets of bakery items, divine marmalade and much more) were served on tables with crisp white tablecloths by impeccably professional and unobtrusive wait staff. 

Loved the St. James location. We walked everywhere from the hotel - close to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Green and St. James parks, not too far from Covent Garden. We could walk to a number of restaurants (The Wolesley, Chor Bizarre Indian  and Cecconis for Italian being among our favorites). 

Took a walk one evening over to The Dorchester and saw The Inter-Continental and Four Seasons -- after a quick overview we were so glad we'd made the choice to stay at The Stafford. While the common areas of these other hotels seemed lovely, they felt more ""generic"" and, at least the evening we were there, felt more Middle Eastern than British. They are clustered in an area with very busy streets and lots of traffic, and we were so happy to return to the Stafford  with its oh-so-English window boxes spilling over with red geraniums, and tucked well away from even  from the genteel sounds of St. James Street.

The Stafford apparently has a tradition of attracting American visitors that I believe dates back to WWII when US military officers stationed in London were fond of The Stafford's (hence, ""American"") Bar.  Scores of model airplanes hang from the ceiling of the bar (jackets required for men, there, by the way) and lots of fascinating photographs line the walls. There are also a number of portraits of the Queen Mother around the hotel; we were told that she was an admirer of The Stafford's impressive wine cellar.

The concierge staff was helpful and effective, especially Frank Laino, who is touted as ""the world's best concierge"".  He is clearly deserving of his title.

The only negative of our stay was a misunderstanding in regard to our arrival. Since we came into Heathrow early in the morning, we arrived at the hotel around 9:30 and asked if our rooms were available for early check-in. They were, and we were grateful to be able to get settled. We thought this was a lovely courtesy and were thus surprised when we were charged for an extra night upon check-out. The issue was quickly and kindly resolved, but I do recommend that guests at this (or any) hotel clarify exactly what the terms of early check-in are.  

Other than that, I have struggled to come up with a negative, but alas, the only thing I can think of is that there were no cotton balls or q-tips in the bath.  Bring your own, and stay at The Stafford. You will not be disappointed.",5,2008,09,26
142,the best hotel,"This is my favorite hotel in the world, (so far!).  It actually feels like I'm staying at my own very posh house in London, full of my loyal and friendly staff, who are happy that I'm finally back. The only place that's more centrally located is Buckingham palace, which is basically next door. It's thoroughly English, down to the giant brass keys that they give you. Everything is perfect, but nothing is modern. i wish i could live at the Stafford.",5,2008,08,28
142,A Superb Hotel,"We stayed three nights at the Stafford hotel and could not have been more pleased. The service was outstanding, the food at all times of the day was delicious, and the accommodations were top notch. The hotel is located in a great neighborhood, within walking distance of Piccadilly Circus and a variety of shops and restaurants. The staff was helpful with all of our questions and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The price is expensive, especially when you take into account the exchange rate against the U.S. Dollar, but we highly recommend it.",5,2008,07,13
142,Nice old-world hotel,"The Stafford is a good, traditional hotel but it fails to really impress in the way it could if the property were polished up just a little bit.  The hotel is in a beautiful old building with a great location in the middle of St James.  It is very tranditional and very English.  There was nothing wrong with my room but it was absolutely miniscule and I'm used to smallish European hotel rooms.  There is no way two people could have shared this room comfortable.  My only real gripe about it, however, has to do with cleanliness.  First of all, nothing seemd terrible clean to me to start with.  Then, I found crumbs from a previous guest all over the desk chair (orange ones, so no one had even checked it or they would have seen them).  Then there were the pretzel pieces under the chair/table that weren't cleaned up even after pointing them out to housekeeping.  Clearly, no one is paying attention to cleaning here - and these are 'deep cleaning' things but very basic ones.  The room service menu also leaves a lot to be desired but that is the case with many hotels.",3,2008,04,22
142,I'd like to keep the Stafford my secret it's that good,"My family of 4 stayed at The Stafford 2 separate times on our trip and my son and I returned on the last leg of our Europe jaunt  because we enjoyed it so much.  

Because we were staying in London for only 4 days, I found that an apartment wasn't an option.  Most require a week stay at least.  Booking two separate hotel rooms for my husband, me and our 2 adult sons was an expensive option, until I found The Stafford.  They have family suites which are basically two suites connected via a common hallway.  The outer door to the hallway can be closed and the two suite doors left open.  The Stafford's family suite rate was less expensive than if I booked two separate suites at another comparable hotel, even though that was exactly what we were getting.  Plus, let me just say that the suites were amazing! The rooms were spotless, quiet, sunny and fresh. Each had supreme appointments, right down to the heated marble floors in the bathrooms, full shower, separate tub, 2 sinks.  The tub even came with its own 2 rubber duckies.  Every detail was considered in making these suites homelike. They have thought of everything. Besides the fabulous ensuite baths, each suite also had a sitting area with a large plasma TV which my sons enjoyed, as well as a desk area and a separate ladies vanity area.  It truly was spectacular for the price.  In addition, the hotel had a quaint parlor room where you could take tea, dessert or drinks, as well as a bar and gourmet restaurant.  We were welcomed at the hotel like old friends each time we returned.  

The location of the hotel was also good.  Close to Picadilly Circus, the Picadilly and Green Park tube stops, Green Park, St. James Park, Buckingham Palace, along with plenty of shops and restaurants in the area.

I've stayed at other luxury level hotels and this one beat them all hands down. I would recommend this hotel highly and look forward to hopefully returning sometime soon.",5,2008,03,27
142,Exceeded Expectations,"The last few trips to London, we've stayed in larger hotels, but our travel agent suggested the Stafford. The hotel is very well situated, right near Piccadilly Circus and St James Park , yet located on a quiet side street so that there was no noise once inside.

The rooms had a feel of a well decorated London flat more than a  hotel and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Service here is some of the best I've experienced. 

We will definitely stay here on our next visit, and would recommend the Stafford for couples or families w/ kids.",5,2008,02,24
142,Excellent in every way,"We spent one glorious week in London at the Stafford with our 3 yr old daughter in July. Not only did we have great weather, the wonderful staff at the Stafford really made us feel at home. 

The concierge at the Stafford is the definition of proactive.  
Before we arrived, I received an email with info about road closures because of the Tour de France-- very helpful since we were driving into London. I'd also bought tickets to a show that we didn't want. In addition to getting us prime tickets for the Sound of Music, the concierge also offered  to sell our original tickets (no takers). And they hustled to get a last minute babysitter for us during an especially busy weekend in London. 
So it goes without saying that they can get any restaurant reservation in town-- including the Ivy!

Our  1 bdrm suite in the Mews was done in shades of blue and chocolate, and felt like a chicly decorated apartment rather than a hotel room. We had a foyer with ample room to park the stroller  and a powder room. The living room had a mini fridge, an Ipod docking station, and a desk with Wifi access. I even had personalized namecards! Our bed was very comfortable, and we had plenty of closet space and hangers. 

We didn't eat in the formal restaurant, but had drinks and dessert in the American bar (cozy but my husband had to wear a jacket). Food from room service, esp the fish and chips, was excellent. We did encounter some minor snafus with room service and a surly waiter, but management was very responsive and cleared things up quickly.
  
The location is ideal-- the Stafford may be secreted down a small alley, but it's just steps away from the commercial hustle and bustle. It's an easy walk to Old Bond Street, Piccadilly, Green Park, the Tube, etc. Great restaurants are also nearby (we loved the steak tartare and people-watching at the Wolseley) 

We loved The Stafford and definitely plan to return.
",5,2007,09,20
142,Lovely hotel,"I stayed just one night on a whirlwind work trip, but have to agree with the positive reviews.  The staff were very helpful, the room service for breakfast both days was super-fast, the location is amazing - you can run right out the front door into Green Park and then Hyde Park.  I also had dinner (the fish and chips!) in the American Bar, and it was yum.  I had the basic room and it was quite tiny (as I said, a work trip!), but still very nice with a Bose stereo, small plasma tv etc.  I also took a pass down to the gym at Piccadilly to do a spin class, and that worked well.  

While we all know that phone calls from a hotel room are expensive, I was blown away at the cost of my call to home - 15 minutes was 68 pounds, being over $150 Australian dollars!  So be warned on that one.
",5,2007,09,18
142,"Lovely Hotel, Amazing Location","We stayed at The Stafford from 6/30-7/7/07 with our two children, ages 5 and 9, in a double deluxe room (for the grownups) interconnecting with a double room (for the children) in the Mews. Overall, we were extremely pleased. Our (interconnected) rooms felt more like a small, luxurious apartment than a ""hotel"" room -- we loved the amenities, such as a half bathroom in our foyer, large closets, ""warm"" marble bathroom floors, flat screen tvs, DVD players, IPOD docking stations, etc. The deluxe double has a lovely sitting area with its own flat screen tv. And while there weren't any special ""children's amenities,"" the staff thrilled our kids by bringing them an IPOD for their docking station and provided us with bread to feed the ducks in St. James Park. My husband regularly used the new fitness center in the Mews and was quite pleased with it (he did not feel the need to use the deluxe health club located near Piccadilly that the hotel offers to guests). The location is outstanding. The Green Park Tube is steps away. It's an easy walk to Piccadilly, St. James Park, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, etc. Our kids were excited to see the guards outside St. James Palace, and witnessed a ""small"" Changing the Guard there in addition to the ceremony at Buckingham Palace. There are excellent restaurants and shopping within walking distance. The concierges are pleasant, responsive and professional, as is the front dest staff. My only ""nit"" was that housekeeping was inconsistent -- i.e, the rooms were spotless, but some days they would neglect to replace the soaps, shampoos, etc. or empty the wastebaskets. We loved The Stafford. We have recommended it to our friends, and we would definately stay there again.
",5,2007,07,26
142,Luxury is Back,"This was the first time I have stayed at The Stafford since its recent renovation. What a difference. We had one of the new  Mews  apartments and the standard of luxury was very impressive - his and hers basins, huge bath and equally vast separate shower, underfloor heating, full-size Floris toiletries, two plasma TVs and an iPod . The breakfast was very good and I liked the fact that if you just wanted a continental breakfast - not a cooked one - it was available at a cheaper cost because the hotel is a la carte. The location is wonderful - a short walk to all of London's great sights. Most of the staff were very welcoming and pleasant - especially in the breakfast room - but the front desk staff are all Cockneys and their manner is somewhat brusque and, as is their way, offhand. That's fine if you think that's picturesque but I preferred the French, Spanish, South African and New Zealand staff members who were unfailingly polite and smiling. The concierge, Frank Laino, however deserves all his accolades - very polite and helpful.  Would definitely come back to this rejuvenated gem.
",5,2007,07,24
142,Very Comfortable,"I stayed two nights at the Stafford on May 8 & 9, 2007.  This was my first stay although I had visited the hotel and looked at a sampling of rooms in 2006.  The first night I stayed in a deluxe junior suite in the main building and the second night in a deluxe junior suite in the new mews building that had only been open one week.  Both rooms were large, comfortable and quiet.  I preferred the mews suite because of its nicer bath and newness.

My main building room was in the rear and was extremely quiet.  It had a separate sitting room with a good reading lamp.  The bath was fairly small, but had a separate shower.  The room was furnished traditionally with king bed, chair and sofa.  Actually, both rooms had two twin beds pushed together to form a king which I found satisfactory.

My mews room was on the rear of that building overlooking the Park Place cul-de-sac.  It had one large room with a sitting area at one end with only a loveseat--no upholstered chair.  The TV was flat panel, wide-screen, whereas the main building room had an older conventional TV.  There was some street noise, but it was muffled and acceptable to me.  The bath was huge with two sinks, a separate shower and heated tile floor.

The Stafford is excellently located a short walk through the park from the Green Park tube station.  There are many nearby restaurants on and near Piccadilly.  It is walking distance to many attractions, including the theater district.  The general neighborhood in nice and upscale.  A laptop is on a table in the lobby for free guest use and was almost always available when I wanted to use it.

Breakfasts were very good--from the menu--no buffet--in the attractive restaurant.  I had dinner one night in the New American Bar and enjoyed it.  I didn't eat dinner in the more upscale restaurant.

Overall, I found the Stafford to be a very pleasant place to stay and will stay there again.  I would classify it as a 5-star hotel.
",5,2007,06,01
142,Incredible Hotel,"Just got back from London and loved the Stafford Hotel. Rate was reasonable (for London) and included dinner 1 night at their restaurant (excellent) and breakfast everyday. They had a room for us
first ting in the morning eventhough check-in was not until the afternoon. Service was incredible. They were very helpful and knew who we were after the first day. Every dinner suggestion was wonderful.

I loved the location (St. James) I had stayed near Holborn my previous trips, and this was far more convenient for tourist spots, fine dining and the theater.

While there was construction going on in the Mews, we could not notice it from our room. The only problem (and a minor one at that) was a small shower. However, this minor inconvenience was overwhelmed
by the other hotel amenities. My favorites were the free bottles of water (two, replaced every day at no cost, free internet access downstairs, and two 110 volt outlets). I would definitely stay there again.",5,2007,04,18
142,The Stafford is Not a Luxury Hotel,"The Stafford is undergoing major reconstruction at the moment. I stayed in the carriage house section of the property, which is supposed to be the finest room that the hotel has to offer. It was not that nice (small, smell of mildew, lumpy carpets, not enough hot water for two people to shower consecutively). Even without the construction problem, I would not consider this a true luxury hotel. The best thing that can be said about the hotel is that the staff are friendly, but the property itself is below-par. I would not stay at this hotel again.
",2,2006,12,04
142,The Best Hotel in London,"My family has been staying here for over 15 years.  To me, it is the best hotel in London.  The location is great (with its own private access to Green Park), the staff all that you could ask for (they take time to know everyone's name and what their preferences are), the rooms are wonderful (I prefer the Carriage House annex to the main buliding).

Some may decry the lack of amenities (there is no gym, pool, etc), but that's fine with me.  This is a hotel with charm and class.

Is it expensive?  Absolutely!!!  Is it worth it?  Yes (especially if you do not have to pay)
",5,2006,04,28
142,Country house elegance,"My first stay at this wonderful hotel, an all too brief stay of 2 nights (if only it could have been longer !). An excellent central location in a lovely secluded street near St James Palace, and near to my library, and to excellent shopping.

This hotel is so quaint with staff who go the extra mile to provide that rare commodity known as ""service"". A great restaurant, nice lounge, and a wonderful bar at the back of the hotel. I didn't quite meet the evening dress code for the bar but the barman told me in the most delightful manner possible; he did not make feel awkward (as some hotel bars might have done) and I was pleased to correct the situation in just a few moments.

Good ""front-of-house"" staff who are welcoming without exception, and knowledgeable about London.

My room was a tad small but nicely decorated. Bed was a little soft for my liking.

I will definitely return when I need to stay in Central London.
",5,2006,04,18
142,Excellent Hotel,"Great hotel in a fabulous location. Can see why is it rated as one of the best in London. We arrived very early in the morning and our room was not ready. We were given another room in the mean time to rest in whilst we waited for our room to be prepared. The staff were excellent. Very quiet area and close to Green Park Underground Station, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus, Trafalga Square. The room was average size and the facilities were nice.",5,2006,01,25
142,"Charming hotel, great service","Very charming.

At least, I guest that's what they will call it. Decor is a bit dated, no flatscreen televisions, the grouting in the bathroom just three days past the point where it should have been re-done etc. Not the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed in, just make this hotel a little dated. Nothing that can't be fixed with a little investment.

The basics are certainly there though.
   The location (although that always depends on your needs and as long as you're in the centre of london...)
   The staff is wonderfull in it's service. friendly and attentative. They do remember you and have the prescence of mind to pickup the conversation where you left it the last time yo've spoken to them. And the (I believe belgian?) girl beind the reception just makes your day.
    Food is great, and it is certainly nice to see this hotel is being noticed by some people you might not walk into on the street.

Despite the little imperfections, I will definetely stay there again. I believe this is called charming.
",4,2006,01,15
142,Traditional luxury in a stellar location,"The Stafford Hotel occupies a prime London location. Only a short walk to St. James's Palace and Green Park, this hotel is situated in arguably the top neighborhood in the city. But the Stafford doesn't sacrifice peace and quiet for its central location. The hotel is tucked into the warren of historic side streets and courtyards of St. James's, making it almost unbelievable that busy Piccadilly is just a block or so north. The front of the hotel is on a short dead-end street; the rear of the hotel is essentially a courtyard (Blue Ball Court).

In the midst of genteel clubs and upper-crust establishments of St. James's, the Stafford is a traditional and historic older hotel, furnished and maintained to a high standard. With only 81 rooms, the Stafford focuses on an individualized service for its guests.

Standard rooms are moderately-sized--a bit small by U.S. standards, but generous for London hotels. Ours included a small entryway with a countertop/cabinet housing a safe and a mini refrigerator. The fridge was ours to use with (thankfully) no minibar in sight. A bottle of house wine, fruit, and bottled water was included at the start of our visit.

The room was well furnished and included a firm king-size bed. Typical for British hotels, the ""king"" consisted of joined smaller mattresses, but with almost no discernable gap or bump...very comfortable. Heavy curtains and double windows insulated us against any street noise--and there was almost none due to the hotel's location. 

The individually controlled central airconditioning/heating system was excellent and blessedly quiet. A marble bathroom included a large tub, vanity, and separate phone booth-sized shower stall. Water pressure was adequate--perhaps a bit too adequate in the shower. Towels were large and plentiful, and washcloths were provided. The hotel furnished soap and shampoo, but surprisingly, no other amenities other than shower caps (and who uses them anymore?).

The room's television featured a limited selection of channels, with no movies or other entertainment options. This is a relatively minor issue for those visiting one of the most interesting cities in the world, but even the most ambitious tourist needs time to ""zone out"" watching TV at times. They won't find much to watch on the Stafford's limited video system. 

These comments apply to the standard double room; the hotel's carriage house rooms and suites offer a different experience for a price premium. London hotel accommodations are not known for many bargains and the Stafford's location and quality do come with a sizeable pricetag.

The Stafford is a historic building, actually a series of converted buildings, including three former townhouses and a stable/mews. As an older building, even one furnished and maintained to a luxury standard, noise from creaky floors was a minor annoyance in our main building room. Surprisingly, plumbing noise was less noticeable. 

No doubt there are exceptions, but the clientele of the hotel seems to be a quiet, sophisticated group of travelers. This lends to the ambiance of the hotel and means few worries about one of our hotel pet peeves--the obnoxious and noisy fellow guest.

The atmosphere at the Stafford is further enhanced by a dedication to providing excellent, efficient service. We experienced a high level of service from the front desk, office/cashier, and bar staff. The concierge staff were the most helpful we've seen anywhere. 

As a smaller hotel, the Stafford does not offer all the onsite facilities that a large, 5-star property might. But they do very well. Need business services, like a computer or a mobile phone? No problem, the hotel will loan guests a laptop computer and arrange for use of a phone. The hotel features a naturally upscale dining room, lounge, and a famous bar. The diminutive American Bar is like a private pub...a very nice private pub, filled with an amazing collection of memorabilia. The small bar can be smoky, like most bars and pubs in London, although odds are as good that no smokers will be present, given the small size of the bar.

Guests should ask to tour the Stafford's vaulted brick wine cellars. Private diners are held here (which must be fantastic), but even a quick tour is fascinating. The cellars include a collection of memorabilia from the Second World War, when the hotel was used as a billet for Allied Officers, and the cellars doubled as bomb shelters.
",4,2005,07,19
142,Not what I expected,"After reading various internet reviews and an Andrew Harper's review, I decided  on the Stafford in London. Unfortunately, it was not at all what I had expected. Instead of cozy English charm, I found tired, dreary rooms with tiny bathrooms. The service (which had been spoken of highly in several reviews) was mediocre at best. They were not in the least bit friendly or accomadating other than one concierge that we had some contact with, Peter.
I feel that I saw a fairly good sampling of the rooms since we had 2 junior suites and a double room. None of these rooms fell even close to the quality of what is described in the literature as a five-star hotel. The prices for the accomadations ($950 per night for the suites and about $650 per night for the room) was absurd given their suboptimal quality. After two nights, we moved to a much, much nicer property ( The Athaneum Hotel and Apartments). I strongly recommend the Athaneum.
 I would not stay at the Stafford again in those particular rooms although they may have rooms that are larger, better kept and more attractively decorated. I did not see any of those.
The only positive aspect that our family saw about the Stafford was its excellent location in St. James close to many sites and the upscale shopping that we had specifically come for on Bond Street, Jermyn Street etc. Otherwise,  what a dissapointment the Stafford was!",2,2005,07,13
142,"Stafford, excellent in every way!","One of the nicest hotels I have stayed at, anywhere.  Rented 2 adjoining rooms for my wife/I and our 2 college-aged daughters.  Great location, helpful staff, and absolutely quiet rooms.  We travel quite a lot, and found this hotel to be 'top rate' in every aspect.
",5,2005,06,19
142,A really good hotel,"I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend and loved it. As a young couple it can be quite intimidating staying somewhere like this but the staff are great, very friendly and professional, a good combination.
Our room was very comfortable, and the american bar is worth the stay alone. Really bizarre collection of baseball caps, signed photos and more which give it real atmosphere. And as has already been mentioned, excellent service again.
As for the complaint re the noise in an earlier review I find that extremely harsh. This hotel is tucked away off any main streets and the noise is limited. If you're going to stay in the centre of London then surely you expect there is going to be some sort of noise!
My only minor quibble was that when we called down for a sandwich and a drink at 2.30am the night porter asked us if we realised that it was 2.30am which seemed slightly cheeky since the room service menu clearly states it's available 24 hours. Anyway...
Lovely hotel, great location.

142,Loved the Stafford!!!,"The Stafford is simply the most gorgeous hotel I've ever stayed at.  I cannot express enough how charming and special the place is.  

I regularly pop in for traditional afternoon tea on a Sunday.  I also love having dinner in the American Bar - fantastic burgers and club sandwiches, all served by a barman who remembers your name.

Best of all is actually staying at the Stafford.  The staff are like family.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Forget going to the Ritz or one of the big touristy hotels in London.  The Stafford has far more class and is thus filled with people who really know the difference between ""flashy"" and ""elegant"".

142,"Great Location, very quiet","We stayed at the Stafford Dec.3, 2004 for 3 nights.  It was our first visit to London and we really didn't have much time there.  I found the Stafford to be a very nice hotel, very quiet and in an excellent location.  The Green Park tube station is just a couple of minutes away.  Our room was smaller than I'd anticipated, but I'm used to American standards, so actually in European standards it was spacious.  We had a sitting area and it had a small fold-out sofa.  The bathroom was gorgeous, all done in marble and with heated towel racks.  We had a mini-bar in our room, a safe and bathrobes.  The staff was very, very helpful and friendly.  My only complaint was the cost; wow, everything was so expensive!  I'd come back here again if I can afford it.

142,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PROPERTY!!,"My sister and I stayed at The Stafford in March, 2004 and as a former flight attendant and one who continues to travel frequently, this hotel has to rate as the very best.  Service was excellent.  Food was excellent.  I cannot say one negative comment.  I would never stay anywhere else when again in London.  And the location is perfect.  Kudos to the general manager and his entire staff.

142,Okay...,"Well..it was okay. The lobbies (and first couple of floors) were really smokey. The rooms were alot smaller than shown on the website. The streets are very busy, and you don't get much sleep, unless you learn to ignore the continuous honking, and sirens. Creaky floors.

However, the bathrooms were very nice, and you get a nice, big, buffet-style breakfast. People there were pretty friendly.",3,2003,10,26
142,Nice but not for me,"Based on lots of good press I stayed here at the end of 2002 and even chose a room in the 'famous' Carriage House. I had one downstairs and would recommend to try to get one upstairs if you go so you can benefit from the higher ceilings vs. the llower floor. The hotel is indeed very British if that is what you want. I found it a little stuffy and prefer less traditional hotels myself.

Maybe I caught the hotel during a bad time since I had to wait a long time for porters and front desk service. In the bar I was reminded that I should really be dressed formal and only served because there were not a lot of other guests.

The location is very good and there is nothing wrong with the Stafford but I would not come back since there are many better choices for my taste.",3,2003,08,09
142,Superb.,"The most delightful hotel I have ever visited. The level of courtesy and service immediately made you feel at home.

The staff in the bar were especially charming. If you ever ventured in by yourself they would engage you in conversation to put you at your ease. They of course would also remember what you had been drinking on the previous evening. It was great fun to watch them gently flirting with the permanent resident as she sat at the bar on her own stool and told stories of her time in the French resistance.

The porters also deserve commendation, they recommended a delightful restaurant for us and I never once had to open a door (something that can be quite rare in British hotels). They also were concerned that we shouldn't be lumbered with having to pay too much for parking and found us a spot where we could leave our car. Most kind.

Our marble bathroom was well stocked with luxurious Floris toiletries (of which I am now a fan) and it was a pleasure to relax in the very deep bath whilst listening to the selection of CDs left for us to play on the Bose music centre.

To conclude....Don't Go!! I want it all to myself.",5,2003,07,20
142,The Best of London,"Have been staying at the Stafford for 14 years and will not stay anywhere else in London. I go to London 2-3 times a year on business and always stay there. It represents the quintessential London luxury hotel, on a very small and intimate scale, but never takes itself too seriously. Staff is constant, with very little turnover. The first bartender, Charles, stayed for over 40 years, and likely would have stayed longer had he not been prematurely taken from us a few years ago. And the Manager, Terry Holmes, has become a London institution. This is the kind of place where the barman remembers your favorite drink (and your name) without being reminded and regardless of how long it has been since your last visit. The sommalier in the restaurant can recall the bottle of wine you drank on your previous stay and will check to see if it is still available. The Chef will prepare anything you request if he has the ingredients in the kitchen, and if he does not, he will go find them if you give him a little advance notice. The Consierge (they call them Hall Porters, in the old English tradition) can always be counted on to get those hard to find theater tickets or restaurant reservations on short notice, or to provide a guided tour of the 350-year old Wine Cellar at 2:00 a.m. after returning from a long night out (I actually did this). Guests tend to be very loyal to the Hotel, chosing to stay there year after year. And there are examples of third generation guests whose grandparents and parents also stayed at the Stafford.",5,2003,06,09
142,Elegance and sophistication in the heart of London.,"We spent three fantastic days at the Stafford Hotel, an unforgettable experience with my son. The hotel stands out for its elegance and impeccable service. The location is perfect, in the heart of London, ideal for exploring the city on foot. Every detail is taken care of, from luxurious rooms to the extraordinary hospitality of the staff. A stay that we will remember with great pleasure!",5,2024,10,15
142,LOVELY EXPERIENCE,"Long and pleasant walks through the neighborhoods and streets of London fascinated our expectations of this magnificent city.
Completing our holiday, enriching it with comfortable pleasures and delicious and delicate food, was The Stafford London hotel, which pampered us at every moment of the day thanks to the elegant and professional staff.
A special thank you to the receptionist Alessandra, who took care of our stay in the hotel down to the smallest detail without forgetting anything.
We would like to thank Chaima (Samy) and Juan who pampered us with a sublime aperitif, delicious cocktails and excellent service. To complete the great hospitality, Alfonso and Cesare delighted us with an excellent fish-based dinner, with excellent dishes, pairing the wine with each dish served. Thanks to all the staff in general for the legendary stay.

142,Rundum perfekter Service,"Es war mein erster Aufenthalt im Stafford Hotel und ich bin immer noch begeistert! Habe mich super wohl gefühlt. Das Personal hat den Aufenthalt zu etwas besonderem gemacht, da sie einen sehr besonders haben fühlen lassen. Alle waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit bei allen Arten von Fragen. Vor allem lohnt sich ein Besuch in der Weihnachtszeit mit der wunderschönen Dekoration im und um dem Hotel.",5,2022,12,17
142,Unter den Augen Ihrer Majestät,"Hier ist das Empire noch lebendig. Traditionelles Hotel im britischen Stil, keine amerikanisierte Schlafstätte. Nachdem wir dort einige Jahre nicht mehr gewohnt hatten, waren inzwischen das Foyer und das Restaurant behutsam renoviert worden. Sehr aufmerksames und hilfsbereites Personal im Empfangsbereich. Das Frühstück wird nach Karte bestellt, sehr aufmerksamer Service. Leider hatten wir - auch vom Preis- Leistungsverhältnis gesehen - ein sehr kleines Zimmer. Deshalb Abstrich bei der Gesamtbewertung. Bei einem erneuten Aufenthalt würde ich das bei der Reservierung auf jeden Fall klären.",4,2022,03,26
142,Fascino British con qualche pecca,"La posizione dell'hotel è strategica, centrale ma tranquilla e defilata dal traffico. Il maggior punto a favore dell'hotel è il fascino assolutamente ""British"", che lo distingue dagli alberghi delle grandi catene. Qui ogni stanza, ogni dettaglio è unico. È un hotel dal carattere decisamente londinese, sin dalla facciata dell'edificio.
Il servizio è molto attento e cordiale. Il personale fa in modo che l'ospite si senta a casa.
Vi sono tuttavia alcune pecche.
Lo stile classico dell'edificio fa sì che le dimensioni delle stanze siano obbligate e non particolarmente ampie: è il prezzo da pagare per stare in un hotel di charme come questo. Ma alcune cose vanno migliorate. Le stanze al quarto piano mostrano i segni del tempo e meriterebbero sicuramente un restauro. Le finestre non sono in ottime condizioni, per non parlare delle porte, molto rumorose. Ogni volta che un vicino di stanza entre o esce dalla propria camera, la porta sbatte rumorosamente in maniera piuttosto fastidiosa. 
Il controsoffitto della doccia della camera 404 è totalmente scrostato probabilmente per l'umidità che deriva dal vapore di una doccia calda.
Gli impianti non sono all'avanguardia, le prese sono poche ed in posizioni scomode. Non c'è alcuna traccia di domotica.
In due occasioni mi è capitato di non potere rientrare nella stanza in quanto il lettore di tessere non funzionava. Il personale si è prodigato in scuse ed è prontamente intervenuto, riferendomi che in quella porta era già capitato lo stesso problema alcune settimane prima. Credo che in una struttura di questo livello dovesse essere risolto per tempo. Una sera per farmi entrare in camera un uomo della sicurezza ha preso ""a pugni"" il lettore finché non ha ricominciato a funzionare.
Infine, proprio mentre salivo sull'aereo per Londra ho trasmesso via email all'hotel un documento di lavoro che avrei dovuto esaminare nel corso del mio soggiorno, chiedendo la cortesia di stamparlo e di consegnarmelo all'arrivo. Non è stato fatto e mai mi è stato consegnato il documento, nonostante prima del mio arrivo avessi ricevuto una email chiedendomi se avessi qualche necessità. Mettendoli alla prova, la mia necessità non è stata soddisfatta.
Buona, non straordinaria, la colazione.
Simpatico l'American bar.
Molto interessanti le cantine.
Efficiente il Concierge.
Una esperienza da provare il Té delle cinque con un viaggio a St. James.
Davvero eccellente il ristorante The Game Bird. Avevo chiesto in anticipo un piatto speciale fuori menù, che è stato preparato magistralmente. Il servizio è puntuale e attento senza essere ingessato. La qualità della cucina ineccepibile. Una menzione speciale, fra il personale di sala, per un giovane ragazzo italiano di Como, davvero professionale e attento nel soddisfare le esigenze dell'ospite. Un esempio per tutti.

Sono stato in diversi hotel di lusso a Londra e tra questi tornerei sicuramente allo Stafford: è quello che più mi ha fatto sentire a casa. Spero, tuttavia, di trovarlo migliorato: abbinando al fascino inglese un pizzico di freschezza, guadagnerebbe moltissimi punti.

Spero di tornare presto!",4,2019,10,04
142,Bello ma qualcosina...,"Molto bello! hotel stile inglese in zona  signorile. Caro perché 5 stelle (per la colazione vorrebbero 30 sterline....) ma proprio perché 5 stelle qualcosa non va bene secondo me. La camera nostra è minuscola e il letto anche ,non è un due piazze pieno! . Questo secondo me non è adeguato al prezzo. Anche il bagno è piccolo con vasca/doccia lavandino piccolo senza appoggi. ",4,2019,07,20
142,Un pequeño hotel estupendo con una ubicación magnífica,"Me he alojado en el hotel en un par de ocasiones.  Una con la familia, de vacaciones y otra yo sola, en viaje de negocios.  Para los tipos de viaje el hotel resultó perfecto. Tiene una localización inmejorable. Es pequeño, con un trato amable y personalizado.  No falta un detalle.  Las camas cómodas y las habitaciones con todo lo necesario. ",5,2019,03,05
142,Klassisches englisches Hotel,"Nach Jahren im selben Hotel in London, haben wir uns in diesem Jahr für das Stafford Hotel entschieden. Eine sehr gute Entscheidung. Das Hotel entspricht einem wunderschönen typischen Londoner Stadthotel, wie man es sich vorstellt. Das Ambiente ist traumhaft und das Personal im Hotel war herzlich und sehr zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer haben einen wunderbaren Charme und sind stilvoll eingerichtet. Das Hotel Stafford kann man wirklich empfehlen. ",5,2019,01,31
142,Fantastico,"Tre giorni meravigliosi nell’albergo con più fascino di tutta Londra. Servizio , professionalità e cortesia ci hanno fatto sentire come a casa. Tutto ai massimi livelli.

Assolutamente da provare per vivere al meglio i vostri giorni a Londra.",5,2018,11,30
142,Hotel Stafford,"Qué decir. Hemos pasado cuatro días maravillosos en el Stafford Hotel. Nuestra habitación fantástica. Limpia. Muy Bonita. El personal de todos los departamentos, Un diez. Siempre atento a nuestras necesidades. Muy profesional. Nos hemos enamorado del American bar. Hemos tenido la oportunidad de disfrutar mucho del hotel. El English breakfast fantástico. La cena con surtido de salmón y el mejor pie que he comido nunca. El gran sommelier Gino, que puso toda su gran experiencia en la elección del vino. Con una gran bodega de la que disfrutar. Sin duda está visita a Londres, estando en el Stafford Hotel ha sido impresionante. Prometemos volver. Ruggero y Agata Ferrario",5,2018,11,30
142,Excelente hotel en una magnifica ubicación,"El hotel tiene una ubicación inmejorable en Saint James. El servicio es excelente; todos preocupados e interesados en que uno se sienta muy a gusto. Paul, el conserje, es particularmente muy servicial; nos ayudo mucho con las reservas de los restaurantes y atracciones. Sin lugar a dudas, lo recomiendo y regresaría.",5,2018,05,21
142,"Un poco mas de inversion,estilo de management ...y seria muy bueno","Este hotel tiene dos atributos indiscutibles que lo hacen inmejorable solamente en cuanto a esos atributos:
1.- Situacion fisica al borde de Green Park, en la mejor zona de todo Londres. Tranquila, elegante y comunicaciones perfectas
2.- un servicio de elevada calidad y bien entrenado.Tanto en el bar americano como en el area de restauracion propiamente dicha, los camareros son mas que correctos, empaticos y agradables con una muy destacable formacion profesional y de trato hacia el segmento elevado de clientes. Un tesoro sin duda
Dicho esto, esta lejos de ser un 5 estrellas.
1.- Las habitaciones son más que pequeñas. Están abigarradas de muebles que apenas caben y no dejan espacio para pasar ni abrir las maletas, por no hablar de , en algunas habitaciones, camas con dosel que ya la hacen mas pequeña de efecto aun.
2.-El baño es antiguo e incomodo por lo reducido del espacio.
Las dos habitaciones que alquilamos son ""doble  standard"". Lo aclaro para mayor comprension.
3.-Lo mas irritante es que sin previo aviso, pese a toda la letra pequeña de las reservas por Booking, en mi caso, que pudiera asistirles, el dia anterior a llegar ya nos habian cargado en la tarjeta un importe. SIN AVISAR y sin ningun tacto ni de elegancia etica ni de la calidad que dicen tener al calificarse como 5 estrellas. Pocos hoteles hacen esa chapuza y, en los que he tenido esa experiencia, el perfil es el mismo: hoteles que quieren tener calidad y glamur y les falta el estilo que llevan sus piedras.
Es necesario que los clientes exijamos respeto hacia nosotros y simetria en el trato. Si van a usar nuestras tarjetas de credito deben hacerlo comunicando previamente que cantidad y a que corresponde la cifra, quieren cobrar. El cliente les da una prueba de confianza dandoles la tarjeta, las claves y exijo al menos que me comuniquen que van a hacer, porqué, cuando y cuanto.
HABLAMOS DE UN 5 ESTRELLAS. Que no lo es,claro queda.
Deberian invertir en las habitaciones lo que nos cobran por adelantado, antes de que nos presentemos en el hotel y hacerlas dignas de lo que cobran y de su rancio estilo de gestion.
Por lo demás es un hotel normal para ser un 5 estrellas.",3,2018,03,05
142,"vero ""Charme""",frequento questo hotel da diversi anni e nell'arco del tempo ha cambiato parte della sua fisionomia. Trovo che il ristorante e  l'american bar abbiano perso parte del loro fascino ma restano sempre molto interessanti. molto piacevole il retro bar e le nuove suite. Hotel tranquillissimo situato in fondo ad un cul de sac  a pochi metri da Green Park e vicino a Piccadilly. ,4,2018,02,15
142,Gran hotel en una excelente localización,"Una grata sorpresa de un hotel bastante clásico inglés en una localización inmejorable a un paso de St James' Palace, Green Parck, Buckingham Palace y Picadilly. Gran servicio con un nivel de atención (especialmente el concierge) al que, lamentablemente, ya no estamos acostumbrados. Es un hotel pequeño y tiene un bar bastante pintoresco y un buen desayuno. Como único pero le pondría que en algunas habitaciones se notaba el zumbido de los aires acondicionados o maquinaria similar. Pedimos el cambio y no hubo problemas. Una gran opción para quedarse en Londres. No era barato pero la localización y el servicio lo merecen.",5,2017,07,18
142,Mal desayuno. ,"El hotel bien ubicado, cómodo. Limpio. Buena atención. Pero el desayuno malo. Aunque es bufet prácticamente nada puedes tomar tu. Y entonces no te lo dan como quieres o tardan. Cuando hay gente no dan abasto. Te sirven de una pierna de jamón el embutido que parece lo cortan con sierra. 
Lento. Pequeño. Incómodo. Si no va incluido mejor desayunar en otro lado. ",4,2017,06,06
142,Schlechter Service,"Als Hotelgast bekommt man keinen Platz im Baraum, weil von anderen Leuten reserviert war, typisch  Englisch! Frühstück war eine Katastrophe, lange Wartezeiten für Kleinigkeiten! Viel Potential bei Selbstverständlichkeiten. Resümee Preis Leistung sowie Anspruch Wirklichkeit nicht kongruent...",2,2017,05,20
142,Not Perfect ...,"Für ein 5 Star-Hotel lässt vieles zu wünschen übrig. Auf den Café morgens wartet man Ewigkeiten - das Zimmer bedarf dringend einer Instandsetzung und an der Bar sind Hotelgäste weitaus weniger erwünscht als externe Gäste: Nach einem erheblichen Umsatz abends zuvor war es nicht möglich am Samstag spät Nachmittag einen Tisch in der Bar zu erhalten. Sämtliche freien Tische waren 'reserviert' - für wen wusste man nicht, für wie lange auch nicht ... im Endeffekt ist man im Pub um die Ecke besser aufgehoben. Das Stafford kann - obwohl es sich als 5 Star Hotel ausgibt - mit den wirklich 5 Star Häusern in London (Claridges; Connaught; Browns Hotel ...) nicht mithalten. Einmal aber nicht mehr wieder !",2,2017,05,20
142,Tipico british,"Per la seconda volta in questo ottimo hotel, buon servizio, bella ed ampia camera deluxe, speciale anche  il blasonato pub. Centrale ma non troppo, comodo sia per chi arriva in auto che in aereo. Prezzi adeguati, sicuramente tornerò.",5,2017,03,23
142,Excelente servicio y localización inmejorable.,"El hotel es encantador, con una bonita decoración. Tiene estilo. No es grande, de modo que resulta acogedor. La ubicación es inmejorable.Y estando situado en la mejor zona del centro de la ciudad, está aislado del ruido de la calle, al integrar diversas edificaciones que dan a un patio interior y estar orientado a una estrecha y silenciosa calle (St. James´s Place). 

La habitación espaciosa, con buenos medios y cama muy amplia y cómoda. Muy limpia y confortable.

El servicio es excelente, muy atento, servicial y eficiente, muy dispuesto a resolver cualquier necesidad o aclaración y para realizar toda clase de reservas, y además con sugerencias muy acertadas.

Si acaso, podría hacerse algo para mejorar el aislamiento de algunas habitaciones que dan al patio donde se ubica la terraza del bar. Nuestra habitación estaba a pie del suelo, junto al patio. 

En resumen, un Hotel muy bonito, con mucho estilo, con un servicio excelente y una ubicación insuperable.",5,2017,02,13
142,Los mejores días! ,"Este hotel es excelente. El trato del personal desde la llegada es de primera. Las habitaciones son cómodas, con excelentes almohadas y camas para tener un excelente descanso! La decoración de los cuartos de muy buen gusto y lo mejor de todo no se escucha ni un solo ruido entre las habitaciones o en el exterior. Te sientes literalmente en tu casa. La ubicación es inigualable, a 5 mins caminando de green park, picadilly etc pero sin que puedas ver turistas alrededor del hotel. Un poco caro pero lo vale! ",5,2017,01,17
142,Un incantevole soggiorno,"Dopo una giornata non proprio perfetta, sono finalmente arrivata in Hotel dove ho ricevuto un'accoglienza confortevole e cortese. Un rapido giro dell'hotel e sono stata accompagnata nella stanza che avevo prenotato: una piccola bomboniera con tutti i confort desiderati. Al mattino, una deliziosa colazione con spremuta fresca mi ha messa di buon umore per il resto della giornata e, ciliegina finale, ho ottenuto anche un late check out che mi ha consentito di meglio gestiore il resto della giornata in città. 
Unico neo? avervi trascorso una sola notte e non aver avuto modo di sperimentare nè il ristorante nè l'american bar, entrambi gettonatissimi! Mi sono ripromessa di farlo alla prossima occasione che, mi auguro, sarà molto presto e - senza alcun dubbio - allo Stafford Hotel!",5,2016,12,27
142,Wunderbares Hotel mit toller Lage,"The Stafford in London liegt in unmittelbarer Nähe der Green Park Station und fußläufig 10 Minuten vom Piccadilly entfernt in einer völlig ruhigen Seitenstraße. Das Hotel strahlt englische Behaglichkeit aus, das Zimmer war ausreichend groß, etwas plüschig, sehr fein eingerichtet, aber technisch auf dem Stand, das Bett, bzw. die Matratze hervorragend. Rundum angenehm und behaglich, sehr gepflegt, das Personal von ausgesuchter Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft. Das Frühstück englisch reichhaltig, in einer Kombination von Buffet und Service, sehr angenehm. Die Bar ist ein weiteres Highlight des Stafford, absolut empfehlenswert. 
Wenn der Preis wieder stimmt, gehe ich sehr gerne in das Stafford beim nächsten Besuch wieder, ein feines, übersichtliches 5 Sterne Haus, das jedem vergebenen Stern Ehre macht. ",5,2016,11,22

Enhorabuena.",5,2016,03,08

Die Lage ist phantastisch - viele Sehenswürdigkeiten befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nähe und können bequem zu Fuss erreicht werden. Im Dezember war die Lobby und der Speisesaal sehr geschmackvoll weihnächtlich dekoriert. In unserem Zimmer gab es sogar eine Nespresso-Maschine. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.

142,Nur die Lage ist Luxus,"London ist teuer, aber zu dem Preis sollte schon auch etwas geboten werden. Unser Doppelzi. war sehr klein, eher ein EZ, das Bad auch winzig, keine extra Dusche, in der Wanne Duschvorhang (!), der Boden im Zimmer mit Spannteppich, wo man ziemliche Löcher drunter fühlt, die Aussicht in einen Hinterhof, dafür aber ruhig. Das Frühstück gibt es mit kleiner Auswahl vom Buffet, erweitert von der Karte war sehr gut, bei uns gab es Unklarheit, was gebucht war. Die Bar ist perfekt, mit Aussenbereich, auch für Zigarrenraucher. Lage Top. Service mässig bemüht.",4,2014,09,01
142,PERFECTO,"Hacía tiempo que no tenía una sorpresa tan agradable como la que me he llevado estos días que he estado en Londres. Teníamos un poco de miedo porque, al ser un hotel de gran nivel, quizá era arriesgado ir con nuestros bebés, habida cuenta que pueden molestar al resto de clientes del hotel. Pero toso resultó maravilloso: pudimos disfrutar de dos habitaciones comunicadas por una puerta (nos hicieron un upgrade en una de ellas)...y qué preciosidad y con qué gusto estaban decoradas!! Además, como sabían que ibamos con niños, además de los patitos de goma, nos facilitaron champú, gel y crema de la marca sebamed y un set completo para niños. Nos dijeron que podíamos tomar las bebidas del minibar que quisiéramos, que iban a ser regalos del hotel (en consideración a los niños, no dejaban alcohol en el minibar); los baños eran maravillosos, clásicos y de mármol; las telas de las cortinas, señoriales...en fin...habitaciones de auténtico lujo, lo que fue muy apreciado por mi mujer y por mí, habida cuenta que en otros hoteles que quizá tengan más fama, si vas con niños te suelen ubicar en las peores habitaciones. 
Qué decir de la amabilidad de todos los miembros del hotel...siempre con una sonrisa en la boca, dispuestos a ayudarte con los carritos, para buscar una dirección, teniendo paciencia con los niños, especialmente si nos aventurábamos a tomar algo con ellos en el restaurante del hotel...por cierto, tuvimos la oportunidad de probar la comida del hotel en las habitaciones y eran ricas y cuantiosas...
Ubicación maravillosa...cerca y separado de todo..En definitiva, hemos tenido la mejor de las experiencias british!!! Volveremos sin duda.",5,2014,05,23
142,Beste Lage,"Das allerbeste hier ist die fantastische Lage. Das Bad zeigt schon erhebliche Altersspuren und hätte zumindest ein facelifting notwendig. Das Frühstück passt nicht ganz zum Luxusstil des Hauses. Die Bar mit der Zigarrenterrasse ist ein Hit. Der Service bis auf das Frühstück entsprechend gut. 
Insgesamt für London aber in der Kategorie empfehlenswert. ",4,2014,04,26
142,Schön - aber alt,"Ein perfekt gelegenes Hotel - leider wird es nicht genug gepflegt... Das Frühstück war hervorragend und die Bar ist auch klasse! Letztenendes recht hochpreisig, doch das ist ja obligatorisch London, jedenfalls in den guten Häusern!

Die öffentlichen Räume (natürlich mit dem obligaten Kamin) verströmen stilvolle Behaglichkeit und wohltuende Ruhe. Die komfortablen Zimmer sind zeitlos elegant ohne modische Gebärden. Wir (2 Erw. + 1 Kleinkind) waren in einer gemütlichen Suite im Obergeschoss untergebracht, die keine Wünsche offen ließ. Hervorzuheben ist das herrliche Frühstücksbuffet und die freundlichen Mitarbeiter - Kempinski Style eben!
Größtes Plus des Hotels: Die Lage mitten im ""royalen"" Zentrum der britischen Hauptstadt.
Empfehlenswert!!!",4,2014,02,17
142,Eccellente,"Abbiamo adorato questo hotel elegante nella giusta misura, confortevole e pratico.

L'hotel è molto particolare, stile inglese ma non troppo pesante nei tendaggi o mobilia. E' formato da 3 building: Romantico (antiche stalle adibite a suite ricordanti dei cottage inglesi ma al centro di Londra), Moderno ma non troppo con toni caldi e chiari e per ultimo stile classico inglese anche queste camere molto eleganti. 
Il personale gentile. La colazione abbondante. Veramente una struttura da consigliare. Ottima esperienza",5,2013,11,30
142,"Wunderschönes, sehr gemütliches, klassisches Stadthotel","Die zentrale Lage direkt am Green Park in der Nähe des Buckingham Palasts und anderen Sehenswürdigkeiten ist ideal. Durch eine kleine Gasse direkt gegenüber des Hotels ist man direkt im Park und auf der anderen Seite sind es nur ca. 15 Gehminuten zum Piccadilly Circus. Das Hotel ist sehr klassisch und englisch einrichtet. Die Zimmer sind alle unterschiedlich und auf drei Häuser verteilt. Ein Teil der Zimmer ist im ehemaligen Pferdestall, was dem Ganzen noch einen rustikaleren Touch verleiht. Die Bar im Erdgeschoss ist ebenfalls sehr zu empfehlen. Das Frühstücksbuffet jedoch kann man sich getrost sparen und anstatt dessen in den Nahe gelegenen Cafés den Tag günstiger und leckerer starten. Meine Empfehlung: die Patisserie Valerie ganz in der Nähe",5,2013,09,12
142,Soggiorno da incubo - attenti alla camera 100,"Arriviamo in albergo con l'auto e subito il portiere ci dice che per portare l'auto in garage il costo sarà di 65 sterline al giorno, (assurdo, il costo mi sembra veramente eccessivo) decidiamo di parcheggiarla l'auto nelle vicinanze. Avevamo prenotato circa un mese prima,prendendo 2 camere adiacenti e quindi collegate avendo con noi 2 ragazzi minorenni. Sono le 13 le camere non sono pronte alla reception ci dicono che le camere sono collegate tra loro e saranno pronte dopo un ora e mezzo, ok ci facciamo un giro e torniamo alle 15,00 per prendere possesso delle camere con grande sorpresa alla reception ci dicono che le camere non sono collegate e che prima si erano sbagliati. Ok entriamo in camera la numero 100, con grande sorpresa troviamo un bagno piccolissimo 2 x 2 metri incredibile e considerate che questa doveva essere una camera de luxe e quindi di livello superiore, ci accorgiamo che nella camera manca l'acqua calda e dopo aver contattato la reception arriva un tecnico che constata che non c'è acqua calda. Dopo un ora riesce a mandarci finalmente l'acqua calda. Ci allunghiamo sul letto per riposarci e ci accorgiamo che dal soffitto in legno arrivano cigolii fastidiosissimi dovuti al camminare degli ospiti della camera superiore, questi rumori ci accompagneranno per tutto il soggiorno rovinando il nostro riposo e il nostro sonno. Un'altra cosa curiosa e strana è che nel pacchetto acquistato doveva esserci in camera una bottiglia di champagne e della frutta come benvenuto e che con grande sorpresa non abbiamo trovato, quindi abbiamo dovuto chiamare la reception spiegare la cosa e finalmente dopo tanto tempo abbiamo avuto sia la bottiglia e la frutta. (questa cosa ci è parsa molto strana come è stata strana l'affermazione iniziale che le camere erano collegate, questo ci ha fatto pensare che ci sono state cambiate le camere all'ultimo momento). Un'altra cosa assurda è l'acqua in camera nelle bottiglie di plastica, questo non è degno di un albergo di lusso e di queste fattezze.  Un'altra cosa che dobbiamo contestare è la colazione che ci è parsa veramente misera e dozzinale. Devo dare atto però che alla fine dopo ore di discussioni e reclami ci è stata scontata una notte in una camera. Ma oramai il soggiorno era stato danneggiato e rovinato da questa serie di fatti negativi.",1,2013,08,20
142,Gute Quaität sehr zentral,"Ein schoenes klassisches Haus im Zentrum von London. Ein Ort wo man immer wieder gerne hingeht. Auf Preise achten. Hin und wieder ist das Hotel zahlbar, hin und wieder ein wenig teuer. Mit Suchmaschinen wie hotelcombined, kayak oder trivago ist es aber kein Problem, die Hotelpreise zu vergleichen.
Das Hotel hat eine tolle Bar mit grosser Tradition. Das Fruehstueck ist eine Klasse fuer sich.",5,2013,05,26
142,Servicio en el centro de Londres,"Excelente ubicación, en el corazón de Londres pero en un lugar muy tranquilo. Hotel pequeño tipico ingles pero sin moqueta en el baño, lo que se agradece :) Servicio de primerisimo nivel en recepción, desayuno, conserjeria, etc
De los hoteles que tienes dudas en compartir para que no se llene :)
El baño muy pequeño, para ponerle un pero",5,2013,02,23

142,American Bar,"Vado spesso in questo hotel, ma stavolta voglio recensire il prestigioso American Bar, un ottima alternativa ai paludati ristoranti dei dintorni di St.James.
In un ambiente da Club inglese , alle pareti foto autografate di improbabili imprese automobilistiche, cavalli, politici, etc.etc. Bar sconfinato nelle scelte, cucina del prestigioso ristorante dell'hotel a tutte le ore, carta dei vini super. Possibilità di stare all'esterno. Prezzi alti.",4,2012,08,08
142,Increible aunque con alguna pega,"El sitio me parece increible, poder estar en un antiguo establo en el mismo centro de Londres. La pega que le vi es que compartes espacio con un restaurante con terraza y te puedes encontrar tratando de dormir con una mesa ruidosa al otro lado de la puerta.",4,2012,05,07
142,British chic,"Lo Stafford Hotel è situato in una zona molto tranquilla ed elegante di Londra, comoda a molti servizi. 

Ho soggiornato in questo hotel durante un fine settimana e il mio feedback è assolutamente positivo. Avevo una suite, al piano terra con entrata dal patio interno: era meravigliosa, aveva un piccolo salottino e un letto fantastico. Ma la cosa in assoluto più bella era il bagno: enorme, pulitissimo, un set di prodotti complimentary eccezzionali e le paperelle nella vasca da bagno ;-) Davvero fantastiche. 

Non ho avuto modo di cenare o pranzare nell'hotel ma l'ultimo giorno abbiamo fatto colazione all'inglese: con uova, bacon e toast, buonissima.

Consiglio a tutti questo hotel.",5,2012,04,10
142,Einfach optimal,"Das Hotel liegt absolut zentral am Greenpark, Buckingham Palace und U-Bahnstation Greepark sind in unmittelbarer Nähe. Piccadilly Circus ist ca. 15 Gehminuten entfernt. Die Zimmer befinden sich in drei verschiedenen Häusern, die alle in einem Komplex verbunden sind. Restaurant und Bar sind im Haupthaus, der Fitnessraum in einem angrenzenden Nebengebäude. Der Service ist sehr persönlich, freundlich und jederzeit perfekt. Das Frühstück ist für englische Verhältnisse sehr umfangreich. Zimmer sind sehr gediegen (very british) eingerichtet und ausreichend groß (meistens sowieso Suiten). Die Badezimmer sind komplett ausgestattet. Es gibt an diesem Hotel absolut keinen Schwachpunkt, natürlich hat derartige Perfektion seinen Preis - aber es ist jeden Penny wert. Darüber hinaus ist lie Lage einfach genial.",5,2011,11,14
142,Sehr schönes Stadthotel näche Green Park,"Das Stafford Kempinski Hotel in London befindet sich in einer sehr ruhigen Seitenstraße ca. 2 Minuten von der U-Bahnstation Green Park und ca. 15 Minuten Fußweg vom Piccaddilly Circus entfernt. Die Zimmer befinden sich im Haupthaus, einem Neubaus sowie - sehr originell - in einem Gebäude mit ehemaligen Pferdeställen. Der Service ist sehr persönlich, im Untergeschoß befindet sich ein kleiner Fitnessraum.",5,2011,10,05
142,Volver a otra época,"Hemos estado unos días en Agosto,ha sido todo perfecto: la ubicación, la decoración de las habitaciones, el personal siempre atento, es como sentirse en casa y retomar el maravillo placer de viajar.Siempre recordaremos los maravillosos desayunos y esperamos volver pronto.

142,Top class - auch im Preis,"Ich war im The Stafford Hotel in London im Dezember 2010 und muss sagen: Topklasse, nicht nur für London down town sondern generell für jeden Standard und Ort. Perfekter Service, perfektes Personal, sehr gutes Essen - alles wirklich gepflegt und sehr komfortabel und gediegen. Gut, über den Preis in dieser Klasse muss man nicht diskutieren, für gehobene Geschäftstreffen perfekte Umgebung.
Keine Schwachpunkte sonst, empfehlenswert, wenn man das Geld dafür ausgeben kann/mag...
Als Ausgangspunkt für einen exklusiven Wochenendtrip nach London sicher ebenfalls perfekt!",4,2010,12,22
142,Troppo facile da recensire (ma camera molto piccola),Scrivere una recensione su quest'albergo che rappresenta a pieno lo stile inglese è facile. Servizio eccellente (una sera stavo poco bene e mi hanno montato un apparato dvd per la sera). Posizione ottima (anche se io preferisco muovermi nella zona di K&C per ristoranti e negozi). Unico neo la dimensione delle camere. Avevo una doppia uso singola ed a malapena riuscivo ad aprire l'armadio.,4,2010,11,22
142,"Mittendrin, luxuriös, eine Kleinod i Zentrum","Typisches altes luxuriöses Stadthotel, excellent gelegen, alles zu Fuss erreichbar, Gute Bar mit beheiztem Raucherbereich aussen !
Suite reativ klein aber sehr schön, Personal  britisch zuverlässig und höflich. Sehr viel Stammgäste. Zentrumsnah und doch sehr ruhig. 5'o clock Tea sehr zu empfehlen. 
Restaurant nicht getestet, da in der direkten Umgebung sehr viele namhafte und ausgezeichnete Restaurants gelegen sind, die wir favorisierten.",5,2010,06,10
