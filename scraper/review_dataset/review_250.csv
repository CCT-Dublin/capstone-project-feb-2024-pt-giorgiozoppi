250,Great hotel,"Clean, comfortable hotel with a handy  free shuttle to and from the airport. Airport parking available too for 10euro a night. Pillows were a little soft for my liking but that's personal preference. Bar/restaurant was lovely with plenty of choices.",5,2024,10,12
250,Wonderful service,"Highly recommend this hotel for a convenient location to airport. The staff are incredibly kind and hospitable. We arrived after midnight and realized we accidentally booked our room for the wrong night, but the hotel was fully booked for the night we arrived. The staff called numerous hotels in the area to find us somewhere else to stay, but there were no rooms in the entire city. They ended up finding a way to get us a room in the Crowne. It was very comfortable and cutely decorated. Thank you to Luis and Liam who made huge efforts to help us in our moment of distress. We are so appreciative. The airport shuttle was also very convenient.",5,2023,06,29
250,Great hotel to visit alone or with family,"Great hotel to visit alone or with family. 
Rooms are large, clean, everything you need is there. Staff is friendly, service is perfect. 
I stayed fir a short period of time, but every day I felt ina comfortable and cosy atmosphere. 
I would like also to mention that the hotel staff and service is very attentive to details which are making our day to flow in high mood. 
I very much recommend it!",5,2024,10,09
250,Very comfortable stay before morning flight.,"Great hotel with airport shuttle! 
Positive experience on our last night in Dublin before an early flight out. Desk staff are very friendly and welcoming. Rooms are large and well appointed with plenty of towels, robes, extra seating and space for luggage. We were on the concierge floor and the lounge is clean with very comfortable seating. Water is provided in recycled glass bottles in your room and there is a water bottle filling station in the hallway near the elevator. Rooms were quiet and hallways dark with automatic lighting as you walk through. This allows for a much better nights sleep without light coming in from under the door all night. Breakfast in the concierge lounge begins at 6:30am and offers plenty of options for a quick bite before an early flight. Would highly recommend!",5,2024,09,28
250,"A comfortable hotel with quick, easy access to the Dublin Airport!",Very comfortable hotel with friendly & helpful staff (from the front desk to the dining room (Mariann & Carolina were so delightful in the dining room!)).  Our room was pleasant and the hotel food (dinner and breakfast) was delicious!  A surprise for us was the beautiful park across the street with numerous walking paths which we enjoyed.  The shuttle bus to the Dublin Airport was quick and convenient.,5,2024,09,26
250,Worth the stay,Very nice accommodations. Excellent breakfast. Free shuttle to and from airport. Nice park across the road to wander.  Very clean and bedding comfortable.  Room size adequate for a stay. Staff very helpful and friendly and rooms were quite at night,5,2024,09,26
250,Nice place,"Nice place to stay. They have a free shuttle that takes you back and forth to the airport. Check in fast and easy. Room nice. Tub and shower. Fast internet, air conditioning, fan, and plenty of room for storage. The bed big and comfortable. Breakfast is good. We ate dinner there 1 night. Also good.",5,2024,09,23
250,Great stay for early morning flight,"Perfect hotel to catch an early morning flight! Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Wonderful room service dinner meal and ability to grab a drink at the bar. Plus comfy bed! Shuttle to the airport runs every half hour which was very efficient and convenient. (We did not use it, but looked like there were large rooms for meetings/events, too.)",5,2024,09,20
250,Comfortable airport hotel,"Good location for Dublin Airport, regular shuttle was a big plus.
Upgraded to the executive level, nice room and access to the lounge was a big plus.
The cinnabar had a good choice of food for dinner and the breakfast was a large buffet choice.
Excellent choice for the airport.",5,2024,09,17
250,Very good hotel overall,"5 minutes drive from the airport with lots of features and multiple (popular) meeting rooms.

Positive:
Friendly staff throughout
Cheap car park adjacent to hotel
Large bar area with multiple seating areas and TV screens
Well appointed and comfortable room
Great buffet breakfast
Large flat screen TVs with great choice of channels
Excellent WiFi

Negative:

Shower not the best
Gym machines need an upgrade",4,2024,09,17
250,Will Comeback Again,"We (2 seniors) stayed 1 night. Very modern, clean, quiet and large room, including a superior and confortable bed. Room was well climatized. Staff  service helpful and professional. Buffet breakfast had a variety of food of superb quality. Will comeback again.",5,2024,09,08
250,Last minute stay,"Our flight was cancelled .. we got a room last minute.  Got the shuttle bus to hotel. Excellent service,  all the staff were so friendly. Hotel was spotless.  Food excellent.  We had dinner breakfast and lunch Would definitely stay again.  Hopefully not because of a flight cancellation!",5,2024,09,02
250,Great place to stay near the airport,"We needed to stay close to the airport, as we had an early morning flight.
They recognized my IHG status with an upgrade to the executive lounge level. This was a godsend, as I had gotten some upsetting news before we arrived at the hotel.
 It was lovely to sit in the lounge and have a cup of tea and relax. Later in the afternoon, they  had a “happy hour” with wine and beer and appetizers. It was perfect, as I was in no mood to go to a restaurant.
The young man working in the lounge, I believe his name was Oscar, was professional and kind. 
The lounge also has a very nice continental breakfast ( many types of cheese, smoked salmon, and pastries). As we had to depart so early, I just took two pastries, which were delicious, to eat in the airport.",4,2024,08,15
250,Handy Hotel,"Really pleasant hotel, very friendly reception, bar and cleaning staff. The hotel is brilliantly located for getting onto motorways and visiting areas outside Dublin - which is mostly what we were there for. Didn't eat her, but there is a VERY well stocked bar and we certainly did sample some drinks!!",5,2024,08,14
250,Would recommend!,"My hubby & I stayed here for 2 nights, last weekend. We were greeted warmly and professionally upon checking in and were upgraded straight away. (I think his name was James). We also benefited from a later checkout time due to club status.  Our room was on the 4th Floor; clean and comfortable with a robe and slippers. (What one would expect.) There was also a Nespresso in the room - sweet!
Breakfast was very good, plenty of variety and there is also the option of ordering an omelette or poached eggs instead or as well as the hot buffet. We ordered an omelette which was very well prepared and tasty (unlike the last one I had in a “4* hotel” in Killarney). There are two coffee machines too with the usual varieties and bottles of still and sparkling water.  
We also used the gym which was small but good with fresh towels and even sanitising alcohol wipes and the cleaning lady was in there early, which was good to see. 
(Note: We parked our car in the car park which can be paid upfront and validated so that you can come and go, it is also accessible through the hotel. )
Throughout our stay, the service was friendly and professional.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would definitely return and have no hesitation in recommending this 4* Hotel!",5,2024,07,28
250,Enjoyed our time,"Great place. The front desk staff is very nice, friendly, and welcoming. They kept our luggage for some time after we checked out so we could explore Dublin a bit longer.

I enjoyed how clean the place is. The lounge was great. My kids enjoyed the drinks, the afternoon snacks in the lounge, and the friendly staff who served the food. The room was nice, clean, comfortable, and sustainable. There was also water on each level where you could easily fill up your water bottle with sparkling or tap water. There were snacks and coffee in the room. I slept well during my stay.

The only caveat is that parking is 15 euros.",5,2024,07,22
250,Perfect after long flight / before early flight,"We stayed for one night after one of us had a 10-hour-flight. The airport shuttle went reliably every 30 minutes between the hotel and the airport. Look for the black/dark grey bus in Coach Lot 16 as of this writing. The bus drivers were exceptional and helpful. The schedule can be downloaded as a pdf from the hotel’s website, which is convenient. Staff was lovely, helpful and friendly. Bed was comfy. Room was quiet. We had a kettle and a coffee machine in the room. Oh, there’s a lovely fish tank in the lobby. We had access to the lounge on the third floor, which was especially nice and unexpected. We really really loved the lounge. It was like a cross between an airport lounge and a library. The young women who handled the lounge were wonderful. Note that being selected for the lounge is probably by chance - we received an upgrade but there wasn’t really any reason that we knew of, how we were so lucky. We had breakfast at the same lounge the next morning with smoked salmon and a great offer of variety. 

We stayed here for the second time in three weeks in prep for our flights back home. The hotel was fully booked due to the pilot strike between 26th of June to 2nd July 2024. Staff was very experienced and handled the high demand graciously. We used the option to spend the night at the airport hotel because the flight left at 7am and we did not want to risk missing the flight being stuck in traffic in Dublin downtown. Unfortunately, the water bottles in our room were empty on arrival. We didn’t get into the lounge this time, so who knows. For this stay, we were on Floor 1, whereas the first time, we were on the same floor as the lounge. Both rooms and beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms were lovely.",5,2024,07,21
250,Would stay there again. Great restaurant and breakfast buffet,"Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport, an IHG Hotel

Santry

Would stay there again. Excellent restaurant and breakfast buffet.

Conveniently located near the Airport car rental returns. So we stayed here our final three days of our trip to Ireland, while we toured Dublin.

We absolutely loved our stay here. The staff were so friendly and polite. The rooms were clean and spacious. What we enjoyed the most was the restaurant downstairs in the lobby. We had dinner there a couple of times, where we absolutely enjoyed the atmosphere and service. Special call out to Anna Maria and Rejis. Excellent customer service and really great at what they do. I would come back just to see them again.

Breakfast...five star! Huge range and they also had a person making fresh eggs! Nice range of both hot and cold foods and spacious.

If you stay here and want to go to the Bar area (say the Temple Bar area), unless you have a designated driver, you can take Ubers or Taxis from here. A great parking place near the Temple Bar area is the parking garage on Jervis street. You can walk from there to the Temple Bar area in under five minutes. You can park till 1am.

Overall, excellent hotel and I would stay there again.",5,2024,07,14
250,"Quiet, comfortable, and excellent breakfast!","We stayed there twice: upon arriving in Ireland before our drive around the country; the night before leaving Ireland. On both occasions, being close to the airport was helpful. The hotel was very quiet, and it's surroundings feel like it is far from the city. The beds were great. The breakfast was excellent. The use of the luggage room was very helpful.",5,2024,06,30
250,Wonderful stay,Great hotel ... highly recommend.  Elizabeth on check in is a treasure !!!  Bar and restaurant staff so friendly and helpful.  Food is really good and there is something for everyone !!! Amazing breakfast and great value. Great location for city and getting back onto the M50,5,2024,06,20
250,It’s Meh! Just ok. Nothing special,"Firstly the hotel room I had was very average. There was a dubious light feature above the bed. Decor was depressing in the room. Luckily was only staying one night. 

The mattresses were not of the standard I expect in Crowne Plaza. Sleep was ok

Breakfast was adequate. The pastries were fantastic.  

Staff were friendly. Nothing wrong with this hotel and for one night it’s ok. Not for any longer",4,2024,06,13
250,Comfortable stay near the airport,"We needed something close to the airport to catch an early morning flight and the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport was very comfortable - good choice for short stays. Rooms were clean and comfortable, restaurant was decent and staff very friendly. Excellent shuttle service to the airport. My only complaint was the weird glass countertops in the bathroom which had a large bubble pattern such that you couldn’t set things on the countertop without them sitting askew. But for one night I could overlook that.",4,2024,06,11
250,"The Ideal Airport Stay: Comfortable, Close, and Cost-Effective!","I booked this hotel for a meeting because I had a number of people flying in from Europe for one night, and didn’t want to make everybody travel all the way into the centre of Dublin.

The hotel was comfortable, the rooms were clean - and it was everything you would expect from a mid-range hotel.

A couple of practical points for potential travellers; it’s not walking distance, it’s about 2 miles / 3 kilometres.  So you will need to get a taxi - which can be difficult at Dublin airport.  Alternatively, if you have a bit of time there is a free courtesy bus which leaves from bus stance 16 directly to the hotel door - every 30 minutes.  You can access the bus station easily on foot from either terminal 1 or terminal 2.

The hotel isn’t ideally situated for exploring Dublin, which is why the prices are comparatively good.  There are no easy public transport links and a taxi will cost around €30 each way if you travel into the centre.

There is a fairly nice restaurant about 200m from the hotel called the gourmet food parlour - and the hotel has a restaurant and bar.",4,2024,06,04
250,Well kept up date property. Recommended.,"Enjoyed my stay at this slightly off-airport property. About a 5 walk from the Terminal. You do need to cross the main thoroughfare of the airport but there is a zebra lane to use.  Also, a free shuttle takes about 2 minutes. The hotel seemed quite new and well kept up.  I had a corner room overlooking the back of the property.  Vibe was a smart business hotel. Enjoyed this property much more than the one at the Manchester Hotel. Room and furnishing are up to date.  The bed was comfortable (I like a firmer mattress) and the linens were fresh. The staff was super friendly (as are most of the people in Ireland). 1st floor restaurant is served all throughout the day. I took in the breakfast buffet. Choice of Continental and full. I ate a hamburger at their bar on the first floor. It was good, but the interior was funky and the staff was a bit off. I couldn't figure out if it was it the midst of a reno or not.  Would recommend this hotel if you need to stay very close to the airport. I think it is the closest to the airport. There might be a Maldornan across from this if I remember correctly.",4,2024,05,28
250,A terrific property; i was very impressed.,"A terrific hotel. We only spent one night here, but everything we experienced was excellent.
The airport shuttle runs every 30 minutes, 24 hours, and the great thing is that you don’t have to phone for it.
It comes, period.
Both times we used it, we were quite pleased with the service.
The lady at reception who greeted me couldn’t have been nicer.
All my email were prompted answered,
and in a very friendly manner.
There are 2 terminals at Dublin Airport.
The pickup area upon arrival is at
Terminal #1, zone 16.
The hotel is located directly adjacent to a beautiful park, which is lovely to
walk in.
The room, bathroom, WiFi, everything was terrific.
This is a very well-managed property.",5,2024,05,24
250,Shout out to the breakfast chef,The service in this hotel is excellent. Any issue is addressed in a polite and friendly manner. Helped me sort out charging for my car. The breakfast is good quality. Shout out to the breakfast chef who was really helpful in getting me a breakfast item that wasn’t available generally but he took the time to go and locate it. Very helpful 👏👏👏,5,2024,05,24
250,Great experience,"We recently visited for a family get together/ communion, the set up was great they had a children’s entertainment on , buffet was very tasty & staff were incredible. Would highly recommend for a family get together. Plus they had football on in the bar .",5,2024,05,13
250,Amazing day,"Celebrated a wonderful family day out for our daughter’s communion. Staff went above and beyond to make sure our day went off without a glitch. Crown plaza itself and staff excessed any expectation we had. The area we had reserved in the restaurant was like our own private function room which was great for the kids to have room didn’t feel like we in the way of any other guests dining. 
Thank you to all the staff again.",5,2024,05,13
250,Rude security,"My college held a ball in the function room here. First off the security were so rude. Pushing and shoving us as they walked by on the dance floor. I’d understand if we were rowdy but we were all standing chatting and singing along. Shoving into girls with heels on. One security in particular, female, overheard talking badly about us as customers, very rude. It’s a nice venue and the floor staff were lovely but i don’t know if that security was hired in for event by the college or the hotel, but I just found them to be incredibly rude and made the night somewhat uncomfortable. 

The food was also very inconsistent, lovely food cooked well, but portions were messy. I got the usual 3-4 potatoes you would expect, when the girl beside me got 1 and on the other side of me got 7.  Just more care dishing up was needed. 

Other than that the venue is lovely, the decor is beautiful and the floor staff serving us were doing great, and we’re very friendly.",1,2024,05,11
250,yet another great stay,"brilliant hotel  cannot be knocked   Everything is perfect,  staff are brilliant  i have been using this hotel for over 15 years  and it has consistent high standards     i would never dream of going anywhere else in Dublin      Although not in the city centre  i would still pick here  All the staff are attentive and caring and value their guests    I have already booked my next stay   i  couldnt  find anything wrong to say    great hotel keep up the great work",5,2024,05,03
250,another great stay,"we have been doing a trade show here for many years . I wouldnt dream of even looking anywhere else to do it.  From the moment we get there until the moment we leave the service is amazing nothing and i mean nothing can be faulted and believe me i am fussy.   accommodation is spotless,the food excellent  and the staff first class .  Must be Dublin number one hotel.  If anyone needs a hotel  in Dublin  you can rest assured this is the place  and the pillows are great.  There are many people  that i can name that make the stay so good its hard to remember their names  here are a few   Beth,john  brian   judith   these guys  are great  keep up the great work   its that good i have already booked my next stay",5,2024,05,01
250,I Wanted to Like this Hotel . . .,"Located just 5-10 minutes from DUB, the Airport designation in the title is legitimate. Hotel in good condition, overall. Front desk staff was extremely helpful. Lounge experience underwhelming; crowded and offerings during happy hour were meager. Club floor room very comfortable and spacious, but bathroom was a negative. Lighting extremely poor and shelf space has contoured glass so toiletry items easily fall over; whatever the aesthetic gain is lost in practicality. Shower pressure was terrible and water temperature changed from too hot to too cold throughout shower, making for a very unpleasant experience. I really wanted to like this hotel, but am not sure I will return.",4,2024,04,28
250,Wonderful place to stay!,"This was an exceptional place to stay! It started with the front desk staff who were so welcoming and professional. We were placed in a club-level room with all the perks that it gave us including appetizers, free drinks; soda, coffee, and wine.

The room was modern, welcoming, and clean with all the amenities we needed in the bathroom including a rainshower shower system. The elevator requires a room key to activate which is a nice security feature. 

We had a really good breakfast buffet which had a large variety of items.

Every staff member we interacted with was nice, friendly, and professional. The front desk even took care of getting taxis for us. There is a very convenient free airport shuttle. 

I would completely recommend this hotel for pleasure or business travel!",5,2024,04,24
250,"Great location, staff and restaurant","Our last stop in Dublin and hotel is conveniently located near the airport. The onsite restaurant had a wide selection within their menu and we enjoyed a relaxing last night before flying out in the morning. Shuttle service was available but we had our rental but i like how the shuttle times, restaurant hours and menu and other hotel details were displayed on their TV.",5,2024,04,22
250,Lots of TLC from this lovely hotel & staff 😍,"When you’ve had a mere-45min flight that had been delayed over 3hrs, and arriving past midnight — all you want is some TLC. THAT’S HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE OUR INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE AT THE CROWNE PLAZA that night. We arrived tired & hungry after spending 3+ hours on the cold seats of Edinburgh airport. Ivan at front desk was an awesome sympathetic ear to our story. And John, dear dear John — thank you for coming to offer us an upgraded room. The room was amazing — plush, elegant, a wonderful night at the Crowne Plaza at Dublin airport. Thank you, John & Ivan😍",5,2024,04,09
250,Comfortable hotel for transit. Eat elsewhere.,Very comfortable hotel and well located for an early flight out.  Shuttle was great and on time.  Restaurant food was not good and I suggest you eat dinner elsewhere.  We had a club room and breakfast in the executive lounge was very ordinary.    The park opposite provides a lovely outlook.,3,2024,04,09
250,January 2024,"Had a wonderful stay at the hotel from a professional and friendly check in with Alisson the reception supervisor to some evening drinks in the hotel bar. Also, enjoyed some some time in the Club Lounge with the wonderful Liesel.. also, a great buffet breakfast in the morning",5,2024,04,06
250,Top class!!!!,"Had our Club Dinner Dance there and what an incredible set up it was.Staff were very friendly,incredibly professional and couldn't do enough for us on the night.

The food was to die for and all served with the most efficient table service.

Couldn't fault it in any yway and look forward to staying at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport.",5,2024,04,03
250,Great night,"Crowne Plaza hosted our annual awards night for Craobh Chiarain, Everyone had a great time. The food was amazing and the service was exceptional. Special thanks to Magda and the team who pulled out all the stops to ensure the night was a success. Could not recommend this hotel enough. Would return in an instant",5,2024,04,03
250,The most helpful staff!,"I booked this as part of my Parent's Anniversary trip and they raved about their stay when they got back. 
I have stayed at this hotel a few times now. It's always my first choice when my family or I am staying in Dublin.
I cannot say nice enough things about all of the staff. I always contact their reservations directly, rather than going through a booking site as they are just so helpful and booking direct with them will actually save you money, more often than not!! I spoke to the lovely Nadia and she helped me make some special arrangements for my parents wedding anniversary. Everything was just perfect with some lovely touches from the Management as well!  I contacted them again just before my parent's planned visit to see if the hotel might help me with special arrangements to accommodate my uncle who has some challenges with mobility who would be visiting my parents there. Nothing was too much trouble. 
The hotel is great, but the staff are what really make it stand out.",5,2024,04,02
250,Amazing time,Had a fab time with UCD med ball. The food was anmazing and the service was exceptional. Esther in particular made our visit so wonderful! Such a lovely girl made our day so special! Could not recommend this hotel enough. Would return in an instant,5,2024,03,29
250,Event at Crowne,Went for medicine gala event and was served by Isabelle. She’s incredible!!! She made our experience 10x better by being very accommodating and kind. Will definitely attend events at this hotel again. She had amazing customer serve and I’m grateful for her!,5,2024,03,29
250,Isabel’s remarkable service,Went for a medicine gala and was left loving Isabell.  Our waitress during the med gala was so accommodating to my needs and was the most polite and kind person I have ever met in the service industry.  She truly ran the entire show single handedly.  She deserves the best.,5,2024,03,29
250,Great hotel,"Usual high standards at this Crown Plaza hotel
Super friendly efficient and well trained staff
Rooms are comfortable, well furnished and cleaned to a high standard.My room was a bit dated but it didn’t effect my stay
Food in restaurant for both dinner and breakfast was excellent and great quality
Hotel is located approx ten minutes drive from the airport and provide a shuttle bus and parking 
Highly recommend and will stay again when next travelling through Dublin airport
Thanks for an enjoyable stay",4,2024,03,28
250,Very nice experience,"The staying at Crowne Plaza Airport Hotel was very pleasant. The staff was great and the room clean. Thanks to the professionalism of Nita, Andrei, Emma, Beatriz, Elizabeth, the Tv technician and the Breakfast Team we had a very nice experience.",5,2024,03,25
250,Poor,"On arrival, one is met by this rather pungent smell of cleaning material throughout the hotel.
When we got to the room corridor there was empty glasses and empty wine bottles outside a few rooms from obviously the night before which no one bothered to cleanup.
Our room was not properly clean when on the morning after we had slept there we found men’s underwear in the bedside locker! 
The bathroom window could not be close properly leaving a draft that swept thru the room.
The breakfast was sub standard with many of the hot items cold including scrambled egg were cold and thus inedible.
The hotel bar and restaurant decor has been updated but the rooms and corridors are very dated.
Not value for money.",1,2024,03,20
250,Excellent,"The lady at check-in set the tone with her warm, friendly and efficient manner.
Room comfortable (great size bed and appreciate the separate shower and bath) and hotel lovely.
Sandra in the Exec Club lounge was superb.
Hotel is good but the staff are what make it great.
Great value - highly recommend!",5,2024,03,16
250,Nice Hotel.,Really nice Hotel. Was there for two nights on business conference.  Really great Hotel with a good breakfast. Cannot comment on the Restaurant as we dined out every night. Rooms were very good with really comfortable bed and pillows. Nice Bar to relax in after the work finished. Very pleasant Reception Staff and also great Bar Service.,5,2024,03,09
250,"Really nice hotel, 10/10! Will be back!","We arrived on the morning of Saturday the 24th, we asked the lovely staff for an early check-in. The staff on the front desk were very helpful and courteous on check-in. The room was very clean, comfortable and the perfect temperature. The bathroom had a great sized bath and a separate shower. 

Before we went out in the evening we went down to the bar for food and a few drinks. The food was very tasty and portion size was more than enough.  Breakfast in the morning was very fresh and a great selection.

All in All my stay at the Crowne plaza was very enjoyable and would recommend to all. Looking forward to staying again.",5,2024,03,09
250,Lovely hotel - great for airport and city stays,"Stayed here while attending a concert in the 3arena recently. The hotel is lovely and all the staff were really friendly and attentive. The rooms are lovely with very comfortable beds and furnishings.

We had club lounge access with my IHG membership and attended both during the day and during the evening drinks time and got fantastic service with drinks replenished regularly by a very friendly and attentive server. A couple of snacks available during the day time to accompany the soft drinks and tea/coffee would be the only enhancement to the offering I would recommend.

We ate in the bar and received fantastic service and enjoyed some excellently prepared cocktails where the waitress even checked to see if they were to our liking shortly after we had our first taste - this was a lovely touch and shows a real passion for ensuring customer satisfaction - I believe her name was Anna Marie (I think). She was brilliant.

The reception team were very welcoming when we arrived and acknowledged my IHG diamond status and offered accompanying benefit amenities. They remembered when we were checking out that we had attended a concert the previous night and asked how it was, I thought this was a nice touch!

A great hotel and another great reflection of the Tifco Hotel group and a great hotel in the Crowne Plaza IHG collection.",5,2024,03,06
250,The best hotel in Dublin you need to stay here,Such a great hotel filled with amazing people. I can't recommend this hotel enough. If you're staying in Dublin or utilising the airport near by then you NEED to stay here. From the reception team to the room to the bar everything was first class treatment. A special mention to the General manager Magda and the deputy Aga for their help with everything.,5,2024,03,05

Обнимаю всех и очень скучаю по вам.",5,2024,03,01
250,Stay before you fly!,"Stayed for one night with my Fiancé. We were travelling to Barcelona on an early morning flight & thought the hotel would be handier instead of the drive from Belfast. 
Checkin/Arrival was great. No queues. Staff lovely - very accommodating. Informing us on different aspects of the hotel. 
Upgraded us to the club lounge floor. We availed of the happy hour, 5.30-7.30. Unlimited drinks, wine, beer, west coast coolers etc and snacks. 
We used the lounge throughout the night for soft drinks in our room. 
The staff had very kindly left a cute 'happy anniversary' card in our room, with chocolates/drinks. Such a lovely touch. 
The room comfortable. Bed was good. Tv had all channels/smart options available. 
The lobby bar had a great atmosphere. A lot of people enjoying drinks/food. 
We grabbed some breakfast snacks in the lunge the next morning before getting the shuttle to the airport. Shuttle runs every 30mins. 
Would defs stay here again.",5,2024,02,28
250,Excellent!,"Great hotel. Lovely decor and very comfortable bedrooms. Excellent restaurant with good choice of dishes.
Shuttle bus from/to the airport.
I will certainly stay here again as each time I stay here it is a very good experience.",5,2024,02,15
250,Great place to stay,"Very nice, clean and large rooms. Very comfortable with all amenities.  Restaurant had good food selection. Heating system was quiet and efficient. I will recommend. There is a shuttle that takes you  to it from the airport. I did not try the breakfast.",4,2024,02,08
250,A 10 out of 10 Luxury Stay,"My Wife and I stayed overnight unexpectedly due to a storm. What a great decision. This hotel stands out from the rest. Everything about it was first class.
Condition, opulent, spacious rooms, Club Lounge, bar meal, breakfast. All superb, and did I mention free parking.

The star of the show was Beatrice on reception. What a welcome. She was perfect. A considerate and genuinely friendly lady who made us feel special. A fantastic introduction to this hotel was Beatrice. Take a bow !",5,2024,01,28
250,Lovely stay,"We stayed for one night as were due to have an early start in the Sports Clinic the next day.  Sofia and James in Reception were so welcoming and friendly, and James really went the extra mile to make sure our stay would be as comfortable as possible - thank you James!
We ate in the bar and the food was nice, the service was excellent.
Well done to all the team in the Crowne Plaza Santry.  We could see it is a very well-run establishment and staff training obviously focuses on customer satisfaction.

If we were to find any fault it would be that the shower was not great in the bathroom and the water was not very hot, but the bedroom was lovely.

We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2024,01,17
250,One night stay,"A stayed one night on my way to galway. The crown plaza is besides the Holiday Inn, I don't see the difference, parking garage € 10.= is also available. Room is very nice, spacious and cozy, bed is perfect, clean, bath is clean, internet is fast and stable. Breakfast large, staff very friendly.",4,2024,01,14
250,A wonderful stay.....,"Dublin is one of our fave cities in the world, spending a night here before we ventured into the city was a wonderful experience, the room was lovely, we especially enjoyed the club lounge.

A special mention to  three staff members who really are a credit to the hotel.

Firstly, Liam - your fabulous coach driver. He treated us so well, was incredibly friendly and helpful - even helping us with our luggage when we pulled up to the hotel - we were the only passengers on that trip and felt particularly special!

Secondly, Sofia on the front desk - what a wonderful welcome to the hotel - friendly, knowledgeable, open and charming - and efficient at making the nuts and bolts, the basics of check-in just happen.

Finally, Elizabeth, also on the front desk who looked after us on the morning of our departure.  There were a couple of hiccups with the stay and our sleep was not great, but she took it all onboard and treated us to a breakfast - which was a great, in salubrious surrounds and a glorious welcome back to Ireland.

Issues with a stay become irrelevant when a staff member goes out of their way to make you feel good again.

We finished the stay with a drink at the bar, the staff were friendly and accommodating. I find the best accolade, is would you return, simple, yes we would.",5,2024,01,12
250,"Good hotel, let down in places","The hotel has had a bit of a renovation since I last stayed and it was very nice, particularly the bedrooms. I had been upgraded to a Club Lounge room but the lounge was closed which was a shame. Even worse was there was nothing in lieu of that  - as a top tier Diamond I got one drink token as a thank you.  Not the hotels fault but IHG fall way behind the competition with recognition for their elite members and I certainly didn’t feel like one at this hotel.

Check in and check out we’re both slow - not sure if it was staff members or the system but it was quite painful! The room was lovely, the bathroom a little dates but the shower was good, along with the hairdryer.  There were sockets by the bed.  The room had noise from the corridor - doors banging - until quite late - I supposed to be expected at an airport hotel but still annoying.

I ate in the restaurant and there was a good choice - staff were a little over keen to serve - I think because it was quiet.  The ‘free’ wine for being a Diamond member was ‘accidentally’ added to the bill but removed quickly when I pointed out the error. 

Overall the hotel has potential but falls a little short of it at the moment. I may return, not sure.",4,2023,12,28
250,Very disappointed,We have just arrived at this hotel to spend the night before our flight in the morning. We booked a Club Lounge room so that we could avail of the complementary snacks and drinks this evening. When we checked in the receptionist told us that the Club lounge is closed! As it’s the ‘holidays’! We are so disappointed and we drove down early to enjoy the so called Club Lounge! We are so sorry that we didn’t book a hotel closer to the airport as it would have been cheaper! They have given us complementary breakfast but it doesn’t make up for no Club Lounge this evening!! I don’t think we will return to this hotel nor recommend it!,2,2023,12,27
250,Another pleasant stay near Dublin Airport,"Recently we had reason look for accommodation on Christmas night near Dublin Airport. We were fortunate enough to chance upon the Crowne Plaza as rooms in the area were in short supply. The hotel is a fairly modern building situated on a quiet private road in Santry about a couple of miles South of the airport. We parked in the adjacent multi-story. Staff members in the spacious reception area were pleasant and helpful. We were allocated a room at the front of the hotel on the second floor (lift available!).
First impressions - our room had modern décor in excellent condition, was of a good size with an en-suite which had a bath as well as a shower. The TV had many channels and was larger than that of lots of other establishments we have stayed in. An electric trouser press, a safe for valuables and a minifridge were provided. The bed was a large double (two linked singles) and from it we had a good view of the Santry parkland across the road. We slept well and next morning we enjoyed a plenteous buffet continental breakfast (we had been e-mailed re. the absence of “normal” hot breakfast facilities due to the kitchen being closed for the St. Stephens’ Day holiday). 
The hotel is nicely decorated, staff are both pleasant and helpful. Although we did not avail of it, there is a shuttle bus service to the airport.  All in all, I would have no hesitation in going back to the Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport.
",5,2023,12,27
250,Pleasant stay.,"Stayed here early December on business as an alternative to staying in Dublin City centre or Blanchardstown. The hotel is modern and welcoming and my room on the club floor was comfortable and a good size. The club lounge was great for a light breakfast however I can’t comment on evening social as I didn’t use at night. Parking was right beside hotel just as you pass Hol Inn Express. 
Would certainly use again.",5,2023,12,20
250,Very disappointed restaurant customer,"I visited the restaurant on December 12 2023 and asked if the beef for the burgers was ground on the premises which legally allows them to serve a rare grilled burger. Despite my repeated requested (and to be fair Ana the waitress was very helpful but powerless to do anything) I was told that the kitchen was too busy to satisfy my request and was refused.
As a platinum elite member, in fact just as a customer, I am disappointed that my easy-to-satisfy request couldn’t be accommodated.
I shall try a different establishment that is more accommodating in future and I recommend customers visiting the hotel to do similar in future if this is how customers are treated.",1,2023,12,12
250,WHAT A STAY,"This is one beautiful hotel especially the staff and one person we would like to mention is Elizabeth who was very thoughtful as my wife had a terrible flu and all she wanted to do was rest, we arrive at midday the room was ready so we were able to check in very quickly.
We had a knock on the door and to our lovely surprise scones with tea and a hot lemon drink, it was delicious, the small things are so very appreciative.
We will highly recommend your hotel, than you all.
",5,2023,12,06
250,Comfortable experience!,"Shout out to Ana in the kitchen on my Bfast, Sandra serving me drinks in the lounge & Maria for her good service on my room! & all the ladies on reception, Enjoyed my trip! Will be back next year :) boraaaa oussss :)",5,2023,12,04
250,The best customer service and lovely Club Lounge,"Very welcoming and efficient check-in, thank you to Celia. Even called when we were in the room to make sure everything was as expected. 
Club Lounge lovely and comfortable, great canapés and excellent service from Sandra who couldn’t have been more attentive and helpful. Can’t wait to come back. ",5,2023,12,03
250,Fine and some things could be improved,"Accommodation : I feel the accommodation could be improve in luxury rooms. As I see in the bathroom you don't have shower with handle but only fixed shower in both bath tubs and standing bath area. 

Toilet : There is no Toilet cleaning brush once we use it. This could be improved

Food and serving : It was actually good and the service was perfect made by  SARA. ",3,2023,12,02
250,Good service.,"I had a wonderful experience at your hotel, concierge was very courteous and professional. Checked me in and out quickly and efficiently, and also answered all my questions and requests promptly and politely. 

I want to thank Sara for the excellent service she provided during my breakfast. She was always  helpful. ",5,2023,12,02
250,"Clean, friendly and just nice. ","We had such amazing time and the hotel was very nicely kept up.  Upon arrival, Beatriz checked us in and was very polite and friendly.   She upgraded us to a room and room was very clean.   She’s got excellent manners and is very knowledgable about customer service.   Elizabeth also helped us out and was very thorough with what we needed.   Well done to the management and staff.  I will def recommend this hotel to my friends.   ",5,2023,11,15
250,Very enjoyable experiences,"Perfect location. Opposite there is a nice park for a walk. Airport and car rental about 10 minutes away by car.  City center can be reached directly by bus (16, 41).  Bus station nearby, 5 minutes on foot. Nice spacious rooms with shower and bathroom. The beds are A1 and I slept really well. Nice bar and restaurant. Irish breakfast buffet with a large selection.

The staff at the check-in counter were always super friendly and helpful. I would particularly like to mention Mr Alisson. In general, the hotel staff was extremely pleasant.

Conclusion: I felt very comfortable.  Will check in at Crown Plaza, Dublin Airport again on my next trip to Ireland.",5,2023,11,13
250,Great airport hotel with lovely restaurant,The hotel is in a great location and if has a complimentary shuttle bus to the airport that runs all day. Restaurant is lovely. Nice food and our waitress Aga was so friendly and did an amazing job looking after us.,5,2023,11,11
250,Excellent Hotel with airport shuttle - will stay again,"Super Hotel, great bedroom, friendly and very helpful staff, wonderful breakfast. This hotel is situated very conveniently for Dublin Airport. It is spacious and the rooms are large and extremely clean. I would highly recommend this hotel and especially if you are flying in or out of Dublin.",5,2023,11,10
250,Very welcoming,"I recommend this hotel for the cleanliness, the friendliness of the staff and for the good food we ate.  I send a warm hug to Mr. Aidas for how kind and polite he was with us.  I think he is one of the most useful on the staff.  See you soon",5,2023,11,10
250,Club lounge experience,Experience in the club lounge was exceptional. Was made to feel like home from home especially with the fantastic service provided by Leisl. Can't speak highly enough of her infectious attitude. Absolutely delighted with my stay.,5,2023,11,08
250,Great hotel!,"Value for money 100% The rooms are clean & functional. The shower is one of the best ever - love it! The service was fantastic. Aidas can recommend good Whiskey if you are new to Irish stuff. Even though we didn't take the breakfast there, we were able to enjoy coffee at Inca coffee shop. About 3min walk to bus stop, very well located. The park is on your doorstep - great if you want to go for a jog.",5,2023,11,08
250,Comfortable Stay with Great Cocktails and Service,"A very nice hotel overall. My room was excellent, and the service at the Cinnabar was exceptional - kudos to Aidas for the great cocktails. The breakfast was delicious. My only minor issue was the mattress, which could've been more comfortable. Nonetheless, I would definitely choose to stay here again.",5,2023,11,07
250,Very comfortable stay in a welcoming hotel.,"Very comfortable room, bed and chair, very friendly welcome 
Courtesy bus from airport is great 
Lovely breakfast. Wide choice of hot and cold food. 
Spacious reception. Convenient for where I visit for work. Decent Guinness

Only minor observation that is not totally positive is that the food available in the evening is kind of not bar food or restaurant it’s in between. Needs a bit more choice. 

Great value overall. 

Thank you .",5,2023,11,06
250,Return to Crowne Plaza Santry,We have just returned to the Crowne Plaza Santry since  covid shutdown . We used to do 2 trade shows a year here and the staff were fantastic. Four years later we return and happily quite a lot of the staff are still here. We felt like royalty when we came in all the old guard remembered us even remembering our names. The standard of service is fantastic. Nothing and i mean is too much trouble for any of them  The hotel has had a bit of a facelift  and is immaculate   From the moment we entered the hotel i felt i was back home.  Got to be one of the best hotels in Dublin. The management should pat all the staff on the back  and say well done   Thank you for a brilliant stay,5,2023,11,06
250,My Preferred Choice for Business Trips in Dublin,"This 4-star hotel excels at the essentials, and the warm service with a smile and a chat from Aidas and Rejis made my business trip truly exceptional. The dinner menu, although limited, is impressively well-done; I particularly enjoyed the delicious burger (and the option for a side salad instead of fries was 'no problem'). They offer healthy breakfast choices, a central location, secure parking, and reliable internet access, making it my top choice when I'm in Dublin.",5,2023,11,06
250,Great experience in Dublin,Everything was perfect! Thanks to the receptionist Allison we have had solved all boubts about our staying in Dublin! The bed was incredibly comfortable and the breackfast amazing. So it has been a great experience thanks to Crowne Plaza hotel!,5,2023,11,05
250,Excellent experience,"It is a new and functional structure. very modern and full of useful services. well located, close to the airport and well connected. the staff is very kind and professional. I remember Mr. Aidas, very good and expert in welcoming the public.",5,2023,11,03
250,Great Service,"From check in to checkout everything was perfect. Very pleasant and helpful staff throughout the hotel. Mariann in the bar restaurant was exceptionally  helpful. The restaurant and bar were very busy yet she found a table for 9 of us. Service throughout the evening was on time, efficient and friendly. She offered advice on the menu which was accurate. Altogether a pleasant experience.",5,2023,11,03
250,Unforgettable Hotel Experience,"I haven't felt this comfortable in a hotel for a while.  Everything was exceptional, from the extremely friendly staff to the great tasteful design and delicious food.  I can't forget the extraordinary cocktails prepared by Aidas, he in particular is an excellent person and really useful for the work and commitment he puts in as Rejis.  Whether you are traveling for business or pleasure, I highly recommend this hotel for a comfortable, refined and hassle-free stay.",5,2023,11,01
250,very nice :)),The Aidas has a pleasant personality ...it quietly makes you feel like you are staying with an entertaining friend. The local neighbourhood and Park is also quite safe and enjoyable to explore. The hotel bar also feels very welcoming and high-class. Will stay again when visiting Dublin.,5,2023,10,30
250,"Good restaurant, great service ",We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and the service was amazing. We were served by Mariann and she was great to us. The food we had was also good. We think it will be better though if they add more items into the menu.,4,2023,10,27
250,Reliability great stay here,"I’ve stayed at the Crowne Plaza at DUB six times this year and each time has been lovely. Checking in and out is easy and the staff are welcoming. 

The rooms are spacious and clean and the rooms are a decent size. Importantly the beds are comfy and there’s virtually no noise if you have a street view. The street view also gives a look over a nearby park.

Food and service in the restaurant are of a high standard. I’ve been served dinner ( and a pint) a couple of times by a very friendly and competent waitperson, Aga. The dinner menu is broad and includes a set of vegan options. Breakfast is sumptuous! Lots of choices. 

There’s a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes from/to the airport. It’s always been on time. ",5,2023,10,27
250,Convenient and well appointed,Convenient and well appointed - great choice for an overnight before an early flight- airport shuttle is easy and frequent- highly recommend if you need to be close to airport either coming in or going out of Dublin- restaurant on sight if needed,5,2023,10,26
250,Agnieszka was Amazing,"We came into town for the Navy-Notre Dame football game. The first two nights we stayed at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport. The breakfast was excellent and in particular, Agnieszka was the barista and she made an awesome latte! She was very friendly and I ended up going back for one more, plus another the next day too. She also gave good ideas on what to see. Thank you Agnieszka for helping make the stay memorable!",5,2023,10,24
250,Overnight stay to catch a flight,"Not much going on here. Paper thin walls and quite noisy. I was on top floor in Halcyon suite. Room was okay. Nothing spectacular. I will say the hallways smell very chemically due to their cleaning. 

Lounge is abysmal. Dark, uninviting, and the allowance of outside food enables the riff raff to camp out and ruin the experience for others.  Beer and wine only. 

Check in the staff is too chatty and ignores their job. Room keys were not coded which is a massive peeve of mine. 

Food was bland and after a few bites, a bit boring. This area really needs improvement. Also the menu is quite limited in my opinion",3,2023,10,23
250,Great airport hotel - Dublin,"We stay here every time we have an early flight out of Dublin airport.  It is convenient and the have shuttles every 30 minutes 24 hour a day.

Rooms are modern, clean and comfortable.

Tonight we ate in the restaurant.  Not extensive menu, but our choices we excellent

Aga was our server.  She was very pleasant and attentive.  I knocked over a glass and she was to the rescue in seconds, and with good humor.

",5,2023,10,22
250,"Clean, Friendly and a Good Location","I have stayed at this hotel each time I visit Dublin for a number of years now and have found it to be friendly and accommodating. It is spotlessly clean, and they have recently refurbished it. It is also a great location, especially if you are traveling to and
from Airport. Good food in Cinnabar, my favorite Singapore noodles still on Menu
Aidas knows what I will order straight away, no questions asked.",5,2023,10,22
250,Do not book through IHG,"First of all I would say make sure to book this hotel through a booking site, I thought incorrectly that booking direct through IHG would (as advertised) be the cheapest, it ended up costing me more than €90 more for a one night stay, after that you cannot get a cancellation refund! The common areas feel more like a cheap cafe or an airport lounge than a €270 a night hotel, the staff are friendly and helpful but the food is average at best, breakfast was poor. The room was ok but felt dated, I have stayed in much better hotels for much less money, I would advise picking a different hotel maybe closer to Dublin and having a slightly longer journey into the airport.",2,2023,10,22
250,Great service from Jomet!,"Jomet was a GREAT server and we loved our meals! I had the green Thai curry, my wife had the sirloin steak and both were delicious. Jomet brought me a Guinness very promptly and then another just in time!",5,2023,10,21
250,The art of customer service is alive here!!,"We had stayed here both the night of October 10, as well as October 18.

On our first stay, we had a room that had some ""olfactory issues"".  But we had arrived so late, and we were so exhausted, we did not say anything until we checked out early in the morning.

The gentleman behind the desk (I have to guess a Manager?) offered us food and wanted to clearly ""make it right"".  We wanted nothing in exchange but requested that perhaps when we returned the following week, a quick check of the room could be made so that a repeat experience would not be had.

Upon our second check-in, we found that we had been upgraded to Club level.  The room was clearly refurbished recently.  Everything was clean and in excellent working condition!  This room also had a separate bath and shower.  

In addition, we had been comped breakfast as well!  

It's worth pointing out that we requested none of this.  This was all done via this gentleman's initiative!  Needless to say, our second experience was extremely positive, and I think it's fair to say negated our first experience!

We would certainly consider a return stay at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport if back in Ireland again!  I wish there was a way that we could capture this level of customer service in the U.S.!  His conscientious efforts and thoughtfulness not only saved us.  But has us thinking that if we have to spend the night in the airport here again, we'd certainly not hesitate to stay again!  ",4,2023,10,21
250,Thank you Aga,"Delicious food and excellent service from Aga. 
She was able to share the vegetarian options and offered us tasters of the beers we weren’t familiar with. 
Nothing was too much trouble. 
The large platter was excellent, the soup and chicken burger delicious too.",5,2023,10,20
250,Overpriced for stay,"Friendly courteous staff very dirty in places foyer etc bath plug detached no conditioner in shower
No restaurant open only bar food excellent customer service very good 
Prompt service food and drink. Reasonably priced for dublin",3,2023,10,20
250,Brilliant hotel and excellent staff and food,"Fantastic hotel. Very high standards and the food is delicious. Cannot recommend enough. The staff are so helpful and friendly. Will never stay anywhere else now whilst in Dublin. 
Agnieszta who I met at the coffee bar is so lovely and helpful. Had to give her a shout out!",5,2023,10,20
250,"Great Hotel! Staff are lovely, Shuttles Are Fast & Frequent ","The hotels great, i’ve stayed in a number of hotels around Dublin Airport over the past few months and Crown Plaza is by far the best! 
The hotel facilities and decor is modern and fresh, staff are lovely and will do anything to ensure you have the best stay! I use the fast, free shuttles to the airport and Florin is one of the team of airport shuttle drivers and is lovely, always greets with a smile and makes enjoyable conversation between the airport and hotel and it just sets the stay apart from other hotels and shuttles i’ve used. Always helps passengers with bags and is a credit to Crown Plaza Dublin Airport. 
Highly recommend a stay here. ",5,2023,10,19
250,Perfect for families.,Everything was perfect. Aidas was extremely friendly and helpful in particular. Can recommend for families! Good kids menu maybe more Gluten free options for kids would be nice.The location is very prime as it is very close to Dublin Center 15-20 min by Bus. Nice Park outside Hotel good for a walk.,5,2023,10,19
250,The best stay in my life.,"This is the best stay in my life…everything was 10 of10 . And for sure I will visit again ♥ ️ The staff was great and kind and smiling and helpful.

250,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff.","One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in Dublin with the friendliest and most helpful staff.

Nice Chat with Aidas and best Cocktails especially classic Cosmo.",5,2023,10,18
250,"Lobby restaurant - good food, nice atmosphere ","Once  checked in, I ate in the lobby restaurant. After a long day of traveling. It was the best meal - delicious burger and glass of Cabernet.

250,Great Hotel,"The hotel has everything we need: a good connection and a beautiful view. The open buffet was great, the food was very good. Aidas and the others did a very good job at assisting us with what we needed and were very respectful. Pleasure to stay in lovely hotel.",5,2023,10,17
250,Stay at Northwood Crowne Plaza,"Hotel is excellent in so many ways, I stay here most weeks except when they’re full! I’m working on my own and the staff always make me feel welcome, always want to ensure my stay is as good as it can be. The rooms are good standard, food very good, plenty to choose at breakfast too! I was compelled to make this review as a member of staff. Aidas is consistently so good in the restaurant, can’t do enough for the customers, welcoming, hard working etc. There is no question that the Crowne Plaza team at this hotel is what makes the difference as I’ve stayed in others and this is by far the best one I’ve stayed in!",5,2023,10,17
250,Quality Choice Hotel at Airport ,"We were very pleased with our stay at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport. The convenient proximity to the airport and the shuttle were the reasons we booked here but we were very pleased with the quality of the service, super friendly reception and restaurant/bar staff and the whole ambiance and the quality of our room and bath. We enjoyed dinner and drinks at the restaurant/bar. On each floor they have a hospitality room for the guests so you can go and socialize there, there are lounge chairs, courtesy snacks and drinks, a work space and this is where we enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast before we caught our early morning shuttle to the airport. Breakfast choices were varied and plentiful and delicious. Would highly recommend! Thanks! ",5,2023,10,16
250,Last night in Ireland ,Reception was great.  I was greeted by name and thanked for my  IHG membership.  Ate very good food at hotel restaurant for dinner.  Our waitress Aga was attentive and very sweet!  Great choice of accommodations for my entire family.,5,2023,10,15
250,Friendly staff,"We had an amazing experience at the Crowne Plaza Dublin. The staff were all very
friendly and welcoming. A special mention to Aidas who couldn’t do enough to help

enjoyed a couple hours. Would definitely come back in the future.",5,2023,10,15
250,A calm and peaceful restaurant with amazing staff," Crowne Plaza is easy to access with a shuttle bus.
Whenever I travel for business I used to prefer long stays here. Peaceful stay and
quiet environment with a nice park beside.

customer service, like Aidas is so helpful, he is an asset for your company. Keep up
the good work you guys are doing.",5,2023,10,15
250,Dull business trip made awesome by this fantastic hotel ,"As a business traveller I have used many hotels but none compare to the Crowne Plaza here in Santry. On entering the foyer first thing I noticed was the magnificent fish tank filled with exotic fish. A gentleman called Marcus assisted with my checkin and was a very informative knowledgeable and polite. I was pleased to hear this hotel has it own gym which Marcus told me about on checkin. My room was well equipped and nicely styled. The King size bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in and the blackout curtain were a godsend. Cleaning staff were available every morning and were always willing to service my room even at short notice. Extensive selection of breakfast items available each morning and a small coffee shop here too with sofa seating providing yet more comfort. During my stay, my company,  made a error with my room extension which was swiftly sorted by Liam at the from desk. I should also mention the other wonderful staff there at the front desk. Always smiling and eager to work to make the stay best it can be. Can't wait for my next trip to Dublin so I can stay here again.",5,2023,10,15
250,Ana & Jasmine,The staff are amazing really well trained and easy to talk to. The food was really nice and well cooked. Special mention to the chefs. The management should be very pleased and proud of this bar. I hear it was built by a donegal man. Tell Mary I said hi.,5,2023,10,14
250,Jasmine & Ana,"Stopped by on my travels to see the new bar, really modern and cozy atmosphere. 12/10 food. Special mention to the chefs. Small hello to HR, the fabulous GM &Deputy GM, and the Sales department. Will be back sometime soon. Best of luck for Christmas.",5,2023,10,14

250,First visit at Crown Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport,"Hotel has a shuttle from airport so very convenient. Flight delayed, I arrived at hotel at 4 AM but they were nice enough to provide a later check out. They did not find my reservation and maybe the fact that the Holiday Express reservation was switched to Crown Plaza but unacceptable. Not hot water the next morning as they forgot to tell us that they had work done the previous day therefore no shower. Ended up to the Maanager which was very pleasant and helpful.",2,2023,10,04
250,Good Hotel ,"The hotel in itself is excellent and conveniently located very close to Airport just 10 minutes drive. Hotel has complementary airport shuttle every 30 minutes which is an added advantage. The rooms are very spacious well fitted and decorated. Bathroom is quite big with a separte tub and shower enclosure 
Everything is plus about the hotel the VERY BIG NEGATIVE for us was the toilet was not having hot water there seems to be some problem with supply system. The hot water was just trickling in shower enclosure and absolutely no hot water at wash basin or tub. Both me and my wife somehow took bath with this trickling hot water as we were to take a flight at 7.30 am. 
Hope Hotel House Keeping and maintenance people shall look into the problem. ",3,2023,10,04

Everyone was extremely nice and there where many little touches that made our stay enjoyable and relaxing.  We stayed at many hotels and this is one is rank one of the top on the list.  There is a park right across the street.  Restaurants are limited outside of the hotel  if you are walking but there is a restaurant on site on the property.

Our server, Mariann—who was from Hungary and has been living in Ireland for 17 yrs— made the experience 10 stars!  She was so friendly and patient.  She took the time to explain to us about the malt vinegar we had been seeing on every table at every Irish establishment—it’s for the French fries.  The vegan soup of the day was fantastic and very flavorful!  The homemade  Irish soda bread was so good I wanted more!  My husband got the fisherman’s platter!  Delicious!",5,2023,09,20
250,Great hotel,Hotel was comfortable and clean. Breakfast was very good and the selection was great. The club lounge was relaxing and Liesl the hostess was superb. She went above and beyond to explain the food and drinks. Would stay there again if we are in Dublin. ,5,2023,09,18

We had dinner later on in the evening a great choice and excellent staff. 
Upon our return to the hotel we were greeted by Nazareth and Elizabeth, upgraded to the Club Floor, Amazing staff and great place to relax and the view just was perfect, we did not have breakfast as our flight was early, we had two breakfast ordered upon our departure. we will highly recommend this Crowne Plaza, we hope tp  return in the near future. 
",5,2023,09,18
250,An Unexpected and Pleasant Surprise,"I usually have low expectations for airport hotels, so our experience at  the Crown Plaza Dublin Airport hotel was a lovely surprise.  It is about a 20 minute drive from the airport, but provides free shuttle service.  Check in was quick and pleasant. The hotel restaurant had a limited menu, but the food was well prepared and tasty.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The rooms were lovely with good beds and plenty of room.  ",5,2023,09,15
250,Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport is exceptional!,"After almost two weeks of heavy travel itineraries through Tuscany, a stopover at the Dublin Airport Crowne Plaze was just the perfect respite.

We're now well rested for our long flight back to the west coast of Canada. ",5,2023,09,13
250,2 very different stays,"We stayed at both ends of our holiday and youd think we were in different hotels, our experience was so different. 
Firat time, we checked in quite late, staff were lovely,  friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a Club room which was fabulous. The bed and bedding were amazing and were similar to our experience at Croen Plaza in Singapore Airport. It felt like sleeping on a cloud. I slept so well,I actually said I always wanted to sleep there... I should have kept that to myself.
On our return, I was looking forward to staying. I wasnt expecting an upgrade, butI wa as expecting a similar standard of bed and bedding.  The room was fine, if a little basic but the bed was one of the worst we slept in during our time in Ireland. We hadnt had dinner the first night so no comparison but it was expensive and ok. 
So, definitely stay in a club room if you need to stay here but give the other rooms a miss. ",3,2023,09,12

250,Outstanding Club Room and Breakfast.,"We stayed here one night and both my wife and I rated our experience outstanding, including the room, breakfast and the club room.  And there is a public park across from the hotel.

We have just started staying with IHG properties.  So, I don’t know why we were given access to the Club.  Liesl, the lady running the Club is outstanding.  She delights in helping people.

And the breakfast, just simply lavish quality and choices.  All types of fruits, breads, meats, pastries, cheese, breads, eggs, etc.  

The staff was helpful and friendly across the entire property.

Yes, we would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2023,09,12
250,Nice business stay,"I stayed here in business recently and it is a very nice hotel.  The location to Dublin airport is great and the room was very large.  Even though there was an event on, there was very little noise in the room.  There is on site parking and the staff were very helpful and nice to deal with…would certainly stay again!",4,2023,09,11
250,"I was just a quick visit to the restaurant for some food drink, the duration was about 2hr and very nice food/service","The food was very nice, but the best part of the experience was the service, we were served by a very nice lady called Sandra, from Brazil,

250,Comfortable,"Liesl was a fantastic host in the lounge 10/10 service. Rooms comfortable and roomy, very clean n staff are 10/10 on desk. Only downside was very noisy SOME nights when there's big parties/conferences going off they seem to turn a blind eye, must be money lol but I'd give the stay 8.5 out of 10 ",5,2023,09,07
250,Fantastic club lounge & exceptional service,Fantastic staff in the club lounge (Liesl) was totally exceptional & went way beyond to make the experience so wonderful 👏🏿 . Other Crowne Plaza  staff from other locations should come here to learn how it should be done!,5,2023,09,06
250,Excellant service levels,"As a regular guest I don't complete these surveys too often, but again I have to mention the excellant service offered by Ann Maria in the bar again this evening.

250,Disappointed ,"We came to an awards ceremony in the Crown plaza, Hotel  is nice, nice rooms staff very helpful.But we paid alot for the room and the awards, We had a set menu with absolutely no choices whatsoever!  Not one glass of wine was offered with our meal, The starter was caesar salad literally consisted  of four leaves of lettuce with ten lardons the main was very poor our table were all still hungry after the main course...I understand this was a big event....But we paid alot of money for this event for which we would assume we would receive a better quality meal,and not only that every trip to the bar would take up 30 mins or more because it was so understaffed. We as a team have been to a number of these events over the past number of years and have never seen it as poor.
 Very disappointed party of ten 
Will not be returning.",1,2023,09,03

250,Not the average airport hotel service,"We arrived mid morning for an overnight transit stay. The check in staff were incredibly welcoming for what probably is to all intense and purpose a transit hotel, they were so warm and hospitable it's not the service one usually receives at airport hotels. No problem at all arriving early there was a room available and we were in in minutes. Easy access to Dublin we spent the day in the city then headed back to the hotel for drinks and canapés in the club lounge.

All staff through out all dining areas, at all times of the day for my entire 5 day stay were impeccable when it came to dietary restrictions. Chef's went above and beyond to accommodate the need to eat gluten & dairy free. Choice was plentiful, and safety concerns for celiacs meet without fault. As a celiac who travels a lot my expectations were low - my bag full of my own food, stress high when it came to buffet breakfasts. But, food came home with me, stress was eliminated when chef took time to detail how all food was made celiac safe and I enjoyed every meal. This hotel & chefs personally, should be awarded for their excellent attention to dietary needs. Highly recommend celiacs stay here!

250,Nice hotel with very good service quality and quite.,"We booked 3 rooms at Crown Plazza for me and my familly. The hotel is as usual for a Crown Plazza of excellent quality. Big rooms with good quality of beds. The hotel is located in a very calm place in front of a park (good for jogging). Lobby, restaurant and breakfirst are of high quality. We had a rooms giving inside the walls of the hotel and views where not very romantic but very quite. We would suggest rooms with view on the park.",4,2023,08,09
250,It was OK.  Not as good as we hoped ,"I have to start by saying the service from the front of house and restaurant staff was great.

However, our stay was just OK.  Unfortunately because it got off to a bad start it just left a bit of taste in the mouth for the rest of the stay and just made us that little more picky.

As a family that was arriving late into the hotel we had requested the room to be set up and paid extra for these bits.  I emailed the reservation day the day before and confirmed the room would be set up so that we could go to bed as soon as we got there.  Everything was confirmed and told room would be ready.  On checking in, again I asked and told it was all done.  I'm sure as can be guessed, the room was not set up and intact was set up for 1 person rather than a family of 4.  It meant that at 12:15 I was having to go back to reception and tell them.  As I say the Duty manager was great and very apologetic and arranged for everything to be sent up straight away.  However, this would never be that quick and it was probably half hr before everything was done.  We had to put the cot up ourselves and be aware that the hotel does not provide mattresses for the cot.  The expectation is that the baby just sleeps on the hard bottom.  We requested an extra duvet which ultimately was stained but by this stage we just wanted to go to bed.

I do appreciate this was not the night staffs fault and we never asked for anything in compensation.  The duty manager did comp us the night, which was very kind.  We just expected more from a hotel of this quality, especially when confirming the day before.  And how they can't provide mattresses for baby cots is beyond me.

Other little quirks included that rather than replacing the water you drank, they just gave you the opposite.  We had drunk all the still water and rather than replace like for like, they just replaced it with sparkling water, which we hadn't drunk one bottle of.  When we asked for some still we were told there was none on that floor.  I assume it was therefore too much effort to go to another floor to get some so everyone just got sparkling.

The breakfast was lovely and the staff great.  But the logistics of the hotel let down the stay.",3,2023,08,02
250,THANK YOU,"We arrived early from our flight, we know the room would not be ready however we had the room by 10.30am, thank you Elizabet, she organized our trip to Belfast the following day and it was a great success, we had a delicious lunch would highly recommend for everyone to eat there. ",5,2023,08,02
250,Greetings from the lounge,"We are always very well looked after in the club lounge at this Crowne Plaza, especially when Liesl is in charge. It's a good place to relax after work with beer or wine and a snack before dinner. Thanks very much.",5,2023,07,31
250,A brilliant pleasure,"Wonderful stay and definitely one of the best Crowne Plaza’s ive stayed in, we was lucky enough to stay on floor 4 which includes a free bar and nibbles from 5:30-7:30, an absolutely amazing server by the name of Liesl attended to our every need, warm welcome everytime and a brilliant smile on her face, a pleasure as always. ",5,2023,07,27
250,Best value 4 Star hotel in Dublin. ,"From booking our stay to checkout, our entire experience was excellent. This is a 4 star, airport hotel, yes... but it's park location, proximity to the city and decor that would be at home in a gorgeous boutique hotel makes for an altogether elevated experience. 

Nadia could not have done more for us when we called to book and she really set the standard from the get go. Check in was smooth and pleasant and while the room was probably one of the last ones that hasn't been renovated it was huge, clean, comfortable, stylish (maybe very slightly dated)  and had everything we could possibly need. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable, the shower pressure was good and the toiletries were all lovely. The little room snacks were also high quality and very nice. 
Every other member of staff we interacted with was extremely professional and personable, especially the waiting staff in the bar, where were had 2 very nice coffees.
The breakfast was also extremely good and checkout was quick and painless. 

A taxi to the Grafton St area will set you back about €20 and the number 16 bus goes by, just outside the park very regularly. 

The parking facilities are excellent and the airport shuttle is incredibly convenient, modern and very clean.
It's such a good all rounder. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. 
I think this is the best value 4 Star in Dublin. ",5,2023,07,27
250,Exceeded my expectations!,"Great airport hotel for early morning flight or late night arrival into Dublin!

We are so grateful for these extra touches, as they are just what our body needs before we take the long flight back home. ",5,2023,07,25

250,Cinnabar at The Crrown Plaza—fabulous!,"Beth and I dined with some fabulous company tonight at the Crown Plaza Cinnabar. 

Garlic Prawn Linguine (the basil cream sauce is insane—considered licking the bowel) and the Fish and Chips were to perfection according to my bride. 

Dessert should not be forgone: Lemon and Vanilla Cheesecake for me and Salted Caramel and Chocolate Brownie Sundae for my lady. My opinion of these desserts in one word: decadent!

If you’re visiting Ireland, I highly recommend this establishment for fine dining in a casual atmosphere—background music is at the perfect volume, telle with football playing and many conversations as well.

The staff are absolutely brilliant and accommodating—especially Samantha, our server.",5,2023,07,18
250,Crown Plaza Dublin Airport - Mariann and Esteban gave great service,We spent 12 days in Ireland. Our last stop before heading home was the Crown Plaza Dublin Airport. Everyone in Ireland are so friendly and polite. The last meal was at the bar in the Crown Plaza where we were served by a wonderful woman named Mariann. She was so delightful. She also had a specific drink made by Esteban which was just as I had ordered. A margarita made just like back home in Texas. It was great. Please let them both know how they made our last day in Ireland special to remember. Bob and Jenny,5,2023,07,18
250,Quiet Airport Hotel - with great staff.,"We stayed at this hotel i. the last night of our Irish Vacation adventure. Nice hotel, clean rooms, separate shower and tub was great. Front desk staff were helpful even with bus instructions on how to get to central Dublin. 

The Cinnabar (i think that’s what it was called) had a great food and was able to accommodate our gluten free request easily. Our waitress Samantha was extremely attentive , friendly and helpful with all of our inquiries about the various dishes. (management, you need to hold on to her)

Free Airport shuttle every 30 minutes going directly from the hotel to both Terminal 2 and 1. Spot 16 for pickup.

250,"Great hotel and service, club access is A+","Great amenities, service and wonderful staff. The food and the service is top notch throughout the whole hotel. The front desk was exceptional with offering umbrellas and exchanging US dollars for coin for transit—Macarina was her name :)

The Club was high end with great food and drink options. Liesl was fantastic providing great service and helped us with planning our transit journey. She served us great drinks and promptly took care of us—great employee!

As a platinum member, I was upgraded to a corner hotel room, super nice views and room amenities. I’ll be back :)

Local transit is a 3 min walk from the hotel door on a private road—quiet with a park across the street.",5,2023,07,16

250,Top class hotel🌟,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. I stayed here a few times and have never been disappointed! Rooms are super clean and extremely comfortable. Top class staff and service. Great choice on the menu and food is amazing, one of the nicest meals I’ve had in a long time! Cocktails made to order in the bar - absolute art! (See pictures!!). Special mention to John for looking after us in the restaurant.

250,Couldn’t be happier to be back,"When I knew I was returning to Dublin for work I asked to stay at the Crown Plaza in Santry. Its been five months since my last visit and upon walking into the restaurant for dinner, I was greeted by Anna Maria, the very same host who took care of me in the business lounge.  As I expressed confusion about my wine for dinner, she offered a taste, suggested a meal choice, and continuously checked on me and all the other guests in the restaurant.  I can honestly say my stay in the hotel just got better.  Between being treated to Anna Maria’s hospitality, seeing Agniascia from the coffee shop and the staff who remembered me, my stay has been enhanced.  I was starting to think that this trip would not be as memorable in comparison to my other experience, but today at dinner, I can honestly say I’m looking forward to seeing Anna Maria and the familiar faces for the remainder of my stay.  Thanks so much!!!",5,2023,07,07
250,Comfortable stay in a very nice hotel.,"I cant fault this hotel for our one night stay. There is a car park next door which is covered by getting your ticket swiped by reception. We had a complimentary upgrade and had two lovely, spacious and comfortable rooms. Both rooms had comfortable beds and pillow, tea and coffee making, fridge and good tv. The bathrooms were spacious and had good showers. It was very quiet at night. We had our evening meal in the hotel and again had great service and good food, as was the same position with breakfast. Staff on reception and in the restaurant were friendly and welcoming. We had a very comfortable stay and would recommend.",5,2023,07,04
250,Wonderful stay!,"The stay was wonderful. It is a beautiful property. Beautiful lobby and rooms are comfy. We had the best breakfast at this hotel. We were in Europe for about a little over two weeks and I am a big breakfast eater, so in my opinion this hotel had the best breakfast. A special shout out to the staff- Andreea and Yasmina for taking care of me and my family. The staff was very attentive. They knew there was 4 of us for breakfast but only I showed up and asked if I would like a tray for the room which no other hotel had done so! Andreea brought me a tray and helped me get ready to take it. Another shout out to the housekeeping staff for cleaning our room and keeping it freeh- Ravith and Siyo(spelling?). If there was a category for giving it 4.5, i would rate it 4.5 was because there was one night we requested water for the room and it never came. My husband eventually got frustrated and went and got it himself. Otherwise the stay was near perfect! Thank you!",5,2023,06,30
250,Crowne Plaza restaurant,"Our waitress, Mariann, was very funny and kind to our party. She took our order in a timely manner. 
The chicken strips and sweet potato fries were delicious and quick, and the drinks were delicious - great stop! ",5,2023,06,30
250,Top Class Service,"Had an excellent stay at this hotel.
My wife cut her leg on the bed and we were given excellent treatment By Jack Keating the reservation manager.  He offered to help dress the wound but I had already done it.
He gave us complimentary drinks and car parking.
We had already been upgraded prior to our arrival.
Andreea was also very helpful and attentive the in the lounge and at breakfast.
Both members of staff were a credit to your company.
Would not hesitate to stay again or recommend the hotel to friends

250,Our stay was a 10 out of 10!!,"Our experience was a 10 out of 10! Check-in was efficient and the person checking us in had the best personality. I wish I could remember her name. We ate at the hotel restaurant and the food was surprisingly excellent. My husband and daughter shared the meat platter. There was a generous amount of food. They were happily stuffed at the end of their meal. I had the vegan grilled vegetable pesto bowl which was also great. Our server, Mariann was delightful!! The rooms are wonderfully clean and well appointed. I’m tired after all this writing, so off for a good night’s sleep in the comfy bed. My husband, daughter, and I highly recommend staying at the Dublin Airport Crowne Plaza. ",5,2023,06,17

250,Great service at the Crowne Plaza,"Just wanted to thank the team at Crowne plaza for their excellent service and a very special thanks to Liesl for the warm welcome and conversation in the the lounge on the 4th floor. She is a credit to Crowne plaza and should be applaud. She remember me and my absent friends (on this visit) from previous trips, it's details like this that site her apart. Thank you",5,2023,06,12
250,Nice Renovations,"Nice renovations since the last time I stayed.  The bed was much better, although I wish the room had been cooler.

I'm amazed at the 5-star ratings of the breakfast at this property. They had very limited choices for a vegan or vegetarian -- no vege sausages?   Really?  It was okay, but certainly not in any way outstanding.  However, I was able to find vege sausages at the 51st & Green lounge in the airport.

I had an incident at 4:00 am where a young, drunken man tried to force his way into my room.  Other than a lot of door rattling and shouting (from his Mum), I was in no danger, but when I checked out the staff were horrified.  They even gave me extra points, which was very sweet, although it was not their fault.

Shuttle bus to and from the airport worked well.",4,2023,06,09
250,Club lounge,"Liesl is a star host! After a long working day I was looking forward to relax in the lounge. As soon as I passed the door I was welcomed with cheers, smiles and attention. All making me feel like I was at home. Thank you for the experience!",5,2023,06,09

Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2023,06,08

250,The Best Relaxing and Enjoyable Place,I have never had fun the way I did on that vacation trip with my family. I really appreciate my dad he found and knew about it it's a really enjoyable place to get away from the local society and relax and enjoy without disturbance. I hope the teenagers my age will enjoy this place because I do.,5,2023,06,07

Thanks for making our stay even better!",5,2023,06,05
250,Irish Hospitatlity at Its Finest,"For a busy hotel, the staff here managed to be warm, friendly, efficient, professional and loaded with personality.  If you are fortunate enough to be greeted at the front desk by James or Beatriz, you may rest assure you are in good hands.  They will bend over backwards to deliver great service.

The hotel lobby is clean and attractive.  There is a quiet lounge area to socialize outside the main dining area where breakfast is served...a great buffet by the way...and the bar area where the drinks are well made and the light food fare is delicious.  The duck fat beef burgers are the best!  Samantha is a great server and will not neglect you once you are seated.

Our rooms (we stayed here twice during our European visit) were clean, well appointed with a comfortable mattress and an assortment of pillows.  Most tended to be firm, if soft and squishy is your thing then you may have to ask housekeeping for a softer pillow.

The bathroom was clean, towels were big and fluffy with plenty of bath accessories to meet our needs.  There is a mini fridge and tea kettle along with bottled waters, still and fizzy.

There is a park across the street with swans.  A type of food court within walking distance just down the street.  Depending on where you want to go in Dublin City, taxi fare varies from 30 euros to 60 euros.  The hotel does have shuttle service to and from the airport.

We highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2023,06,05

They made us all feel so welcome and even made a special hot chocolate for my daughter. Best service ever ",5,2023,06,03
250,Will undoubtedly return.,"My wife and I stayed here mid May, I for one night and my wife for 2 nights. This was due to my having a hospital appointment.

Every interaction with Mariann was a pleasure, as she exuded professionalism and friendliness at all times.

250,"If you need to get to the airport, stay here","The room was ok, but smelled a little musty. Check in was pretty easy, the elevators were quick, and there was a club lounge that had a good selection of food and drinks. The decor is kind of old.

She was friendly,  extremely attentive and provided prompt service for all of our requests.  I would definitely recommend a stay at the Crowne Plaza. Be sure you purchase the breakfast.

The hotel itself was lovely, a big clean room and a bathroom with a seperate bath and shower. We had breakfast included which was full of choice (with veggie and vegan options!) and delicious!

In particular, Agnieska at the coffee shop consistently provided top-notch service and was very warm and genuine, welcoming me each morning and remembering my order. Without being asked, she even helped me carry a heavy tray to my room so it didn't spill. ",5,2023,05,09

Our 2-night stay could not have been better. We were welcomed by Aidas, who's been working here for many years as have the other staff (always a good sign). Our room was warm and clean with good wifi and lots of hot water. It was also pretty quiet for sleeping after the bar had shut. The breakfast was one of the best I've had in a hotel, not least because it was freshly cooked and therefore piping hot, not sitting around in a buffet for hours. The bacon were top quality and the coffee was properly strong. We also ate here one evening and the pub food was also top quality. There was literally nothing that wasn't perfect, including the staff who were super-accommodating and let us store our bags so we could enjoy Dublin on our final day. This was a matter of cours for them. So much better than any of the big hotels that I have previously used when visiting the city. Can't recommend it highly enough. See you again",4,2023,05,05

However, ended up having a great evening, with fantastic food( fisherman plater and sticky toffee).  Pornstar martini at its finest, as well ( they have their own mixologist!!!). 
Look for Marian and Aidas, these guys are the real deal.

Return in two weeks, with friends, of course.

250,Good to be back ,"Such a great hotel; friendly welcome,  clean, comfortable and the food in the bar and breakfast restaurant is really quite good. The redecoration has brightened and freshener up the hotel. My only (minor) gripe is the lack of natural light in the restaurant at breakfast. I'm sure that I remember that there are windows on one wall. Maybe it's been filled in but if it's just drapes, surely they could be opened? ",5,2023,04,25

My room is clean. And they have a green philosophy which I love. Everyone has been so wonderful and genuinely nice most especially Dominic the shuttle bus driver!

I know I will be staying here again when I come back to Dublin … brilliant brilliant, absolutely five stars and it’s because my trip on the tram from the airport to the hotel was so much fun! Kudos to Dominic ! You need to give him a raise!!!",5,2023,04,18

Our room was lovely and so comfortable.  Our only wish was that we could have stayed longer!,5,2023,04,17
250,Perfect Start to our Ireland adventure,"My wife and I just had the pleasure of staying at the IHG Crowne Plaza Hotel.  We had just finished walking the 97 miles of the West Highland Way in Scotland, and flew to Dublin to meet our mom for a tour of Ireland. The hotel is lovely.  What truly shines is the staff!  The General Manager, who I believe is Magda Dabrowska, must be very proud of the assembled team. No mean feat in these trying times of staffing!  

Our very first contact with a representative of the hotel was our shuttle driver Dominic - who was outstanding! Dominic made sure we had a wheel chair available for mom upon landing and arranged for his partner driver Peter to assist us.  Peter was very kind and helpful. Beatriz at the front desk was an absolute pleasure! 

Housekeeping was very attentive. A shout-out is well deserved for the Club Lounge Staff Alisha and Carolina, and our downstairs breakfast server Jasmine and along with Manager Sillden.   
We will be returning to the hotel after a tour of a lifetime for mom.  There is no doubt that our experience at the Crowne Plaza set perfect tone for the start of our journey in Ireland - THANK YOU!",5,2023,04,17
250,Highly recommended,"Stayed twice at this hotel at the start/end of a recent trip from Dublin airport. 
We found the rooms to be well maintained, very clean and perfectly comfortable. 
On both occasions check-in was very professional we were warmly welcomed. Our IHG status was recognised and we were provided with a room upgrade and complimentary access to the hotel's club lounge.
Location is superb, just a 5 minute drive from the airport. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle bus to/from the airport which is easy to locate upon arrival and is just a short walk from the terminal building. On both stays, we had early morning flights to catch and were lucky enough to have Florian as the transfer driver. Florian was able to drop us kerb-side at the terminal building which was very helpful.
Would definitely have no hesitations in recommending the CP Dublin Airport. ",5,2023,04,16

250,Staff,"The staff were treating us so horribly they were so rude, one lady told me if i start messing about I was getting kicked out because they had such good security staff, I did nothing to nobody I just wanted to enjoy my night but I couldn’t. I felt as if anywhere I walked or anything I done they watched us like a hawk. I work in the security industry myself and that is not how we treat people, we treat them like humans not like dogs. Stayed with my twin, the only staff member that was nice was James, he fixed the air con in my sisters room this morning, he was so nice and friendly and it was really helpful. James needs to train the rest of staff to be like him. I will never forget how horribly I was treated. ",1,2023,04,14

250,EXCELLENT SERVICE- BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY - COMFORTABLE BEDS - DELICIOUS BREAKFAST,"EXCELLENT is an understatement!
OUTSTANDING accommodations and CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

I arrived at DUB Airport at 2 am, with 3 toddlers and a teen - and my husband. All hotels we called they were booked - or just did not have a room for us considering that we were 6 people; i felt such a lack of compassion from the hotel clerks that i spoke with - i mean we weren't looking for any extravagant accommodations - i was a mom with 4 kids looking to sleep them safely for few hours until our connection flight ... oh well ..

when i finally called here - the man that answered he was so kind, really!!!! i will i remembered his name - he was the night supervisor! He told me to get a taxi (told me how much i should expect the fare to be) and he will figure it out - no way he will not help out!!! I mean, seriously ---- so much compassion - and at this point it was 3 am and i was desperate and we were all tired (my kids were crying in the background of our phone conversation). Once we got there - the check in took less than 5 min .... and offered us complimentary breakfast in the morning (WOW)

When we walked in the room - the place was unbelievable clean and styling and cozy --- and the beds were like clouds, really! Best sleep~!!!!!

The breakfast in the morning was delicious and so many options on the buffet ---- and all so tasty!!!! It was more than i expected! The entire breakfast area was beautiful and so elegant!

... and then a free shuttle to the airport!

This was an unbelievable experience for my family - and i don't think the manager that was on duty will ever know what a blessing he was to our family ---- we need more people like him in hotels ---- people that care!!!! 

On our way out we noticed how beautiful the property was ---- so green, even a river i think ----- and i would definitely like to come back to Dublin and Crowne Plaza - this location - is the only one i consider and recommend 100 %",5,2023,04,11
250,"Clean, comfortable and great food and service","Very nice and comfortable hotel close to the airport.  Check in staff was super friendly and efficient abd the rooms very clean and comfortable (pillows especially good, which is saying a lot as I am a pillow snob who travels with his own pillow!).

The restaurant served “surprisingly” good food that I have typically not encountered at this type of hotel.   Especially delightful and welcoming were Aidas and the entire dining room staff!  

Even if you don’t stay here, I recommend anybody with a long layover at the airport  to come to the hotel for a meal!  It’s only a five minute complimentary shuttle bus away!  ☺️",5,2023,04,10
250,Above and beyond…,"We visited the concierge’s room for some hors d’oeuvres and drinks and was greeted by Liesl  who was an absolute delight she is friendly, engaging and a great listener.

The breakfast was free with our stay and it was delicious! They bring coffee or tea to your table as soon as you sit down. It’s great because I drink about 5 cups of coffee in the morning! :) Our room was very clean and the bed was comfortable! Overall, the hotel was a great pick being so close to the airport. Shuttle service is offered to and from the airport as well. 10/10 stay and will recommend it to others traveling here as well. 
We’re off to Galway, but will be back at the end of the week to complete our trip here! 

Thank you Crowne Plaza! ",5,2023,03,27

250,Business as usual,"What another pleasant stay at this IHG. Im a frequent traveller with work so it is of upmost importance that I have a comfortable and relaxing stay. From the beginning to the end- this hotel did not disappoint. I was warmly greeted by Elizabeth at reception whom did everything possible to ensure I had a perfect stay. What a lady! Hotel room was spacious and tastefully decorated- exactly what I expect from a Crowne Plaza. Overall, a fantastic stay with very helpful staff.",5,2023,02,12
250,Very Pleasant stay,"A very pleasant stay in a very convenient location approximately, 10 to 15 minutes from Dublin Airport—

Very comfortable, clean room.

A well stocked buffet styled breakfast, staffed with very helpful people—

We had a minor problem with the  shower head in our room, which we reported to Alisson on the reception desk, whilst we were checking out, and he assured us it would be attended to prior to the next quests arriving—-he was very helpful and understanding—

A small note—there is a daily charge for parking @ 10 euro —",4,2023,02,12
250,Hotel recently reopened,"Part of a group booked here pre-tour of the country. Hotel had recently been refreshed & renovated. Arrived on day one of re-opening following an overnight international flight. Surprised the staff with our morning arrival, hoping to register, drop bags & tour the central city for the day. All was made possible by helpful front desk agent Elisabeth who calmly registered 10 guests into multiple rooms, had the coffee service opened for us & arranged taxi service & hotel local transportation. Driver Domenic with the hotel gave several of us an overview of central Dublin as he drove us to Guinness Storehouse and helped me to learn the public bus service back to the hotel at the end of the day. Be sure to opt into the morning Irish breakfast - one of the best spreads I’ve enjoyed while in country. Room was clean & comfortable. Staff very hospitable & helpful.",5,2023,02,08
250,saturday horror and sunday humiliation,"Where should I start. 1) the reservation and the hotel do not communicate well. The booking was one price and the Hotel charged more. The reservation was made for a Park view and the Hotel never heard about it. The reservation person names was not found. None to no existent.
The staff on arrival tried to accommodated as much as they could. 
2) The staff on arrival around 3pm, offered a free parking, and a Late checked out for the trouble and misunderstanding. still communication and notes between reservation and the Hotel is zero.  
3)The room has an annoying noise coming from the heating/ventilation system. So again the staff on that time tried their best and changed the room.
4) I have to move all my staff again to the other room.which I forgot my face cream there. 
The new room has a towel on the sink of the bathroom with hair.. Disgusting. Call the reception the Duty manager came to take that way. There were 02 empty nivea plastic container in the shower , and I asked the Duty manager about them . he said it was part of the hotel . When I went to have a shower the plastic bottles were empty . Clearly not part of the hotel.
5) there was no hairdryer in the room I asked 3 times for one. Next day I went to the reception with the nivea  empty plastic containers and told them what happened the attitude of the receptionist was unacceptable. she tried to blame me for that saying ""my manager went there to check the room yesterday, there was nothing reported"". Sunday 5/02/23.So I ask her about the hairdryer and She said and I quote "" you will find them in the drawers"" then I repeated said I have asked 3 times for a hairdryer , don't think that I would not checked the drawers before hand?. 
6) As the staff of the day of arrival Saturday, 4/02/2023 added a complementary late check out on Sunday we stay a bit longer by 13:15 one of the receptionist knocked the door persistently to ask us to leave. I said we have an complementary late checked out. She said and I quote ""I did not see any note about it"". I will check it now. 10 minutes later came the impolite receptionist and another one knocking our door asking us to leave. I said again we have a complementary late check out. She said I will help you with your luggage for you to leave. Again communication is zero and the hotel. the rudeness of the staff on Sunday unacceptable. basically i was throw out of the hotel, even still having 30 minutes to leave.
6) most of good hotels have a free parking for the guests. This one does not. website said free parking available. 
7) Now the good part. To some guests there is a lounge on the 4th floor . It is lovely. There drinks and appetizer . As I was feeling well, I asked for a dessert Anne Maria, promptly added my request. by the way Anna Maria and the lounge is only good you will find in the good hotel. She is excellent. Very professional. 
8) there was a medical glove hanging on the smoke alarm, not only dangerous as fire hazard, but disgusting.   I truly believe the health and safety authority should pay a visit to the hotel. This time I took a picture and showed it to the impolite, unbearable receptionist. She said and I quote. ""I do not know whom put it there.I do not how it got there"" . I said I am asking you, I am telling you.Advising you. That receptionist should never work in a hotel . Knocking guest doors like a crazy , asking you to leave the room 45 minutes before your check out? which kind of professional is that ? 
So, unless you have no other option. I would not stay in the Hotel ever. Too price, room not properly clean and front house staff brutal. But if you stay there, please be sure to check in before 3pm, as the staff of this shift are professional and if you need anything ask Anne Maria. I went for a night to relax and got into a horror .  ",1,2023,02,06
250,Ticks all the boxes!!,"Beautiful hotel, gorgeous decor, very friendly staff, food Is top notch honestly the chef that was working on Feb 5th deserves a raise!
All the staff where so kind and could do enough for us, especially Elizabeth on reception, she goes above and beyond to make u feel welcome and goes further again to make sure all your needs are met! Every hotel needs an Elizabeth on reception!
Can't wait to return with the kids next time, they will love it too, especially that there is waffles and pancakes and the breakfast bar lol ",5,2023,02,05
250,IHG Hotel Close to Airport,"Recently renovated IHG hotel very close to the airport. Offers airport shuttle services as early as 3:30 am and the last one is at midnight. 
Check-in was easy and breakfast included during my stay. 
The fitness center wasn’t open during my stay, but supposed to open in Feb 2023. 
Room 349 was large with a king bed, mini-fridge, flat screen, and plenty of outlets and usb ports. The bed was comfortable with soft pillows. Tub and walk-in shower in the bathroom, but the towels could be softer. 
Breakfast is served at 7 am. Full Irish buffet was pretty good with plenty of breakfast options - fresh, flaky butter croissants. 
Room service was fast and accurate.",4,2023,02,01
250,Very disappointed!,"Currently staying here overnight to catch an early flight home. Not sure if my expectations are unreasonable, but most hotels I stay in have coffee available that one can help themself to. Not this one. After having dinner, and tipping 20%, I was sent back into the restaurant to purchase coffee. Which they poured in the paper cup I wanted. But they don't accept Apple Pay. You would think they would just give it to me since it was already poured. Think again. I was sent to my room to make a coffee. No coffeemaker here. Its a kettle. With instant coffee. No paper cups. So, I guess I won't be having coffee. Its been a long day, and it will be even longer tomorrow. I just wanted a coffee. I'll not be staying here again. I should have chosen a cheaper hotel. That doesn't mind giving a $3 coffee to keep a guest happy",1,2023,01,29
250,"Top Hotel!, 5 star","What a welcome back!, the hotel is completely renovated and fresh - I was so impressed with the new lobby, restaurant & bar. Magda greeted me on arrival at reception and was so friendly and enthusiastic. Great hotel!, highly recommend for any purpose of visit!",5,2023,01,26
250,Good,Recently attended the Irish Athletics Awards.  Service was good. Was in the big dining  room. The female manager was nice. Also wine 🍷reception on arrival. Food was good.. They could have added more veg with the chicken main course. Got to meet alot of Irish Athletics Legends ,4,2022,11,27
250,Conference success at the Crown Plaza,"I just had my first conference for Ecospec recently in the Crowne Plaza hotel. The booking experience with Carol and Priya to the running of the event with Jennifer and Stephen just exceeded my expectations. It is a credit to the entire organization for the level of service they showed.

I will certainly recommend this hotel and use their services for both business and leisure going forward.",5,2022,11,22
250,Awards night,Was here for a awards night the service was amazing. especially from sean the bartender remembered my order every time.never stopped going staff here were brilliant for the awards night.and the food and desert was top class aswell amazing night,5,2022,08,07
250,Jonny B and glen,Was in the hotel for a conference couldn't be happier with the staff and venue Jonny B was some man on the bar very professional and glen was very handy in behind the bar couldnt be happier with the treatment,5,2022,08,07
250,Bar,"I went to crown plaza,  (santry) last week as some friends I have not seen for a few years where there. I met them in the bar, which was cozy and friendly.  my friends had left after a couple of hours and I stayed a while longer as I was waiting for a lift home. There was 1 particular member of staff Called Jaymie, who went above and beyond for the guests and myself. She checked to see if everything was ok as i was alone, i found this admirable, especially in these times when you really don't know what is going through someone's mind. After I told her i was waiting on a lift she offered to call a taxi if the lift wasn't coming, but assured me it was ok to stay in the bar until then. She made everyone in the bar feel welcomed going above and beyond while staying within the guidelines for covid.
She is a credit to the premises and the hotel chain.
I will be sure to revisit.
5 star service",5,2021,11,21
250,I was underwhelmed...,"My reservation at the Holiday Inn Express was transferred to this hotel, due to the Express being closed. The Crowne Plaza of course is also part of IHG and is located next door to the Express and shares a shuttle from the airport. This was billed as an ""upgrade"". Overall however I was underwhelmed. Staff at reception were excellent, the bed was very comfortable and I slept well. Rooms are strangely decorated, more in keeping with a property selling rooms by the hour than an upscale hotel. Walls are thin, and I could clearly hear my neighbour talking on the phone. Breakfast was OK, however staff were not overly friendly in the restaurant. Shuttle to and from the airport was fast and efficient.

I would not rush back.",3,2021,11,16
250,Perfect stay,We love staying here great rooms beds breakfast and the staff are excellent pleasant and helpful. My husband had an appointment in Santry clinic which is only short walk away. We are returning in February for his surgery. We are now in Gresham in Dublin City and the difference between the two is huge. So week done crowne Plaza for making a stressful situation so easy and comfortable,5,2021,11,13
250,A Lovely Stay,"We enjoy Crowne Plaza hotels, the staff are superb, the rooms are of a very good standard and the food is excellent. 
The staff are knowledgeable , helpful and efficient . Our room was well appointed with the bathroom having both a bath and a stand-alone shower. The decor, furniture and fittings were all in very good order. The only improvement I would appreciate would be a coffee maker in the rooms.
As I was quarantining prior to a surgical procedure the housekeeping staff looked after us very well. 
The room service menu offered a good choice of dishes which were well cooked and presented. The food  was promptly delivered.",5,2021,11,12
250,"Great People, Strange Experience","We did not intend to stay here, but had our reservation transferred here without any communication from the Airport Holiday Inn.  So we had no expectations, no chance for prior review.
The staff at all levels  behaved professionally, were friendly, and and did everything to make your experience great.
One issue, the dinner restaurant.  The staff stayed positive but it was one fiasco after another.  2 hour wait for meals, wrong meals delivered, poor quality in some cases, but they seemed to be quite understaffed for a 4 star hotel. 
The person next to me ordered a vegetarian meal, but was delivered a burger.  I ordered a beer battered fish dish, but got some grilled prawns, smoked salmon and some croquettes that were delicious.  Wrong meal but it was better than what I had ordered,
The two hour wait is no exaggeration, but got to know people  around us.
Finally, top notch breakfast.
Just a weird experience,, good luck if you eat dinner here.",4,2021,11,02
250,Excellent Airport Hotel,"Great location airport hotel with its own shuttle from DUB. Everyone was incredibly professional and kind. They let us check in early, thankfully, and we ended up having a quiet afternoon and evening. I loved our room (we got upgraded for being IHG members) to a room with a peacock blue bed and a really nice bathroom. The king bed was very comfortable, the best we'd slept on in Ireland. We had to get hard copies of our negative covid tests, and the receptionists were happy to print them for us. It was so comfy (and we were so tired) that we ordered room service, and the food was very good. Our stay included a buffet breakfast, and it was delicious. The croissants were proper flaky. I had no complaints at all about our stay, and recommend it!",5,2021,10,21
250,"Great location, good hotel","Excellent free bus service from airport takes 7 mins. Better location than hotels adjoining the terminal as quiet snd opposite a lovely country park. Lovely inside, rooms ok but small and noisy fans in bathrooms which was really disappointing.  Conference facilities one of the best have used snd the food is excellent.",4,2021,10,14
250,The Room was the let-down,"Excellent food; range and quality, Very clean, lovely decor, Very good customer service; efficient and courteous, Great location; adjacent to lovely park, adjacent bus stop and only 20mins bus ride (41a,b,c, 16, 33) [only €2adult, €1 child to get to town centre]. Parking €6per day. So all good except lumpy flimsy pillows, bumpy mattress and shower that didn’t drain (blocked) within bedroom.",4,2021,10,10
250,Quarantine hotel,"Checked in after 21.20 and i was told that i could not go for a ""smoke break "" because was late! 
So they also decide when you like to smoke, and i can't have a walk after having travelled 10 hours!! 

Is this for real???",1,2021,06,26
250,Cannot fault it !,"just spent three wonderful days here.  perfect surroundings for walks, hotel is immaculate and  beautifully decorated. very chic.

250,A Little Dated,"Thought on this trip would try this Hotel near Dublin Airport as I was flying out the following day - The check in was grand , little bag of goodies instead of a lounge ( Closed - Covid  - plus one Drink available at the Bar - The room was comfortable if a little dated - I guess the place was twenty years old - The Bar service was good very organised  young Hungarian lady produced Fish and Chips and a few Pints .
B/Fast the same young lady produced a first class B/Fast- check out was fast and the Electric bus to the airport ran to time and was nice change",4,2020,10,25
250,Honeymoon Stay before Flight,"We stayed here back in June 2016 before flying out of Dublin for our honeymoon. I recently had time to sort wedding keepsakes and came across the note that was left in our room. I will never forget the kindness of 'Olga' during our stay. We were treated so well with a room upgrade. The staff were so courteous, great food and hospitality. Thank you.",5,2020,10,17
250,Excellent service but even better staff,We are staying her currently.  When we arrived we met with Olga at reception.  She dealt with us swiftly and was so lovely to us. What a first impression.  She prepaid our parking ticket for our entire stay and gave us a lovely goodie bag full of yummy treats. We went to the bar for dinner and met with Peter who was the waiter. He was great to give us recommendations and was so friendly and kind. The food was absolutely superb and portion size was excellent.  We both received 2 drinks on the house each which was a lovely treat. All those little touches made us feel so very welcome.  Covid guidelines are clearly displayed and staff are very good at adhering to them. We feel very safe here in these scary times. The hotel room and public areas are spotless and the rituals toiletries are a nice treat. The staff in this hotel are an absolute credit and many thanks to both Peter and Olga for making us feel so welcome ,5,2020,10,06
250,Nice hotel. Poor Check-in Service,"My husband and I arrived at this hotel after a weekend in Germany as a brief pit stop before our journey back to Belfast.

The hotel is nice, the food was decent and the service in the restaurant was very good.

This was all let down by the poor service received at check in.

I had booked this room through booking.com and prepaid the room rate. 

The hotel receptionist asked me upon check-in how I would be paying for the reservation. I informed her that I had prepaid the room (Crowne Plaza actually had sent me an email a few days prior requesting payment).

Upon hearing this the receptionist pursed her lips, looked down her glasses at me, shook her head at me and told me point blank that I had not paid.

I showed my confirmation of payment email but she refused point blank to accept that I had paid. She stated that as I had booked through booking.com that sometimes the payments don't make it through the system.

I stated the fact that I had paid through a Crowne Plaza payment request and website and not through booking.com. 

Even if the hotel has issues with booking.com as the end consumer that is not my fault. It is an issue between hotel and partner.

Despite the fact I had paid through Crowne Plaza, had a payment confirmation from Crowne Plaza, this receptionist continued to look down at me condescendingly and refused to accept that I had paid.

She then proceeded to tell me that I have to show MY BANK STATEMENT to prove that I had paid. Luckily I had access to my online banking app and was finally able to prove I had paid.

Why did I ever have to show my personal bank account details for me to be proven correct?

As soon as I showed my personal bank account details to a total stranger she changed her tune and accepted we had paid.

Complimentary drinks were offered in the restaurant (which we received), however this was too little too late.

A humiliating experience that should never have happened.

I will not stay here again and will be recommending friends and family to not stay here also.",3,2020,09,19
250,Excellent hotel,"Stayed one night. The room was excellent. Had a problem with the shower drain which was repaired straight away. Breakfast was excellent. Ate in the bar.The food was excellent as was the service.
Great place to stay.",5,2020,09,06
250,"Friendly Staff, Good location","We had one night here as we transferred from Kilkenny to Dublin for a flight the next day.  Nicely appointed rooms, Helpful staff.  Good amenities for the business traveler as well as those on the move.",4,2020,08,21
250,Exceptional staff,"Have used this hotel often for bar and restaurant and have held my parents 40th wedding anniversary party there as live close by. 
Recently was booking last minute for some family to stay overnight to attend a funeral next day. I dropped into the reception and was met by Olga who was exceptional, she was so professional and treated us with such compassion especially given the circumstances we were dealing with. 
She’s fantastic front of house and addition to the hotel.",5,2020,08,18
250,Has changed due to covid19 ,Stayed at the plaza and have several other nights booked for athletics events taking place near by. Unfortunately after 3 1/2 hour drive it would be nice to get settled into a room make last food orders downstairs this did not happen due to three trips to get key cards validated up and down to reception missed last orders then had to order sandwiches to the room not what was ordered 🤷‍♀️. Two staff also at breakfast only so the fabulous breakfast we are so used to at the crown plaza was disappointing due to very slow service.. it is unprecedented times at the moment but don’t let standards slip. If anything make better of the situation.. ,3,2020,08,18
250,Exceptional Service,"On the night before our flight from Dublin Airport we stayed at the Crowne Plaza. The hotel is in a good location, about 5 minutes drive from the airport. The parking was a little hard to find; however, the reception staff were very helpful and told us where to go to access parking. On check-in, Olga provided the most exceptional service. When she heard that we were starting our honeymoon after being married the previous day, she congratulated us and immediately upgraded us to a top-level suite, ordered a bottle of prosecco to the suite free of charge and gave me and my wife a goody bag with chocolates etc. The suite was beautiful and spacious, very clean and had all of the amenities once could wish for. Our flight left early the next morning and we were provided with breakfast to go as the restaurant had not yet opened. Overall, 10/10 service and a special mention to Olga for her kindness - we will definitely come again!",5,2020,08,06
250,Excellent Stay Night Before Our Flight,"We were travelling quite early in the morning and so decided to avail of the Park and Ride deal. My family and I were welcomed in a hospitable fashion and as  I was an IHG Elite Gold Member, was given a welcome amenity - some drink vouchers. Really appreciated this. Our room was excellent, clean and comfortable. We were given an early check-in before 4pm which was awesome! 
Good, quality amenities. Unfortunately we couldn't have breakfast as our flight was around 7:40, but what was really great was that there was free coffee in the lobby. What was really helpful was the free airport shuttle. Last but not least though, I had misplaced my keys and only realised that they were lost after we departed Ireland. When we arrived back after our holiday, we checked with reception just before getting our car and they had kept it safe! 
Thanks a million guys!",5,2020,05,18
250,Great hotel. ,"Great, clean, comfortable hotel with friendly staff who are only too happy to help. The rooms are modern with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom. The walls are thin though, we could hear the couple next door to us going at ""it"" Al night. All. Night. All through the night. They barely stopped! 😂 

The breakfast buffet is tasty with a good choice of juice, coffee and tea.

An easy walk to the bus stops for buses to either the airport or the city centre and there's a little shopping centre about a 10 minute walk away that has two cafes, a McDonalds, an Aldi and all sorts. 

Would definitely recommend. ",4,2020,05,10
250,Short break,"Spent Saturday night in the Crown Plaza and all i can say is wow.  This is our fourth visit here in a two year period as our son lives close by.  And we have had four fab breaks away.  We were greeted by Graham, who welcomed us back asked if we would like a front facing room also if we preferred a bath or shower or both and if we would like a wake up call or dinner.  he was so professional and welcoming.  Our room was beautiful, plenty of room, bottled water and an ample supply of toiletries.  lovely big shower and separate bath.  We didn't eat in-house, but had breakfast and it was fab.  So much choice from cooked to cold meats, fruit, omelettes made to order and amazing waffles with toppings, selection of breads and toast.  This is a beautiful hotel although a little far out it is still only 20 mins on the bus which stops at the entrance gates to Northwood park only minutes walk away.  Also Northwood park is beautiful for a morning walk.  We will most definitely be back again. The hotel also have a free aerport shuttle for those who are using Dublin aerport again only  minutes away.",5,2020,03,09
250,Fine but must improve ,"This is a nice hotel in a nice convenient location. The Rooms are a decent size abs well furnished. The rooms do have issues with noise transference. The biggest let down was the breakfast where the room
Was seriously under staffed, the chef was under too much pressure and multiples were waiting for coffees etc. The lack of a gluten free selection Is this day was also unacceptable.",3,2020,03,08
250,Comfortable stay.,"Stayed at the Crowne plaza hotel dublin in past few days. This is our 3rd visit and again we had a very positive experience. Relaxing overnight before a flight. Staff treated us so well, friendly, professional and most helpful. When we checked in to our room I observed the bathroom/ toilet was unclean. I rang reception to let them know the nature of the problem.Within 10 minutes the issue was dealt with. I have worked in the hotel business, cleaning etc, and I understand how stressful the job is. I try to give constructive feedback when I stay in hotels. If management don't know about a problem,then they can't fix it.An offer of alternative room was made, this was not necessary,but appreciated . Glad to see there was a routine fire drill/check too. Well done again all staff at Crowne plaza hotel dublin airport. See you again very soon!",5,2020,03,07
250,Amazing stay,"Myself and the other half stayed here for 2 nights this weekend using a voucher which was just out of date but they kindly honoured it. It was my birthday on the Thursday and his 40th on the Friday. I mentioned this when booking and to say the staff went above and beyond is an understatement. We were upgraded to one of their fabulous suites and they even delivered a complimentary bottle of wine, fruit plate and a piece of cake with Happy Birthday wishes! We could not have asked for a better weekend. The staff at reception, in the restaurant and the Club Lounge were so friendly and attentive, and they even validated our parking on check-out!! We didn't want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. Thank you so much for the most memorable hotel stay 😊👍🏼",5,2020,03,02
250,"dark rooms, but only full size beds","This is a typical Crowne Plaza Hotel which are usually quite good.  The hotel is a 10 minute drive from the airport, so it is not really an airport hotel.  That helps keep the noise level down as the planes are not flying low above it.  Even so, the windows keep the outside noise to a level where you can sleep.  Unfortunately, the doors don't keep out the inside noise as we could hear doors slamming as people left in the morning.  We had arrived after an overnight flight and desperately needed sleep, but it was hard with doors slamming.  The curtains did a good job of keeping the light out.  So I suggest ear plugs.  The beds are comfortable.  What I don't understand is why Crowne Plaza has full size beds, and not queen beds.  There were three of us, so the two that had to share a bed were crowded.  Otherwise the room furnishings were fine.  The bathroom was well supplied with a good shower.  We were there just a few hours, so we didn't use the rest of the hotel's amenities.  Check-in was ridiculously slow considering we were the only people checking in at 5am.  It took about 10 minutes, and we had made reservations months ago.  The night clerk seemed clueless.",4,2020,02,23
250,"Not my first stay,  won't be my last ","As an IHG member, I got an excellent bed and breakfast rate for a Saturday night in this Dublin hotel. Have stayed here before and find it very convenient.  It's in a nice quiet area with some shops closeby and even a MacDonalds. Check in staff (male) were not particularly friendly or welcoming but sorted our room keys for us.  We got a nice comfortable and spacious room with two double beds, minibar was empty for some reason but complimentary water was supplied. Some nice touches such as chocolate on our bedside lockers and pillow sleep spray.  The bathroom had a bath and a separate shower which is a bonus for families, the bathroom was long and narrow but made great use of the space.  Every aspect of this hotel is clean and fresh. Breakfast was very nice and breakfast staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and immediately brought a high chair over for our little one. €6 for overnight parking. ",4,2020,02,22
250,Used the restaurant at the Crown Plaza whilst staying at the holiday inn,"Stayed for a week for a business trip. 

I've eaten a couple of times at the Crown Plaza restaurant and both times the staff are absolutely lovely. 

Today I was served by Anna who is very friendly, professional and attentive. You can see she makes sure she looks after all her customers in the restaurant and sees to them right away. 

I would definitely recommend and come back again. The atmosphere is very pleasant and relaxing. ",5,2020,02,20
250,Great hotel,"Have been to the bar for food and drinks with the mrs twice now and service and meals were great. Even though she seemed to be on her own and bar was quite busy, danielle was very pleasant and had no problem helping us to our table with drinks. Would highly recommend. We will definitely be returning.",5,2020,02,17
250,Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport,"Stayed in the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport hotel for business. The hotel is not to close to the airport but about a 10min drive. Good location as well to be able to jump on a bus or grab a cab into Dublin centre. Rooms very comfortable, bar and restaurant   great to eat and have a Guinness in.gym has a few pieces of equipment in it and ok for a quick workout. Running machines however need servicing.  Would be very happy to stay in this hotel  again.",5,2020,02,16
250,Everything I needed.,Stayed here on a work trip for one night. The room and bed were both so comfortable with everything I could have needed. Friendly staff and only a short distance to the airport with a free shuttle bus available. Beautiful breakfast. Would not hesitate to stay again and recommend.,5,2020,02,15
250,I will be returning to this hotel ,"I've stayed in the crowne plaza for the first time on a short business trip and I was made feel very welcome by the bar manager gemma, the staff were also very helpful in the bar.The rooms were very comfortable and had all my needs ,Enjoyable stay.",5,2020,02,13
250,Outstanding ,"I recently stay here as it was close to the airport and I was flying out to Las Vegas for my 50th birthday. With a storm brewing and many flights canceled including my own I had to stay an extra night. 
Ok I will start with the service from the girls on the desk on arriving to the hotel. I dealt with Jenny and olga whom were most helpful with trying to arrange my flight and made sure I was ok and kept checking status of my flight for me
They were so friendly and helpful to me which they made my stay pleasurable. 
Then the bar staff were very friendly also and the food is excellent here and the friendly Anna who is always smiling and helpful.
So overall this hotel is a great place to stay and the staff made me feel very welcome and couldn’t do enough for me .
So thanks to all 
Peter maloney",5,2020,02,09
250,Surprisingly good,"My husband travels for work a lot and we expected this to be just another average airport hotel, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that there were a lot of little touches that made our stay a cut above the rest. All of the staff we dealt with were very helpful and professional. We were surprised that the room was decorated well and was bright. Most importantly we slept really well which does not always happen in hotels. The bed was comfortable, the room was completely dark, the hotel was quiet and they even provided a sleep aromatherapy spray.
They actually seem to care a lot about their guests here and in the bathroom there is a card to say that if you forget anything like your toothpaste, razor, comb etc. They will provide one free of charge. 
We were impressed to see lots of vegan options on the food menu. 
We didn't opt to have breakfast included in the room rate but it was only €13.95 each to have the continental breakfast. There was a lot of choice lots of teas, coffees, breads, pastries, cheeses, cold meats, cereals, juices etc. There were vegan choices too and they have soya milk. 
We stayed in the Raddison by Dublin Airport last month and it wasn't anything near as good as this. 
We'll be back in 2 weeks for our next trip! 
",5,2020,02,09
250,Bar food ,"Had a business lunch in bar this week . The food was well presented and the menu has plenty of choices. Place was busy but staff were friendly and efficient. Special mention to Anna for her great service, got us fed & out on time as we had explained we were on a tight schedule to catch a flight. Will return when in the area in the future!",5,2020,02,06
250,Fabulous Business Hotel,"I stayed here for the 10th time in Feb 2020 and feel it is time to write a review on TripAdvisor. The staff and team are excellent, nothing is too much trouble. If you are lucky enough to be given access to the Club Lounge, you will meet the lovely Edit, who makes you feel like you are an old friend visiting a favourite restaurant. Highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2020,02,05
250,Had a great night before my fight.,"Had a great night here before my flight. I wished I could have stayed longer. The room was lovely, the bed was comfortable and the food was delicious. The staff was great and helpful [they helped me print up my boarding pass ]. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2020,02,04
250,Convenient for airport ,It’s 10mins by hotel shuttle to the airport. The rooms are worn and could do with a revamp. The food in the restaurant is excellent I highly recommend it. The gym is ok for a short stay. The staff where really friendly and happy to help.,3,2020,02,03
250,Excellent Reception Staff ,"I stay at this hotel on business and must write how amazing reception staff Olga and Szilvia are !!! Nothing is too much for these ladies to help with .... polite helpful and professional these ladies are an asset to this hotel .
Always a pleasure staying here at this great hotel  ... see you again !! ",5,2020,02,02
250,Great stay,"This was a private visit, but it was nice to be recognised and greeted as a regular by staff like Olga and Edit who usually see me there when I'm on business. Special thanks to Caio on the front desk for giving me a nice room when I checked in! Everyone there works hard to make staying away from home a stressless experience. Back soon I'm sure.",5,2020,02,01
250,Convenient to DUB Airport,"I stay there because it has a free shuttle bus to the airport, but get downstairs 10 minutes prior to the bus leaving for the airport because there are people that work at the airport and get the best front seats on the bus. They jump on the bus first because they don't have to struggle with luggage. Trouble is that they smoke while waiting for the bus. Some early buses don't even leave, but if you are flying to the USA you need to leave earlier to clear customs. (3 hours before departure)  All the rooms have different décor and some are nicer than others. There is no swimming pool but it is a nice convenient hotel with good restaurants and a computer in the business room. The air-conditioning does not work. ",3,2020,01,29
250,My seventh stay,"I have stayed at this hotel previously and come back as an IHG Spire Elite member. Room was upgraded to a Club Executive. Staff at this hotel are a credit and the bar next to lobby has been renovated. 

This is my hotel of choice when working in Dublin Airport area.",5,2020,01,28
250,Standard airport Crowne Plaza,"This is an OK hotel, close to Dublin airport. Service is good & friendly. Rooms are alright, well furnished & clean but the walls are very thin. You can hear everything from the adjoining rooms – that is not good. Breakfast is good but nothing special. Probably not a special hotel in the Dublin area but a solid business option to spend the night. A bit too far out for tourism I believe.",3,2020,01,27
250,Great Service!,I had three nights at The Crowne Plaza last week. I ate at the Touzai restaurant with a couple of friends which was great. I also ate in the bar one evening and was served by Edit - brilliant service from her!,5,2020,01,24
250,Up for the match,"Stayed for 2 nights with my wife.  Fine room which was very quiet at night . Good bathroom with lovely fluffy towels . Good choice of TV channels . Very big comfortable bed . Had dinner one night . Perfectly fine meal . Dining room is open quite late . 
A large group of us used the bar which has a good choice of drinks . 
There was a well organised function in the function room . Bar service there was slow . 
Breakfast on both mornings was excellent . Nice fruit and smoked salmon and cheeses . Cooked breakfast was very good . Plenty of good hot tea available. 
Again the restaurant was open quite late for breakfast 
Car parking is available in attached secure parking garage at a reasonable fee.
We were very happy with this hotel and we expect to be using it again in February while going on holiday 
Strongly recommended.",5,2020,01,19
250,Ok hotel near airport ,"Stayed here a couple of times in December.

Stayed in a club room, and found club lounge pretty poor... coffee machine out of order during both stays so no cappuccino for me on a morning. 
Food selection limited as well.

On a positive - Room was decent size, and bar was ok. 
Only ate there once - food was ok.

Preferred the Carlton for an airport stay.",3,2020,01,16
250,Amazing managers and staff,"I’d like to thank the manager and the hotel staff for all the attention and kindness in serving us! I just received a “pint” glass that was lost in room cleaning, the Manager offered to solve the problem, by sending the glass via mail. 

I received the glass today! 
Thank you for your hospitality and services you made our trip a little more special. 
Amazing team!!",5,2020,01,14
250,Had two nights,"Had two nights at this hotel,staff were brilliant suite was fantastic easy commute to get into Dublin City. Whatch out for the breakfast staff who try to poison you with out of date peanut butter,just kidding she was so apologetic and we had a good laugh over it. Thanks",5,2019,12,31
250,Great Hotel,"We absolutely love this Hotel. This was our second time there, but it was about not to happen as we were shocked with one of the staff members, his behaviour with other staff and even with us was just not acceptable for someone who deals with the public and a big NO NO for a 4 star Hotel.
He mistreated the other staff member that was with him then day we went there for the reservation, he almost called us liars about the price we saw on Booking.com, I even explained him the.proce was there, was with taxes, and I was always able to book from there with no issues everywhere on the world for the prices announced and he said that was not true and came with a very stupid excuse to charge us more, so, we ended not booking the room and went the next door in the next Hotel, where people where very friendly and professional. It ended up that that Hotel.belongs to Crown Plaza, closed for Christmas, so, we ended relocated on the Crown Plaza for a cheaper price than the original we were prepared to pay for.
But the next time we go there to book a room will be the day where we decide if we keep Crown Plaza on our list or remove it for good. If that ""guy"" is still there, that means that Crown Plaza does not know how to select its staff and their standards lowered a lot.
By the way, if someone from Crown Plaza is reading this and wants to know who the person is: I don't remember his name but it's a tall guy wearing glasses, with beard, Brazilian. You should fire him asap as that person is going to be very bad to the business. Stick to real professionals as before.",4,2019,12,31
250,True airport Hotel,"In saying that it is a typical airport hotel, I have stayed in better.
The club room was a waste of time.  Awful canapés, basic wines.  The main restaurant had a peculiar menu with an emphasis non basic cuisine. Fortunately, there is a super restaurant a few paces away.
Excellent Staff.",3,2019,12,29
250,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for one night on a quick trip to Dublin. Great breakfast available in the morning. Room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Staff was helpful and friendly. Convenient shuttle back and forth from airport. ",4,2019,12,28
250,Good airport hotel with free shuttle,"We had a late flight arriving into Dublin and decided not to head into town. We needed a family room and it came to a choice between the CP and Hilton, but CP (& the neighbouring HI Express) had a free shuttle from the airport. It was also handily located a five-minute walk from a bus stop that could get us into town (for a lot less than a taxi).

 The room was good size with two double beds and the bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower. Very little noise from the corridor and slept well. The bar was also decent with a good choice of drinks on offer.

Due to the location I wouldn’t choose to stay here more than one night, but it is a good choice if you have a late arrival/early departure.",4,2019,12,28
250,Excellent Hotel With Free Airport Shuttle,"I enjoyed a one night stay at this Crowne Plaza location, arriving via the free hotel shuttle bus from Dublin Airport. My great experience started with the shuttle driver - a lovely man who took the time to personally welcome every rider to Dublin and help carry their bags onto the bus. Check in was incredibly fast - in addition to informing me of the hotel services and amenities, she also offered to help book an taxis and assist with any reservations outside of the hotel. I've stayed at numerous Crowne Plaza hotels and my room was to the standard I expected - spacious, lots of storage space, a proper three piece bath, and a very comfortable bed. There is a large park directly across the street from the hotel - a great space to unwind either before or after travelling. The breakfast was fantastic - lots of hot and cold choices, including a few different preparation styles for the eggs - and complimentary newspapers were available. I enjoyed my stay and recommend the hotel to others.",5,2019,12,28
250,Helped us organise a surprise for my brother,"I didn't stay, but we booked a stay for my brother for his birthday as a surprise. The reservation lady was brilliant. Think her name was Nadia. Nothing was too much trouble and she was very enthusiastic about helping us organise the surprise. Arranged for a lovely greeting to be left for him at reception and a nice bottle of wine in his extremely spacious room. Needless to say, everything went perfectly and my brother was beyond surprised and happy.",5,2019,12,27
250,No Upgrade Despite Platinum Status But Still An Overall Good Stay,"Decided to stay here while in Dublin for 2 nights with family. Was convenient as there was parking. There was a nearby bus stop where one can get a bus to access Dublin City Center. 
Though I was a Platinum Elite Member, I was not given a complimentary upgrade as there were 3 of us staying, and Club Rooms could only accommodate 2 persons. 
Nevertheless we were given access to the club lounge which was welcomed! We also opted to have a full breakfast on the last morning of our stay which was excellent. 
The surrounding area and park is quite beautiful in summertime for walks. There is a nearby playground in the Demesne, next to which one can find the walled garden. 
Lots of space for exploring and exercising.",4,2019,12,26
250,Fantastic ,"Beautiful food, service very helpful, one of the group required gluten free, separate menu available and was very tasty, I had Singapore Noodles and it was excellent, others had the Burger and they said it was very good. Price for lunch for 3 people, 3 cokes and ice cream was €66. Great value. 
Look after the waiters and the cooks, tip well and be respectful.",5,2019,12,24
250,Great Service,I visited the hotel with my friend a few days ago. We had lunch in Cinnabar and we were served by a lovely waitress called Neeve. She was very attentive and provided us with food recommendations. Myself and my friend both had the beef burger which was delicious. We were extremely happy with the service and will return again.,5,2019,12,21
250,Rude miserable staff,"Most disappointing stay. At the bar the the member of staff who served me couldn't be more miserable, made to feel like an inconvenience when asking for a drink. Then proceeded to stand behind the bar swearing to colleagues about pay.

Ordered some food ... I think I'd had a better burger in fast food restaurant... So over priced. No one asked if it was ok.

Went to reception to ask a question , cold emotionless response, complete lack of customer service.

Can't wait to leave.",2,2019,12,17
250,a great place to stay before flying off on holiday,"my wife and i were allocated a very nice room, everything went well during our overnight stay, the coach driver to and from the airport was very helpful with our luggage, next time we need to stay near the airport it will be here",5,2019,12,16
250,Very pleasant stay,"I was only here for one night but it was great. I had a room on the 4th floor next to the club lounge. Check in was efficient, my room was quiet, tastefully decorated, clean with a lovely en-suite. There was a deep sIeep pillow spray and a sweet on my bed. I had a continental breakfast included in the price in the club lounge. ",5,2019,12,03
250,Excellent!,"Couldn't fault my 1 night stay at the Crowne Plaza!

The decor of the bedroom was beautiful and the bed and pillows were so comfy. I had a brilliant nights sleep.

As I arrived at hotel late, I ordered room service. Food was delicious, still hot and delivered to the room in super quick time.

I will definitely be back, was brilliant from check in to check out.",5,2019,11,30
250,Business trip - nicely supported,"Nice and tidy facility. There is a gym on-site which is always a plus (though one of the two treadmills wasn't working). Well served rooms and conference facilities.
Could be better with Vegetarian options for lunch.
Special thanks to Mr Shazi for thoughtful room service.
Overall positive experience.",5,2019,11,27
250,Excellent.,We stayed overnight for a morning flight. From checking in until departure we found everything to be excellent. Quiet hotel. Calm and welcoming entrance area. Very comfortable bed . Breakfast was one of the best we have ever had . Well done !!!,5,2019,11,22
250,Perfection from check in to check out,"If you need a hotel close to the airport this is the ideal location, it is close to all local amenities and has a beautiful park across the way from it if you decide to venture out. On check in we were given a very warm and friendly welcome by Graham and the reception team, he was very professional and informative of the hotel amenities and offered to reserve a table for dinner that evening which was a lovely touch. We stayed on the 4th floor with access to the club lounge, again the staff were very friendly and attentive. The bedroom was beautiful and cosy. The bar staff were lovely and friendly and a great bar menu with plenty to choose from. The buffet breakfast has a great selection and again the staff were helpful and attentive. Graham was on duty when we checked out and asked how our stay was, we couldn't fault a thing, from the exquisite decor to the friendly staff in every department it is certainly an experience we will repeat again and would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2019,11,21
250,Brilliant,"I was recently in the Crowne Plaza, in the bar I was served by Tommy and he was brilliant, so friendly and efficient. Nothing was an issue with him and he went out of his way to make sure that we were being looked after.",5,2019,11,21
250,Gorgeous Room lovely Decor.,"The room was fabulous. I loved the decor!! the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious as was the shower. I had a very restful night.
There was a great selection for breakfast . I had lunch here as well and it was very tasty. Staff were very welcoming and friendly.",5,2019,11,18
250,Brilliant service,"I stayed in Crowne Plaza for few nights with my family and it was great. Staff in reception was nice, housekeeping girls very polite. But the highlight of our stay was the night we had dinner at the restaurant. Tau, the lady who served us and also supervisor of the restaurant did a brilliant job. She was friendly, careful and very professional. Always smiling and making sure everyone around was being looked after. Wouldn’t mind having people like her, giving this kind of service, everywhere I go. Thanks Tau! ",5,2019,11,12
250,Excellent staff,"Stayed here after late flight from Dublin prior to travelling on. Reception staff were very friendly and room was very comfortable and clean. Plenty of choice at breakfast and staff very attentive.
Wouldn't hesitate to rebook.",5,2019,11,11
250,Party poopers..,"On entering the beautiful lobby of the Crowne Plaza, everything was lovely bar the staff at reception who were rude and unprofessional towards my girlfriend checking in. As we booked the room with a bath we were suprised to find a disbled fitted shower and toilet which we did not pay for. The room was lovely regardless and a great TV but unfortunately the room next to us were very noisy and the walls felt like paper. We decided to let it be and we were hoping in the evening things would change.After a complaint to the reception on noise at 12.30 am nothing changed and in fact loud music from a speaker commenced at 3am which only stopped after 4am when we eventually got the reception to intervene. We didn't get a wink of sleep and were very disappointed paying good money on a supposedly nice hotel. To top off our experience we were greeted by poo outside our doorstep. I wish I was joking. Would not recommend.",1,2019,11,10
250,Outstanding hotel,Excellent location for Dublin airport! The staff at this property are all extremely friendly from reception staff right through to housekeeping . The service they all deliver is fantastic and I would highly recommend this hotel,5,2019,11,09
250,Service,I stayed in Crowne plaza airport hotel Dublin. My stay was good. Hotel room service was nice especially service and hospitality of Mr. Shaji was excellent. Definitely I recommend this hotel for others.,5,2019,11,08
250,Favorite Dublin hotel ,Come here at least twice a year with my two daughters..... staff make this hotel extra special .. from the wonderful Olga on reception to the chef who tailor made the waffles (incidentally best waffles ever) !!!!! I cannot recommend this hotel more ... wonderfully comfortable room well worth the upgrade to club floor .... great location for shopping .... truly superb guys you should be very proud !!!!! Every single staff member we encountered was a credit to this establishment... I’ve stayed in many hotels .. lots of five stars and truly think the Crowne plaza is quite unique.. ,5,2019,11,04
250,Nice hotel with some failings,"Shuttle from the airport is a good start to the stay. Complimentary and goes every thirty minutes. It's about a 5 minute walk from the terminal but easy to find. Shuttle drivers are very friendly providing information about the nearby area (which bus to get into the city etc).
Great welcome by reception - everyone smiling and willing to help. Was able to leave bags as too early to check in. 

I was assigned room 141 which on first glances seemed perfect. Two double beds, comfy chairs, desk space to work. Complimentary water, tea/coffee and biscuits. Room comes equipped with safe, ironing facilities, hair dryer etc. 

It was however let down on the bathroom. The shower was old and mildewy. The blind did not come down (glass was frosted but still). The worst bit was that there was no heating in the bathroom! 

The heating in the room worked well but sounded like it was being powered by a hamster running on a wheel. (I thought maybe I was unlucky but I heard the same coming from other rooms as they were being serviced the following morning). 

Breakfast was great - large selection of both hot and cold foods and drinks. Only let down in the staff who seemed they would rather be elsewhere. 

Conference facilities are ok. Rooms are smart and technology fine but the catering was in a small area not suitable for the number of people. 

Overall it's a nice hotel but starting to look a bit tired. For the price I would expect quite a bit more in terms of maintenance.",4,2019,10,28
250,Fantastic customer service- goes to the extra mile for the weary traveler,I had a problem with my reservation and thought I was going to burst into tears because I was so exhausted and just wanted to crawl into a nice bed. Olga at the front desk went above and beyond to fix my reservation and make sure I got a nice room with a bathtub so I could relax and recoup- amazing! Its so rare that anyone really sees how tired you are and goes out of their way to help- Olga is a rock star!,5,2019,10,24
250,"Old, run down rooms. Terrible customer service","When we arrived to our room, the key didn't work. This was at midnight, after traveling all day.  OK, so my husband went back down to front desk. New keys didn't work. After giving us 3 different sets of new keys, none of them worked!! There was obviously something wrong with the door lock. The ""solution"" they gave us was:  They couldn't give us a different room, and if we wanted to leave the room, we would have to come to the front desk to have someone come open he door for us!!  (The pass key worked). UNACCEPTABLE!! In addition, the furniture in the room was filthy dirty, rooms are very run down old!  They offered no discount on the room rate for all the problems. When checking out, the lady at the desk took the charge for wine off our bill. I would like some of my money back, but they  wouldn't do that!!!",1,2019,10,23
250,A very good and efficent hotel with clean decor and rooms,I had an overnight stay and it was a shuttle to and from the airport (which is often and reliable). The reception was efficent and the room was excellent. I had no complaints or criticsms to offer. Lots of food and drink options. They do their job very well here.,5,2019,10,23
250,Oceanic Events 2019/2020,"We are a large UK events company who host many of our events in the Crowne Plaza Blanchardstown and Crowne Plaza Northwood. Our account is managed by Carol Byrne the Cluster Director for Sales for both properties and the great events team in each property. We just had the Irish Hotel Awards 2019 at the Crowne Plaza Blanchardstown last night and the feedback has been super so we are extremely happy and looking to double our numbers for 2020.

All of our team are so happy with all the hard work Carol and her team have put it, they have exceeded our expectations with how accommodating and friendly they have been. Would definitely recommend this venue for events or for any sort of leisure or business trips!!",5,2019,10,22
250,"A good walk in the park, a good meal and a good sleep","The hotel has a decor that some might consider dated but we actually felt more at home here than in a modern hotel as it is very well maintained. It is opposite a lovely park in which we enjoyed walking on the afternoon and morning of our stay, meeting a few dogs. We ate at the hotel restaurant and the soup and fish were both excellent. The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet so we slept well. Breakfast was also excellent with a good choice. The free shuttle bus service was efficient: although travel to the hotel is from the Bus Zone on the edge of the airport, the trip back to the airport dropped us off at one of the departure terminals. Both drivers were very friendly.",5,2019,10,18
250,"Fantastic hotel with exceptional service, right from the time of booking","I have stayed in a few hotels that are part of this group and while I've never had any issues, I felt compelled to write a review on this occasion due to their level of service. I initially dealt with their reservations team (Nicole) who was exceptionally helpful; I'm sure the amount of queries I had must have been frustrating, but she was more than happy to help. She was so friendly and couldn't do enough to help me. 
This level of service continued at check in and the bar. 
The room was spacious and clean; the beds were extremely comfortable. I can't rate this hotel, or its level of service, highly enough. 
Thanks Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport!",5,2019,10,16
250,Crowne plaza,"The Good -Super comfy beds, Nice rooms, Fantastic spread and choice at breakfast. 
The not so good--Couldn't believe that we were asked to pay for parking, Not enough toiletries left in bathroom- only  one small bottle of shampoo, wash and body lotion .",4,2019,10,15
250,Warm and cold at the same time,"For irish people the max temperature of 24 degrees Celsius in the room might be completely OK, but for someone coming from the south like me it was quite cold. However the bed and the covers sre really really warm and cozy, but what really impressed me were firs the very friendly prsonel, the stylish interior and the great breakfast. No mater on that food regime you are, you won't be hungry after a breakfast in Crowne, there's something for everyone.",4,2019,10,15
250,A Great Place to Stay,"Our entire hotel experience was excellent.  We only stayed one night at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport because of its location and we had a flight the next morning.  I wish the hotel was located elsewhere!  The rooms were spacious and comfortably furnished with electrical outlets for US plugs, UK/Irish plugs and northern European plugs. The staff was efficient with check-in and check-out. Breakfast had everything we wanted for a morning meal.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,12
250,Fabulous food and service,"Stayed last night in The Crown Plaza Santry Dublin. We had a King room which was lovely. There was a ceramic scene above the headboard which had little lights in it. Very unusual.  Had a fabulous meal in the restaurant (photo of scallop starter at end of review) and this morning’s breakfast was amazing. The usual hot food, cereals, museli and fresh fruit. Smoked salmon, roast ham, turkey and beef. Soft cheese, Brie and other cheeses. Lovely breads, crossaints, waffles, pancakes. There was even a full honeycomb dripping honey! You could order kippers and poached cod/ haddock. Teas, cappuccino, latte, americano and hot chocolate. I’m sure I’ve left something out!! When we got to our car it would not start as I had left the interior lights on. Reception called Hotel Maintenance and Kieran arrived in 5 minutes with jump leads. Very pleasant young man and so helpful. In no time we were on our way. Great service after a lovely stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,10,12
250,Nice Stay,I will try and keep it simple. The Staff were nice and helpful. It a little old in places but they had updated a lot of the area. My room was clean and I had one of the suites and it was always clean but it could do with a lick of paint the table had a imprinted face on the table. The bar was short staffed so it was a long wait for food . The bar unfortunately was small so you had to sit at a table . The resident bar was at reception area. I could not get a stool at the bar because it’s also open to outside people and I understand you have to make money so I was not to upset. Again the staff were very good and always helpful. I would stay there again . Thanks,4,2019,10,08
250,Hotel stay and service by staff,"I visited the hotel for a conference but unfortunately there was a mix up and due to some confusion the conference I was supposed to attending did not take place at the hotel. I was very upset and distraught when I arrived at the hotel to learn this. I was helped immensely by Olga (the manageress) at the hotel reception. She tried all different ways to ensure that there was a reservation under my name. Spoke with the events manager to ensure that there wasn’t a mistake. She managed to give me a lovely room for two nights for a reasonable price that would not break the bank, given how upset and beside my self I was. She showed me extreme kindness and supported me with dealing with the situation. She has restored my faith in humanity and showed me that there are some lovely, helpful people out there. Olga, thank you very very much for all your help and support. Could not done it without you. The hotel was lovely, clean and had very pleasant and helpful staff. Thoroughly recommend!",5,2019,10,08
250,Staff makes All the Difference,"My brother and sister and I spent four nights here getting ready for and returning from walking the Sheep's Head Way and the Wild Atlantic Way. During a tour of Dublin we lost a passport. The staff of Crowne Plaza Hotel were fantastic trying to help us get everything sorted out. No matter how busy the hotel was, there was always someone eager to help, even finding us a room during a major influx of tourists, when the hotel was actually fully booked. Kristian Brzezowski, Andrei Georgescu and Caio Polcheira at Reception were just amazing. And don't let their names fool you, they all spoke impeccable English. ;-)
Never too busy to help, always willing to make a call, a reservation, get a taxa, show us how to get to the Embassy. The rooms were great, the beds a delight, the cleaning was perfect, but for the three of us it was the staff that made the difference. And it is the staff that will bring us back.
We even had a wonderful waitress named Neeve Hyland, who was a real delight, charming, attentive, supportive, fun and always checking to make sure that we had everything we needed. We really hope the management does everything they can to keep these wonderful people because for the three of us they made all the difference. They were fantastic representatives for Crowne Plaza and deserve all the praise we can give them. They will be the reason that we will come back to Crowne Plaza next time we visit Dublin.",5,2019,10,07
250,Amazing for an airport hotel,This hotel is located close to the airport but also across from a lovely park.  The decor and amenities are great and meet all one's needs if spending an overnight in Dublin when traveling by air.  A really beautiful hotel!!!,5,2019,10,05
250,small Rooms clean ROOMs,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza last week of September and the hotel was very nice. Very spacious lobby and the restaurant and bar was very nice. The hotel is very clean but the rooms are very small. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're catching a flight out of Dublin the next day. This hotel is a great airport hotel.,5,2019,10,05
250,Ready to Go,We stayed at the hotel prior to our early morning departure from the Dublin Airport.   Rooms were good size and clean.  Staff was attentive.  Prompt transportation to the Airport.  Ambiance a little quirky.  Service and food in the bar was good.   Avoid the main restaurant.,4,2019,10,02
250,Great Visit,"I came to Crowne Plaza for dinner with three of my friends. We sat in the hotel lobby and were met by our waitress Neeve. She was more than welcoming, helpful and friendly. The food was amazing. We will return again soon.",5,2019,10,02
250,Last night before takeoff ,"Had a great night sleep before our flight home. Friendly staff, quick service and lovely room. Check in was quick and easy. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. Loved the little extras on the pillow. ",5,2019,09,29
250,"Great Airport hotel, with park across the street.","We stayed here one night after an overseas flight from the states. Not really a 5 star hotel (could use a little updating) BUT for us was a perfect stay.  We were upgraded to a very comfortable, QUIET room with a nice view of park across the street. And were very surprised and pleased with an excellent meal that night. Breakfast was also quite good.  Friendly staff, efficient shuttle to and from the airport.
BIG surprise was the large,beautiful park across the street, wonderful stroll the next am.",5,2019,09,29
250,Did not stay here but used some facilities,"They have a bus that goes every half hour to the airport and services this hotel and the Holiday Inn next door. The drive on 9-18 saw me with our 2 larger bags and asked if he could help. Said I needed them weighed but there no longer is a weigh machine next door and was sent here. He takes the bags, gets a key from the desk clerk and says follow me. I did. He takes us to a small side room, weighs the bags, tells me if we don't need anything in them he will tag them and put them in the storage room and does! Then tells my husband if he is turning the car in tonight and taking the bus tomorrow, have the car rental bus leave him off at station 16 and he will bring him back. WOW! And it happened just like he said. The next morning, we caught the bus and that driver was just a kind and polite and helpful!!!
We ate dinner in the restaurant as we always do when leaving Ireland and the food was quite good although the menu is different and smaller than it used to be. 
Problem was that we had to come here to do our airline check in boarding passes and the computers suck and the printer was out of ink. The front desk clerk said just email it to her -- well Delta does not allow that.  The business center should be up and running well at all times as so many use it. We talked the next a.m. to some ladies who ended up on our plane and they too had issues with the business center but loved the hotel",4,2019,09,28
250,Transition ,"Running around in the morning dealing with logistics of turning the rental car in, getting flights and seats sorted out in preparation of going home, decided to spend the last. Igor in Ireland close to the airport. Convenient location and a free shuttle bus to/from DUB (large bus so there’s room for many). They let us check in early, which was gracious. Room (4th floor, club level) was comfortable and quiet (could hear the odd door slamming in the hall, but not so loud as to be greatly disturbing). Bed, pillows and towels decent quality. Didn’t make use of the bath amenities (brought my own). Club room offered wine/beer and snacks (samosas, fried meat, salami, cheese) at 530pm and continental breakfast in the morning. Coffee (nespresso and a large multi-machine), tea and some soft drinks available throughout the day. Strong wifi signal throughout hotel and in room. Decent stay for what we needed. ",4,2019,09,24
250,Perfect Transition,"After a tough travel day, this was a great first hotel in Ireland.  High end, with all the amenities (bar, restaurant and comfy rooms), I had no complaints.  I would mention that the airport shuttle is large and must park in the tour bus lot which is LEFT out of terminal 2, and in about 100 meters turn RIGHT and walk past a tall modern church tower (God is Love) and LEFT to the bus lot.  On the return, they drop you off at the terminal.  They run every 1/2 hour.",5,2019,09,22
250,Will Highly Recommend,"I stayed in August and what a very nice surprise, it runs as an Airport but very unlike all the other airport hotels, checked in at lunch by Elizabeth , very informative on the hotel and things to do, we were staying for one night,  to continue our trip in the morning, it has been a while since we have been there , a new refurbished bar and the menu delicious. Elizabeth organised a wake up call and we had even a second, so no sleep ins, well worth the stay 
Highly recommend",5,2019,09,17
250,Beautiful location / great hotel but.....,"We stayed for the weekend. We were very kindly let check in very early which was great and we appreciated that. The room was lovely , well decorated, water, beverages, biscuits. Even a fridge and glasses. Also a lovely treat of “this works” sleep mist provided on the bed. - a nice welcome touch. 

Some of the staff are hard to understand but the bar staff were pleasant  and very attentive and the food was good and reasonably priced. Lovely helpful dark haired lady also on reception. 

Set in a pretty area with a few restaurants nearby for a change of dining experience though breakfast is very ample in the hotel in a nice dining room. 

Our main impression was as an amazing hotel at a good price BUT the 4 star instead of 5 is because the function we attended was a disappointment in terms of service and food. The hotel kindly gave us a discount but the complaint was made not for that reason but at the disbelief & to highlight the poor late service & mediocre food served to us at a glamorous function. 

Will return to stay again as overall we were impressed - thank you ",4,2019,09,16
250,So convenient for Dublin Airport,"Sometimes we treat ourselves to a night in this lovely hotel (part of IHG group, we adore Clontarf Castle!) and it never disappoints. This time we got a room on the fourth floor which includes a few lovely extras like the ‘Club Lounge’. Reception, waiting staff, excellent, snacks lovely and main dinner delicious. Room spacious and bed most comfortable. A little bit of luxury!",5,2019,09,09
250,"Great hotel, great employees","It was great to stay here! The room was beautiful and very comfortable.
The employees are all really nice and kind. Caio was really helpful and attentive, thank you! Plus, it was a relief to be understood in my language ;)",5,2019,09,07
250,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here three times and booked again for October.  Always welcoming and very clean.  Food is really lovely.  Reasonably priced hotel situated well for city and surrounding area.  Set in Northwood Park, lovely place for an evening stroll and close to restaurant and local shops.",5,2019,09,03
250,Neeve,"Neeve is beyond expectation. She met our needs more than she had to. We will be back to see Neeve before anyone else. Neeve was the highlight of our stay! As members of the IHG we have stayed in lots of the hotels that IHG represent and Neeve has been highlight of our stay. We would come back, Just to see Neeve as she is a great employee of yours!!!!.",5,2019,08,31
250,Amazing experience,Neeve is absolutely amazing! We have not had better service here! So kind and welcoming. Everyone raves about Edith but Neeve is definitely the better half of the club lounge. Our favorite in the club lounge ❤️,5,2019,08,31
250,Convenient,"Convenient hotel, close to the airport, good shuttle service. Good sized comfortable rooms.
Only negative: eventhough it is a non smoking hotel, there was a smoky smell in the room and hallways.
Nice italian restaurant 5 min walk away , in case you would rather eat outside the hotel.",4,2019,08,30
250,Airport stay,"I’ve stayed at this hotel many times over the last few years as it’s so convenient to the airport, and has a nice shuttle service. I’ve wanted to write a review, but the service this last time prompted me to do it. After traveling quite a lot this last trip, We pulled into the hotel tired. I was frustrated to learn that my hotel points had all expired, but then when the front desk couldn’t find my reservation, I realized I had made it for the following evening by mistake. Not only did Caio (spelling) correct it, he could sense we were tired and frustrated, so was very nice and threw in a breakfast for us. At breakfast the next morning, we were greeted with a big smile from Steph. She was so incredibly nice, and accommodating and gave us the best service, ever. Not only do you want to see a big smile in the morning, the breakfast is always excellent at the hotel. Steph is one of those stand out people that should be in management. I’m a huge fan of this hotel and should point out that the entire front desk staff and bar staff are always so nice and helpful. Look forward to my return early September. Thx! Charlotte ",5,2019,08,30
250,Amazing,"We stayed for a few days in July and we had a great time, from check in we were greeted by Elizabeth and as it happens on check out , had lots of questions to ask and always had a smile and that lovely glint which the Irish are well renowned for, had lunch in the bar and it was amazing. took a few day tours and the country is amazing,

Will highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,08,30
250,Great staff,"Very nice hotel.  Tommy, our waiter at the restaurant, was fantastic. Food was great and reasonably priced.  Frequent shuttles to airport. Check in was fast and easy.  Would come again.  The only quirk is the bath tub...its ridiculously small.  Can't imagine any adults fitting into it... why even bother having it?",5,2019,08,29
250,Great place easy getting to and from the airport,"Room was top notch as I expect from Crowne Plaza, we were upgraded to the executive floor. Had wine, snacks etc.
Across from the hotel is a very nice, safe park to walk or jog in.
We returned a little late one evening and our waitress took our order after she was supposed to cut it off. Edit was great every time we ran into her at both the restaurant and the executive reception. It is because of people like her that we stay at Crowne Plaza hotels when there are almost always less expensive alternatives.",5,2019,08,26
250,OK but nothing special,The Crowne Plaza was ok but I wouldnt recommend it. Its nicely decorated etc but nothing special and expensive for what it is. In same building is budget sister Holiday Inn Express which is cheaper and include's breakfast. Both hotels charge e6 a night for their in house car park which on a greenfield site shows rip off Ireland is alive and well. Try the Premier Inn which is much the same standard and also has nice rooms and free parking and also has a free shuttle to/from airport,2,2019,08,25
250,Great customer service,"Had a great customer experience this evening, brought my wife and daughter to the restaurant. There was this gentleman- Patrick who looked after us. An absolute rockstar , I spent 10 years as a staff trainer and customer experience manager in irelands largest mobile phone network and this particular gentleman is a premier league . I hope his attitude and qualities are recognised by the management. Piotr",5,2019,08,24
250,Still Super Hotel & Bar,"Stayed here recently. Rooms well done, large TVs, well lit, clean, mains & USB power outlets, good AC controls.  Front desk staff helpful.  Cinnabar (Edit) remembers your drink, attentive, excellent service.  Breakfast (in room adjacent to restaurant closed during construction), well staffed, excellent hot & cold choices, great way to start the day.",5,2019,08,23
250,Excellent Hotel,"We spent our last night in Dublin at this Crowne Plaza, Airport hotel.  The room was immaculately clean, had a very comfortable bed and bathroom was well appointed.  The staff was friendly and efficient. ",5,2019,08,22
250,Staff Rate,"So i booked this hotel for me and family to stay in whilst at a 60th birthday party which we all travelled all of the UK for, the hotel its self was brilliant really good, beds were brilliant it was clean comfy up to standard, however when checking in i ensure that i could leave a preauthorisation so that when things are charged back to the room 50% is taken off due to being staff this was not the case, we were told by the staff member that the manager had said it was not allowed because the room was 50% this is very untrue it was staff rate and staff rate was not 50% and even if it was the hotel does not pick the staff rate the app lets you have staff rate as it sometimes is unavailable. I do not get to travel massively because of working in a hotel, its such a shame that on the little time off i have i am denied the benefits and 'thank you' from IHG which is 50% off the bill. I even asked my own hotel if i was correct in thinking 50% off and i most certainly was and they were in shock themselves.",3,2019,08,22
250,Excelent Service,My car broke down just on my way out. I asked at reception a young man Vlad if they have a jump lead or if they can help me. Vlad went to Matthew the Maintenance Manager who had a jump lead and got me back on the road. Absolute brilliant. Thanks again lads. I owe you big time,5,2019,08,21
250,Fab hotel ,"Visited hotel last week, was a little bit afraid it would be near to airport with the sound of planes every hour, never heard one !  Also very nice rooms, great front desk and restaurant service 10/10 will definitely come back soon ! ",5,2019,08,16
250,Exceptional friendliness and service,"It was just great and such a relief.  We drove from the Cliffs of Moher and although not long the narrow narrow roads were such a stress.  WE were thus so relieved to arrive at the Hotel.  WE were pleasantly surprised at how quick the check in was and how easy the parking was.  Special thanks to Shaji and Deepak for being especially helpful and welcoming.  WE recommend this location to everyone!

Andy Kirkpatrick",5,2019,08,14
250,Nice,"Pretty place,and comfortable beds!  Good breakfast buffet!  Hotel shuttle to the airport is nice.  For a 4-star hotel, they kind of cheesy for the toiletries.  There were four of us and there was only 1 tube of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion and 3 towels!  A clean place and I would stay there again!",4,2019,08,14
250,Great Experience and FriendlyStaff,"Whilst checking into the hotel  we got talking to Elizabeth, mentioned it was mine and my grandmothers birthday present to stay at the Santry Hotel,  as a very long time ago we would have come from the Santry aera  and we were trying to locate family she  quickly organised a slice of chocolate cake to be bought to the room with a glass of bubbly, it was the beginning of a great family holiday especially my grans , the room was amazing with all the essentials you require,Very Friendly staff and great location  garden, we did not get a chance to eat as time was a luxury with all the plans that were made.
I would love to return next year.",5,2019,08,14
250,Great service!,"We stayed for two nights and enjoyed dinners and breakfasts at the hotel. Clean and quiet. Easy access to/from airport with complimentary shuttle service and exceptional help from Shaji, who worked the front desk.   We would stay here on our next trip!",5,2019,08,13
250,overnight stay,"we needed an overnight stay before our departing flight and this hotel was perfect
they picked us up in a nice bus with a great driver who was very funny and informative
we were greeted as soon as we walked in and felt very welcomed
we went to our room which was beautifully decorated, the showerhead fell off and the drain barely drained but was taken care of instantly
beds were super comfy and the bar restaurant  was very good
",5,2019,08,11
250,Excellent stay,"Great hotel for travellers. There is a complimentary shuttle bus to and from the hotel very early through to late at night, which is convenient. The hotel had the convenience of having outlets for North American plugs as well (and I believe possibly other places), which was very nice for me.

The hotel itself is situated on a gorgeous park that is nice to run through, and very close to a bus station that will take you into the city centre. 

The staff were all friendly in my experience. The room was quite large (I had the King suite), with a large bathroom and included necessities like a safe, iron, hair dryer kettle, etc. The coffee in the room is just instant. They did provide complimentary water (still and sparkling) each day, as well as tea, instant coffee, hot chocolate, etc.

One thing I quite liked was that the TV had options for connecting via hdmi or streaming from your phone. 

The only downside in the room is that the fridge is not really good for storing your own food---I believe there would be a minibar charge to open it.

The hotel breakfast was a full Irish as well as continental with quite a large selection. It was the same all days I stayed there but enough selection that it didn't get boring.",5,2019,08,10
250,"Noisy Hotel with Rude, Arrogant Staff",Would not stay at this hotel again and I totally regretted choosing it. Strong odour of cigarette smoke and poor sound insulation. Could not sleep with constant banging!!. Poor check in experience. Was exhausted leaving...,1,2019,08,07
250,Good airport hotel,"This Crowne Plaza is easy accessible to/from the airport, including with the hotel shuttle (take the bus at the airport's bus station lane 16). Comfortable and modern rooms. Nice surroundings, opposite the beautiful Northwood Park for a stroll or jog. The breakfast buffet offers many choices to suit all tastes. Arriving at night the reception's dark colours are a bit gloomy, and there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke. The young receptionist's behaviour was at the limit of being rude and we were regretting our choice of hotel, when a more courteous colleague intervened and sorted the issues to our full satisfaction and with admirable diplomacy. We would like to particularly thank Ms Olga for her great professionalism. From then on everything went smoothly, room changes were organised with great efficiency and the comfort of the rooms made us forget our initial impressions.",3,2019,08,07
250,Very little sleep. This hotel has absolutely nose dived.,"Stayed here with my wife after returning from a holiday last Bank Holiday weekend. Indifferent and loud staff. Noise levels resulted in very little sleep for our family. Also a staff member knocked loudly on our door in the morning without any apology when seemly realizing she was at the wrong room. She just muttered to herself. Seemed to be looking for a signature on a form.

250,Good airport hotel,"We spent two separate nights at the Crowne Plaza Northwood prior to/after driving into the Irish countryside.  The Crowne Plaza offers a complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport.  We booked a Club Room which included a complimentary continental breakfast and an evening happy hour with light snacks.  The personnel at the Crowne Plaza were friendly and professional which is always a huge plus.  The continental breakfast included cheese, bread, meats, salmon and cereals – more than enough for a great meal.  The evening happy hour was a bit disappointing in that it lasted only 1.5 hours and did not include any hard liquor.  The beer and wine offerings were fine but we had hoped to enjoy a cold gin & tonic at the rate paid.  That being said, we did fine with the wine.  If my memory serves me right it was a very good Spanish wine. The snacks offered were high quality and replenished as needed.  If we were to return to this hotel, we would not book a Club Room as the value was not sufficient to warrant the cost (our total room rate was over 250Euro/night).",4,2019,08,05
250,Quick visit for Athletics at Stadium,"Excellent hotel, spacious rooms, exceptionally clean, decor plush. Bathroom fully equipped, shower and bath. The 4th floor club lounge was a treat with beautiful views of the park. The staff were friendly helpful and had and excellent attitude. We eat in the bar both nights and the food was good, hot and tasty. If I had to be picky/constructive it was a little slow and service, laying of the table done in front of one guest and not  individual spaces. Couldn't get a Bloody Mary! The ice machine on the 4th floor wasn't working, but had no sign to say sorry visit another floor. I would stay again.",5,2019,08,04
250,Great hotel and service,"Travelling alone for an early flight out of Dublin. Hotel is very near the airport and easy to find. Highly recommend, staff and facilities are of very high quality. Also a special thank you to Shaji on reception.",5,2019,08,03
250,Very nice,"End of a long few weeks travelling.  Just needed a place to stay for our early flight the next day. 
Staff was very nice and friendly. Rooms were spacious and clean. 
Shows in our room was very small and had inconsistent temperature. Otherwise, very happy with our stay. I’d come back for sure. ",4,2019,08,03
250,"Comfortable Hotel, Minutes from the Airport","We chose this hotel on the end of our Ireland trip to be close to the airport.  This is a lovely hotel.  Modern, spotless and the service was excellent.  Our room was spacious.  Came with sparkling water every morning, a huge closet, a big screen TV, a safe for valuables, etc.  The bathroom was also very nice.  Huge tub and good shower, with lots of hot water.  The bed was very comfy with lots of nice, puffy pillows.   The front desk were awesome.  They directed us to the bus a few blocks away, the #16, that took us right to the center of Dublin.  They even changed our paper Euros into coins for the exact fare needed.   We ate dinner here twice.  The restaurant is a Thai themed place, and I enjoyed the Singapore noodles....   Service in the restaurant was excellent.  Attentive without being overbearing.  Nice wine options too.
  On our last night we ate from the bar menu and they did an excellent fish and chips.   Free shuttle back to Dublin Airport.  The shuttle driver was so friendly and very nice.  He went above and beyond for his bus full of mostly American tourists.   Nice stay.",5,2019,08,01
250,Terrible,"I stayed here using my points....wish I did not. Hotel is run down, gloomy, and seedy.  There is no lounge, bar to sit and have a cocktail. Staff at reception just 'doing their job'. No customer service. The room was average...beds were hard.  No ambience whatsoever. Could not wait to leave.",2,2019,07,31
250,"location, quality, accomodating","first rate rooms, fabulous and patient staff handling some rude customers bickering among each other at check-in, breakfast buffet, 5 mins from the airport, car park next door--what more could you ask for? Tip: don't buy the b&b. Go with the continental bfast and upgrade to save a few euro; stay away from the restaurant with outdoor seating a block away.",5,2019,07,30
250,great customer service,the stay was wonderful. the free handy phone for local use was very very handy. the hotel staff was courteous and very caring particularly the front desk staff notably shaji. room service was great and shaji was always asking me if I need anything else to make my stay better. overall a great and satisfying experience. ,5,2019,07,29
250,Lovely Service,"Hotel staff were very helpful and the service is nice. Especially Shaji who served us drinks and continued to cater to us well past bar hours. Shaji also made sure we were happy with our orders. 
.....",4,2019,07,28
250,Fantastic rooms staff and service,Was staying here with two associates while working in the area. The hotel itself was beautiful and in the perfect location but what stood out above all else was the service we received from the night server Shaji. We had take out delivered to the lobby as we were served our drinks and we ate there and were treated as though we were seated in a restaurant. Would highly recommend and would like too thank Shaji again for his service.,5,2019,07,27
250,You Might enjoy your stay if your a smoker,"You might enjoy your stay if you are a heavy smoker. From the moment we walked in the door all we could smell the smoke. In the restaurant with our kids, in our room, even the bedding stunk of smoke. We had two rooms both had bad water pressure. We woke to the sound of construction going on in the hall outside of our room @ 7:30am. This was the most expensive hotel in five cities we visited in Ireland and by far the worst. We stayed in beautiful luxury properties in Galway & Cork & small boutique properties in Dingle & Kindale. Sad to end our trip in this smelly hotel.",1,2019,07,23
250,Convenient!,"Close to Dublin Airport with regular free transportation to and from the airport. There is a bus stop nearby for easy access to the heart of Dublin for 3€ each way. The hotel is comfortable and the restaurant is nice. On our first night the restaurant was closed because of a private function. Fortunately, the closure allowed us to discover a nearby restaurant the Gourmet Food Parlour which had excellent food. Located on the same property as the Crown Plaza is a less expensive Holiday Inn Express.",4,2019,07,22
250,Great place to stay before flight ,"This hotel is great for Dublin airport being less than ten minutes from terminals. Friendly staff clean rooms with large shower and separate bath. Really comfy beds and nice extra touches in room. Dining area a little basic but I was surprised by the quality of the food... better than some Irish hotels. Good breakfast. Would recommend .
",4,2019,07,22
250,Bar visit,Bar was under construction so sat into the lobby area. Was a visit before catching our flight. We were highly accommodated with great food and a great service by Tommy. Will definitely be returning. Thank you Tommy!,5,2019,07,22
250,VERY CONVENIENT AIRPORT LOCATION ,"Chose this Hotel due to location primarily and the fact we had an early flight. We dropped our Hertz Hire vehicle at the airport previous afternoon and caught the hotel transit bus to our accommodation- approximately 3 minutes. Situated in a quiet, leafy area of Santry with a nice little park just over the road. Warm reception, room very comfortable with all amenities. They do serve light snacks and drinks on ground floor, adequate. If you want to dine more comprehensively there are other venues in the immediate vicinity.
Shuttle bus timetable to airport is every 30 minutes from 4.00am and is comfortable and reliable, - completely suited our flight circumstances. Would definitely stay again.",4,2019,07,20
250,A very nice surprise,"We had a group of 10, five rooms, for one night before flying out. I had booked this for convenience and price, so I was very happily surprised when we checked in. The location is quite nice with some restaurants in walking distance. There is a lovely park across the street to wander through. Check in was easy and our rooms were ready. We felt the lobby, the public areas and rooms all were quite attractive. Our room and bathroom were lovely and more than comfortable. Our one problem was that our A/C was not cooling our room enough. We called and a gentleman arrived within minutes. He checked to see if it was properly turned on, which it was, but he could tell it wasn't cooling properly. He offered to move us to a new room or he could bring us a fan. As we had large windows in the room we could open we chose the fan. By the time we returned from dinner the room was quite comfortable. The front desk called a taxi for us the next morning and checkout was quite easy. Every staff member at the hotel was professional and welcoming.",5,2019,07,18
250,Lobby,"Visited hotel today with my family for some food and drinks on our way to the airport, although the bar was under construction we were able to get seated and eat in the lobby area. Service was fantastic with our waiter Tommy being particularly attentive and very friendly. Food was also good and served very quickly! Will definitely be back and recommending to others!",5,2019,07,18
250,Wonderful staff - pity about the noise.,"I only have good and positive things to stay over the hospitable and wonderful staff in particular at the Crowne Plaza in Northwood Road, Dublin.  Sadly the experience is tarnished by the obligatory contingent of ""special"" guests who check out at 4 am in the morning (most noticeably, flight attendants), slamming doors behind them and waking up all other guests within their immediate vicinity.  Those flight attendants reading this, please just exercise a little bit of consideration at 4 am in the morning and close your door gently before you leave.

Thank you.",3,2019,07,17
250,Needs cleaning and remodeled,"We had high expectations according to reviews but we had a room that the shower had lots of mildew and mold, not properly cleaned.  The bathroom sink looked to have been painted and most of the paint was chipping/ coming off, needed to be replaced and guests not placed in this room.  The room smelled of cigarette smoke but was a non smoking room . The sheets did not properly fit the king size bed and you could see the mattress around the top under the pillows. The comforter was too small for our king size bed and would not cover both of us.  The size of the room was adequate as well as the staff were excellent upon arrival and check out.  Food was good in their lounge area.  Would not recommend unless all this is taken care of...",3,2019,07,16
250,A grinding machine for air travelers,"I am struggling to find something nice to say. The rooms are small, a very slightly faded industrial look, room service that can't get orders right after two repeats, and a staff too used to people coming and going to really care about anything except not being inconvenienced. The bright spot was the morning shuttle driver. He was purely 5 star. Can't conceive of why I would every stay there again.",3,2019,07,14
250,Best staff we've seen at any hotel defo worth a stay,"We have just left the Crown plaza after a 2 night stay and feel it defo is worth a good review. Arrived on Friday after a long drive from the North to be greeted with a friendly smile from the lovely Olga, she was so friendly and helpful throughout our stay and really needs regonised for being an excellent asset to the hotel. Also a mention to Tommy on the waiting staff as he went above and beyond when we had an issue and got it sorted with no hassle at all. We will definitely return thanks again all.",5,2019,07,14
250,Well Worth the Stay,"We had an amazing stay recently, we were going to Croke Park for a football match and it was an ideal place to overnight, it was a lovely surprise to be greeted by Elizabeth who we had met last year and who remembered us, we had no delay in check in, chatting about the football and having a great laugh. the room as usual was amazing, very nice view and the all that we required, 
we had a delicious breakfast the following day, and the result was what we wanted, we will be back in the next few weeks
Thank you to all",5,2019,07,13
250,Excellent airport stopover,Reliable shuttle every 1/2 hour. Comfortable and spacious family room. Very close to airport. Good choice of food in bar. Staff exceptionally attentive. My go to place @ Dublin Airport from now on. In delightful surroundings if you want to go for a walk or jog. ,4,2019,07,12
250,Server in the lounge,"We are from Canada and would like to applaud the server we had two evenings in a row in the lounge/restaurant at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport.  His name is Tommy.  Tommy was attentive, personable, friendly, and was willing to share thoughts about menu items, whiskeys, and places to walk nearby. In our experience, he went above and beyond as a server!",5,2019,07,12
250,Absolutely wonderful,Calo and Olga are the absolute BEST.  Every question I had was answered with no hesitation and they even helped me order Chinese food.  I could have had an easier time. Plus the rooms are absolutely wonderful.   Great place cheers!,5,2019,07,11
250,Spot of lunch ,After a walk in the park it's a lovely place to go for a pint or some bar food . The menu is good Cesar salad is to die for . Nice to just relax and have a conversation . Staff are very friendly with great table service. To stay or just pop in I recommend highly ,4,2019,07,11
250,"Disappointed with the cleanliness, otherwise OK","When I arrived at the hotel, the check in was quick and friendly. I took my cases to the room, and upon inspection decided I could not stay there. The bathroom was very unclean, with mould and dirt all around the door seal. Reception then gave me another room, which was exactly the same. Eventually I was put in touch with the Manager on Duty and Manager of Housekeeping (who agreed with me that the standard of cleanliness was a problem). We toured around what must have been up to 6 different rooms, all the same poor standard. They agreed to give one room a 'deep clean'. What a difference!! Finally a clean bathroom. The rest of the stay was uneventful, but tarnished by my initial experience. Dined in the restaurant one evening, and the food was nice. The Club Lounge was OK, not very many options food wise, but reasonable for breakfast.",3,2019,07,11
250,Great stay!,"Check-in was seamless, the staff were friendly, hospitable, and warm. The shuttle from the airport to the hotel was on-time and easy to use. There was a close-by public transit bus that goes straight to city centre dublin. The rooms were clean and cozy, and the food was delicious. Then, when we were leaving, Tommy (staff of hotel) took the bus all the way from the hotel to the airport with my whole group to make sure we made it safe and sound. So incredibly helpful! I would go out of my way to stay here again!",5,2019,07,10
250,great overnight stay prior to morning flight ,"My husband and I and our young adult daughters stayed at this hotel at the completion of our self drive tour of Ireland.   We were allocated interconnecting rooms, a pleasant added bonus. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. I really liked the layout of the ensuite with lots of shelving space.

We were able to park our rental car out the front, check in and leave our luggage in our rooms prior to returning our rental car to the airport, an easy 10 min drive away. After returning our car we were able to catch the free shuttle bus back to the hotel. The next morning we were also able to catch the free  shuttle bus from just outside the hotel back to the airport for our mid morning flight.

We did not dine at the Crowne Plaza but choose to have dinner at the Gourmet Food Parlour, less than 5 mins walk away.

I would recommend this hotel for anyone needing to stay close to Dublin airport.",5,2019,07,10
250,Westlife weekend,"My sister and I stayed over the  1st July weekend to attend westlife concert . The hotel was clean. The staff were friendly and so helpful. Our stay was made stress free by how lovely all the staff were and so willing to help us and facilitate our requests . My sister has special needs and our room was wheelchair friendly the bathroom spacious and appropriate to our needs. All staff from  start to end of our trip  from room service , bar Resturant reception staff accommodating to our requests . Lovely hotel and our stay made  all the  more memorable by the kindness of the hotels staff 
Would recommend hotel and definitely will be back again 
Thanks",5,2019,07,08
250,Friendly Service,We ate in the bar last week and was served by a lovely gentleman named Tommy. He was so friendly and didn't mind chatting to us despite being busy. The food and drink were amazing along with the service. Thanks again to Tommy and the staff there. Will return again soon.,5,2019,07,05
250,Amazing Service,I recently visited the hotel with my sister for food as we were on our way to the Leinster Football Final. We ate in Cinnabar and we were served by Tommy. He recommended his favourite food to us and it did not disappoint. He provided us with amazing service and was extremely friendly. Thanks again to Tommy. Will definitely return for food again some time soon.,5,2019,07,04
250,Fantastic Dublin Airport Hotel,"I picked this hotel simply because I needed to be close to Dublin airport for an early flight. I was so pleasantly surprised. The rooms are great with everything you could need. There is an executive lounge with drinks and snacks. Best of all, it is across the street from a wonderful park with walking paths and pretty vistas. This will now be my #1 choice for Dublin airport hotels. One noteL there is a big, nice shuttle to the airport, but the day I traveled it actually filled up and a couple of people had to get a taxi...so consult with hotel staff about timing.",5,2019,07,03
250,Overnight,Great stay for one night. Nice clean and spacious room. The staff was lovely and very helpful. Walking distance to a nice mall area. Close to Dublin Airport and the shuttle service made it easy to get back and forth. I would definitely stay there again.,5,2019,07,02
250,Excellent Food and Server!,Had a long travel day. Were really hungry and tired. Ate at the restaurant. Great food but even better server...Tommy!  The staff coverage seemed very limited but Tommy made sure all of our and the other diners’ needs were met.  He is a great ambassador for the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport. The hotel is lucky to have him!!,5,2019,06,27
250,"Thank you, Tommy!","Our family settled into the holiday inn express before our flight back to the US and needed a walkable place for dinner. After evaluating menus, we chose Cinnabar. Our waiter Tommy was delightful, helpful, and friendly. He asked about our trip and made recommendations from the menu. We were happy with our food and he made sure to meet our specific requests. When I questioned how a specific menu item was, he assured me that if I didn’t like he he would bring me a replacement meal. We really appreciated his professionalism and friendly manner. Thanks, Tommy! You epitomized the friendly nature that the Irish are known for. ",5,2019,06,26
250,Perfect end to incredible Ireland trip!,"Crowne Plaza Dublin was the perfect place to end our 10-day visit to Ireland. We arrived late the evening of June 25, and Olivia and her incredible co-worker (whose name I’ve misplaced) greeted us professionally and warmly and were super helpful in making us feel comfortable and welcomed. Highly recommend this beautiful, well-situated hotel.",5,2019,06,25
250,Business Visit,"Very well located Hotel. Staff are extremely friendly and the food is good also. Edit was great, she was one of the most friendly staff I have ever encountered and made sure I had everything I needed at all times.",5,2019,06,24
250,bar great food and service!,"Staying next door with a pal at the HIE and went to Crown Plaza for a much-needed drink - it was made perfectly! and then ordered some food too - which was great. our server Tommy was really wonderful - attentive and friendly.
just go there already!",5,2019,06,24
250,Restaurant in the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport,"We were at this restaurant on 6/23/19, our server was Tommy, he was amazing, very attentive to us very friendly. I give him a 5 +. Very professional and attentive, a wonderful experience for our last eve in Ireland.",5,2019,06,23
250,Amazing Stay,I had promised to leave a tripadviser for this hotel on checkout simply because we had been looked after so well on our stay. The warm friendly atmosphere from the staff warrants the height of respect. These guys go up and beyond to make your stay at this hotel a very memorable one. Thank you to Conor and Tommy in the bar who delivered excellence with our every request. A definite return to this hotel is guaranteed.,5,2019,06,23
250,No airport sounds,This hotel was far enough away from the airport to avoid the noise but close enough that their shuttle gets you there in 10 minutes. Very nice room. Staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was very good but lacked customers because the majority of the guests that evening appeared to be attending a massive family reunion in the banquet hall.,5,2019,06,22
250,THANK YOU,"Amazing hotel to stay, from start to finish, attending the Sports Surgery just minutes from the hotel, did not have a reservation as we had not planned to stay, met Elizabeth who had us organised and checked in very efficiently, the room was lovely and added bonus as we needed a walk in shower, had delicious scones and tea in the tea room, overall a great stay,will highly recommend.",5,2019,06,21
250,Gets the Job Done,"Stayed here for one night prior to a flight to Rome which left very early in the morning. Had turned in a rental car at the airport and their drop off was next to the hotel shuttle point (which is the equivalent of full-size city bus so plenty of room). Property is a good ways away from the airport so don't even think about hoofing it. It is a typical style business/airport hotel with the expected amenities. Reception was quick and friendly enough. Our room (#150) was decent sized and faced a rooftop, but we were there for the convenience only. En suite was a little tired, but otherwise everything worked. Property was quiet. Great thing is that the shuttle starts to the airport at 4:00am which was perfect for our early flight. Note: It is the same large bus as before, so no issues as people lined up and started to eye the much smaller van that was the only thing there initially until the bus arrived. Would stay there again if waiting for a flight.",4,2019,06,20
250,Great Club Lounge Service,"Excellent service in the Club Lounge by Edit. Very well organised & exceptionally professional service with a pleasant smile.

I cannot fault this hotel, its staff or quality of the rooms & service provided.",5,2019,06,20
250,Worth the Visit,"We had an amazing time from start to finish, were greeted by Elizabeth who was amazing to deal with, very kind and sincere as we had a child that was very active and noisy, we had a great room on the 3rd floor, room 337 with a very nice view of the park, this was so amazing as we did not expect it, we took the girls for a long over due walk and this tired them which was great as they had an early night, we had dinner in the Cinnabar with a glass of wine and this was an end to great stay.
Thank you all,",5,2019,06,20
250,Very Good,I stated one night at this Crown Plaza a very quick ride from the Airport. The hotel offers a shuttle bus service to and from the Airport Terminals. I chose a taxi at around €11.Arrived late for a quick and convenient turn around. Room upgrade to a club room with high comfort and excellent facilities. Too much for one person. Very helpful staff. The hotel was busy. The breakfast nice. I liked the friendliness of the staff and their helpfulness.  Would consider staying again for convenience of airport. ,5,2019,06,20
250,First class service from start to finish,"First visit to this hotel. Check in was excellent by the receptionist. She was was very helpful and informative and explained in a very sensitive way that my room had a shower for a wheel chair user. Not sure how to react to this at first but thought give it a go and it may be a pleasant experience. Room was very well decorated and clean and bathroom was obviously spacious. All mod cons and lovely large and easy to use TV and also good WiFi access. The bed and pillows were really comfortable for me and ensured a good nights sleep. The other guests were not noisy coming and going so that helped as well. The shower was fine and roomy and provided me with a unique experience. If you were very tall this may prove problematic as the shower had a fixed height. 

The evening meal in the restaurant - which had an Asian influence was superb. The starters of scallops was the best I have had for a long while with the Singapore noodle main course a close second. The service was  first class. Breakfast was also good with the usual selection on offer except for poached eggs? I should have asked if this was an option as I did not fancy scrambled but in a hurry. Irish soda bread was a must to try and die for. The check out was with the same helpful receptionist who remembered me by name - not sure how she did this with the amount of guests but it was most appreciated? All in all a very enjoyable stay and experience.",5,2019,06,13
250,Restaurant Server Outstanding,"We enjoyed the Asian-influenced meal at the Crown Plaza Hotel restaurant the evening before our flight back home -- a nice departure from pub fare we had the rest of the trip. ""Tau"", our Brazilian server, was outstanding. After the restaurant realized it MIGHT have served good containing gluten to our table (despite the menu detail indicating it was gluten-free/wheaten-free), Tau did everything possible to fully investigate the situation, to confirm there was NO gluten in the food served, and she knocked herself out to ensure that every dish was absolutely gluten-free and to care for us. As a result we enjoyed the dinner, enjoyed the service and had a wonderful meal.",5,2019,06,10
250,"Okay room, bar staff needed","We had an average small room with a broken wall lamp. The mattress was softer than we preferred but that is always a personal preference. The bar area was packed at 8pm with one waitress serving 15 people in the furniture area outside the actual bar. We sat at the cafe counter and the waitress said she would serve us there. Despite that, the food we had was great.  ",3,2019,06,09
250,They think of everything and then some!,"Our 2nd time at this Crowne Plaza. Chose it this time not only because of its proximity to the airport but because we were so pleased the last time we were here, 4 years ago. 

We arrived quite early- late morning and were prepared to just drop off our bags before heading into town. Our room was available so we were able to unpack and get settled. 

The room had everything one can wish for and then some: USB outlets on either side of the bed to plug in devices, a North American style outlet, an ice bucket with an ice dispenser by the elevator on each floor and the piece de resistance, a courtesy smart phone one can take into town during our stay. 

We were also delighted with the walk-in shower, as the typical very deep and narrow bathtubs we’ve encountered throughout Ireland have been a challenge to us as mobility-challenged seniors. 

The Crowne Plaza has been the perfect place to chill out after a fast-paced tour of Ireland before heading back home. ",5,2019,06,06
250,"Nice hotel, good service","Comfortable and clean, with very helpful staff.  Particularly helpful to me was an employee by name of J'Haji.  I am kind of an early riser and couldn't get in the Healthclub. He stopped what he was doing and made the trip up there to get me in. His attitude was great.",5,2019,06,06
250,Excellent service,"We checked in at 2.30pm had a great service at front desk,rooms are very clean and had a great room service,staff was so friendly evening staffs are very good at their service .Break fast was excellent overall we had a great time highly recommended again the break fast was excellent",5,2019,06,05
250,Great Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights in the Crowne Plaza Santry on a recent trip to Dublin. The hotel was fantastic. Our room on the fourth floor was spotlessly clean and well furnished. The club lounge was relaxing. Breakfast was exceptional, with a huge range of food. The bread was the highlight! Staff in all departments were courtious and helpful. We'll definitely stay here again",4,2019,06,04
250,Stay before flying,"One night, since I had an early departure the next morning.     The hotel was very comfortable, with a lovely bed, plenty of work space and excellent WiFi.   Staff were very good.

The hotel, like all Dublin ones, was expensive, but I had points which reduced the cost considerably.

For some reason I got a disabled room, so the shower was designed for someone sitting - the maximum height you could raise the head was about 5 feet - not much good when you are 6 foot 2!    If not for that, I would have given 5 stars

A comfortable nights sleep, then far too early a start to get home!",4,2019,06,02
250,Very good hotel overall,"5 minutes drive from the airport with lots of features and multiple (popular) meeting rooms.

Positive:
Cheap car park €6 per day adjacent to hotel
Large bar area with multiple seating areas and TV screens
Asian focused restaurant
Upgrade to a suite
Club room access with great service
All round staff excellent
Well appointed and comfortable room
Great buffet breakfast
Large flat screen TVs with great choice of channels
Excellent WiFi

Negative:

Air con too cold and fixed at 20c
Poor shower",4,2019,05,30
250,Outstanding staff,"Stayed 2 nights beginning of May and came back for 2 nights the end of May. Hotel is clean and comfortable. Restaurant and pub are both great.  But the reason we came back, was the staff!  One gentleman in particular went out of his way to see that our needs and concerns were taken care of.  Huge thank you to Caio for his assistance.  He is an asset to this hotel! Thank you Caio!",5,2019,05,30
250,Modern,"After 3 weeks of touring Ireland and staying in B and B’s, I was in sensory overload with how modern this hotel was.  We are spire elite ihg members and was very impressed with the whole hotel.  My room was large, my bathroom was very spacious ( had a soaking tub and separate shower) water was provided and it was quiet and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helpful at the front desk and they even helped me load my luggage upon the complimentary airport bus, so I could grab a quick togo breakfast since I was running a little behind.  Great way to end a beautiful trip to Ireland. ",5,2019,05,27
250,Jacob and Stephen Communion Party,we had a family communion in the Fahrenheit Room of the hotel. anything we asked for was looked after the room set up was excellent and the staff made sure our day couldnt have went ay better. a special meanion to gabby and darren who looked after us throughout the day and even when we needed to alter the room to add some more tables and chairs hey were very helpful in meeting our demands. everyone enjoyed the service within the hotel and had a great day. I would highly recommend the hotel for functions. Thanks again.,5,2019,05,24
250,Surprisingly wonderful,"We chose this hotel for our last night in Dublin simply because it was close to the airport and we could use our points. Who knew it would turn out to be such a gem? Lovely rooms with sparkling water and a wide assortment of coffee, tea and cocoa. Staff were helpful and friendly. The bar was awesome. We met the most wonderful locals there and had a great last evening in town. Honestly I've never had so much fun just hanging around a hotel.",5,2019,05,23
250,Cinnabar is the best,"The restaurant inside the hotel is an amazing option for food and drinks.  We were served very quickly, and our server Tommy was gracious and kind.  Ask for Tommy when you get in for great service! We will definitely be back!!!",5,2019,05,22
250,Hotel Bar,"At a recent overnight stay at the Dublin Airport we stopped in Crowne Plaza Hotel Bar. Met a lovely young man, Lee, who was the bartender. Made us some perfect Rusty Nails. Glad to have made the stop.",5,2019,05,22
250,"Such great staff, excellent food, amazing fish and chips.",We popped over to the crown plaza for a quick bite at the bar. We we're not disappointed. The service was prompt. Started out with a lovely dark Guinness. Patryk was especially helpful and recommended the fish and chips. Soo so yummy! We also had the ribeye steak which was cooked to perfection.  Would highly recommend.,5,2019,05,22
250,great choice for airport hotel,"Had two rooms for one night prior to flying out the next day.
We had requested rooms close together, reception staff went out of their way to organize adjoining rooms which was greatly appreciated; also pointed out  breakfast	was much cheaper when booked ahead, which we did and enjoyed one of the better hotel breakfast buffets.
The rooms themselves were a bit dated but spacious, well equipped and comfortable.
Overall a very good choice for Dublin airport and providing the price is reasonable, I would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,05,22
250,Better choice than Airport Hilton,Reasonably close to airport with excellent check in experience. Very pleasantly presented hotel immediately adjacent to a great park ideal for walking or jogging? Has a club floor however due to some hiccup did not open for breakfast as scheduled so had to use main restaurant which also appeared short staffed. Notwithstanding these issues this would be my airport hotel of choice by a long chalk!.,5,2019,05,21
250,Front desk person was amazing when I checked in,"Several things were unique about this hotel and check-in: I am rarely recognized as a IHG Platinum member but was at this hotel. I was told I qualified for an upgrade, but their suites were only doubles/kings, and I had reserved two twins. [We quickly sprang for a king!] But I am rarely offered an upgrade and never has someone explained that I could be upgraded if I were willing to move to a double or king. Desk person went out of his way to help me understand and give me an upgrade!",5,2019,05,12
250,Outstanding service,"Excellent hotel with great location and exemplary service. The free hotel shuttle to the airport is dependable and convenient. On our departure date we were down at 7am and were offered tea/ coffee by the smiling Shaji, who was manning the front desk.  The bus that goes to center city Dublin is very near the hotel and hotel staff were very helpful in helping us navigate the city by bus, which were extraordinarily comfortable and timely.",5,2019,05,12
250,Best hotel in Dublin,"This is my second time staying here and I wouldn’t recommend another hotel in Dublin.  The staff is so friendly and helpful! Especially the Front Office Manager Kristian. The rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable.  It is about a 20 minute bus ride in Dublin City and perfectly located on Northwood Park.  All the peace and quiet you can ask for!  The restaurant is delicious for a quick bite to eat. I can’t wait to return! :) ",5,2019,05,10
250,Best choice at Dublin airport,"Well maintained with spacious rooms. Easy to airport in the am. Friendly shuttle driver. Although we did not eat there, looked like good food options. 15-20 minute taxi to Dublin city proper. I’d use this property again.",4,2019,05,05
250,dinner only,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door but we had dinner at the Crown Plaza.

Service was very good - the food even better. 

Prices reasonable - get the Irish Beef burger. Atmosphere very business like.",5,2019,05,03
250,Comfy Bed - Close to Airport,"I booked this hotel because it had good reviews and a free shuttle from the airport.  We were only in Dublin for the night, arriving late and leaving around midday the next day.  I emailed the hotel about the shuttle and they responded promptly.  The shuttle runs every half hour from 4:00 to 23:45.  The beds were very comfortable and the room nice and clean.  The staff were courteous and helpful.  I would definitely recommend for the convenience.  If you are staying in Dublin for any length of time you might want to be closer to downtown. ",4,2019,05,03
250,"Very helpful and friendly staff, comfortable stay!","I stayed at this hotel for a work trip. The bedrooms are very comfy with all the facilities you need to have a great stay. The staff are the most friendly and helpful people I have experienced at any hotel. They go out of their way to ensure you have a good stay at the hotel. Shahji, one of the waiters was particularly great. Highly recommend for excellent customer service!!",5,2019,05,02
250,Great Place to Stay,"We arrived after an all night transatlantic flight expecting to just drop off our luggage for the day.  The desk clerk went out of his way and had a room ready for us even though it was 11 o'clock in the morning.
The hotel is in a great location and had shuttle service back and forth to the airport as well as in walking distance to the main road.
The room itself was a decent size and the bathroom was a good size for the 4 of us.  The only thing lacking was rails and/or hooks to hang the towels on after being used.
On checkout, the clerk was great and very helpful as we had issues in the business centre.  Nothing like being treated like you matter.
Definitely left a good impression of Dublin!",4,2019,05,02
250,First class service,"Another fantastic few nights at the Crowne Plaza. Booked into a club room as well worth use of the club lounge. The service here is friendly and first class with Edit in the club lounge happy to look after you whilst relaxing with drinks and snacks. 
The rooms are so comfy you just want to go straight to sleep and wake feeling a great. 
Perfect location for the airport but only a short taxi ride to some great restaurants in the local area if you want to make a break from the hotel.
Don’t forget to take a stroll around the lovely park just across from the hotel.",5,2019,05,01
250,Tommy Rocks!,Cinnabar has great food and drinks!  Tommy took real good care of us!  He accommodated my special dinner requests and when we couldn’t handle the salty marinade on the black olives he took them off our bill when we didn’t even expect it. ❤️ Ask for Tommy and you’ll be given great Irish hospitality 🍀,5,2019,04,29
250,"Clean, close to airport friendly staff","The hotel is in a nice quiet location. The majority of the staff is friendly. I used the shuttle to the airport it was a short drive. We ate at the bar restaurant a few times food was good. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices, but at 17.00 too expensive. We were on the second floor the room was clean, two small complaints we bought drinks for the room thinking we had a place to keep them cool the refrigerator was an old mini bar and did not keep anything cold why not replace it with a real refrigerator?  the other minor complaint the trash can in the b/r too small. Overall I would stay here again if I ever return to Ireland.",4,2019,04,27
250,Cinnabar Restaurant,"We are staying next door, but the goat cheese toasted sandwich and the prawn crackers we just ordered at the Crown Plaza restaurant was the best thing we have eaten in all of Ireland, and we have been here for 3 months!",5,2019,04,26
250,Nice rooms in quiet location near airport.,"Nice rooms in quiet location near airport.
Excellent airport shuttle service - best of all airport hotels - every 30 mins.
Rooms have been modernised.
Inca Coffee bar in lobby as well as restaurant and bar.

Club Lounge avaialble for IHG Elite Members - for Happy Hour and Breakfast.",4,2019,04,24
250,A lot of static voice,"The room was terrible there were a lot of static voice from fans and power supplies that could not be switched off. Dont go if you like to sleep.

They call them selves an airport hotel but it is quite far from the airport.

Not good especilly to the high price.",1,2019,04,17
250,Shuttle service,What a mess! There was no shuttle service between 1 and 3 from the airport on Saturday. Eventually when the hotel's mini bus came people were rude and pushed to get on the bus. When we eventually arrived at the hotel tired and miserable we got the warmest welcome from reception.  Olga empathised with us and made the checking in process delightfully seamless leaving the earlier disaster but a memory. Thank you for the friendly warm welcome and I will definitely stay again but I would suggest sorting the shuttle service.,4,2019,04,16
250,"Delightful location, great place to stay before flying away","I wasn't keen to spend our last night in Ireland in an airport hotel. I was wrong. The Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin is located next to a lovely park with walking trails through trees, a stream with 2 swans. The on-site Asian-theme Touzai restaurant (again, not usually a favorite of mine) was excellent, with tasty gluten-free options. The bed was comfortable, the room was well appointed and quiet. I would stay there again for sure!",5,2019,04,16
250,Great Hotel close to Dublin Airport!,"We stayed here for one night prior to leaving Dublin. Its close to the airport. The shuttle is shared with the Holiday Inn Express right next door. At the airport, the shuttle lot is a short walk from Terminal One through mostly covered parking. Shuttles run every 30 mins and is convenient. They run either a full size bus when most flights are arriving and sometimes a smaller shuttle bus. 

Check-in was quick and easy. The ambiance at this hotel is quite contemporary. Our room had 2 beds and lots of space. Room was very neat, bright and tidy. Bathroom was clean and nice. Room even had a mini-fridge which is a nice bonus if you want to store anything cold. Rooms are quiet and relaxing. Wifi was strong and had good speed. 

Breakfast was quite good with many selections. I enjoyed this and would recommend adding it to your room rate if its not already included. You can enjoy a great breakfast to start your day. Checkout was quick and easy also. Shuttle service back to the airport is easy and convenient. They can drop you at Terminal 2 (right at the Terminal) or at Terminal 1 (in the shuttle parking lot). Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,04,14
250,Tommy was great,"We stopped in to get dinner after a very long 2 days of traveling  and exploring Dublin. Perfect spot, great food, and Tommy took great care of us. He was on top of everything all night long. Highly recommend!",5,2019,04,14
250,Good if you need to be in the area,"We stayed at this hotel one night before heading out to the west to start our tour of Ireland. 

The hotel was comfortable, the buffet breakfast was excellent and so was our dinner the night of our arrival. Service was wonderful too.

I didn’t like the car park next to the hotel. Pretty tight compared to what I’m used to but there’s no other choice.

The hotel is good if you have to be in the area and are mobile. There doesn’t seem to be much to do nearby.

My friend forgot a necklace in the room. It wasn’t found unfortunately. ",4,2019,04,14
250,Good Breakfast!,Enjoyed a brief stay here on a business trip. Room was spacious and quiet so I got a surprisingly good night’s sleep. The breakfast was good too. A wide selection of food to set you up for the day. Would recommend to anyone visiting on business.,4,2019,04,10
250,Mr George edge,"Working as an engineer from England in Dublin for the past 11 months and have stayed at this hotel pretty much every week Monday to Friday, lovely rooms , great food and I am regularly looked after by the lovely Edit who can never do enough for me , so nice and always be smiling always looked after me every time it's a pleasure to be served by her always greeted with a big welcome, she is a credit to the hotel Andy can't fault her atall.
George",5,2019,04,09
250,Great Visit made  by the fantastic staff,"I have been here many times but the latest hospitality was worth a note  , from Edit in the lounge, she is always welcoming and remembers by  favored  drink  .. thanks Edit !   Tommy in the bar restaurant again pointed me in the way I needed ... not a big plate !, thanks Tommy . They were both fantastic, on many visits to Dublin this hotel has proved the best, its now my first choice.",5,2019,04,08
250,"Very, Very Nice....","Just spent 3 nights there. Overall really impressed with the hotel, staff all very helpful. I'm a light sleeper but found the hotel very quiet, slept really well.

We had breakfast there every day but not dinner. We had continental breakfast but the options were huge and fresh so did not feel the need for a cooked breakfast but to upgrade to cooked was not expensive anyway.

The only slight downside to the hotel is that it is a little outside the city. We had a hire car so getting about was easy. The car park was next to the hotel and 6 euro a day to park. Very reasonable.

If you like running or walking there is a beautiful park just across the road from the hotel. 

Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Really good place.",5,2019,04,08
250,"Superb staff, great location","Stayed march 20, 21 March, 2019. Very impressed by the kindness and friendliness of front desk staff - Elizabeth is a charmer. Room on the fourth floor was super comfortable, spacious, and had everything a traveler might need. Everything in the hotel was spotlessly clean and well maintained. I used the 4th floor club room for breakfast and afternoon coffee, great view of nearby park. The park is a huge plus - right outside the front door and perfect for walking or jogging. It is a beautifully maintained park with pathways, workout stations, and some stately, old trees. Ten minutes from the airport and less than 30 minutes from city center, taxi outside and bus service nearby. In all, I was really impressed by this place, one of the best IFG properties i've stayed in.",5,2019,04,07
250,Friendly staff,"Had a few drinks with a friend in a bar, and a dinner in restaurant. Singapore Noodles  are amazing. Jomet and Neeve are very professional and friendly. Restaurant  staff Lionel and Justin are super attentive.",5,2019,04,07
250,Staff were so pleasant and helpful,While staying at the hotel the plug in my laptop blew a fuse in the room. Matthew Daly went out of his way to actually put a new plug on my laptop charger and was so pleasant and friendly to top it off!! Thank you Matthew!,5,2019,04,05
250,The Very Best,"Mu first time visiting and staying, and all I can Say is WOW, from the arrival to the departure, met Elizabeth who checked us in and had our itenary planned for the 2 days we stayed,. we visited the jameson Whiskey and Kilmanim Jail, what a great history.
We had breakfast in Touzai recommend the Omlettes quite delicious.
We did not get a chance to stay in the hotel to eat but they have a great menu, Rooms very spacious and all the amenities.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",5,2019,04,04
250,Great trip with Scottish Schools Athletics Team,"Fantastic room and food. Service from staff great, in particular Shane the Transport Manager who was excellent. We had a large coach to park and 36 children so his help and safety advice for crossing the road was invaluable.",5,2019,04,03
250,Top service,"I've been coming here most weeks for over 18 months now. It's not fun being away from home that often but the staff here make it a lot easier. A big shout out to Peter, Edit, Olga and Sylvie - nothing is ever too much trouble for them.",5,2019,04,01
250,Excellent Service and kind staff.,"Got to my first hotel and found they had no booking for me. With a quick search and booking, I got a room in here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. 
Shadi, showed me the way to the car park and was very knowledgeable about the stay and park here. The receptionist was quick and understood that this was an emergency booking and found my booking very fast even when I only booked it about 20mins ago. When settled and needed a drink, Shadi spotted me and asked if everything was o.k. and if I needed anything.
I asked for a glass of water and within minutes I had my drink.
I wish all hotels were this helpful and efficient.",5,2019,03,31
250,Edit varga excellence in service ,"Edit Has been amazing member of the staff at Crowne plaza hotel Dublin airport.
Many of our colleagues who stay here have complimented on her amazing customer detail and Customer satisfaction. It is a pleasure to stay in the hotel with the service provided by Edith and we look forward to seeing her every time we come back
",5,2019,03,31
250,Convenient and comfortable,Stayed here on an overnight stay before heading to Spain. Arrived early in the morning - room wasn’t ready which was understandable but the hotel is able to store luggage. We headed into Dublin via taxi (reasonable). Hotel is clean and comfortable and very convenient to the airport. Recommend.,4,2019,03,31
250,Family Visit,This is our first visit to Ireland and the first leg of our adventure. The Crowne Plaza was the hotel which was booked and reccommended to us by friends. This hotel is amazing from great comfort  to helpful friendly staff. Gemma was amazing in the Bar who could not have been more helpful and professional. She tended our families every need. I reccommend this hotel to anybody considering a stay.,5,2019,03,28
250,Great customer service!,"Beautiful, clean hotel with great bar area and restaurant. They are very helpful with any information of the city. Great customer service especially from front desk receptionist Shaji who provided all services needed!",5,2019,03,23
250,Perfect business stay,"I totally love this place as a centre for business, it’s so friendly and helpful.
Just found the 4th floor club and it brilliant.  The host Edit is very helpful. It is a must if in Dublin. You will not be disappointed. Worth a stay
",5,2019,03,21
250,Anna was so incredibly helpful!!,Anna my server went above and beyond the call of hospitality.  She was so understanding and supportive to my needs and concerns.  Delightful experience in the midst of my long journey.  All of the staff were gracious and helpful.  The food was delicious and the room lovely and has all the extras that make travel relaxing!,5,2019,03,20
250,Excellent customer service,My friend and I were well looked after by Rachel. She was attentive and friendly. Look forward to next time I get to eat and drink here. Drinks and food reasonably priced with great choices to suit all. ,5,2019,03,19
250,Excellent 2-night Stay,"Enjoyed my stay here - again as I was an IHG Platinum Elite member, I was given a complimentary upgrade to a club room with access to the club lounge where I was able to have breakfast and evening drinks with canapes. 
I opted for the breakfast in the restaurant (which was complimentary at the time) as there was a better selection with more items! 
My room was very cosy and the wi-fi worked really well and was super fast. 
Loved the decor. Amenities were also really nice. 
Would definitely stay here again in the near future. 
I also admired the tranquil and picturesque surroundings of Northwood Park",5,2019,03,16
250,Perfect for a night. ,"Walking in the lobby and bar look quite outdated.  However, the floors are decorated so lovely.  The rooms have a gorgeous feel to them. So tastefully decorated, it’s like a boutique hotel. 

Breakfast was the usual. If you like a full Irish breakfast then you’ll enjoy this.

It’s an easy drive into the city and around €15/20 per trip.

",4,2019,03,14
250,Well Worth the Visit,"I normally do not stay at the airport or review a hotel however with the weather we are having an decision to make, I met Elizabeth, had no reservation made, but that was soon rectified, had a great room on the 3rd floor nice view, all the required amenities you wish for, even forgot the toothbrush, did not have to leave the hotel as the reception had them, ate a lovely meal in the bar, busy with sport on the TV but to be expected.
We had an amazing breakfast at 9.30am great chef on duty cannot remember his name, great eggs.
Will highly recommend this hotel for staff and food.",5,2019,03,13
250,Fantastic welcome,"I am just after checking in to this hotel and I received an amazing welcome from Olga and Olivia. I was tired after a three and a half hour car journey and the two ladies made me feel so welcome.
I could not believe that Olga remembered my name even though I had not seen her for three or for months. She obviously takes great pride in her work and is extremely customer focused. This is not something that you see very often in hotels nowadays.",5,2019,03,10
250,Holiday ,I chose this hotel by default because of its proximity to the Dublin airport. But I would definitely choose to stay here again. Accommodations are good and the park to walk across the street is excellent!  And Tommy my bar/food server was AMAZING!  So helpful and attentive.  I only ordered coffees but he took care of me just as well as the surrounding tables who were both eating and drinking. ,5,2019,03,10
250,A little piece of home,"When staying away regularly you are always looking for somewhere to stay that makes you feel welcome, home from home. I always look forward to returning to this hotel because the staff are so good. I feel like I need to give a special mention to Olga, Sylvie, Edit, Olivia, Beth and Caio who are always so friendly, welcoming and helpful.",5,2019,03,10
250,"The best airport hotel, hands down","This hotel is, by far, the best airport hotel  in which I have ever stayed. It is clean, secure and comfortable. The food is good and the bar first class.  The staff is friendly and professional. The airport bus runs like clockwork and the driver professional and helpful. This was the 3rd time that I have stayed and every visit was perfect. And to top it all, it is very affordable! Highly recommended.",5,2019,03,07
250,Home from home,"I stay in this hotel Mon-Thurs every week for the past 18mths with my colleagues and have to say that the staff are the greatest asset to this place, they welcome you with pleasant smiles and are always willing to do what it takes to make your stay as comfortable as possible. 

A special thanks to: Olga, Sylvie, Olivia, Beth, Edit, Peter and Shaji - you really make the Crowne a home from home for us! THANK YOU",5,2019,03,06
250,OK I suppose,"It’s an airport hotel so I suppose you shouldn’t expect much in the way of character or charm. It’s OK, the staff are OK, the service is just about OK. It’s not great value for money and though it’s fairly close to the airport they run a shuttle every half hour which is also OK, I suppose.
The rooms are comfortable enough. The breakfast fairly expensive and just less than OK if you go late, loads of dirty tables stale luke warm food, stale Luke warm attitude from the staff. 
There must be better places to stay for over 150 euros or cheaper places that are also OK. 
As the premier Holiday Inn brand ...must try harder.",3,2019,03,03
250,The staff are a credit to this hotel!,"We stayed here for a girls weekend as it was cheaper than staying in the city centre. The city is easily accessible by bus from the hotel and it has a shuttle bus running to the airport every half an hour.

We were checked in by Olivia, who was very helpful and friendly. She gave us tips on what to do and where to go, so thank you Olivia!

The room was great, nicely decorated, we felt 
very calm. We ordered room service on the first evening (Friday 1st). Thank you to room service for handling all of our questions/needs.

The bar/lounge area had a relaxed/ambient atmosphere. There was a good range of gins, which we were pleased about.

Also a special mention to Neo, for making the most delicious cappuccino and providing impeccable service.

",5,2019,03,03
250,Lunch,"Great lunch, Chicken wings to die for.  Also Ciara our host was so helpful and friendly. I wish all staff are as good as her.  Will be back for lunch. Lunch menu for all taste. Glass of coke abit small. May be go for water instead next time",5,2019,03,01
250,Pleasant Surprise,"We stayed in the hotel as we were attending a family event locally  Although it's about a 35 minute drive from City due to heavy traffic very near the airport, it's easy to find and surprisingly nice location with a great running track.

Chek-in was prompt and the staff very friendly and helpful with directions, thanks Beth. We had a room on the Club Floor (4th floor) where it was relatively quiet and offered internet access and coffee and capanies with wine in the evening but were unable to avail of this lovely treat .

The rooms are well appointed, quiet and the shower was great with lots of hot water and good water pressure. The AC/Heat worked very well.

We had the opportunity to eat breakfast both days in the hotel and there was a wide variety of choices, reasonable prices, 

We would definitely stay here again should we need to be in the area for any reason.

Room tip: I would recommend an upper floor, especially the club level (4th floor) it was only 30.00 for the upgrade.",5,2019,02,28
250,Well worth the Stay.,"we had amazing stay in this hotel last month, we had planned to travel back to Donegal but the weather hit us badly, we rang and made reservations with Elizabeth who was so pleasant on the phone and that the room was ready when we arrived checked in by Elizabeth as well , all the mod cons, had a delicious meal in The Cinnabar and just relaxed for the evening, very compy bed great sleep, had an amazing breakfast the following day, will highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,2019,02,26
250,Always good.,"I've stayed at the Crowne Plaza Northwood many times since 2008. The rooms are quiet with comfortable beds that ensure a good night's sleep. Staff are polite and attentive in the lobby, restaurant and bar and many know me as a regular. My colleagues and I often use the 4th floor lounge where we are always recognised by Edit who takes good care of us and makes everyone feel very welcome there.",4,2019,02,25
250,Well groomed hotel close to the airport.,"Had a chance to stay here due to a cancelled flight and as always the brand lived up to its expectations mostly. 

The Executive room had some nice touches like a free to use mobile phone whilst in the city and clean, fresh and modern styling inside as decor.

The restaurant downstairs is Asian fusion loosely speaking but a bit westernised probably to give it more appeal to the hotel market rather than specific dining for this type of cuisine. The chilli beef with rice was fairly decent though. They need to address the free knats flying about though as that was a bit annoying on occasion as they dived bombed you!

The only issue I discovered was that the rooms have stiff walls between them which means you can hear everything next door. Extensive experience at IHG hotels has been that they build the walls in concrete or block presumably to reduce noise between rooms; not the case here. Just pray you don’t get an amorous coupe of noisy contractors sharing a room like me!

They also need to put some bakery items out with the coffee at reception for us wary starters as we miss breakfast which’s starts at 6am.",4,2019,02,25
250,Wonderful stay,"I stayed in this wonderful hotel for business event for 2 days, an amazing place to stay with a personalized service from staffs especially from SHAJI, who made sure all the minute details. Thanks Shaji. Not to mention hotel has very good dining option with a very nice ambiance, and varied options to select. Overall i had a very relaxing and peaceful stay. will come back, Thanks",5,2019,02,24
250,Good Hotel,"Spent a few days on business. Staff friendly and efficient. Room nice, clean but some tlc wouldn't go amiss for example chipped floor tiles in bathroom, dirty grout in shower, but small niggles only. Bar OK but feel it does not need football to be shown on all screens in bar. ",4,2019,02,22
250,Great Staff and food,"I’m basing my review on the three times I visited this week 

The staff are very friendly especially the waiter during the time I visit which is 1900-2030, 

the food is great with a wide choice on the menu.

Both these reasons are why I keep coming back, friendly service and great food, well done to the management",5,2019,02,19
250,Great hotel,Great hotel in vicinity of Dublin airport. One impressive thing about this hotel was discontinued use of plastic bottles for water and soft drinks. They had reusable glass bottles for both. Rooms are okay size not very spacious. Limited options to eat out around the hotel,4,2019,02,09
250,Enjoyable Stay,"Chose the Plaza even though the rate was higher than Holiday Inn next door, we had stayed there last trip and were put off by noise from building work. Could see construction work from the bedroom window here too but thankfully as it was weekend all was peace & quiet. Our stay also coincided with the Six Nations Rugby and we were able to find a table in the bar & watch the match on the big screen. Food and service here was very good along with the drinks. I had booked a club room with exec lounge access which is where we found ourselves next for evening snacks and drinks...again very enjoyable. 
Good nights sleep in our room, large well lit bathroom with double shower and bath. Breakfast taken downstairs as club lounge was closed on the Sunday morning before taking handy shuttle bus from the hotel to airport.",5,2019,02,07
250,One of a Kind,"Arrived at the hotel, before lunch time, was great to have a room ready as we had not the best of mornings, the Clutch in the car went and it took time to have another car brought to us and with a 12 month old baby I need not say anymore, I remarked to my husband John I would need a coffee when we checked in, and to our lovely surprise a knock on the door with coffee and scones, the small things that do matter, thank you Elizabeth for making our stay so relaxing, the bed linen and toiletries were amazing, My husband took our little one to the park and I just relaxed,, 
We ordered room service WOW, the staff were amazing.
Thank You CPH for a very nice stay and will highly recommend",5,2019,02,06
250,Stay here and not next door at Holiday Inn Express!!,"Highly, highly recommend this place! I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express right next door (which is apparently run by the same ownership or management, I'm not sure) and this is by far ten times better. In fact, for the additional 7 Euro or some minimal amount that is the cost difference between the two, there's absolutely no question this is a much better investment. 

The hotel is beautifully furnished, makes you feel like you are in luxury the entire time you are there. The staff is helpful and friendly and the rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. The bathroom is very spacious, with a gorgeous bathtub, and there is even a guest lounge where you can partake of snacks and drinks in the late afternoon/early evening. 

The breakfast in the morning was very plentiful and highly enjoyable. If I'm ever in Dublin again and need to stick close to the airport, this is definitely the place I will be staying again. The shuttle bus to and from the airport is free and efficient.",5,2019,02,04
250,Last Good-Bye to Ireland,"After 4 full days in Ireland, the hotel made the perfect fair well, as we on the next day left.
The hotel was beautiful and the service was warm and kind,with a special thanks to Oliwia and Caio from reception who made us feel like home. Thank you!!",5,2019,02,03
250,Made our overnight very special ,"Huge thanks to the staff at CPDA...stayed here last night to attend our daughters 21st Birthday party nearby. Staff made a beautiful ""special"" breakfast for her this morning which was such a special touch. I have to say this was one of the best night's sleep I have ever had away from home. Top class facilities, clean and bright...with super staff! We will be back! Thank you so much",5,2019,02,03
250,Rugby weekend ,"Well it’s Six Nations time again and the game of our seats England - just wonderful 
Again I am back to my favourite hotel which just never disappoints 
Ten minutes from the airport via the hotel courtesy bus 

Again greeted by outstanding check staff - the delightful Olivia and the relatively new Caio - these people just want to do all they can to make your stay as pleasant as possible- a delight 

Then of course there is Liam - if ever anyone was designed to work in the service industry then he is your man
Answers and the best possible advice - couldn’t ask for better 

Outside the hotel there is a bus which gets to Dublin City Centre in approx 20 minutes- 3euros per grand but you must have exact money 

Then of course off to Landsdowne Road to see the wonderful Irish 

How much better can life get
 Pint of Guinness please!!",5,2019,02,02
250,Great service,"Awesome service & help from Shaji.  
Clean rooms, nice staff. 10 minutes from the airport by car. Bar closes around 11 or 11:30 but they will continue to serve drinks in the hotel lobby until 2 am 
Decent parking garage.",4,2019,01,30
250,Amazing,"This unique hotel is located in a quiet location in Northwood Santry beside a beautiful park, we sere greeted by Beth who had us checked in very quickly and was given all the information about locations and the hotel, very impressed.
The rooms are spacious and well laid out, but there is a lot of variety in fixtures and water pressure varies greatly on upper floors. 
All the staff are very friendly and always acknowledge you.
There is an excellent restaurant with bar that has many TV’s.
Easy accessible to the city, the bus walking distance from the hotel,, will be back",5,2019,01,29
250,Nice hotel and convenient to airport,We stayed here just before and just after going on a trip from Ireland to mainland Europe.  They held our bags which was convenient. There is a shuttle to the airport and back and there is an easy bus route that takes you right into the city center.  Staff was great. For some rooms they have a little phone you can use to travel into Dublin.  We forgot to ask for one but it is a cool idea.,5,2019,01,26
250,"Top notch, good hotel","I stayed here overnight recently as I was flying out from dublin Airport. I erturned after previou good experiences and once again I had a great experience . The food was excellent in the bar, the bedroom was really comfortable and the staff were great. This is a top notch hotel, the shuttle bus to and from the airport is very handy.",5,2019,01,23
250,Amazing weekend!,"Had an amazing overnight stay in this hotel for my birthday. Booked 3 double rooms which had king sized beds and were very modern and spacious. I was greeted with complimentary prosecco and fruit in the room as a birthday gift, as well as very helpful, attentive and friendly staff at check in. Breakfast was outstanding - by far the best hotel breakfast buffet I have ever attended - from a traditional Irish breakfast to waffles and pancakes to smoked salmon and a cheese board! There's something for everyone. Free hotel shuttle bus to the airport is brilliant and runs every half an hour. Will definitely return!",5,2019,01,21
250,We'll be back!,I have heard great things about this place so decided to give it a go last weekend for some food and drinks. I have to say it didn't disappoint! The hotel is lovely and modern and we were served immediately by very friendly staff in the bar. I cannot fault the food or the service. We stayed on for drinks once we had a bite to eat due to the great atmosphere. I will definitely be back!,5,2019,01,20
250,Amazing,"Had such a fantastic overnight stay here. Was getting away from home for some rest and relaxation and have to say the staff here were amazing. Stayed in one of the bars for the evening, looked immaculate and the service was great, really personable, quick, efficient and effortless. Room was clean, comfortable and had everything needed. Food was delish. Would recommend to anyone!",5,2019,01,20
250,Great service,"Went to the hotel for some drinks with some friends and have to say the bar was amazing, the staff were very friendly and attentive to anything we asked for while we were there.
Got served by Honey who was fantastic and spoke to the manager Eoin who was very informative.
Would definitely recommend people to go visit it.",5,2019,01,20
250,Love this place,"Dropped in for a bite to eat and a couple of drinks with some friends. The food and drinks in the bar were fab but what makes here great is the service from all the staff, they are amazing. I've never written a review before because I never had a reason to but the Crowne Plaza deserved it. Attentive, friendly, smiley and just fun to be served by. Can safely say we'll be back!!",5,2019,01,20
250,Regular ,"We are always popping in to the hotel for a drink... the service from Anna and her team is fantastic.. friendly chatty and such a pleasant young lady.. always a great welcome and look forward to going back 👍👍
",5,2019,01,16
250,Just what we needed ,We stayed here on the last night of our 10 day trip round Ireland. When we hot here we were seen to straight away and had the warmest welcome from Olga at the front desk who not only allocated us a beautiful room but really just read our tierd faces and offered some helpful suggestions for a relaxing stay. Really just made our last night terrific and its the small touches like this that will bring us back again. ,5,2019,01,16
250,Excellent service!,"I stay here 5-6 times a month and every time staff EDIT does not stop to suprise me. She is outstanding and always exceeding expectations! Great smile, positivity and attotude towards her job! Thank you and will see you again soon!",5,2019,01,13
250,Superb service ,On my first visit to Dublin in January stayed at the Crowne Plaza and had a pleasant and relaxing trip. Very friendly bar staff. Got served by Tommy and enjoyed my visit. Will be back again to get a latte! ,5,2019,01,11
250,Great service by tommy!,"Great stay in the crown plaza as usual! Great service and coffee, served by Tommy who was great and very entertaining! Would recommend this place to friends and family. Great style and atmosphere as well",5,2019,01,11
250,Excellent customer service ,"Brilliant service in the executive lounge from Edit from Hungary. The staff here are always great but Edit stood out. She is so attentive, professional and a lovely person to chat too. We look forward to returning again soon CP Dublin Airport! ",5,2019,01,08
250,Great Location for Airport Access,"We stayed one night at each end of our recent Christmas/New Year's trip to Dingle.  I believe they have a shuttle service, but we had a car.  It's a very easy five minute drive from the airport to the hotel.  Not traffic problems.  They had an attached garage for parking (€6 per night paid for separately).  On our first stay we arrived late and the only food option was room service.  We opted for just drinks in the bar.  On our second stay we had dinner in the bar.  They also have an Asian themed restaurant - we'll try it next time.  The front desk was efficient and helpful.  We stayed, both times, in the Ducati Suite, a room themed on Ducati motorcycles.  It was very unique and very comfortable.  Great bed and pillows.  Great bathroom.  Comfortable seating area.  Two TVs.  We had access to the club lounge and used it for breakfast on our first stay.  It was comfortable and offered good continental breakfast choices. The computer in the lounge was not working on the first stay, but they have computer access in the lobby area where I was able to print what I needed.  The lounge computer was working on our second stay, and I printed our boarding passes without any issue.  All-in-all we totally enjoyed our two nights here and will use this hotel in the future.",5,2019,01,07
250,Excellent service ,"First time staying in this hotel and it’s simply beautiful!
Rooms are comfy and very clean. But I’m very impressed with staff. From first moment, check in, I felt very welcomed. I would like to give special thanks to staff from restaurant, all of them, but special highlight to Leigha and Keith, who made me feel like I’m at home. Great job! ",5,2019,01,05
250,Will stay here again!,"The Crown Plaza always seems to get things right. I loved the fact that a free device is there for you to use to travel around Dublin. It’s like a pocket tour guide. Next time I’m here, I’ll be sure to use that! The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are friendly and efficient. The free shuttle to the airport is a real plus!",5,2019,01,05
250,Very good stay,"I stayed at this hotel for a week on a business trip. Service excellent, restaurants good (sweet potato fries and garlic sauce my favourite), even loved the nearby park to chill at  after work (beautiful garden during autumn!). The decor of the room was a little too dark for my taste but I know there are different room types. As I was working nights housekeepers could be more mindful and not bang the doors in the corridors during days so harshly as I couldn't sleep well. Breakfast great.",5,2018,12,27
250,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN,"our room was excellent with a large shower and bathtub. the room had 2 bed with a desk and sitting area. room also includes a hip phone called a ""handy"" allowing you to get travel tips with idea and payment. also on this Poppin new phone you can make international calls for FREE. There were free Cookies for the kids. the room was gorgeous with 3 different types of outlets. there is a SPECTACULAR fish tank in reception with a very gorgeous restaurant. Truly the BESTEST hotel of all tine.",5,2018,12,21
250,Poor,"When I checked in, I was only offered a room with two queen size beds rather than a king size bed.  Further, despite my platinum status, no upgrade was offered.

Further, while great emphasis was placed on the fact that the hotel focuses on aiding sleep, the air-con in my room was noisy whether turned on or off (especially at night).  The sleep aid sprays were also only provided occasionally.

Finally, my room was in the 'quiet' zone but on the Friday night, there was a party in the hotel and there were drunk guests slamming doors to rooms in the quiet zone repeatedly during the night and shouting in the hallways - the hotel took no action to stop this or ensure the guests for the party were located together.

All in all, a very disappointing experience.",2,2018,12,20
250,Plaza lounge ,I regularly stay in the CP Northwood and it’s always a good experience but I have to say Edit is fantastic she is very courteous and attentive in the club lounge. Making the experience great and worth the money! ,5,2018,12,18
250,"Lovely hotel, great staff","I stay here quite often with work. A great hotel with super staff in all areas.

The bar staff are particularly good, making the sometimes lonely business trip night pad by quickly with some lovely banter with your evening beer.

Particular recognition for Simon behind the bar who is always full of craic, or something else perhaps..... definitely makes the night a fun affair",5,2018,12,18
250,Great hotel,Love this hotel in Dublin near the airport. Located near a shopping area and great restaurants. You can take the bus near by to the city takes about 45 min. There is a park opposite the hotel where you can walk or jog,5,2018,12,17
250,One night in Dublin,"Nice. Offers airport shuttle, nice hotel. Close to airport . Decent breakfast buffet. Cute rooms and the staff was very helpful. About a twenty minute ride from city center. 25 euro cab drive but good if you’re not staying long. ",4,2018,12,16
250,What the doctor ordered,Fabulous stay at this hotel. Greeted with a friendly smile by Beth in reception-very helpful. Delicious breakfast the morning after. Friendly staff over all. Clean rooms and well presented. exactly what the doctor ordered!,5,2018,12,07

250,Food and drink at cinnabar,I was staying near the Crowne Plaza Hotel last week where I was greeted by a warm smile and excellent customer service from Kim behind the bar. I was served food and drinks at the bar and I was looked after very well even though it was very busy. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends and I'll definitely visit again if I ever return to Dublin. ,5,2018,12,04
250,Great Hotel,"The hotel room was clean and well presented.

The bed was spacious and comfortable.

The bathroom was very large and had a great shower

250,5 Star,"Another great stay in a crowne plaza hotel. A 5 star standard which is expected & always recieved from an IHG hotel. Checked in by beth. Went for dinner at Touzai-delicious, hats off to the chef. Room was adequate size. Ideal airport location. Fantastic stay, credit to all staff!",5,2018,11,29
250,Very nice facility and generally good service,"We had an event at this hotel's convention space.  It was a very nice hotel with comfortable, clean rooms.  It has a very nice finish to the property and we enjoyed t very much.
We did wish there were sufficient staff to keep the coffee and water on the tables fresh.
Overall we were very pleased with our stay",4,2018,11,28
250,A lovely stay,"Overall a great experience, friendly staff, lovely room and delicious breakfast and meal. Only gripe (and a very small one) was the quality of the breakfast coffee. But already looking forward to staying here again .........",5,2018,11,25
250,Nice Airport Hotel,"Stayed with my sister as we had an early flight the next day! They provided a complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport and was very prompt! Check in was very efficient! We arrive about 10pm and was leaving at 4am, so we asked if it was ok to not put a pre-authorization on my card as it was just a quick stopover and the receptionist said it was fine which we really appreciated!",5,2018,11,25
250,Great Location,"An ideal location if travelling to the airport, this hotel provides a shuttle which is just a short distance from the airport which ensures you dont have to worry about booking a taxi for your flight! Less stress way of travelling. Beth checked us in. Used the gym in the morning, a smaller gym than i am used to but done exactly what it needed to. Overall a great stay, would highly recommend.",5,2018,11,23
250,AMAZING,"We spend some time at this beautiful Crowne Plaza and we were not disappointed, from our entrance to the very end of our stay, were greeted by Beth who recommended us to have dinner in Touzai which was delicios we had the early bird and highly recommend , the rooms were spacious and immaculate, we had a delicious breakfast and had a great stroll in the park.
Will highly recommend  and thank you to all the staff in the hotel , will be back :::",5,2018,11,23
250,Location is great! Staff are customer service focused,We stayed here as a family of five for one night before taking the ferry back to London. It was great as still managed to explore the city centre before heading back to England. We had dinner at the restaurant and for some apparent reason they served our food one hour later! But they genuinely apologise and took care of our bill. A few of the waiter and manager on duty even came to apologise and told us if we wanted more food it will be on them!,5,2018,11,20
250,It’s Christmas!!!,"The first thing to greet me after a particularly difficult and long day was the amazing christmas tree in reception which really brought a smile to my face. Next was Szylvia (hope I spelled it correctly) in reception who made my checkin experience so easy.
As a spire elite member I received a room upgrade (thank you!) and spent a few minutes in the club lounge, where Edit could not have been more accommodating.
This is truly one of the hotels where customer comes first and I could not recommend them more.
Will definitely return.
",5,2018,11,19
250,Excellent Service,"Hi.  Ive been staying at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport for the last 6-7 months and have enjoyed an excellent level of service from all members of staff especially Edit in the Lounge/bar for her great service and friendly personality and Szilvia on reception  for being both friendly and efficiently checking you in with no fuss.  Both really go the extra mile.  Looking forward to another few months at this hotel.  Thanks, Craig.",5,2018,11,19

250,Thanks for a lovely stay,"We have stayed three times now in the Crowne Plaza and this Hotel keeps getting better thanks to its superb staff and beautiful Hotel. We checked in to be told we had been upgraded to the  4th Floor and were able to avail of food and drink from the Executive lounge. When I said how delighted I was to the girl at check in I told her it was our wedding anniversary too, which she didn't know, so it was extra special. Our room was gorgeous and all the staff were so friendly, we returned from the bar to find a bottle of bubbly and a fruit platter in the room with a card wishing us a 10th Wedding Anniversary, how fabulous was this after being upgraded too. We attended an awards night in the Hotel with over 300 guests. The staff were amazing, so efficient and helpful, always checking the tables, the food was beautiful and every course served piping hot and with no delays, the dessert was amazing too. This must be a fabulous hotel for a wedding with this quality of food and service. Thank you for a fabulous stay and a great night and we will see you all again next year.",5,2018,11,13
250,Long term stay,A brilliant stay. The hotel staff are superb. Great Club Lounge. Edit from the Club Lounge is an angel. Will be back for sure. Rooms are great. Breakfast is good and Chef Louis is a grafter and a talent.,5,2018,11,13
250,Clean and nicely located,"Close to the airport but in front of a beautiful park where you can walk, meditate and relax. Mall 20m walk.
Rooms are confortable, clean and well decorated.
Front office staff is very helpful, speacially Olga! She’s super friendly, professional and great sense of humor.
Ive Stayed there in October  for 6 different occasions.",4,2018,11,13
250,Probably the Best Dublin Airport Hotel,"We have stayed at several of the Dublin Airport hotels but the Crowne Plaza surpassed all our expectations.  We had eaten in their 'Touzai' restaurant previously but this was our first time to stay here.  The hotel represented great value for money.  They have a regular half-hourly courtesy bus from the airport.
Our room was excellent - clean, comfortable and very well equipped with great lighting including good reading lights beside the bed.  The bathroom facilities were superb having both a bath and a separate shower.  Even the corridors showed a bit of class with good carpeting and interesting art.
We were very struck by the courtesy 'buddy' phone in the room and notices in the bathroom offering to supply extra items such as disposable razors etc free of charge. We didn't need to use these services but it was great to see them offered.
A bonus is that the hotel is just opposite a gate to the Santry Demesne which is a nice place for a stroll if you have time.
The breakfast was first class - great freshly cooked fare.  Plenty for a vegetarian to choose from and the scrambled egg was cooked to perfection which is a difficult thing to achieve in an hotel breakfast.
The Crown Plaza will be top of our list when we next need a Dublin airport hotel.",5,2018,11,12
250,"Close to airport, near the park","We had nice stay there during Dublin marathon. Sportsmen could train in park. There was alson stadium nearby and fitness room in the hotel. 
Tasty brekfast and good choises for group dinner. Also nice conference rooms. And we enjoyed last evening party and rockband.
We also could leave our luggage in the hotel and spent last day in citycentre. This was quite long drive by bus and you can pay only with coins, that was only strange thing.
Loved this place.",5,2018,11,08
250,Excellent hotel,"I stayed here for an event on Friday 2nd November and this hotel is top class in every aspect. The service is great, the rooms are spotless and the food is fabulous. I would highly recommend it. I would definitely return again.",5,2018,11,07

250,Amaizing staff,Hospitality at its best in Ireland. The staff and the hotel is perfect for a short visit. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Good amenities. Beautiful park outside. Good pub that serves excellent food and drinks. Most of all Mr Shadi at the front desk impressed me with his loyal hospitality and excellent customer service skills. Definitely will be back.    ,5,2018,11,05
250,Good Hotel,"Stayed here to be near airport for early flight out. Double room, comfortable beds. Nice size bathroom, shower and tub. Shower was small, took long time for water to heat up. Staff helpful and accepted our e-mail to print off our boarding passes for American Airlines. Shuttle from Airport to hotel was timely and prompt, very helpful driver. Would stay again.",5,2018,11,04
250,Food to die for,"We were stopping at the Holiday Inn Dublin Airport, they don’t do evening meals but there sister Hotel The Crown Plaza next door has a lovely restaurant and we decided to give it a try, 
From start to finish it was a very lovely experience, the staff are very welcoming and the service  provided by Lionel and Justin was superb, I had Chicken Satay with noodles and it was truly delicious, this was my first time trying noodles and I will definitely have them again, I then had hazelnut brownie, oh my god it was so heavenly.
Will definitely come again",5,2018,11,04
250,You know what you get with Crown Plaza's,"Hotel was a short shuttle ride from airport.  We took at bus into Dublin city which took @ 30minutes. The bus stop was a 5 minute walk from hotel.

Breakfast is in very good quality with decades options. 
It is worth",5,2018,11,01
250,My Airport hotel choice,"The rooms are Comfy and clean.  I love that you get a bathtub too! Staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent, great choice and fresh. Shuttle service to the airport, what else do you need? ",5,2018,10,31
250,Great hotel near the airport!,"I spent 2 weeks in Ireland and I think that this property was one of the nicest hotels that I stayed in during my trip.  The hotel is near the airport, has a lovely park across the street, a frequent shuttle, breakfast, clean rooms, and a comfy bed.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2018,10,30
250,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"I am an employee of Crowne Plaza in New York City and I stayed here for one night as it is close to Dublin Airport.  This hotel was AMAZING.  They offered a free airport shuttle which ran every (15) minutes and was very convenient.  The front desk was friendly, efficient, and VERY knowledgeable about the area.  They were able to provide us with a map and transportation options.  We returned to the hotel after midnight and the business center was closed but they were kind enough to let us in to print our boarding passes.  The room was EXTREMELY clean and VERY comfortable! We will definitely be back to stay here when we return to Ireland to visit family.  We will also be recommending this hotel to everyone.  Thank you for the lovely end to our two week trip over home!",5,2018,10,30
250,Great,"Had a fab stay in begining of the month. Beth checked us in, she was very helpful. She recommended we eat in the hotel that the food is delicious! High quality of customer service which is to be expected of this hotel! Peter in the bar ensured we had a great night. Hotel was tastefully decorated. Great hotel and great staff. Thank you very much! Highly reccomend",5,2018,10,28
250,Wonderful comfortable Accomadating,"This Hotel is definitely the best hotel that I have ever experienced. Every aspect of meet and exceeded my expectations. I stayed on the 3rd floor, but believe me we had the best night's sleep. Check- in was fast and very friendly by Elizabeth the staff were impeccably professional. Elizabeth recommended so much for us to do , but as we had a car highly recommend us to go outside Dublin, visited Enniskerry, Greystones and Wicklow in gerneral ,I brought my wife here as a Birthday Gift and the made it special for her, a lovely touch were the bathrobes and lavender spray a complete nice touch. In my opinion this is a classic Crowne Plaza and would stay here again",5,2018,10,28
250,Mr,"We had a family dinner and would like to highlight our excellent experience in the restaurant. 

We were treated by Supervisor Lionel who was exceptional and we deffinetely recommend. 

Happy customer Ray",5,2018,10,24
250,Very disappointing.,"We stayed here the night before flying out to the US, it is an ideal location for the airport without being right on the airport concourse!!  We were checked in by a guy who really didn't seem to know what he was doing.  However when we got to the room it was small but fine.
We decided to have a drink in the bar before having dinner.  The bar was like a zoo, even the young man serving drinks in the lounge couldn't cope with the noise.  We then went to dinner, having dined there before we were expecting good food but our order was taken by a lovely gentleman, but it was served, or should I say plonked down on the table by rather rude young man.  I had to send my dinner back it was so awful and then I had to send it back a second time, so I opted for a sandwich half of which I left behind, it too was awful.  Where we might stay again we certainly won't eat, I'd recommend the Holiday Inn Express next door and dine at the Gourmet Food Parlour next door to that.",3,2018,10,24
250,Excellent Hotel with Friendly helpful front desk clerks,"We had the pleasure of staying one night here before our flight back home. we really were very tired as this was our last day of a 3 week vacation in Ireland. Where do we start, we were checked in by a friendly, polite and helpful gentleman called Carloss, he was very kind to print out our boarding passes and called us a taxi as we wanted  to head in to the centre for a bite to eat. Thank you also for the lovely room away from the lift. We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was lovely. the hotel rooms were comfortable and quite. the hotel lobby is beautiful and the location is so close to the airport. perfect for the last stop before a long flight to get a great nights sleep and a friendly welcome. thanks Crowne Plaza, and Carloss, We have told our cousins to book in here when they visit next month. Regardss, Kathleen and Kevin September 2018",5,2018,10,22
250,Ar Fheabhas,"I travelled from Mayo to Dublin early morning to arrive a day before a departure from Dublin airport. An ideal location for travelling out from dublin airport. I had a terrible morning, my car had broken down and i was out in the rain trying to sort it with my insurance company. I met Elizabeth in reception, her smile instantly helped with my bad humour. I had explained what had happened on my journey to Santry which i felt she really cared. This customer service needs to be highlighted as a strongsuit to this hotel and especially to Elizabeth, she really knew how to help my personal situation.  I had a decent sized room. I enjoyed my dinner in the restaurant, it was the perfect combination to a relaxing evening before an early departure. Thank you to all staff, i will certainly be back again!!",5,2018,10,22
250,Brilliant Beth,"Greeted in reception by the fabulous Beth. She was very accomodating. I was exhausted from a long day of travelling so I asked Beth to check me in as quickly as possible as I was egar to rest my head. She recommended I visit Kilmanham Gaol while i was in Dublin which i throughly enjoyed. I had a delicious breakfast that morning, it was just what the doctor ordered. My room was an adequate size. The Hotel is tastefully decorated. A huge thank you to all staff for my lovely stay.",5,2018,10,22
250,"Convenient location, delightful service staff , good food","We spent our last night in Ireland here and besides the expected high end hotel amenities, we were particularly appreciative of the hotel wait staff. Lionel was charming, witty and attentive and the food was well beyond traditional hotel food fare. Save for a small issue with hot water , we were pleased with the ease of our stay and the value for the money ( particularly when you add in complimentary airport shuttle service and breakfast)",5,2018,10,20
250,Remarkable,"Had a fabulous stay last month in the hotel. It was ideal as I was flying out if dublin the following day to Italy to family which allowed more time in mo leaba! The airport is a great location if you have an early morning flight. Go raibh mile maith agut to Beth. She arranged a wake up call so i would not miss my flight, really went the extra mile to ensure I had a home away from home. I had a delicious breakfast, hats off to the Chef. I will hopefully be back in the forseeable future! Commendable effort from all staff for all their hardwork. I will be back!!!",5,2018,10,20
250,"Great room, great lounge and food","As the title attests this is perhaps the best of the nearby airport hotels nearby Dublin airport. I've stayed at five of them. Easily the best cleaned and maintained rooms. Excellent free and frequent hotel bus ride in 10 minutes from  or to airport. If you find a better price at the Holiday Inn Express next door you'll eat here no doubt and use the same bus.  Business center accessible to print boarding passes or to surf the web, etc. The lounge area is spacious and popular with a good menu of varieties of food with international flare...and it is very reasonably priced, surprisingly. (I have not dined at its rather pricey, fine dining restaurant.) For an excellent alternative, turn left from the hotels and walk a short distance to a really good ""Gourmet"" restaurant on the same street. Pleasantly surprised that the prices for a nice range of dinner choices  was not inflated despite the name.",5,2018,10,20
250,Amazing Airport Hotel!,"Wow...we've stayed in quite a few airport hotels throughout our years of traveling for business and pleasure and the Crowne Plaza blew us away. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, particularly Olga. She greeted us with a genuine smile which was most welcome at the late hour of our arrival after a long day of traveling. The room was well appointed and the bed was SO comfortable!! There was even a small sample of sleep spray you could spray on your pillows to help relax you into a deep sleep and that's exactly what we did. We couldn't hear any noise from within the hotel or the nearby airport. The breakfast buffet was huge and all the food was piping hot. Again staff were so friendly in the dining room. We would definitely stay in this hotel again and highly recommend it to anyone traveling in/out of Dublin Airport!
P.S. The complimentary shuttle bus was on time and very clean.",5,2018,10,18
250,Nice atmosphere,was there only one night the room was big and roomy and set up for family of three. The staff was very friendly and we used room service late and food came up quickly and was delicious. Breakfast had plenty of food to choose from. When booking we had breakfast included which was the best way to go.,5,2018,10,17
250,Good and close to airport,"Visit this hotel infrequently over the years. It has recently refurbished rooms, which are large and comfortable. 

Access to the club lounge is a perk. Good snacks and beverages throughout the evening. 

Gym room is small but had everything necessary - just don’t visit during peak hours as it might be busy. 

Breakfast in the restaurant is always of a very high standard, with a very wide selection. 

The bar has a good atmosphere for an evening drink and dinner. ",4,2018,10,14
250,Delicious food and Great service,"While staying at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport. I had dinner at the Sanctuary Bar. The food was delicious. The server I had was named Anna, she was very friendly, brought food, drinks in a timely manner. I would highly recommend eating there.",5,2018,10,12
250,Nice hotel,"Stayed here in October for an early morning flight the following morning. The hotel is nice, the room was nice and clean. There was tea and coffee and biscuits in the room and a safe. The cost of the double room was €175 which included 4 days parking. There is a free shuttle bus every half hour to the airport. My only negative  comment about the hotel is that the bed was a bit hard but maybe that’s just me. I would use it again if I was travelling out if Dublin airport. It’s a nice hotel and staff were friendly.",4,2018,10,08
250,Crowne Plaza Hotel - Amazing!,"Currently staying here for 3 nights to attend a family wedding in Dublin. The rooms are spotless, the beds are comfortable and we had a wonderful sleep on our first night. Where this hotel exceeds expectations is in the little touches - the quality of the linens, free mobile phone for the duration of your stay and, of course, everyone is brimming over with Irish charm and friendliness. I have especially enjoyed the pillow spray which is said to promote sleep. Such a small touch but at the same time so thoughtful. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,10,06
250,Very satisfied,Spent 2 nights here. I was very happy with our stay. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport. There was a smart phone in the room which was available to use while staying there. Also the smart phone allowed free international  calls. Very good buffet breakfast. I did not include the breakfast buffet when I made the reservation because I was sure I would want to eat breakfast in the hotel. I would recommend including the breakfast when making the reservations.,5,2018,10,04
250,"Sleepless night in a stuffy, noisy room","Stayed her for a one night to catch an early flight from Dublin airport the next day. Had to change rooms because of the noisy heating system which was impossible to control, it was just as bad in the next room. The door rattled on and off all night. Stuffy + noisy meant a sleepless night, not what you want before a long flight. Also overpriced (like most hotels in Dublin).",2,2018,10,04
250,"Very friendly staff, but rooms quite noisy","Staff is extremely friendly and very helpful, especially Lee from the Coffee Shop opposite the reception was very attending and friendly. Also when I forgot my precious pen at the reception after checking in, the staff brought it to my room in minutes. I was really surprised and impressed. Great service staff.
Only sad point: rooms are extremely noisy due to very thin walls: A family checked in 3 am at night and when they entered their room (located close to mine) I woke up from that noise and heard all the discussions in detail. Would be great, if the staff advises people to be quiet at night, especially near the rooms. When you are there for work it is stressful.",4,2018,10,02
250,Good overnight hotel,"Stayed solo at the Crown Plaza, northwood, dublin Airport. Its a great location, it's approx 5 mins from the airport and has a free shuttle bus to the airport. The hotel is modern, clean, comfortable. My bedroom was very adequate, clean and the bed and pillows were very very comfortable. I ate in the bar the evening I arrived, After sitting for 10-15 mins i got up and looked for a menu. Service was slow, i asked the waiter if I could order and he said he would come back to me. Approx 20 mins went by and eventually a waitress came to take my order. Once ordered, the food was delivered pretty quick. The food was worth the wait, it was very tasty, fresh and hot. I had chicken wings and a burger, it was too much, the chicken wings portion was huge!! The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast in the restaurant was excellent, there is a large hot and cold buffet and a menu if additional items are requested.  i Staff at reception were friendly and very efficient. This is my second time staying at this hotel, I would recommend this hotel and I look forward to returning again. Like the other hotels near the airport car parking is available and is charged,",5,2018,10,02
250,Overnight stay,"Stayed on Sunday night 23rd Sept. The quality and comfort at this hotel is unmatched. Nothing is too much trouble for the management and staff. Room, bar and restaurant excellent. I seriously recommend that you consider this hotel. I have no doubt that you will be pleased. ",5,2018,10,02
250,Great experience at the restaurant,"The service was phenomenal, Anna was very attentive and was very helpful. Which made leaving Ireland harder, the food was amazing. Ordered sweet potato chips and a Cajun chicken burger. We have nothing bad to say about our experience here",5,2018,10,01
250,Ok for overnight. Best thing is free shuttle to airport.,"The PROS of the hotel: nice lobby with awesome aquarium; easy check-in/out; early check-in time of 2 pm; clean bedroom with long washroom and walk-in shower; complimentary bottled water in room; cool personal device in-room for hotel information/ accessing internet, etc., springy beds and complimentary pillow spray; free shuttle to airport which is only a 10 minute ride. The CONS: requested quiet room away from stairwell and was given room at end of corridor where stairwell exists; room was likely a 4-star rating 20 years ago but the bedroom wallpaper of a photographed location with little lights in it to make it starry is dated IMO; the TV monitor was a tiny 40"" screen with a dodgy remote. For a 4-star airport hotel, I expected more, but I guess my money was well spent on the free shuttle and bottled water provided.",3,2018,10,01
250,Made our last day in Ireland extra special!!!,"We are Southern Californians that were lucky enough to travel in Ireland for 18 days.  The Irish people were the friendliest people we have ever had the good fortune to encounter.  After an amazing trip we spent our last night at the Crown Plaza at the Dublin Airport Hotel.  
Sylvia st reception gave us such special service and accommodations that we decided to stay at the hotel instead of going back into Dublin which we had planned.  Hotel is perfect place to relax.  
We highly recommend the hotel and. hope you get a chance to take a walk along the river!",5,2018,09,30
250,Amazing!!!,"The hotel went far beyond our expectations to make our 5th Wedding Anniversary special! We checked in shortly after 2pm with a lovely receptionist Szylvia who gave us the great news that our room was upgraded to Club Floor :) Our room wasn't ready yet but it only took 20min and Cao (sorry if I've got the name wrong!) brought us the keys. We were greeted with a bottle of prosecco, chocolates and a card from the hotel! It was such a lovely gesture! The room itself was very modern (loved the colours!) and specious. There is comp continental breakfast served in Club Lounge with plenty of options! We also had a dinner in the bar which was delicious....and the staff - they always smile and are willing to help! Thank you CP Northwood for a marvelous stay! We'll be back!",5,2018,09,25
250,AMAZING,"We spend 1 night in August m and what struck us both were the staff, so courteous, mannerly  and  efficient.. We were checked in and checked out by Beth who seemed to be doing training, was so patient with our questions ,
We had a delicious lunch and would highly recommend the breakfasts even if you are not a guest.
Rooms very spacious and very impressed with the design, rooms are immaculate.
Highly recommend...",5,2018,09,19
250,Disappointed stay,"My Husband and I had an overnight stay at this hotel on 12/9/18 and although the hotel was clean and comfortable and close to airport with good shuttle bus provided I have to comment on how disappointed I was with an evening meal I had in restaurant. I ordered Singapore Noodles and it was the worst dish of food i have ever encountered. Bland, tasteless and so much of it heaped in a bowl that it was a case of just working your way through a huge mound. So unappetising. Another customer 2 tables away had ordered exactly the same and she struggled as I did to eat more than a quarter too and I am a good eater! Serving staff asked if all was ok and I told the truth and said no it was awful. Another server asked when clearing my table and I told him the same thing. They wernt bothered at all. It isnt cheap. On checking out, most hotels ask if everything was ok with your stay but not in this hotel so I did mention that I was very disappointed with the meal and she took my phone number and asked which card I made the payment with. My husband has been an IHG member for many years, I at least expected having some sort of credit to our bill but nothing has been forthcoming. My Husband had the steak and he said it was delicious,so credit when its due! This is disappointing for a hotel of such calibre. I wont use it again and will take my custom to one of the many others in the area. Very disappointing when a hotel doesnt want to ensure customers are happy or act on problems encountered. Maybe as most customers have only one night stop overs they dont feel the need to sort problems out.",2,2018,09,17
250,Stayed one night. For early next day flight to USA,"I arrived there with no reservation to a fully booked Hotel, a tour group was checking in at the time.The young man at the desk was so very kind he worked wonders and secured a room for me. Excellent customer service.I did mention my family member IHG status. Room very clean and comfortable. He loaned me a cell phone to call international at no cost to me. (part of their great customer service) Also a comp. full breakfast the next morning and the free shuttle to the airport.  I will for sure recommend this hotel 110% and will stay on my next visit.",5,2018,09,16
250,Amazing service !!,"Called in for a few pints with some friends. Had such a lovely night which was made all they better by the brilliant service by Tommy in the bar! Couldn’t praise him more, he was so attentive and friendly",5,2018,09,15
250,Great stay for overnight stay,"We didn't arrive until after 7p. Turns out, one of our rooms still wasn't ready. Crowne Plaza gave us drink coupons while we waited. Because of a family member's status with the chain, hotel also offered to comp breakfast - wow! 

Excellent customer service!!

Food was very good. Rooms were clean & comfortable.  Shuttle to/from airport was clean & reliable. 

Stayed at this hotel once in 2016. Enjoyed my stay both times. Wouldn't hesitate to book here whenever travel plans take me to dublin",4,2018,09,14
250,"Friendly, Helpful Service & Good Food","Had an early dinner here while trying to get over jet lag. Our waiter, Tommy, was very friendly and very helpful. He helped my husband choose a beer and made suggestions for dinner.  We had a pleasant conversation about our visit to Ireland. 
Tommy is a great waiter and an asset to the hotel. ",5,2018,09,14
250,Great hotel at every level!,"This hotel is situated not far from the airport in a trendy area of Santry . Spacious lobby, very comfortable rooms, excellent staff especially Beth we  had our 6 Month old Daughter and could not have been more sweet one great restaurant right on the premises. We were very comfortable for our 4 night stat there. There is a very nice walking track and excellent shopping in the Pavillions  We  highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,13
250,10/10,"Stayed for a work event. Lovely clean comfortable bedroom. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Great breakfast selection, good coffee. Had lunch and dinner in the bar, amazing food and service particularly from Anna working in the bar. Lovely helpful girl. Will be back",5,2018,09,13
250,Great service once again,"Visited here for the second time and like our last visit we were fortunate served by Tommy. We were seated in the lobby area and had the most wonderful time. Tommy was so attentive and we really appreciate the excellent service he delivered
We will be back again!!",5,2018,09,12
250,Wonderful Supper!! ,"Tonight I ate at the restaurant in the hotel, and it was so good! I had the Spinach and Ricotta Tortellinis, and my mother had the seafood chowder. Everything was very delicious, and our waiter Tommy was excellent! He was so friendly, and very helpful about some things we were confused on. If you stay here Definitely eat, and definitely ask for Tommy!! ",5,2018,09,11
250,The food was good & server was helpful,"We arrived tired and hungry after a 10 hour flight to Dublin. We decided to eat at the Crown Plaza. Anna was our server, and she was very sweet and helpful— especially at the end when we were asking her recommendations on sites and excursions. She kindly gave us many suggestions and must do’s! Thank you Anna and crown plaza for the good food and kind service.",5,2018,09,10
250,Excellent service at the restaurant ,We went for dinner at the hotel restaurant. The food was delicious and our server (Anna) was wonderful! She gave us excellent food recommendations and she also gave us some great tips on places to visit while in Dublin. We’ll definitely be back! ,5,2018,09,10
250,Out of the Ordinary,"Stayed here one night while traveling back to the states after a week in Ireland.  This hotel was by far our favorite.  

Check-in was super easy and the front desk is very accommodating. The hotel is decorated very modern with an Asian twist. 

The beds are pillow-top mattresses, which we did not find at any other lodging.  The room was spacious and includes a mini-bar.  The bathroom had plenty of counter space and a bath tub!!  No mildew issues for our room either.  The room had an iron and a trouser press- very useful if you are traveling with more business-like clothing. The noise level was low- we had no problems getting to sleep or staying asleep. 

The hotel's gym seem well appointed and popular.  We just popped our heads inside to check it out.  

The hotel's restaurant/bar was very busy, but very good.  Our experience with hotel food usually involves bland sandwich/fried food options.  However, this menu was quite expansive and both options chosen were delicious.  Get the apple tart- you won't regret it! 

The hotel is located in a residential area so you don't have many dining or shopping options.  Keep this in mind if you are traveling without a car.  There is a lovely park across the street from the hotel that has a walking trail and playground equipment for the kids.  

Great option if you are traveling for a few days in Dublin and want to be close to the airport.",4,2018,09,09
250,Well appointed hotel,"Very convenient and well run airport hotel. Spacious lobby, welcoming staff. Car park is not included but is in reasonably priced deck only a minute away. Did not use airport shuttle but it looks like it is operated on a frequent and predictable schedule.",4,2018,09,07
250,Dinner and drinks,"Anna was our server, was extremely respectful and made sure we always had what we needed. We never had empty drinks and was very quick. Would recommend to anyone staying near the airport, or, for anyone who would like a nice night out with drinks or food.",5,2018,09,06
250,Lovely Hotel,"Great hotel.
The food is very good. (Great Breakfast)
Very clean hotel.
Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Lovely bar and restaurant.
Free airport shuttle that runs every half-hour.
I would highly recommend this hotel .",5,2018,09,05
250,"Clean, convenient but weird decor","This best thing about this hotel is the regular shuttle which takes about 10 minutes.  There is a central departure point from the airport and left on schedule (4:15am). There were many crew members in the shuttle too.  
BUT, the hotel is just good for a necessary overnight, it was clean, but the beds were not very comfortable,  The bizarre decor of brightly colored foil wallpaper, and printed mirrors and weird prints reminded me of what a Russian oligarch might consider stylish.  I could have overlooked this,  because it was a clean hotel,  however, getting ready to leave for a super early flight, there was NO HOT WATER.  So needless to say I was unhappy and really awake for my flight.  ",3,2018,09,05
250,Wonderful layover,"My family of four (including two young children) stayed at this wonderful hotel at the beginning and end of our vacation, as part of a layover on our Italian vacation. The staff was made up of some of the friendliest folks I've ever encountered in the hospitality industry. 
In addition to the wonderful staff, big kudos for:  
- super convenient free airport shuttle that runs about every half-hour, starting at 4 am. 
- outstanding breakfast; normally, hotel breakfasts are sad affairs but this one offered a wide variety of tasty items 
- great onsite restaurant with very attentive staff
- lovely park and playground across the street
- comfy beds; I'm prone to lower back pain and I had nada after sleeping here
- close proximity to bus stop that goes to city center; buses only take exact change, so stop by the front desk and they can help you out (the Dublin bus drivers we had were kind of surly, so come prepared with your 2.85 euros). 

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, and we certainly plan on using it for our next connecting flights through Dublin.",5,2018,09,04
250,Tommy our amazing waiter,"Tommy was incredibly attentive, and courteous. I told him I would write a review and I'm sorry it took so long to get this done, just too many other things going on. Thank you Tommy for helping a tiring situation much better. Thank you again Tommy!",5,2018,09,03
250,2nd to none!,"Arrived back from our summer holiday in Portugal and decided not to go straight home as we were absolutely shattered. Wife wasn't well at all with some kind of tummy bug, needed to get some food for her as she had not eaten in days. We kindly asked our waiterwould it be possible to have some plain grilled chicken and somesteamed vegetables, none of which was on the menu, he went and asked the chef who promptly came out to enquire about the well being of my wife. Went back to the kitchen and cooked exactly what we asked for, no sauces or frills, to make sure the wife got food into her, she at the lot and almost instantly felt the better for it. The staff at this hotel excel and go above and beyond their call of duty, this is why we return time and again, especially after holidays. Well done to all at this wonderful hotel.
highly recommended to all our friends and relatives",5,2018,09,01
250,"Best Location, stylish rooms, great service","We normally only visit Dublin for the day and occasionally stay with my daughter however we decided to to stay at the Ctowne Plaza  and wow what a surprise, from our check in we met Elizabeth and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the conversation about hurling as we are both from Galway great banter,Elizabeth recommended us have dinner in the bar as we had lunch on our way down we had a bite to eat later that evening , simply delicious,,
we had a delicious breakfast the following day, rooms immaculate all the finer details covered.
we will highly recommend for all to visit and stay.",5,2018,09,01
250,Great staff and atmosphere,"We got to our hotel late and decided to go to the bar for drinks.  It was a great time sitting and chatting with the server, Neeve.  She was friendly, knew many things about the history of Dublin and helped us navigate our way around the city.",5,2018,08,28
250,Great hotel,"This hotel is lovely, everything is spectacularly clean and our room had its own air conditioning which was great. The shower and bathroom where phenomenal,  probably the best shower I've had in a hotel! Didn't eat or drink here but a pleasure to stay in! ",5,2018,08,28
250,Excellent Experience!,"We stayed at this hotel during a week-long vacation from the United States.

To start, the hotel staff was very responsive to e-mails, and were polite, professional  and courteous on the phone when I called them. During that call, I happened to mention that we were vacationing for my Mom's 84th birthday.

We got to the hotel early and only one room was ready (we'd booked two). We took our bags the room I was sharing with my brother and went to the lobby restaurant to grab a bite to eat.

Following that, we got Mom checked into her room. Upon entering her room we found a fresh fruit plate and a card wishing my Mom a Happy 85th Birthday. Okay, she's 84 and not 85, but what hotel does this?? It's little touches like this which make a world of difference to a guest. The front desk had also seen to it that Mom's room was right next door to ours.

The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and the air conditioning worked great. 

The bathroom lighting seemed a bit dim, and there was no fan which resulted in the mirror fogging up during a shower. The rooms were a bit cramped. We had two twin beds and the table and chairs which were in the room by the window were inaccessible. It was no big deal as we wouldn't have used them anyway. The bathroom lighting and the table and chairs aren't near enough to keep me from staying here again. They're just two things I noticed which some folks might like to be aware of.

We paid for the daily breakfast in advance, and we're glad we did. It was awesome. Granted, we Americans might not be accustomed to baked beans and stewed tomatoes for breakfast, but it was excellent nonetheless.

If I may single someone out: There was a young man working in the restaurant; his name was Luke. When my Mom arrived for breakfast before my brother and me, he greeted her and offered my Mom his arm and said ""I'll be happy to escort you to your table."" My Mother was absolutely blown away by that and said it made her feel very special. Again, it's the little things that make the biggest impact.

What a class act this entire place is.

We only had one issue at dinner one night, but a quick word with the Manager of the restaurant cleared that up, so it hardly warrants mentioning here. Things happen, and it's how the staff responds which matters. 

The bottom line is that I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. It would be nice if they had a shuttle which ran into downtown Dublin (the cab ride is about €15-20), but even that wasn't bad, as our cab drivers all gave us history lessons during our drives!

This hotel is the epitome of everything I have come to expect from Crowne Plaza, and I look forward to my return visit...",5,2018,08,28
250,Bar and Restaurant,"Have used the bar and restaurant facilities on numerous and regular occasions.
What makes the real difference is the service especially a young lady named Niamh (Hyland I think). She is always friendly and welcoming. Always over to say hello and ask how are things. She creates an atmosphere that you are a regular and important. Always a nice smile. Staff like her and her colleagues are a credit to the Crowne Plaza brand. Real friendly and polite young people that make a real difference. Keep up the good work. Many thanks Dermot Keelan",4,2018,08,27
250,Good Airport Location,"we just stayed overnight to catch early flight home to U.S. Room was nice - small for 4 adults, compared to what we are used to in the states, but it was very nice and comfy. very close to airport and great bus service to airport runs on time and gets you right where you need to go. We ate in the bar and that was good as well.",4,2018,08,27
250,Always a great experience!! ,"We had a lovely evening of food, drinks and chat with my family, my Dad regularly stays at the hotel and he loves it! 
Olga is excellent and professional as always and Neeve served our food and drinks with smile a lovely pleasant manner. We highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,08,26
250,Great staff,We had a great experience here! The bar staff were fantastic especially Tommy! He was very helpful and really friendly. Would definitely come back again based on how great the staff are! A really nice place to stay.,5,2018,08,25
250,simply the best,"Great location for an early flight out of Dublin. Its so accessible to the airport, it was a pleasure staying there. Any staff i had been dealing with ensured that every need was met. A remarkable effort over all. A special go raibh mile maith agut for Beth at the front desk who checked me in upon arrival. Beautiful grounds surrounding hotel, which is so refreshing for a city stay. Highly recommend!",5,2018,08,23
250,LIFE SAVER!!!,"I dont normally leave reviews, however this time i felt it was necessary. I had been left down by another hotel who shall not be named on a booking I had made. I felt so disappointed, I had been looking forward to my trip to Dublin as i was visiting friends. I decided to go and look for other accommodation last minute, which i was severely stressed about. I decided to pick the Crowne Plaza. It was close to where my friends live so extremely suitable. I was greeted by Beth in reception. She was so helpful. When i told her my situation, she came to my rescue. She sorted everything for me and even gave me complimentary tea. She was a breath of fresh air in the mist of my disaster. Thank you to all staff and especially Beth for your commendable effort. The room was clean and tastefully decorated. I enjoyed a delicious breakfast the following morning, hats off to the chef. I will 100% recommend to anyone lookng for accomodation in the vicinity.",5,2018,08,23
250,Very good airport hotel,"Stayed at the end of our vacation before flight and it was perfectly located for airport transit, rooms were nice and breakfast was excellent. Near a nice park for walking. Service was excellent, left toiletry bag in bathroom and they mailed it to me in the US free of charge!  ",5,2018,08,21
250,Easy stay night before flight,"This was a nice place to stay the night before a flight. It is a bit of a drive to the terminals, but they do have a free shuttle that runs about every half hour. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean.",5,2018,08,20
250,A quick stay - delivered Crowne Plaza Quality,"We had been all over Ireland and had to stay overnight at the airport to fly to France. Staff were pleasant, friendly and helpful. Check in and checkout were easy. We had dinner in the restaurant, which was exceptional. The only thing is the breakfast restaurant was opened five minutes late, which was an issue because we were rushed anyway. The pastries felt slightly old but otherwise a great stay. If it wasn’t for those two small points, I would have given the hotel five gongs. I will happily stay at this Crown Plaza again.",4,2018,08,19
250,Quiet room but needs a face lift,Stayed here after an international flight. Room was clean and quiet but needs some work.  Checkin was a bit of a shambles but it did the job for one night.  Breakfast was great and the service here was the best in the hotel.  As a single stop yeah it was ok but expected more. ,3,2018,08,19
250,Good stop before flight,I stayed here before leaving this really nice country. Hotel itself was clean. Room was spacious. Breakfast was delicious. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly. I would stay here again if I'll ever need another layover in Dublin.,4,2018,08,19
250,An Excellent Stay With Complimentary IHG Platium Member Upgrade,"Stayed here for the first time and my experience was a fantastic one! 
Firstly I was greeted as an IHG Platinum Member and my membership status was instantly recognized. Kristopher was the gentleman who checked me in and he was very professional and courteous. He gave me a complimentary upgrade to a Club Room. 
I enjoyed the Club Lounge which was spacious and also served complimentary beers and wine from 5pm-7pm as well as hors d'oeuvres. 
Was also allowed to have a complimentary breakfast in the lounge, however as I was leaving quite early I didn't avail of this. 
Loved the overall decor of the hotel, particularly the chandalier lights in the lobby and lounge. My room was quite spacious, with a flat screen TV. Climate control worked well and kept me comfortable! The amenities in the room were divine! Loved the shortbread and hot chocolate! 
Will definitely be returning here the next time I depart from Dublin Airport!",5,2018,08,18
250,Short holiday to Ireland,Absolutely marvellous rooms and staff. highly recommended to stay here if the location is convenient to you. IHG rocks!!The check in was cordial and quick. The room was way better than expected (we got a suite). Have always preferred to opt for IHG hotels worldwide and have never been disappointed!,5,2018,08,15
250,Airport Hotel,This airport has everything you need and close for travel.  Multiple food options nearby as well and overnight parking is only 6 EU.  Great choice for a quick overnight stay.  Glad we picked this spot for travel.,5,2018,08,15
250,"Very nice hotel, easy shuttle to the airport","We only stayed here one night before we headed to the airport, but it was very nice. The staff was great from the moment we entered the hotel, very friendly and efficient.

The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. Great even if you have 4 people.  

We ate dinner in the bar. The service was great and the food was very good for a hotel bar.

The hotel is across the street from a lovely park as well.",5,2018,08,15
250,Great Service and Comfortable Room,"We had an unplanned layover in Dublin and couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel we chose near the airport. The lobby is very pretty and the room is comfortable. What made it the best was the service from the Cinnabar restaurant. Our server, Anna, was friendly, provided great recommendations from the menu and was so accommodating to our requests.",5,2018,08,14
250,Loved this place,"The staff were welcoming, the bar is cosy and the bed was really comfy. Even though I was only there for one night it was a great experience.

So close to the the airport and made my morning flight so much easier! 

Def would stay there again. ",5,2018,08,13
250,Perfect Transit Hotel,"This is a very good hotel for Transit from Dublin. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and eager to serve. The property has a nice lobby, bar and restaurant to wind down in the evening. We stayed here one night before our morning flight from Dublin airport after a driving trip in Ireland. There is a shuttle to the airport that runs every 30 minutes. The shuttle can get crowded though in the morning hours as it is shared with their sister property Holiday Inn Express next door. All in all, good stay before the flight !",5,2018,08,13
250,Excellent Airport Hotel,"We stayed here twice over the last two weeks and found this to be an excellent airport hotel. There is a free airport shuttle that runs frequently and drops you at the hotel's front door. The staff are excellent - very helpful, friendly and efficient. 
We stayed in a king standard room and found it be great - the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was large and all of the rooms features worked well for us.
The breakfast is 10 Euros if you purchase it the night before and was well worth it... we've eaten at hotels all over Ireland and this is definitely one of the best.
Overall, this is a great spot. You can hop on a city bus that's a five minute walk from the hotel and be in city center in 25 or 30 minutes.
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,12
250,Great airport hotel,"Stayed here at the end of our trip to Ireland as we had an early flight the next day. It was everything you would expect from a Crowne Plaza.  Clean, comfortable, helpful staff but best of all AIRCON!! Yay. We had been travelling around Ireland during the most recent heatwave & it was SO uncomfortable as the majority of hotels/shops/cafes/pubs are NOT air conditioned & no fans. I found it very difficult to sleep at night so this hotel was a blessing. ",5,2018,08,12
250,Crown plaza Santry,Myself and hubby stayed in this fabulous hotel.The staff couldn't be nicer especially the lady at reception Beth.The food is fab and the selection of food for breakfast was amazing.We will be back for sure.,5,2018,08,11
250,We will be back,"We stayed 2 nights as a family with 3 kids and had a very enjoyable stay.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.  The Touzai restaurant food was excellent and the breakfast is top notch and has something for everyone.  The rooms are spotless. As a family, we loved the location with parking, a park across the road, and the airport, Tayto Park and the city centre and other activities within a close driving distance.  A special thank you to Anna for her attention when serving us.  We will definitely be staying again and highly recommend this hotel",5,2018,08,11
250,Lovely property near the airport,"The hotel is set w/in an office park not far from the airport (a taxi from the airport took 10 minutes and cost 15Euros.) The hotel is ""newer"" so the Lobby area is nicely appointed. The rooms are good and very comfortable. Very quiet. Front desk staff are very personable and accommodating). There is a large county park across from the hotel, which is a nice place to walk or run - it's a lovely park. The room offered an outlet for US devices and at least two USB ports - all of which was invaluable when traveling w/ other family members. The restaurant is nice, an Asian influenced menu.
To travel to Dublin via taxi is about 25 minutes and the fare is 18Euros.",5,2018,08,11
250,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is slightly further away from the airport than some of the others and certainly not walkable. 

However, that is part of the appeal - it doesn’t feel like your average airport hotel which added to our holiday. It is located across the road from a park and it is easy to get the hotel bus to and from the airport. The only slight issue is that they only run every 30 minutes so it can be quite a long wait 

Hotel itself is really nice with great services. The room was good as was the food at the hotel, albeit at expected hotel prices. 

Overall would definitely recommend.",5,2018,08,09
250,Convenient and comfortable BUT take a cab NOT the shuttle,"We had to spend an overnight in Dublin because our arriving flight from Geneva would not arrive in time to make the flight back to the states.  The hotel was very comfortable.The restaurant was interesting and the service was good.  However, do not try and take the shuttle bus to the hotel.  Take a cab.  No one at Dublin Airport is quite sure where the shuttle buses pick up and when we finally found the right area we had walked what seemed like miles. The girl at the desk arranged for a cab to take us and all our luggage  back to the airport and that was perfect.  Lovely comfortable van, very nice driver who dropped us right in front of the check-in desks.",4,2018,08,09
250,BETH  WAS EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!!,"I have never encounter SUCH AMAZING service in any hotels I have ever visited. Beth went above and beyond when I stayed at this property. She was nice, calm, understanding and easy going. She made my stay great, considering I arrived to the hotel after 23.00pm, organised my wake up call as I had a 06.00am start, organised a breakfast to go in the morning as I was going to miss breakfast, it was such a pity I could not stay longer, I will come back to this property every time I have to stay in Dublin by the Airport..... A+ service",5,2018,08,09
250,Touzai,Great place and great hospitality experience and the wings are better than blue bar 😊i had family dinner and Mr Simon took care of us with his exceptional up beat service delivery thank you Simon i will always recommend this place   ,5,2018,08,09
250,Great place,"Had a great stay here recently. Location and facilities were wonderful and the bar was excellent. A young man called Tommy served us and was exceptional - friendly, witty and had some great recommendations. Would recommend.",4,2018,08,08
250,Great service,I stayed in the hotel last month for a couple of days with friends and had such a great time. The food was excellent and our server Tommy couldn't have been more helpful or attentive. We enjoyed great conversation and were looked after brilliantly! We will absolutely be back again,5,2018,08,08
250,Helpful Staff,Stayed in the crown plaza last night. Bar food was delicious. I had the privilege of being hosted be niamh who was extremely polite and helpful!  We went to the city centre on Niamhs recommendation had an excellent night out.,5,2018,08,08
250,Crown Crowne Plaza!,"Great hotel, nice staff, a few minutes from the airport and downtown Dublin.  Free shuttle is in a more remote car park (parking lot) in Zone 16.  Buses are boarding for various destinations to the right by ticket machine.  Look for the large FREE yellow bus straight ahead!  Pickup is every 30 minutes.
From hotel toairport, on the hour and half hour.  Luggage is placed wherever you can find a space.  Driver might offer to help.",5,2018,08,08
250,In Dublin for work conference,"Arrived early, the room was not ready, as I was attending a conference elsewhere, very tired and irritable not a morning person but Beth took it in her stride, gave me access to have a shower in the gym, nice and refreshed when I came back to reception and only had to wait less than an hour for the room ,, very very impressed
 
The room was very quaint clean and had everything I needed. The bed is very comfortable and the toiletries were nice. The service was great, it was a pity I did not get a chance to spend more time however when in Dublin I know where to stay.",5,2018,08,08
250,Very Nice!!,"The rooms were very nice, beds were super comfy. The bar and food was pretty good, prices not to bad. In the morning the breakfast buffet has everything you can think of, even a chef that will cook your eggs how you like them. Parking was super easy as there is a parking garage connected with the hotel. (Make sure to say Hello to the birds in the reception area. Also love the colors within the hotel.",5,2018,08,07
250,Nice,"Nice bar area and good hotel with parking next door in a multi storey shared with the Express.
Food menu changes often to help regular guests who wish for something different.
Used by a lot of airlines crew so not always busy in hotel areas.",4,2018,08,06
250,There are amazing people there!,"Very nice hotel; so glad we went there.  My experience was over the top because we had dinner in the hotel pub and after having awesome Seafood Chowder, we left  with me not knowing I had dropped all my Euros and the case that contained all my credit cards under the table.  Since the room was in my niece's name they couldn't find me.  Our waiter, Jomet, who I was already impressed with, had found them and turned them into the Manager.  I never even knew they were gone!   The next day, just on a whim we returned to the Pub before leaving Dublin for Italy.  Jomet was so overjoyed to see me and told me what I had done.  He and the manager returned everything to me.   This young man who not only is a great waiter, is a warm, honest, kind human being that I had the pleasure of meeting and one who I will remember always.

When we returned from Italy, we stopped back in for dinner.  Jomet was off that day but Justin, who was our waiter this time, was also very kind and professional, helping us decide on the perfect  meal.   Obviously, I would expect the rest of the staff at the Crowne Plaza are equally  welcoming and professional so I highly recommend it",5,2018,08,05
250,Great Service in the Bar!,"My husband and I just spent one short night here before we left Ireland.  We had a great service in the bar area.  It was super busy, but the waiter Tommy was amazing.  He was very attentive and kind and offered us another drink (on the house) considering the wait time for our food.  Clean place to stay and super easy to get to the airport.",4,2018,08,04
250,A big nice airport hotel.,A big comfortable  hotel near to airport. The free of charge bus can help you to move to airport if you have not a car. A lot of choices for a dinner in hotel with more than one restaurants. The Italian one was perfect for a light dinner or snack with wines or beer choices. a booked a single room and got a 4 bed room clean and quiet. A must in this area with new renovated areas.,5,2018,08,04
250,Great Airport Hotel,We used the Crowne Point Hotel as our last night in Ireland prior to launching the next morning for the trek home.  It worked out nicely.  Didn't think that we would have time for breakfast but they opened early enough that we did.  It was a very nice breakfast and the complementary shuttle got us to the airport in time.,5,2018,08,04
250,Easy access to airport and city center,"The staff was amazing! The food was good in the restaurant. The ride on the city bus to the city center takes about 20 minutes. Our room was nice and spacious. 

Only 1 program-the bed in room 228 has a slope in it like a 900 lb elephant has been sleeping on the left side. Don’t get that room!",5,2018,08,03
250,Tommy in the bar was great!,"Had a great stay, was served by Tommy in the bar and he was just brilliant! The visit was excellent from start to finish. A lovely hotel with a great atmosphere. Will most definitely return. Thanks to everyone!",5,2018,08,03
250,Good Crowne Plaza ,Stayed for 1 night. Friendly staff Elizabeth checked me in and then was back in the morning for check out pleasant friendly lady. Unfortunately the hotel was fully booked so didn’t get room upgrade with the ihg spire club but it is subject to availability. Ordered room service arrived quickly. The fish tank at reception is something different was nice. The club lounge is lovely. Good having the free courtesy bus you get it from bay 16 at the airport only had to wait 15 minutes for it when I got off the plane. When I go back would ask for a room with a double bed as the one in 258 is two single mattress zipped together but you could feel the gap ridge prefer having the mattress as being full double but would recommend. Thanks ,5,2018,08,02
250,Crown Plaza Hotel Santry,My name is Mary and I travelled from Kilkenny to Dublin last week to meet with two friends I hadn't seen in a while.We visited the Crown Plaza Hotel in Santry for food and a few drinks. The visit was excellent from start to finish. A lovely hotel with a great atmosphere. A lovely friendly young girl with a constant smile served our table. Her name is Neeve. She was just so helpful and very efficient and good at her job. As for the food it was just beautiful excellent. Will most definitely return and hopefully arrange a stay over at the hotel and hopefully meet Neeve again. Once again thank you.,5,2018,08,02
250,:),"Loved my stay, amazing bar service especially when being served by staff member Tommy Donnelly. So friendly and a good laugh along with great service! I recommend asking for his service if ever staying at this hotel.",4,2018,08,02
250,Bar,My friends and I were served by Tommy at the bar. He was very friendly. Overall it was an excellent evening and we loved the atmosphere. We’ll definitely go back....10/10 would recommend Crowne Plaza!,5,2018,08,02
250,Amazing place,A beautiful place and absolutely amazing service by a very nice gentlemen named Tommy. He made sure we were comfortable and always checked up on us. Very funny too!!! Will definitely recommend to many friends.,5,2018,08,01
250,Look for Better Times,"Well I think it may be time to spend some money on refurbishment and training. As an airport hotel is not the best. Arrived late at 10 pm after a 14-hour flight, welcome ok, did acknowledge my status but more like a recording. Went straight to the bar which was closing to sit in the lobby no food available. Staff more interested in clearing tables and closing down, than serving the guest who pays their salaries (shame). Requested high floor away from the elevators, got 2 room away and 1st floor, thanks for checking my preferences. Rooms small compared to other Crowne Plaza, usual amenities no slippers. Room service menu on a card, limited, bent, food debris and grease marks on it, decided not to eat.  As a show case on Irish hospitality for international guest or any guest, was it worth it for the price, shoddy service and disappointment at Dublin Airport Crowne Plaza?",3,2018,08,01
250,Wonderful service,Staying in area and came to Cinnabar for dinner. Anna was our server who was very friendly and attentive. Held pleasant conversation. Recommended food and served up a good meal. Hotel restaurant close to airport with transportation options for city,5,2018,07,31
250,Excellent Hotel,"Amazing hotel. Friendly,courteous and hard working staff. The hotel itself is modern and very very clean. The food in the hotel is second to none. Breakfast is top class with a wide selection of food and drinks to choose from. The menu in the bar suits all tastes and is reasonably priced. I was staying here as my husband was having surgery at a nearby hospital.  The fantastic staff at the Crowne Plaza made my stay easier and couldn’t do enough for me. I have to mention Emer one of the hotel receptionists who is a credit to the hotel. I am forever grateful for her kindness and friendly manner throughout my stay. I look forward to returning to the Crowne Plaza in the near future with family and friends.",5,2018,07,29
250,Excellent service,"I recently visited for the first time, we sat in the lobby area and were greeted by Anna, a friendly hostess. Anna was extremely attentive and recommended the food she liked, Anna was helpful and seemed to love working there. I would highly reccomend the crowne plaza! The food was fabulous and the staff were amazing, will definitely be back",5,2018,07,29
250,Single night,"Excellent service, perfect for an overnighter. Lovely room, great breakfast,............,, was to find, higho recommend. Will come again, have stayed in others around but this was the best , friendly helpful staff too",5,2018,07,29
250,Great spot ,Spent the night here before flying out in the morning very clean room comfortable nice facility throughout fast check in friendly staff and a great barwould definitely come back stay again the only downside was to get up early and catch a early flight,5,2018,07,27
250,Great food and excellent staff,"I visited the Crowne Plaza last week for a catch-up and a meal with a friend. We were served by Neeve, who was so helpful and friendly, and although the restaurant was quite busy at the time she was very attentive, and went out of her way to get some gluten free bread for our table as my friend is coeliac. The food was delicious and service was excellent, we had a very pleasant experience and will no doubt be back again in the near future!",5,2018,07,26
250,Restaurant Review,"Our overall experience was excellent complete with delicious food. Tommy provided elite service. He greeted us immediately, returned with drinks quickly, checked in often and he went the extra mile. Thx",5,2018,07,26
250,One night of discomfort. ,"How this hotel holds a 4* rating beats me. Having spent 12 days this month in the sister hotel in Blanchardstown we expected a similar Standard for our one night prior to flying out. Not so. The room is one of the most badly laid out I've ever seen in a rated hotel. The photo of the chair which can't even be accessed bears this out! When I complained at reception I was told we were allocated the room because we had requested 2 single beds. WHAAAT? Said beds sagged in the middle and creaked and groaned with each move we made. The air conditioning kicked out twice and refused to cooperate, leaving us very uncomfortable. No point complaining at 1 am, so we put up with it as best we could. The restaurant food, despite the charming staff, was awful. We have the feeling that the chef thinks that if he piles the plate full you won't notice the bad quality. There is no hotel parking ~ you're directed to a private parkade nearby where you are charged E6 for 24 hours. 

Breakfast was just ok. ",1,2018,07,26
250,Soft landing for a morning arrival,"We booked Crowne Plaza for a one night stay over. Arrived about 11:00am, from an overnight flight. They checked us into our room immediately without any early check-in charge. They explained the bus line, and changed our money into exact change, which they put in a plastic bag for both our trip into downtown Dublin and back. Very convenient way to get there, and I don't recommend trying to drive.

Taxis are plentiful too, but we had three different people help us on the bus. Very friendly.

Back to the hotel. the room was comfortable, well outfitted and supplied. We wanted for nothing. Caught the airport bus the next morning at 5:30am - it runs right on schedule from 4:30am.",5,2018,07,24
250,Great stay in fantastic location,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel. The staff very very friendly and attentive from Elizabeth at the desk who checked us in, our bags were checked into the room while we were waiting , Elizabeth booked the theater and dinner,  was easy to get a taxi later as we were given the number to call and all so easy very very relaxed evening. We had a wonderful buffet break delicious crispy bacon with poached eggs and fresh browne bread. Our room had a great view of the park, it was a very relaxing 2 days and a pity we did not stay longer. one Terrific experience!",5,2018,07,24
250,Great service with a friendly smile,"Just arrived this evening after a 3 hr drive. Easy to find, great parking and spacious  comfortable room on the first floor.
Decided to have dinner. Neeve was our waitress for the evening. We asked her for her recommendations on the menu which she happily did. We both opted for the Singapore noodles, which were exactly as described by Neeve, hot and spicy. 
She was so happy to be of assistance to us, great to see this from such s young person in this type of industry 
The portions were huge too! I'd recommend the bar restaurant if you're doing an overnight.
Residents lounge service was disappointing tbh, felt like we were an inconvenience to the guy and that was embarrassing.
Check in and out was easy and again the staff were ever so professional and friendly.",5,2018,07,23
250,Great Hotel,"Stayed here with my husband last night as our flight was late back and next bus didn't leave for 6 hours. Walked in with no reservation at 1am in the morning and they swiftly found us a room. Room was great, air conditioned and with a mini bar. Delighted with the experience.",5,2018,07,22
250,Good place!!!,"Good place, I stayed at Crowne Plaza Hotel for 1 night, my room was big and comfortable enough.

The breakfast was good with a lot of choices. The staff works fast and is professional. 

The location is less than 15 minutes driving from the airport. There is a free shuttle from the airport and from the hotel every 30min, see pic time table.

In conclusion: The Crowne Plaza is a good place to stay if you need to be close to the airport. Hope my review was helpful.

250,Nice hotel a bus ride to the city,The staff at this hotel were really good. Answered all our questions and were helpful through out. Rooms were well presented. Bus trip to Dublin was about 30 minutes. A bit far away from the city. Great for overnight stay right near airport. Lovely park across road. Breakfast was excellent and staff again very helpful. Noise became an issue with on drunken patron playing up staff dealt with it they  best they could.,4,2018,07,16
250,"Quality physical product, funky service ","While I don’t hold a degree in hotel hospitality, I believe that “Basic Hospitality 101” would teach potential staff to kindly and properly greet guests when they approach the “reception” desk.  At this hotel, that was not my experience. I travel a great deal and have the opportunity to compare and contrast check-in processes frequently. When I approached the desk at the Crowne Plaza where two female reception staff stood, both looked at me with quizzical looks on their faces. I uttered that I was there to check in, and one retorted, “Well, choose either one of us”.  I responded, “I’ll choose whoever welcomes me first.” Neither said “welcome,” but I chose her, the one who spoke to me.  The other was clearly disinterested in assisting.  The one who checked me in was either an assistant or deputy manager (according to her name tag): professional but cool and aloof.

The other one later managed to insult my travel companion (to the point of tears) when she entered the hotel after I was checked in and already upstairs. Quite simply, this reception staff person (whom I had experienced earlier as sour) struck me overall as rude and not quite fit for the role she held.

Note: Subsequent encounters with other staff at the front desk and in the restaurant were quite pleasant. 

Now on to the *rooms*: we reserved premium king rooms, which were surprisingly quite nice (the pillow spray was a useful touch), up-to-date and very comfortable. With the exception of a weak shower spray, I had everything that I needed, including AC, in a very warm Dublin, and I could have stayed at the Crowne Plaza for several days.  We used it for one night only as the transition to our departure early the next morning.

Finally, there is a decent restaurant on the premises with Asian (Indonesian and/or Singaporean?) food. I liked one of my dishes very much but left three-quarters of the other behind.

There’s a really efficient shuttle service to the airport.

Overall, my review is based on my wholistic experience.  Perhaps, with a longer stay and more time to really experience the hotel, I would give it four stars but for now, it’s a three.",3,2018,07,14
250,Lovely Hotel,Great hotel! We were a family of 4 and had the double twin with two double beds. Very clean and room service was good. Although the sandwiches we ordered were a very much of a standard that you’d get at a Spar services. Everything else perfect.,4,2018,07,13
250,Absolutely Amazing ,"I've been in Dublin for the last month and a half and stayed at 2 other hotels before moving here about 15 days ago. While both the hotels I stayed before were simply terrible, this stay has been so amazing. Every staff member at the hotel is extremely warm and courteous. I'm a vegetarian (survivors guide in Dublin anyone?!) and away from home since long and the staff here have been so considerate and genuinely caring. Want to specifically call out Olga and Edit, both of these wonderful ladies are such amazing hosts I feel almost at home! I was supposed to move to another hotel after a few days but I've extended my stay at crowne plaza till the end of my stay in Dublin. Good buffet spread with (comparatively) decent veg/egg options. Nice and neat rooms. Access to the club lounge is an added benefit. The huge park opposite to the hotel is great for a walk in the evening. The hotel is a bit far from my workplace but I don't mind it one bit!",5,2018,07,12
250,What a Welcome To Ireland,"My wife and I arrived in Dublin to begin a one-month stay in Ireland, celebrating our 52nd anniversary.  Our first night was at the Crowne Plaza at the Dublin Airport.  We had stayed there before, but on the way out of the country instead of coming in.  My wife happened to mention our anniversary celebration to Olga at the front desk.  Wow!  What a welcome.  She put us into the Harmony Suite and saw to the delivery of a nice bottle of prosecco along with fresh fruit and chocolates to our room.   When we went down to the lobby to thank her later, she just said that it was the Crowne Plaza way.  We’ll be back for certain, there is no doubt.",5,2018,07,12
250,Lunch,"I meet people regularly in the Crown Plaza for lunch/dinner. The food is always lovely and the service is great.

We usually sit down the back and are served by a tall gentleman. I cannot remember his name! He is always very helpful and ensures that we are well looked after.

I met my sister for lunch last week and we were served by Neeve. She was an absolute delight. Very thoughtful, conscientious, and friendly. I asked to speak to her manager as I thought that her customer service levels were outstanding. Unfortunately, her manager was unavailable at the time. 
She is a great asset to the Crowne Plaza and the next time I am up there I will ensure that I get the opportunity to speak to the manager about her.",5,2018,07,12
250,World Cup Semi Final,"We were looking got somewhere to watch the match and have some food with my wife,mother in law and the two youngest children.
We decided on the crown plaza on the swords road.
What a great choice. We were treated to wonderful food a great seat to watch the match all accompanied with great service delivered by a wonderful team. Watch out for a barman named Eoin who was particularly friendly,chatty and went out of his way to be helpful.",5,2018,07,12
250,Great staff,"Visted here last week with friends. Went to the bar and had drinks and food. We had great cocktails and thai green curry. It was excellent. Tommy was our waiter and he made our night even better.
Thank you",5,2018,07,11
250,Close to Airport - Great Service,"We chose the Crowne Plaza specifically due to its close proximity to Dublin Airport. I did have some difficulty finding the hotel; our GPS sent us to the wrong location, but a quick telephone call to the hotel soon gave us clear directions.
On our arrival we were checked in by Olga (the lady who took my telephone call) who very generously gave us a room upgrade to an executive room and waived the parking fee for our car. Completely unexpected, but very thankfully received.
Our room was very tastefully furnished with all the trimmings expected of a quality hotel, including free WiFi. With the executive room also came access to the special lounge, which provided complimentary evening drinks and canapés, with tea and coffee, fruit being available at any time.
The hotel has a very nice bar, where you can also dine if you wish.
A full buffet breakfast also was included in our room tariff. The breakfast was exceedingly good, with plenty of choice to get you going in the morning.
I believe the hotel also provides a shuttle bus service to the airport, but we didn't need it.
A very pleasant short stay in this fine hotel, made even better by the very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.",5,2018,07,11
250,"Super comfortable, convenient to find, incredibly close to airport for early morning/late night shuttle or car return","After spending a week in a truly lovely self-catering accommodation in Killarney, our stressful itinerary to Dublin was made into a completely experience at the Crowne Plaza. We had a total of 14 people staying at the Crowne Plaza, and all of us were satisfied. A bit of advice, make sure you arrive for the shuttle completely ready to depart at least 5-7 minutes early.  It leaves on time.",4,2018,07,11
250,No complaints ,"Really good stay, although we only stayed for 1 night for the Michael Buble concert we really had a comfortable stay.

We arrived at the hotel for 10am, was expecting to be told the room was not ready, to our surprise we were allowed to check in and go straight to our room, thank you very much for this.

Rooms very spacious and well looked after.

Staff very helpful 
",5,2018,07,11
250,Good quality hotel,"So often you feel a little cheated when a hotel advertises great facilities only to be let down when you get there. This is not one of those hotels. Professional, clean, good decor, excellent food, super comfortable bed, air con and the use of a mobile phone.  It's the small touches that mean so much.  There is a courtesy bus to the airport and a 20 min walk through a park (located across the road from the hotel) to a lovely shopping centre.  The bagel cafe in the centre is just amazing, the staff are so helpful if like me you can't decide what to eat! The breakfast was first class, a surprise for self service! I only got to stay in this hotel for one night but if you want that bit extra, it wont disappoint.",4,2018,07,09
250,Mrs catriona dixon,"I visited  the hotel recently to meet  clients. I just wanted to pay my compliments for such a well run hotel.  to the staff, for their professionalism . In particular I want to compliment the young waiter Tommy. This young wexford  man I believe, went out of his way to make us welcome, waited our table with swiftness and friendliness. A gem and a treasure. Thank you Tommy. We will be back.",5,2018,07,06
250,"Great service, great food",Spent a day here and went for a drink and food in the bar. I was served by Tommy in the bar. He was really polite and a great waiter. I enjoyed the atmosphere there and the staff in general that I encountered were top class!,5,2018,07,06
250,Bar,Two weeks ago i visited the bar on the way home from the airport. I had a Cajun chicken burger which was absolutely delicious. Myself and my boyfriend were served by Tommy. He was great and made our meal even better.,5,2018,07,06
250,Lobby food & drink area,"Whilst waiting to collect my sister from Dublin airport on a significantly delayed flight from Greece, I popped into the Hotel for a bite to eat to kill time.
I was greeted by a lovely smiling and enthusiastic waitress called Neeve and I understand that she is new to the job.
She was so pleasant, efficient and friendly, all the hallmarks of a good place to eat.
She even took time out to explain the pronunciation of Irish names to some foreign guests who had a good laugh. I run customer experience training courses for a living and can assure you that Neeve is the embodiment of that. Well done. WILL be back.

250,Easier to get to than we thought,"You might choose a hotel closer to the airport if you look only at distance from the airport, but after having stayed both at the crown plaza and the Maldron hotel that is just next door to the airport. I really recommend Crowne Plaza.

Rooms are not only cheaperm but also nicer, bigger and with MUCH nicer beds.
It is not at all difficult to get to as the shuttle bus takes you straight to the door.
We had to leave at 5:30am and it was no problem at all.",4,2018,07,02
250,Just Perfect!,"We stayed here for one night as we wanted to be close to the airport as we had a flight to catch the next day.

The evening reception staff and Liam were excellent and very professional, friendly and accommodating. Check in was swift and hassle free.  

Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Showers are great and the hotel is very quiet - exactly what you need before a long day of travel. 

A good breakfast selection and friendly service awaits you in the morning.

Elizabeth the Manager, assisted us during check out and went out of her way to ensure that we were well taken care of and accommodated and on our way in no time. Thank you Elizabeth!

",5,2018,07,01
250,Exactly what we needed,"My husband and I had to wait in line at check in for 10-15 minutes, so the concierge upgraded our room to the executive suite and provided complementary breakfast. Our room was very nice, clean, and large. We had a nice dinner in at the bar located in the hotel. Breakfast was very nice as well. 

The only reason you might stay at this hotel is for its proximity to the airport. It's about an 8-10 drive. Car rental return is across the street from the airport. 

Note: If you are flying to the US from Dublin, you must go through customs in Dublin (I don't know why). Plan to get to the airport at least 2.5 hours prior to your flight.",5,2018,06,30
250,Great breakfast buffet,"Overall comfortable bed, a/c worked good... and good size room and amazing full Irish breakfast buffet. Friendly staff, too. Nice green park across hotel. Would recommend they provide shuttle service to Dublin city center which runs about 20 euros in each direction. If you have a lot to do  as a tourist in  city center ,it adds up. 

If you want the room early check-in because you have had a long international flight, you're likely going to need the book the night before especially during the busy season. Also would suggest comparing booking this hotel with points versus a regular reservation. (It could save you in paying euros and taxes).

They do provide a free Hotel shuttle airport pick-up. Look for Zone 16 in Coach Park. It is the yellow bus and it picks up in between the terminal 1 and Terminal 2 and arrives every 20 minutes. (Our wait time for pickup seemed more like 30 mins. though).",4,2018,06,28
250,Great Service!,Neeve was a great server! She was very attentive and even though the restaurant was closing within the hour she did not rush me. The food was excellent and the Hop House was great. Thank you for providing a friendly atmosphere with great service and food.,5,2018,06,27
250,Cinnabar ,Anna was a great waitress who was willing to assist a guest with suggestions and always had a smile on her face. I had the fish and chips with Mushy Peas (1st time... they were great!) The pint of Guinness was a great topper!,5,2018,06,26
250,Perfect overnight stay. Excellent for airport,"The hotel has excellent facilities in a great location, it is within striking distance to the airport and with a regular shuttle bus it is very handy for early morning flights. The staff are all friendly and helpful and the accommodation is excellent. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.",5,2018,06,25
250,Nice stay,"Been here a few times for work, no complaints.  Decent rooms, clean, friendly staff, good breakfast and solid bar/ lounge.   Close to the airport with a shuttle every half hour in the morning, so it makes the airport easy to access. ",4,2018,06,23
250,Fantastic hotel,"Myself and my daughter stayed here to go to Taylor swift in croke park. Fantastic hotel, the room we stayed in was top class, beds were so comfy, staff were lovely, receptionist was so helpful.Location is central to everything. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for accommodation in Dublin.",5,2018,06,19
250,Great team at a really good airport hotel,"We arrived late at night after a flight from Dubai with our one-year-old son and the front desk team of Olga and Szilvia could not have been more helpful. They were exceptionally friendly and informative, and made us feel so welcome.

We had a lovely stay and would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to others. Comfortable beds, spotless rooms and a lovely park across the street makes this feel more like a luxury hotel than an airport hotel. Breakfast was also very good.",5,2018,06,18
250,Relaxing time,"Was with my wife and two daughters firstly for Taylor Swift concert very easy to get to Croke park. One of my daughters was flying out to the states early next morning we used the airport bus and found it fantastic we then had breakfast it was of very high quality staff at breakfast were very attentive, overall I would stay again no problem.",4,2018,06,18
250,Top Hotel near Dublin Airport,"The Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport offers a great hospitailty just 10 minutes by bus from the Airport. Once you find the shuttle bus stop (hidden behind Terminal 1), the bus will bring you to a top Hotel. The rooms are very nice and the beds are exremely comfortable. The Food in the Restaurant was also very nice.",5,2018,06,18
250,Great hotel,"I am currently writing this while relaxing in my room.

I can’t speak for food as arrived later in evening and had already eaten but have seen some great reviews! Hopefully will get to sample on my future visits! 👍👍",5,2018,06,17
250,Ate the food and sat in the lobby,The food is excellent.  Lots of variety in the bar and the restaurant.  Easy to order and enjoyed all our meal that we ate.  My son loved the large fish tank too.  Didn't stay in a room but since it is Crowne Plaza I'm sure the rooms are great.  ,5,2018,06,17
250,Fantastic!,"We stayed here the night before an early flight and it was lovely. We were given a complimentary upgrade upon check in and the room was beautiful. Friendly staff, good amenities and the free shuttle bus to the airport was a great bonus! We will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,16

The bed is perfect and the linen is crisp

250,A Year On and a Second Stay..,Found ourselves staying at this hotel again for the Pro14 final thanks to a very competitive IHG members rate. We had a standard twin room which was spotless and had all the amenities that you'd expect from a Crowne Plaza. Having arrived well before check in following an overnight journey the reception team pulled out all the stops to find us a room that was ready. Afternoon bar service was excellent with the high level of professionalism that is the norm for Irish hotels. Didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel but the breakfast was faultless.. Nice ambience and plenty of fresh food. This really is a good hotel and one that I'll be looking to stay at again...,4,2018,06,15
250,Excellent service at the breakfast buffet,"Having stayed here for the third time this month, I would like to not only recognise the quality of the fresh food at the breakfast buffet, but the friendly yet professional service from the staff. 

Miroslav (Pedro) always greets you with a smile and is never to busy for a quick chat. He ensure you have everything you need for a great breakfast experience with attention to detail and a friendly smile. 

Miracle is also very helpful with anything you might need while displaying an enthusiastic, assistive and proactive demeanour. 

The management here seem to treat the staff well which filter down to the experience of the guest. The supervisor Jon shows a mature and experienced approach to his interactions with guests. 

Would not miss the brekky buffet. Well done. ",5,2018,06,12
250,Ideal place for seminar or conference,"We were running a seminar here for 3 days and I was the go between my bosses and the hotel   This place scores 10 out of 10. 
- Modern 4 star hotel with great facilities for business meetings, seminars, conferences, thank you Judith and her staff, Roisin, Shauna, Jennifer and Mark.- Excellent staff - always ready to help and make extra step especially Beth

- Restaurant  and Bar is definitely their competitive edge. No matter if it is breakfast,or dinner - it's every time great! Compliments to the chef who is running it;

Gym small but you have everything you want , great jogging or walking track

Will highly recommend to all.",5,2018,06,11
250,Lovely staff,"We stayed in this hotel a week ago and we just loved it. I would like to say a big thank you to the nicest duty manager ever JON !!! He was very friendly and helpful and he was looking after us all our stay!!! Thank you Jon and to all your staff ( specialy Miroslav , very friendly guy in breakfast room ) !!!",5,2018,06,11
250,"Great Stay, Highly recommend the hotel","I stayed here on Easter Weekend and had a great experience.  Staff was really friendly on check in.  Rooms were neat and clean.  The price for the brunch the next day was a little confusing, but as I worked it out with the clerk, she gave me a nice upgrade to visit the concierge club for Hor's Douevers and drinks.  Staff was helpful with suggestion for Churches, restaurants and getting to the airport.

The workout room has adequate equipment.  It never seems that there is as much equipment in Europe as in the States. Hotel is located a little away from the airport like lots of Crowne Plaza's but advertises transport.  There are several on site restaurants, and several that are walkable.  There is validated parking.",5,2018,06,10
250,Above and beyond service,"We checked into the hotel after all the emotions of our son's wedding, heightened by the fact that I was with my ex-husband.  My niece was with me, and our other son was with him.  We needed two rooms. Olga -aka amazingly empathetic woman checking us in - apologized for not having the two rooms on the same floor.  I kind of whispered that this was great, as this was my ex.  She immediately gave me a ticket for a free drink, and put me on a floor with some lovely amenities.  If there were ever a time kindest like that was needed - and anyone who has traveled with an ex can understand this - this was the time.  Thank you, Olga, and thank you Crowne Plaza.",5,2018,06,09
250,Service,"Great waiter tommy served at the bar! Great venue, great food, I would definitely recommend this hotel to my colleagues . Can t wait to come back and enjoy to stay here again with my family and tommy :)",5,2018,06,08
250,"great food, and even better service !","stopped off at the crowne plaza for food with my family on our way to the airport. ideal after a car journey to refuel. we ate in the bar food was excellent, good choice, tasty and super quality.  we were served by Neeve, couldnt have asked for better, very professional and super friendly. we will absolutely be making a trip back once we're in the area again. excellent experience overall.",5,2018,06,07
250,Great food,Attended a wedding in the Crown Plaza Hotel near Dublin airport. Lovely bright reception room and the food was absolutely perfect and beautifully presented.  Choice of beef or turkey and ham. Friendly courteous staff. ,4,2018,06,02
250,Staying for a wedding,"Great location,  good food,  excellent staff, no request to small and dealt with in a professional and courteous manner. 6e per night parking with airport shuttle bus every 30 mins. Will definitely use when traveling from Dublin Airport.",5,2018,06,01
250,Enjoyable solo visit,Popped into the Crown Plaza for a coffee was very impressed with my visit. I was well looked after by Anna in the bar who served me a fantastic cappuccino while i read the newspaper. Really enjoyable solo visit,5,2018,05,31
250,Always over and beyond,"Stay here a few times a year and have reviewed before, but feel the need to compliment again! The hotel itself is fantastic, with everything you may need; but what makes this hotel special is the staff. Always attentive and willing to go the extra mile to make your stay comfortable. A special thank you again to Olga and then the gentleman in the morning who checked me out. Really nice to see familiar faces every time I visit- so often at hotels the team change so quickly you don’t see the same person twice ",5,2018,05,30
250,Great Service!,"We had a great experience!  The front desk was very courteous and helpful. Best of all, Edit provided us great service in the restaurant/bar and in the Club Lounge. She was great!  If I lived here I would have tried to hire her for our business!  Hope to come back again soon!",5,2018,05,29
250,Mmhhh - are my expectations to high ... or is this in need of at least more attention ?,"I staid overnight for business last week in May and must say I was less than impressed..
I needed 4 keycards as each would only work once ... then after finding that the batteries in the door need replacing it took someone 20 min to come up ... 
the shower temperature control was broken so it couldn’t be adjusted
The drainage in the shower was clogged ..
In the elevator the lights are hanging down from the ceiling..
At dinner ... no I won’t go there .. (food over cooked , staff removed coffee cups without ever serving coffee and ignored the question ,..)

So I think the hotel might need a new manager and invest into enough “handyman” to keep the place in good running condition ... and do some preemptive maintenance (batteries in doors to unlock keycards ..)

",1,2018,05,29
250,Great bed and comfortable stay,"It is only 10 minutes from the gate to the Crown Plaza airport hotel Dublin. A well functioning conference hotel with a good breakfast buffet (with a broad selection of warm and cold dishes), a descent room with a lovely bed met great linen, a gym, good lunch option and friendly staff. This is not the place where you stay for its surroundings but for an efficient meeting place. Recommended.",4,2018,05,29
250,"Great evening, even better service",Went for food today with my friends who are over from America and I was so pleased to be able to provide them with such a wonderful evening. Our waitress Niamh went above and beyond to provide both courteous and timely service. The food was delicious and we weren’t left waiting for too long. I would definitely go back again and my friends were incredibly impressed with their first impression of ireland! Many thanks!,5,2018,05,27
250,Excellent hotel,"Stayed two nights over the weekend. Cannot fault this hotel. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Rooms are great, clean and very relaxing.
Had a wee problem on saturday evening with taxi overcharging trip from dublin town centre back to hotel. Front of house staff ,'Szilvia' was extremely helpful and aided in lodging a complaint with local authorities.
Fantastic weekend. Thank you.",5,2018,05,27
250,A couple of well-spent nights here,"Spent a couple of nights here in March 2018. The Crowne Plaza at Dublin airport is very convenient to the airport and a bus ride (3 Euro) into the city. The bus ride takes about 20 minutes in good traffic.

Check in was quick and easy, as was an early AM checkout. The international staff were friendly and willing to engage in conversation. 

Our room was a nice size. The bed was really comfortable with plush blankets. The bathroom and toilet were quite large with nice appointments. Indeed the entire hotel was well appointed. 

We had breakfast there and holy cow was it good: a full Irish and then some. Coffee was properly strong and robust.

There's a lovely park across from the hotel: it's got nice trails and walking paths. On our sunny Irish day the park was lovely.

The gym was just fine. If you've seen my other reviews my standards are pretty simple: some good working cardio equipment and a decent array of free weights. The Crowne Plaza had all that plus some. The gym was large and clean. You could pick up an apple on the way out!

We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was great. I had a salmon dish and not only was it delicious, there was a lot to eat. I'd definitely recommens the hotel and the restaurant.",5,2018,05,26
250,Wonderdul,We visited last week before a flight out of DUB.  This hotel was immaculate.  The room was one of the nicest I’ve seen. Even had a US power outlet in addition to the European outlets.  Service was great.  Would definitely recommend.  ,5,2018,05,26
250,Incredibly friendly staff,I came here for food and drinks with my friends last weekend. I was served by a waitress called Neeve. Her country accent and cheeky smile were a breath of fresh air for locals like us. She was pleasant and polite throughout the night and was very accommodating to all of our needs. She went out of her way to make sure that we had a pleasant evening. I will definitely be returning again soon.,5,2018,05,24
250,Quick and efficient service at reasonable prices,"Staying at the airport hotel so ate in the CP bar for convenience 
Had the tortillas and make your own salad 
You can’t really go wrong here- salad was fresh, generous and tasty
Tortillas are tortillas- salsa was nice and spicy but not too hot..
All for just under 20€
Pretty good atmosphere here too and staff are friendly and courteous too",4,2018,05,23
250,Excellent Service,Came in for a small bite to eat and a few drinks last Friday evening. We sat at the tables near reception and got a warm and friendly greeting from a waitress called Neeve. She came to our table with a beautiful smile on her face and took our order. The food and service were both amazing. We will definitely be returning again soon.,5,2018,05,22
250,Excellent conference hotel,"Minutes away from Dublin airport, set in beautiful woodlands this is an excellent conference hotel.
The bedrooms are very spacious and have all the mod cons that you would expect. The bed was very comfortable and although the property is very close to the airport it is very peaceful. The conference space is great with plenty of breakout rooms and pre function areas. The breakfast was lovely. There is also a lovely park just in front of the hotel which is perfect for an early morning run. The service was impeccable and all the staff were friendly and attentive.",5,2018,05,22
250,Friendly and professional staff,"Every thing was verry good. Even when wasn't they made it happen. I arrived and the room was nod ready yet and i went straight for the breakfast . The breakfast buffet is amasing. Everything is fresh and tasty. I came across John who acomodated me in the dining room. A very friendly person with a proffesional attitude. Every time ready to help me and my friends , with everything we need it. The staff makes it all at the end of the day and John was one of them. Was a good exeprience staying here and looking forward to coming again.",5,2018,05,22
250,Wonderful stay and staff,I loved our stay at this hotel. I am the kind of person who really needs a goodnight sleep and that was exactly what I got while staying a the Crown Plaza. Breakfast was really good as well. The staff was willing and able. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,05,19
250,Right good stay,"Arrived late yet checkin was smooth and the staff very friendly.  The room was clean and all worked in the room as advertised.  Plenty of outlets for the tech.  The air conditioner could be placed on constant fan, which i do so love.  The bar was okay with the service being very good and breakfast was very tasty.  Wifi was solid and worked pretty much everywhere.  Many good suggestions from the staff as to where to go the next day which didn't help my pocketbook.  
Room as also quiet as was the floor.  
Did not get a chance to use the workout room however it looked good (i think that counts ?) 
Overall a good stay.  ",4,2018,05,16
250,"Spacious and comfortable, very convenient for north Dublin","I stayed here on my own last week and was pleasantly surprised. Great service, comfortable room and not too hot. Super bathroom. Unexciting toiletries but the price was good having booked a few weeks in advance. Breakfast was imaginative and plentiful.",5,2018,05,14
250,Very good informal business venue.,"I reminded myself this morning about how good this hotel is for a short notice informal small business meetings.
There were two of us from 10:30 to 13:00. Very comfortably seated. Teas and coffees offered and delivered promptly and on a number of occassions. 
A bacon sandwich and a danish was a pleasant addition following our arrival.
Friendly and efficient staff.

250,Staying in dublin,Loved this hotel staff were excellent very friendly and very helpful.very close to the airport and to the m50 and m1 motorways.so if you have rented a car it's a great base for doing day trips to other parts of Ireland  ,4,2018,05,09
250,Not your average airport area hotel! ,"Perfect place to stay near the Dublin airport! Whether you are at the beginning of or near the end of your visit in Ireland, this hotel will greet you with a smile! Wonderful customer service and friendly staff. (Hotel can store baggage for you until check in and a bit after check out) Easy FREE shuttle to and from airport (be sure to give yourself plenty of time for bus transit/schedule). Lovely park in front of hotel made for a great stroll! Taxis are easy to arrange to take you to nearby city center of Dublin. Fares run anywhere from €15-€30 Euro depending on traffic and timing. The hotel itself reminds me of something from the 80’s or early 90’s retro, very colorful designs and patterns. Clean and well kept. Our room was very quiet and bed was very comfy. I loved the tree mural behind our bed... Bath was a bit dated, not as clean as I would have expected, but we were given an early check in so maybe this had something to do with it. I had one of the cleaning persons come back in since she was still in the hallway right next to us, and she emptied trash and gave us fresh towels. Our bath had a separate tub and shower which was a unique feature. Free bottled water provided each day was nice. The WiFi wasn’t super strong, but it’s free and good enough for what I needed it for, however, for business, I would recommend a different server. The full breakfast was tasty and service was very good. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. Recommend this hotel and definitely would stay again! ",5,2018,05,08
250,Great hotel stay in Dublin,"Day 2 at the hotel (1st full day) Great front desk service from Krystian and Rachel. Couldn’t have been friendlier or more helpful. Checked in and went to our room to unwind. Later went to the bar for dinner & drinks .. great server, Aida’s, excellent service. This morning we had breakfast and a wonderful conversation with Jon (including several things we all had in common), excellent breakfast and GREAT Lattes made by Agnieska @ Inca. Everyone has been kind, caring and friendly. Recommended as a place to stay - quiet, clean and close to the airport👍.",5,2018,05,01
250,Very good hotel,"We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel as we paid a short trip to Dublin during April this year.  Hotel is located between Dublin airport and city centre but you can reach city centre via taxi or by public transport buses, with no any problem. 
Service was excellent and all the staff we interact with were very polite and helpful with many matters as transportation, sightseeing, restaurants and other small details that made our visit to Dublin easier and better.",4,2018,04,30
250,Edit in the Food & Bev Dept. is the best!,I just wanted to say that Edit; who works in the bar/food & beverage team is absolutely incredible and goes out of her way to make sure everyone feels like the most important person! She truly gives the VIP service and makes the stay at Crowne Dublin Airport well worth it!,5,2018,04,26
250,Great hotel,"Stayed at this hotel last weekend, we were here for a rugby match on Saturday and had a late flight in Friday and left on an early flight Sunday morning so it was convenient for us to stay near the airport, we used the free shuttle service to and from the airport and we went into Dublin on the service bus on Saturday for less than €3 each. We had drinks in the bar Friday night and it was lovely and reasonably priced for Dublin, the full Irish breakfast on Saturday morning was excellent and lots of freshly cooked alternatives. The room was great with a very comfortable bed and we had the grab and go breakfast on the Sunday morning as we were leaving at 4am. We also had dinner at the bar on Saturday evening that was also very good.
I will definitely stay here next time I fly into Dublin.",5,2018,04,23
250,Excellent Restaurant,"We have been told that the people of Ireland are the nicest in the world, sincere in their niceness.  It is true, everywhere we went, from the cab driver to wait staff or whomever we asked for directions on the street, each was nicer than the last.  In this country of truly generous and pleasant people, one person (Colin Mulligan - Restaurant Manager) exceeded this high level of generosity.  His courteousness and kindness was unmatched. It was our last dinner in Dublin and Colin was very attentive.  He encouraged us to save money and utilize the hotel shuttle to the airport for our early morning flight.  He even had a breakfast to go bag arranged for us to pick up before the shuttle even though we were staying at the hotel next door.  The customer service he provided was excellent and more importantly, he was sincere.  Colin is such a nice person and it is evident that providing good service is natural for him and his staff.  Thank you Colin for giving us a truly memorable last night in Dublin.",5,2018,04,22
250,Perfect stay,"Couldn't do enough for us, whilst staying with you - 14th to 16th April - stayed in Room 211 was lovely and clean - club lounge was great, ate in the restaurant and bar a few times, it was all good 😊",5,2018,04,22

250,"Initially Poor, But Properly Resolved","Last week I rated this hotel as poor because of a couple of issues. The Deputy General Manager (Mr. Stephan E.) saw my TripAdvisor review and reached out to me to discuss. He is very concerned about customer satisfaction and the Crowne Plaza Hotel brand. Sometimes everything will not go as planned, I understand that. He provided a satisfactory solution to the truthful issues that I raised and for that reason, I changed my review from poor to very good and am looking forward to staying at a Crowne Plaza hotel in the future. I regret not talking to him before I left my TripAdvisor review. Very clean hotel, close to DUB Airport and a nice breakfast buffet.",4,2018,04,18
250,Very friendly staff and not a bad place to stay at all,"Stayed in the Crowne Plaza Northwood on Friday 13th last for a one night stay. It was the hotel of choice for those of us attending a conference in The Helix, DCU the following morning. The hotel is well maintained, car parking facilities were prefect.

We checked in on the Friday evening and the staff member who dealt with us was called Rachel, she could not have been nicer and was pleasant, professional and made us feel very welcome. 

I had booked two rooms, single occupancy in each, directly over the phone with the hotel a few weeks previous. After we checked in we both went to our respective rooms. I arrived in mine and thought to myself it wasn't the biggest room in a hotel I've stayed in but the two single beds were a put off. When I went down to my colleagues room I was more than a little annoyed really. He had two large beds in his room, the room was a bigger layout and much more comfortable (remember I had booked these direct with the hotel and we both paid the same cost for the rooms)

I did say this to reception when I went downstairs for food, while they did sympathise with me they couldn't do much as the hotel was fully booked. It hasn't stopped me complimenting the hotel but did leave a little sour taste when I see the funds coming out of the credit card.

The food in the bar was lovely that evening and the serving staff were again professional and nice to deal with",4,2018,04,18
250,Disappointing,"We stayed one night at this hotel so we could catch an early morning flight. While the room was well equipped and comfortable we were disappointed in the overall experience. The food in the restaurant was not very good with gluggy nasi goering and the creme caramel without the expected crunch and the custard was tasteless and too firm. Service however was good.
We booked a 4am wake up call which did not happen. Luckily we had set an alarm so woke up on time. There was no hot water for the shower. When I rang reception I was told to run the water on full for 5 minutes. Did that but still no hot water.
I had read some information on a card by the bed that stated if your wake up call was 5 minutes late the room would be free. The man on reception offered us a discount for the inconvenience so we brought this to his attention and he agreed there would be no charge. Parking at the hotel was handy.",3,2018,04,17
250,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed at crown plaza Northwood on fri 13 th!! Room great, bed so comfy it was decadent!! Enjoyed a lovely breakfast and staff are so efficient and attentive.  Will defo return. Had stayed previously but service and comfort excellent.. attending scout national agm, lots of scouters staying again on 14 th... have great sleepover all!! Thank you crowne plaza for a most enjoyable stay. Ann rochford wexford",5,2018,04,14
250,Wonderful stay - suprising value for the money,"Stayed for a single night on Apr 8th en route to an airport departure the following morning.  I've stayed away from Crowne Plaza properties in the States because of quality issues, so I was skeptical of this stay.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Lobby was warm and welcoming, and staff was as well.  The biggest surprise was the room - very nicely appointed.  Comfortable bed, stylish and updated bath, great lighting. There are two dinner options at the hotel - Touzai and the bar.  We went with the latter, which offered a simple, less expensive menu.  Service was great, and the meal was as well.",5,2018,04,14
250,Disappointing Crown,"I have been an IHG platinum member for many years, and have stayed in many Crown Plaza’s all over the world. I have to say that this staff was below average in courtesy and ability. With a 5 pm arrival our rooms were ready but the hallways on level 3 were a mess requiring us to traverse dirty dishes and dirty linens all the way to our rooms. The keys did not work for either of our two rooms (traverse back past the dirties). The waiter at the bar was excellent. The waiter at the restaurant however was very slow and we had to flag him down for everything. The Asian fusion dishes were good, the steak was not (poor flavor and tough). The desk clerk in the morning was not at all helpful. At 7am we asked if the coffee shop would be opening to grab a coffee prior to our flight. He simply said no because it is Saturday. He didn’t offer to tell us there is complimentary take along coffee in the restaurant. When reviewing our room charges he asked if we had anything from the minibar in our room. I replied no (as we had not). He said I see you had a sparkling water (which was on the tabletop with a complementary note next to it). I mentioned that and he did not charge us. We had to wonder how he even knew that!",3,2018,04,14
250,Fine facilities - lack luster staff,"Recently stayed at the Crown before a return flight to the states. 

The facilities are adequate for a Crowne - bathrooms were old but clean and the rooms were OK. Sheets were a bit scratchy and for some reason my room heated to 22 degrees Celsius in the night (which is quite hot). In the middle of the night I then had to figure out how to use the thermostat (not simple).

The real disappointment was the staff. Perhaps Crownes are no longer as excellent as they used to be, but the majority of the staff was not courteous or prompt - with two exceptions. The first was our waiter in the bar - quite pleasant and speedy. The other was the manager at the front desk. 

However, both the woman I worked with at the front desk and the waiter in the restaurant were less than expected. Service in the restaurant was slow and it felt like we had to work very hard to get and keep the waiter’s attention when trying to order another round of drinks. 

Unfortunately a snow storm in MN (in April!) meant that we needed to rebook our flights. As someone not from the area and having been charged crazy fees for using room phones before, I went to the front desk to see if they could help. First, the clerk just stands there and says “what’s the number?” So I googled on my phone and tried to find it. I got a number and she dialed for me. The person on the line told me it was the wrong number and gave me a different number. At one point the clerk completely ignored me until I reminded here to help me even after her manager had just instructed her to google the number for me (the WiFi was not good). After me trying multiple numbers and back and forth the manager finally told me that there was a phone in my room that would allow me to make those calls from my room! Great! Wish I had known before standing at the front desk for 20 minutes though. 

However, when I tried to use the room phone, I discovered that it automatically hung up on my after 5 minutes - they denied that this was the case when I called the front desk but I tried it about 5 times all with the same result. 

Eventually I just called from my cell and will have to pay the long distance fees incurred.

Not a high quality Crowne. ",3,2018,04,14
250,Quick and Convenient,"WIth a free airport shuttle and great per night price, you can't go wrong with this hotel. Room was spacious, with an amazing bathroom and shower, which after spending time in Europe I can appreciate.

At reception, Olga and colleagues were very polite and responsive from extending our stay to booking ahead. Staff in the evenings at the Touzai restaurant Lionel, Justin, Christina, Chef D. Kearns and others made each meal memorable.  Breakfast in the same restaurant were good though could not say the same about the staff the first two mornings.  Guest room on the fourth floor was very nice, spaceous, though standards were inconsistant.  Club lounge staff were very good with a nice selection of hor d'ourves.   Overall the staff were excellent with special mention to Cassia who made our stay memorable.  A down was the Cinnabar with noticeable dust on more than one occasion.",5,2018,04,02
250,Fabulous Hotel,Wonderful staff especially at reception. Our car broke down on way home from airport and we had to wait for over 2 hours for Family to collect us at the Crown Plaza. The reception staff took our suitcases and held them for us until it was time to leave. We had a meal while waiting and the idea of building your own salad was great. When it arrived it was delicious and very reasonable. I am due to stay here in December and am looking forward to the experience.  ,5,2018,04,01

250,Very enjoyable visit,"Myself and my partner visited the hotel last Thursday for a few quiet drinks at the bar. This was our first time visiting your hotel and I must say it was a very enjoyable experience. The bar's atmosphere was very chill and homely, which was complimented by the bartender, Tommy, who looked after us all evening. We talked in detail about the art of pouring the perfect Guinness and Tommy did not disappoint! Very smooth and creamy pints all night! 
We then stayed for food which was also delicious.
Will certainly be returning again in the future!

250,Wonderful restaurant,During a recent stay in the lovely Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dublin we decided to have a meal in their gorgeous restaurant. Beautiful food and wonderfully attentive waiters. They were most pleasant to our two little girls. Special word of thanks to Lionel and Justin. Will look forward to visiting again.,5,2018,03,23
250,Excellent customer service that made our first trip to Ireland very memorable,"My wife, daughter, and I spent a 4-day weekend in Dublin and were fortunate enough to have stayed at this hotel.  We were cheerfully greeted by Kristian when we checked in.  Throughout our trip he was an incredible help to us in making the most of our short visit.  Each morning we would stop by the front desk and tell him what we had planned for the day.  He and his awesome staff would then help us figure out the best way to accomplish our goals.  Even though we had a rental car, he strongly advised us to leave it in the garage and take a nearby bus to the City Centre, which we later realized was absolutely the right decision.  He even gave us correct change for both our outbound and return trips on the bus!  We also enjoyed the bar and the restaurant very much.  We will be back to Ireland some day soon for a longer trip, and if I have my way, we'll stay at the Crowne Plaza again.  I wish I could remember the name of every person who helped us, as they were all wonderful.  Thanks to Kristian and all the staff behind the counter and in the bar and restaurant for your superior service.",5,2018,03,21
250,Bar food,"Went to the bar last week for food and drinks with my family. Had the pleasure if being served by Tommy there, he was very efficient and helpful. With a few young kids it's hard to find a place to suit us all but the bar met all our needs. The service made it ten times better.",5,2018,03,19
250,No suprises,"once again, very impressed with this hotel. we checked in late Sunday evening after a delayed flight from our holiday and was greeted with a smile as usual. Lovely room as usual. lovely breakfast as usual. only gripe i have is the overpowering smell of urine in the communal toilet down at reception.",5,2018,03,19
250,Service at club lounge,"It's not the first occasion of being served at the Club Lounge, but have to point out that Edit is absolutely superior in providing the service to its guests in the lounge.Hope that during your stay you'll be able to say the same!",5,2018,03,18
250,OUTSTANDING,"My family and I spent last weekend at this hotel.  We were incredibly impressed by the staff on reception.  I think over the course of the weekend we spoke to four different people and they were all totally professional, helpful and polite.  

The free shuttle from the airport to the hotel made life extremely easy and we were able to check in to our room early, enabling us to travel in to the centre of Dublin without our bags. The nearest bus stop (Northwood Plaza) is conveniently placed for a short trip to the city centre and only costs. EUR 2.85.  

The room was spacious and immaculate.  The beds were extremely comfortable and we were not disturbed by banging doors in the corridors - as happens in many large hotels..  We will definitely stay at this hotel again.  Thank you to all the staff for a fantastic stay.",5,2018,03,16
250,Shaji is the best ,"I Was here for company's training and the Service that we received from Shaji is the best that I've ever had in my business trip. 😁

250,Restaurant Crown Plaza DUB airport,"Understated but filled with; attentive, polite, knowledgeable, multi cultural staff whom not only served a host of customers throughout the challenges of the ‘beast from the east’ but returning post drama... a chef or chefs who serve some amazing food ‘one of the best meals, I have ever had’ - it must be... as I have never been compelled to write a trip advisor review. Milisau thank you for the impeccable service and passing on my compliments to the chef ",5,2018,03,14

250,Juan's Big Adventure,"My name is Juan and I am travelling around the country of Ireland in search of artistic inspiration for my new album. In the Crown Plaza Hotel, I found it.

Having stayed at other local hotels and had bad experiences I was left expecting very little from my next encounter with North Dublin hospitality. I have never been so wrong. 

Visually stunning the Crown Plaza Hotel manages to capture stylish chic and elegant features in a blend of pure excellence. The hotel truly is a sight for sore eyes. 

However, as ever, what's most important is invisible. Namely, the warm welcome that was so prevelant throughout my stay. Smiles, kind words and wonderful service were available in abundance. 

On top of this, I, Juan can say from the bottom of my heart that I have never met someone like the barman, Tommy. He spoke to me, genuinely interested in my album and creative work, he asked me about myself and most importantly he made me feel the thousand welcome the Irish are so renowned for. 

Tommy really sums up the quality of this hotel. Stylish, Sleek and Kind. 

",5,2018,03,09
250,Lovely food and fantastic service,I recently went for food and drinks here with my hubby. We were greeted by welcoming staff and stunning decor. The ambience in the venue was enticing and we had a very pleasurable evening. We were served throughout the night by barman Tommy. We had nothing but compliments for this warm and friendly man as he went out of his way to make sure our evening was perfect. We will most definitely be back. ,5,2018,03,09
250,Great Service,Visited here with my friends for food and drinks.Tommy served me in the bar and treated me and my friends very well. Great location close to the airport and beside a park. Will be back again for sure :),5,2018,03,09
250,Club Lounge at Crowne Plaza,"The lounge is open all day/night with refreshments and self-service coffee station, while during buffet time, a variety of fresh finger food and fruits, could use some sweet items though. 
I have been here few times and Miss Edit was the hostess/lounge waiter at each time and she is constantly friendly approachable happy welcoming and treating each guest as fit to his profile. 
She interacts appropriately making everyone feel like they are home. 
Looking forward to my next visit to Dublin and to Crown Plaza just to stop by the club lounge again and relive the experience.",4,2018,03,08
250,AMAZING,"We had booked a standard room for 3 nights but upgraded to a Club Room upon our arrival, of course it was last week and the snow did appear, thankfully we were only delayed by one day, Beth had organised a package before we arrived and we did get a chance to visit outside the city, very tired but worth it, loved Howth and Enniskerry.

The hotel is located within an 30 minutes from the city and only minutes walk to the park (which is a beautiful). 

Being on the Club Floor we had access to this all day if it suited we did get a chance to use it on our last night , the canapies were delicious and went down well with a glass off wine we had breakfast the following morning, the staff on the floor are amazing 

The room was Large  and beaufifully appointed, the beds are comfortable to sleep 

We enjoyed our stay at Crowne Plaza so much, both the hotel and the position, that we have no hesitation in booking again 

In conclusion, let me say that the staff were all very friendly and helpful and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. The hotel may only be rated as 4 or 4½ stars but to us, it was pure 5-stars",5,2018,03,08
250,Up in Dublin for Pku Association of Ireland mtg and Appointment at the Mater Hospital,"I’ve stayed in this hotel before. This time it was overall a better experience. The staff couldn’t be more friendlier and hospitable, their efficiency is top rate. The Executive Suite that I was booked into by myself was absolutely gorgeous and perfect. The water in the showers is piping hot and the bathroom exquisitely designed. The furnishings in the suite are colourful and bright. The food was top notch. I used the gym facilities and the Club Lounge for my breakfast. The staff are delightful.",5,2018,03,07
250,EXCELLENT ROOM SERVICE FOOD AND SERVICE,"Great burger by chef Bernard and super service from beautiful Zharmaine. She was very professional and kind + helpful. Very convenient hotel in a quiet location. Rooms are good and they have a shuttle to the airport.

250,Appalling reception staff,"In general this is a standard airport hotel, clean and dry - but nothing outstanding compared to other hotels of the same brand.

However, the worst thing was the appalling  reception staff on arrival in the late evening, even though she was the head receptionist!!!

This women had a patronising attitude and I felt judged as soon as I walked up to reception. She looked down at me and did not want to professionally deal with a request I made before arriving (for a quiet room). 

The whole way of her handling this simple matter in a friendly way was ridiculous and frankly a huge disappointment. I felt totally upset about how she was talking to me and fireing her internal hotel blabla at me, as if it were my fault that these requests apparently don't come through to them or that the hotel already had 130 check-ins before me and what not. I honestly haven't got a clue why I should be made feeling bad by this woman, whilst I'm a friendly guy who just wants to spend the night with no problems at all?

The condescending attitude of this 'head receptionist' towards me was totally unacceptable. Even in a budget hotel, I would never stay there again because of this. She wasn't even letting go of me after I requested to be checked-in by somebody else.

This lack of honest customer service was poor, old fashioned and I felt like I was being told off by my school teacher. It reminded me of the service level we got when in 1988 me and my family had dinner in an Eastern German restaurant during communist times in the GDR.

Thanks to the other reception guy I got two free drinks at the hotel bar because of it, that calmed my emotions a bit but not much.

I'd say save a few € for your stop-over by opting for a different hotel near the airport with a cheaper price.

I stayed here last week on my way from Amsterdam to southern Ireland.

Very disappointing experience.",1,2018,03,06
250,My New Home In Dublin,"I have stayed in this hotel now for the last 5 weeks back and forth from the Uk, i used to stay in the centre of Dublin but wanted something different, i am so grateful i choose to stay at the Crown Plaza Northwood. I will start with Olga who always meets and greets me when i arrive, with a big smile and will go that extra mile to make sure my stay is always a pleasure, she is always ever so helpful and willing to help no matter what, as are all the front desk, ever so polite and helpful....
Now onto Colin in the restaurant, well what a joy to see such a happy face no matter what kind of day the restaurant is having, again he and his team are always so helpful and will always make sure you are happy with the food, and it is very good i must say!!! 
Well done Chef, we have only met a few times but you do a great omelette :0)......

So this week was a little different to my prior visits to the fab hotel, as my flights were cancelled due to the snow and storm which meant i had to stay the weekend, no big deal as i was due back monday anyway but it was so interesting how the hotel coped with what they were up against...

So in come the Beast from the East and the Big Freeze, praises to the staff, Never did they crumble under the pressure of cancellation's or bookings.
I do hope the management read these reviews and take onboard what the shop floor do and those extra miles that are performed on a daily basis, this is there job i hear you say, well yes maybe but there is customer service ? and then there is the Crowne Plaza Northwood customer service, i would more than happily continue to book my future stays in Ireland here at this hotel.......

Well done team !!
And thankyou

I do not wish to single out any one person as they were all fantastic and went above and beyond what you could expect, well done it was a pleasure!",5,2018,03,05
250,Unbelievable friendly helpful staff,"Stayed due to the Storm and even tho they were short staffed they never put s food wrong,lovely food and a great bar.

250,Another Great Airport Hotel ,Great hotel for airport convenience both to stay over or to have meetings with people passing through Dublin. Comfortable rooms with good food and reasonable parking. So important in Dublin. Also convenient to Santry stadium and Santry Sports Injury Clinic,5,2018,03,03
250,Not ever a mistake,"During our hibernation during the Beast from the East and the Big Freeze here at Dublin Airport for 3 days with cancelled flights, I would like to sing the praises of this hotel and its staff once again. Never did they falter under the pressure of cancellation and over bookings. All staff is highly capable and I must mention Olga from front desk and Jon in the breakfast room. 
The food at breakfast and the Cinnabar was tasty and of good value. 
Rooms and furnishings excellent.
We will always be back",5,2018,03,03

250,A true customer support when it's needed,Thanks to Crowne Plaza team and especially Olga at reception who delivers a true customer support in those difficult times with storm Emma forcing me to stay in Dublin airport for the weekend. I will remind during my next visit to Dublin and will come back.,5,2018,03,01
250,Amazing service ,"After the convergence of. Storm Emma and the beast from the east I found myself stranded, with my flight Cancelled due to adverse weather. 
Olga at the hotel was amazing helping to extend my stay and allowing me to stay in the same room. 
The service I’ve received has been second to none. Not only from Olga on the reception but from staff in the bar and restaurant. 
Room service has been prompt. Food is lovely and the room and hotel standards are excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel for good food, comfort and great service. ",5,2018,03,01
250,horrible receptionist and laggy websites,"booked through the hotel this morning, booked 3 rooms of 4 people and the rate on the website said 417 euro  for tomorrow night. when i got the confirmation email it said 598 euro on it. Thinking it was a mistake I rang up reservations to enquire about it. A lady answered the phone named 'olga' and i have to say she was the worst person i have ever dealt with in the hospitality industry. i was a waitress for 3 years and now i am a chef for the past 2 and i have never once spoken to anyone in the way this woman did. Everything was said in a condescending tone. she was trying to tell me that the booking was for tonight and that i had booked 3 rooms with 12 people in each so 36 people! even though this is not what my booking confirmation said! she said to me ""let me explain this to you so you can understand, you cant fit 12 people in one room""... im very aware you cant do that which is why i booked 12 people over 3 rooms but for some reason she didnt believe me. anyways she then told me she would change it for me and says ""okay the new lower price is 598"" which was the exact same price as before but i couldnt deal with this woman anymore so i hung up and went to cancel it online, i no longer wanted to stay here if thats the service to expect. But when i recieved the cancelation email it stated my booking of 4 people in 2 rooms for 399 euro was cancelled! so now im thinking the website must have lagged everything up! so unfortunatly i had to call the hotel again to make sure my actual booking was cancelled and olga answered, i couldnt deal with her again so i passed the phone to my mom. she was incredibly rude to my mother too and not any help whatsoever ! i understand with the storm people are under pressure but thats no excuse to talk to people the way she did!",1,2018,03,01
250,Shabby and down at heel for the price,"I stayed here a few days for a wedding and the cost for the few days was a lot but I figured it should be a nice place for the price and the fact that they hosted weddings. Firstly, the good bits, the staff were just lovely, friendly and helpful. Now the negatives. The room was shabby, the paint was peeling off the ceilings, the sink in the bathroom was cracked and chipped, the heating was broken and was stuck on 19 degrees and the tv remote didn't work. I am a vegan and I do not expect to be catered for at all times but I usually do ok in a hotel breakfast. In this hotel, the best I could do was a plate of baked beans and when the chef was asked he offered me bacon because it didn't have milk in it! When I had explained he offered me a plate of steamed vegetables for breakfast. I stuck to my baked beans and coffee. Also, the view from the window was a brick wall, about 2 feet from the window. The cupboard where the maids held the equipment was near our room so early in the morning (5 am) there was clanking of the water bottles and noise all down our corridor.",2,2018,02,28
250,Serviceable Airport Hotel,"As a one night layover stay, the Crowne Plaza works well. There is a free shuttle bus about every 20 minutes from zone 16 at DUB.  Check in was easy, and there are 2 pretty good, but overpriced restaurants/bars on site, with sort of an asian flavor. The property is big, we stayed on the second floor, in a fairly dated room with views of an adjacent roof. The bathroom was even more aging, the shower stall was clogged up and lighting pretty poor.  Location is far enough from the city center, to make it costly enough by taxi, and there is obviously not much nearby. Overall, this was a decent enough place to stay before hitting the airport the next day.",3,2018,02,28
250,Couldn't fault it! ,"Had a brilliant stay at the hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, I was looked after by Tommy who ensured everything was 110%. The food was of great quality too. Thoroughly enjoyable stay and will definitely be returning! ",5,2018,02,27
250,Fantastic service and location,"Stayed here in January in 2018, I travelled with my husband and 18 year old son. Fantastic location and breakfast was great with exceptional service from Beth, Very attentive and polite. Would recommend a return stay

Stayed: January 2018, travelled with family",5,2018,02,27
250,Weekend trip - great hotel with good facilities,"Spent another great weekend at this hotel.   We have stayed here many times and the location is really ideal for getting in and around the city.   Receptionist who greeted me was very helpful and made sure I had everything I needed.   Meal in the restaurant on the Friday evening was lovely and breakfasts had a wide variety and good quality.    The bar always has a good selection of food and drinks serviced by friendly staff.   

My only negative comment is that the rooms are a bit dark - you find yourself constantly looking for the light switch",4,2018,02,25
250,Great place for a wedding ,Great function room for a wedding. The room can be decided into sections. The couple had one half for wedding ceremony and then other half for dining area. Good bar area attached. Dancing was great. Food was nice and deserts were large. Sound system for speakers was adequate. ,5,2018,02,25
250,Dinner.,"I have had meals here on a number of occasions and it has been very good. Service is excellent. 

On occasions the lounge has been very busy but neither the food nor the service were comprised. 

This hotel is always busy but staff curtious.",4,2018,02,24
250,Excellent restaurant service,"While staying at the Crowne Plaza to catch an early flight, my daughter and myself found ourselves in need of food and were pleasantly surprised by the excellent staff we encountered at the main restaurant  (the name of which I can't remember off the top of my head.) Our server Katja was inviting, efficient and knew exactly what we needed before we even had to ask. After experiencing a surly waiter earlier in the day, it was wonderful to have someone who knows what they are doing. A good server makes all the difference to your meal. ",5,2018,02,23
250,Nice hotel. Good service. Tasty food/drink. Good airport connection.,Very nice place to stay. Feels modern in the rooms and restaurant/bar areas. Reasonably priced and ideal place to stay on business for links to city and the airport. Useful shuttle bus to and from airport. Friendly staff.,5,2018,02,22
250,Great help from our main gal at the desk - Olga!,"Shout out to a great host for the week who made our trip super easy and helped us with everything ! 
This was for a business trip so having great receptionists help making the experience care free was invaluable! Thanks Olga",5,2018,02,22
250,Another great stay.,"I always enjoy staying here. The location is ideal if you are travelling out of Dublin airport. The staff are excellent and always go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. A particular mention goes to Edit who was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, whether they be a family or single traveller. Good room amenities and only about 20 minuets from Dublin city center.",5,2018,02,20
250,Great casual dining for a family,"With 3 young kids, it can sometimes be hard to find somewhere that a) won't make you feel like a travelling circus & b) has something everyone will eat. We have eaten a few times as a family in the lobby area of the hotel. The kids menu is excellent offering good quality burgers, soup & Singapore noodles instead of the usual bland nuggets. Portions are good & my kids clear their plates, even the 2 year old. The coffee is very good too & I'm fussy about my coffee. Today I was served by Tommy who was very attentive & looked after us well. The lobby area is quiet & comfortable with a huge fish tank to keep the kids amused & strong Wi-Fi for when they tire of that.  ",4,2018,02,18
250,Excellent service,"Had dinner in the restaurant and was very pleased with the service. Tommy Donnelly was our waiter and he was very pleasant, friendly and professional. Food was excellent. Really enjoyable overall, will definitely be coming back again.",4,2018,02,16
250,Great Hotel,Lovely hotel with a lovely park beside. Close to the airport with a free bus to and from.Served by great staff including Tommy in the bar.Great bar and restaurant made better by the quality of the staff.,5,2018,02,16
250,Great location - nicely renovated,"Stayed for one night in Crowne Plaza Santry

Great location for visiting Dublin, 30 minutes by bus to the city,  Parking space in the hotel only 6  Euros per day

Recepion excellent were greeted by Beth and had our room ready within 30 minutes and we arrived very early very friendly and efficient - with very nice advice on food places.

Room was very nice - very nice decor immaculately clean . Temperature in room was very nice , bathroom had all the modern cons you would expect very clean and well maintained.

Sleep quality was excellent - very good mattress and quiet.

Breakfast was of excellent quality.

Overall great stay and well recommended for a visit to Dubln.",5,2018,02,14
250,Great hotel at airport,"We just needed a hotel close to the airport because we had a very early flight out of Dublin and this was perfect and exceeded our expectations in every way! It's a beautiful property and the rooms are very nice! They even have outlets for American appliances which I haven't seen in Europe before and even though we always travel with adapters, inevitably we never have enough to charge phones, laptops, hair appliances etc so this was greatly appreciated. They have a very convenient parking garage if you have a car, which we did pick up a rental upon arrival so that we could venture out to countryside etc. The breakfast buffet is fantastic!! But my favorite part about this hotel, is the service! Great staff and they took amazing care of us! In fact, they went above and beyond! We were late coming downstairs to catch the shuttle to airport on the morning of our departure so the gentleman at the front desk, called someone to cover the desk so he could personally drive us to the airport in the hotel van and I am positive we would have missed our flight if not for his help!",5,2018,02,12
250,Having drinks in the bar.,"When I visited the hotel for drinks with my friends, I had a wonderful evening thanks to the very friendly staff. A special thanks to my server Tommy who made the experience all the more enjoyable. It was a great atmosphere and the drinks were gorgeous. We will definitely be returning again soon.",5,2018,02,12
250,Convenient hotel,"Stayed this hotel a few times while traveling through Ireland. Hotel is quite personable for an airport hotel, good breakfast and very frequent shuttle to the airport. It’s a bit outside of the Dublin City centre, probably around 30-35EUR taxi fare.",4,2018,02,11
250,Hospitality,"The room is clean and comfortable. The staff are all very hospitable and accomodating as if your a gueat at their own homes. Concierge and front deak staff were knowledgeable and very helpful to my personal needs and information. Special thanks to one of their staff,  Zharmaine, who provided personal service and warm hospitality. Thank you!",5,2018,02,10
250,Best place to stay close to Dublin Airport,"Highly recommended! This is by far the best hotel in the vicinity of Dublin Airport.  We only stayed one night but I would have happily stayed longer and will definitely chose the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport next time I need to stay out by the airport. Anthony, at reception, really looked after us when we were checking in - a big thank you!  I really liked the option of a standby upgrade when booking the room - I haven't seen this at hotels before and it really would be worth it.  The room was really great - nice heavy black out curtains in the room and lovely toiletries in the bathroom all added to the upmarket feel of the hotel.  If you stay in a Club Room, the lounge is a really great option.  Again, when I was checking out, Beth, at reception, couldn't have been more helpful.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2018,02,09
250,Exceptional service,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 2 nights mid January, the check in process was delightful. The receptionist Olga was informative, friendly and helpful. When arriving home I realised I had forgotten a treasured garment at the hotel, I called the hotel and Olga arranged to have the garment sent to me at no extra charge. This was an unexpected and welcomed surprise. Olga was a great help and she's one of the reasons why I'll stay at your hotel again and again.... Thank you for the great service and added value.",5,2018,02,09
250,Great place to stay before flying off on holidays ,"Stayed here the night before we went on our holiday. The guy at reception was fantastic, customer service was impeccable. Room was outstanding and we were able to leave our car there for the entirety of our holidays. We were able to get a free shuttle to the airport from 4am and back to collect our car on our return. Highly recommended if you are looking for a hotel near the airport ",5,2018,02,02
250,Fantastic hotel and service,"Spent 4 days here. Only 10 minute away from Dublin Airport, efficient and regular free airport shuttle. Nice rooms. Surprised it was 4 star as service felt like 5 star. Food was very nice with big portions. And staff were super friendly. Definitely is now my go-to hotel every time I visit.",5,2018,02,02
250,Surprise Gem,"Never stayed at a CP, but will definitely do it again!The staff, the room,were impeccable and the restaurant manager went above and beyond for us. We were pleasantly surprised & cannot wait to return.",5,2018,01,29
250,Good airport hotel ,"Excellent service in the reception. I can't remember her name but very lovely lady. We had a laugh at something and straight away the service experience felt more personal. It is such a shame it doesn't happen very often in big hotels. 

Rooms we had were just been renovated. Very nice rooms.  Excellent bed! The rooms weren't too big but big enough for 2 people and 2 big luggage. The bathroom seemed a bit old fashioned compared to the bedroom. But it was clean and big. So no complaints there. 

Breakfast was excellent but unfortunately we had to hurry to the airport so could't enjoy it enough..

Definitely staying here again if we need hotel near the airport. 

",5,2018,01,29
250,Great staff,"Was here for food and drinks with family. Sever was Tommy, he was very attentive and great with conversation. We were delighted to have been served by such a nice guy. He even recommended the food which was great",5,2018,01,27
250,Comfortable Business Hotel,"I stayed here for a couple of nights whilst on business in Dublin just before Christmas. 

Rooms were as you might expect from Crowne Plaza of a fairly good standard and well decorated with comfortable beds and good amenities to hand. Whilst the hotel does have that corporate feel about it as you might expect it wasn't clinically so and there was good atmosphere throughout. 

Breakfast was good with an extensive choice although on the night we ate dinner in the restaurant the service was poor although the food good. The service in the bar was much better with tastes more akin to most peoples I would guess.",4,2018,01,26
250,Disappointing ,"First of all I'd like to say the hotel is lovely and the staff were great, unfortunately when we checked in to our room we found the airccon not working and after refusing to take a blow heater for the room I eventing to reception and they gave us another room. We had to catch an early flight in the morning so we're up at 4am only to find no hot water in our bathroom, it was barely lukewarm but nothing like a cold shower to wake you up I suppose. 
This hotel was lovely but I would not go back again because of these two issues. ",3,2018,01,25
250,Crowne Plaza,"Comfortable business hotel. Bar food and service is very good. Stay here regularly and Edit in the bar is very pleasant and efficient. 
Breakfast is efficient and good quality. 
Rooms are very good but the TVs could do with modernisation. 
Overall a very good hotel. ",5,2018,01,25
250,Great Service at The Crown Plaza,"I stay in many hotels and not often driven to write a review. This time I experienced  incredible service from Szilvia (Reception). Szilvia literally came to my rescue selflessly offered to help me during her off duty time to ensure I was not left in trouble. So warm and friendly and efficient. I could not have asked for more. If you are reading this Szilvia, thank you. You were a God send. 
The hotel itself is my first choice when I travel to Dublin, consistently high standard in every way. Love the ease and regularity of the shuttle, the food, the rooms and the people make it a great place to stay every time.",5,2018,01,25
250,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here last week, a very nice hotel indeed. The check-in staff were great, being a member of the IHG club I was given a free drink voucher - not bad for a pint of Guinness. 

Had dinner in the bar, very good menu. I went for the Thai red chicken curry, which was very nice indeed. Could have done with being spicier though!

The rooms are great! Lovely shower, very powerful!

Location is perfect for the airport as it is off the grounds. Also not a bad location for central Dublin. My Uber came to something like 20EUR.",5,2018,01,24
250,"Convenient, quiet, comfortable","I stayed at this hotel overnight, after completing a driving holiday with friends, who dropped of the rental car at the airport and caught an evening flight, while I had to wait for a morning flight from Dublin airport. I was particularly attracted by the location at a sufficient distance to avoid excessive aircraft noise, but with availability of a shuttle service to and from the airport. Unfortunately, this was not readily apparent from the airport end, but worked fine the next morning taking me back to the airport. The hotel and room were clean, pleasant, comfortable, everything I needed and wanted for the purpose. The staff were helpful and the room service meal tasty and generous. A hotel most fit for my purpose.",3,2018,01,24
250,Good but not perfect.,"One night stay at the hotel prior to early flight next morning.

Entrance / Reception / Front Desk:
A nice looking entrance, good decor but dimly lit lighting.
A nice greeting from reception staff and very easy check-in.

Room:
1st floor room with two double beds and en-suite bathroom with a separate ‘walk in’ shower which is terrific. The room and bathroom have been decorated really nice and very modern.
Good quality furniture and bedding but the TV is very small and can only be seen from one of the beds?
Large wardrobe available, HVAC system easy to operate and adjust as required.
Very quiet with no sound from corridor or adjoining rooms.

Bar/ Restaurant:
Had an evening meal, decent menu but quite expensive, there is also a separate Restaurant but did not venture into it, expect meal price will be much more expensive.
Our waitress was ok but when meals arrived an item was missing, she said she would go and get it from the kitchen but totally forgot? Did eventually bring the missing item but meal almost finished by then.

Once finished our meal asked waitress for our bill, but once again waitress totally forgot about us (too busy talking to people (not eating) at entrance.
Eventually left our table and stood by the till to pay our bill, waitress arrived and we were soon on our way, no apology for forgetting about us TWICE, really not acceptable considering the Bar/Restaurant was not that busy.

Check Out:
Had a good nights sleep, early check out to catch the 5am Shuttle bus to Dublin Airport.
No ‘good morning’ greeting from front desk staff, and on handing over our room cards he leaned over and just snatched them out of my wife’s hand and turned away from us?

No mention of how was our stay? which is very unusual in any hotel.
While waiting in reception for shuttle bus we realised there is no sign of any security personnel in the lobby area.
People seem to be able to just wander in and walk straight past reception without any intervention from staff?
Also noticed ‘a lady of the night’ offering her services to a young gentleman, pretty shocked by this and with no intervention from hotel staff?

Airport Shuttle Bus:
Disaster, too many people with too much baggage trying to board bus. No driver to be seen, no one co-ordinating passengers, its a free for all.
On arrival at Terminal 2 (our get off stop) it’s carnage, we are located on seats at rear of bus, struggle to get past passengers and children and on reaching front of bus we find the driver has let other passengers onto the bus and are now blocking our exit off the bus, once again no intervention from driver to stop anymore people getting on, eventually exit the bus, total shambles, no one in charge.

Round-Up:
This is not an Airport hotel, it is a long way from airport, cost us 15 Euro’s in taxi from airport, a good 10 - 15 minute journey.

Nice clean hotel, bar food average, staff ok but not usual high standard.

Room very good, clean and with very modern decor and furniture.

Would I return? probably not, will try another airport hotel next time. 

First impressions are paramount to me, staff attitude was excellent at check-in but let down by one person at next morning check-out.",3,2018,01,23
250,Great hotel.,"I stayed here last night and can only praise the hotel for its wonderful staff. I would particularly like to praise Olga and Beth at the front desk for their professionalism.
They have been here for a number of years and always welcome and appreciate guests, particularly those who have stayed in the hotel for many years. 
I stay in hotels all of the time and sometimes hotel staff can forget that it is the customer who keeps the doors open. This is never the case with these ladies and it is always appreciated when they recognize and welcome you to their hotel.",5,2018,01,23
250,Touzai,Zharmaine provide excellent service with a smile and Chef Lui makes the best omelette in the world👍👍👍.  The whole bfast experience was excellent with lots of choices and with  Zharmaine and chef  Lui around it was even better.  Very happy to go back till next time,5,2018,01,23
250,Decent hotel good breakfast - noisy cleaning ladies,"I’m removing 2 stars because:

- Room is way too hot and dry event with the Heating turned off, I got up in the middle of the night because of this

- Very noisy cleaning ladies at 7 am, no respect for customer sleep. At 7 am cleaning ladies were banging glass bottles  against each other, in their little storage room, just outside my room.",3,2018,01,21
250,Lovely hotel with great staff,"We only had time for a quick overnight stay because of an early a.m. flight, it would have been nice to stay longer to enjoy the hospitality of the staff and the hotel amenities.  Anthony checked us in, and was so friendly and welcoming. After seeing how much baggage the four of us arrived with, he upgraded us to a larger room. He also was very helpful with arranging a ride to the airport in the morning and even arranging a to-go breakfast for us since we had to leave so early. Our room was very nice and comfortable. I was too tired to use any of the hotel amenities but my husband and son used the gym and said it was one of the better hotel gyms we've seen, and afterwards went to the bar/lounge for some drinks. There was a slight mixup in the morning with our ride to the airport; the shuttle doesn't start until 4am but we had to be at the airport at 3am; so the gentlemen at the front desk called us a taxi which arrived promptly. However, after trying to fit one suitcase in his car and looking at the rest of our bags, the driver gave up and left us at the hotel, telling us to call another taxi! This could have been a disaster for us, but the hotel staff stepped up and drove us to the airport himself, and dropped us right in front of our terminal (which I think the airport doesn't allow). So, much thanks and appreciation for the staff of this hotel who went above & beyond to make our stay pleasant!",5,2018,01,19
250,Beyond our expectations,"We spent one night at this hotel before returning home and it was not as we expected. 
We chose Executive Club room, just to be more comfortable and get a good rest. The room was quite small, while the bathroom was unusually big compared to the size of the room.
When we arrived the room was very cold, as if the AC was on. We tried to adjust the temperature, but realized soon that the highest setting was 24 C and the fan was still blowing cool air. Therefore we turned it off, hoping it would warm up a bit while we left for dinner, but that did not happen. It was a cold night in Dublin and the duvet provided did not do any justice. We ended up sleeping with our clothes on. 
The next morning both my husband and I craved a warm shower. My husband went in first and reported that water was freezing. Therefore he did not manage to have shower at all. I had a cold shower instead, as I did not have any other choice.
Also we ended up paying for the minibar, because I removed some items to make space for my medication. After that I realized that minibar was sensor operated and as soon as you remove an item it charges it to your room. Also the fridge was a toy size. This was the first time we experienced it and we travel quite a lot.
Unfortunately we did not have time to bring this to the attention of the staff upon checkout as we had to catch the shuttle right after breakfast.
The only positive thing about this hotel was breakfast with a variety of items to chose from.",3,2018,01,10
250,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed here on St. Stephan's night, and was travelling to the Sates early in the morning, so i requested a quiet room as i had a child with me.

Anthony checked us in, who was friendly and efficient , and gave us a beautiful room on the 4th floor, 

The decor of this hotel is fabulous.

Definitely will return.",5,2018,01,10
250,A very happy experience,This was my third visit but the first with my wife who is disabled. The staff were wonderful and as helpful as anyone could be especially Anthony and Petru from the front desk. I could not recommend them higher.,4,2018,01,08
250,Great Bar,"I was very pleased with my trip to crown plaza as the food I found to be tremendous, my friend and I could not have been more pleased with or meal and visit and it was only made all the better by our waiter Tommy. Tommy was possibly the most attentive and polite waiter we’ve ever come across as he made sure we were always well seen to and also took the time to make conversation with us which only improved or experience and created a more friendly atmosphere to the place. If all the staff were to be the same I would not hesitate to return and to recommend it to friends.",5,2018,01,05
250,Very comfortable-,"A wonderful night to end a glorious holiday in Ireland. Large comfortable room, excellently appointed. While the classical hotels in the city had their intrigue, it was a pleasure to stay in a hotel where the rooms are dead quite. You didn’t hear people next to or above you.

 Breakfast was fantastic as well.

The only issue we had was the hairdryer, 2hich only blew out warm hair. (We tried 2)",4,2018,01,05
250,very friendly staff,"I had the pleasure of staying for 1 night and I had a room service from a lovely server Sharmaine who was very friendly and nice, she added a lot to my experience with how genuine and nice she was from receiving my order over the phone to delivering it

Also the bed was and cleanliness was excellent",4,2018,01,03
250,Great Staff,"Had a lovely stay . Cant thank all your staff enough, special mention to Jon in the restaurant.food was outstanding. will definitely be coming back and recommending your hotel to my friends and family.",5,2018,01,02
250,The people!,"The staff at this hotel are phenomenal! I felt welcomed and greeted by all the staff on my travels. The restaurant and bar area serves great food and drinks, their waiters were very personable and knowledgable on everything! They were happy to talk about food as well as offer recommendations for fun activities to do in the area! The staff member, Tommy, was especially friendly, he was the main contributor to this 5 star rating! I am thoroughly impressed with his wonderful service!",5,2017,12,28
250,Excellent staff,"I was in the mood for a nice drink, and decided to go to the bar. I was served by a barman named Tommy, he was exceptional to say the least. Kind, cheerful and funny. Will definitely go again. Thank you :)",5,2017,12,28
250,Lovely staff ,We stayed here recently for one night before flying from Dublin airport. The family room was very comfortable and for an airport hotel very quiet. We ate in the bar and the food was nice. We left our car in the secure car park unfortunately our flight was delayed and we were lucky to get the last shuttle back. I'd leave my car at one of the airport carparks in future as the bus service is more reliable and frequent ,4,2017,12,26
250,Nice hotel convenient to airport,"We had a Club King room that was very well appointed with all the expected amenities, a little smaller than I expected but modern with an extremely comfortable bed, large tv, safe, nice toiletries, large walk in shower, but with weak water flow, and access to the club lounge.  We found someone's sweater crumpled up in the wardrobe so room cleaning left something to be desired.  Restaurant was good and staff was friendly.  A smoking area has been established directly in front of the main entrance which is very annoying as the smoke impedes safe entry and exit to the hotel as well as while waiting for the shuttle.",4,2017,12,25
250,Highy Recommended,"Great location, lovely park nearby, lots of parking, near bus routes, great food, very clean and comfortable bedrooms, fine restaurant, parking very convenient and a brilliant helpful receptionist in Olga - so helpful and good humoured - Crown Plaza are very lucky to have staff of this calibre. The only negative - The bar definitely need more staff - service terribly slow.",4,2017,12,22
250,Exceptional experience,"Stayed here recently in a club room between flights.
The staff could not have been more helpful - ensuring we had access to the club lounge prior to our check in and delivering our luggage to our room.
Accommodation was particularly good with little touches like “this works sleep spray”.
We were made to feel very welcome and would definitely recommend this hotel.
Even the receptionist made sure we had the correct change for the bus journey into Dublin City.
I feel the staff went above and beyond.  What a refreshing change compared to some of the other hotels we have stayed in .  Well done!",5,2017,12,22
250,Terrific place but be careful of the shuttle from the airport,"No complaints at all. Wonderful staff , close to airport , good food and well appointed rooms.

BUT- be very cautious about the shuttle to the hotel from the airport. The hotel shuttles are located at Zone 16 a bit of a walk from the terminal. The problem is that the walkway to Zone 16 splits in two. Either way will get you there but if you take the one to the right, as I did, you will probably, as I did , end up at the wrong location since there are two distinct areas for the buses and the hotel shuttles.

The one for the hotels is at the end of the covered walkway if you go to the left.

But if you end up at the one for the buses it is impossible to tell that you are in the wrong location. 

This is especially true at night .

One you get to the proper place the Crowne Plaza Shuttle is not a normal van sized shuttle but is a full size bus which only is identified  as such by two small signs pasted to the front and side windows. These are virtually invisible in the dark and I stood by for more than a half hour missing at lest one bus because it’s almost impossible to identify it.

I complained bitterly upon finally arriving at the hotel and was treated very considerately and professionally by staff. 
My email complaint was also promptly and professionally responded to. 

But upon my return to the hotel a week after my first mishap the bus remains the same with two tiny signs pasted onto the windows.

So be careful.

Other than that this is a great hotel with great staff. ",5,2017,12,22
250,Great Bar,Went to the bar with friends and a small bite to eat. Great atmosphere and we were severed by a polite young man behind the bar called Tommy.  He was a gent and very attentive. We will be back. Thanks you and special thanks to Tommy,5,2017,12,21
250,Terrible experience due to unannounced alarm,"I visited the Crowne Plaza to enjoy a Christmas lunch in their bar and my experience was dreadful . There was a planned alarm testing that NOBODY was informed of . We went into the bar and ordered food and a couple of minutes later an extremely loud, high-pitched alarm proceeded to ring for over 20 minutes . If we had know this was going to happen there is no way on earth this would have ever ordered. Our lunch was ruined and not once did any member of staff apologise . People had to stand outside the hotel the screeching of the alarm was that loud ! When I questioned the bar manager about why this was never announced to customers he tried to tell me the staff were informing everyone , our ordering experience involved someone taking our order and before that another staff member greeting us and neither informed us of the dreadful alarm we were about to endure. The lack of apology or remorse from the bar manger would put me off ever coming back. And to make matters worse the food was extremely slow. Very very disappointed ",1,2017,12,20
250,Friendly and Attentive staff,"I have been using the hotel regularly over the last two and half years and routinely frequent the Bar to eat. Am always impressed by Jim, Edit and Peter all of whom take the time and effort to be friendly and attentive, even when the room is busy.",4,2017,12,19
250,Friendly staff!,"We came here for dinner from the next door Holiday Inn and were served by the very friendly and helpful Anna. Service was fantastic and she made us feel very welcomed. When learning our daughter was sick, Anna offered to take the food we had packaged for our daughter up to the room herself - very kind and made a deep impression on us. If we had to stay near the airport again, we would choose Crowne Plaza!",5,2017,12,17
250,Great food and friendly staff,Had breakfast with my partner and friends in this hotel and the food are really nice. A variety to choose from and freshly cooked. The staffs are wonderful and smiling alot. Special credit to staff Zharmaine Macaranas for her cordial and superb service two thumbs up to you! Youre doing a great job. ,4,2017,12,16
250,A very good restaurant and helpful staff.,"Delicious breakfast in the hotel. Zharmaine was very helpful and very friendly to us. The place is very spacious and the Santry Demesne park in front of the hotel is a very nice place to do your morning jog.

Would definitely visit again.",4,2017,12,15
250,Executive Room 4th Floor,As a Platinum IHG member I got a free upgrade to the club floor. The room was of high standard and you have access to the club lounge. This is my fourth stay at this hotel. Everything is good and there is a free shuttle bus to Dublin Airport.,5,2017,12,14
250,Amazing stay!!,I recently visited this hotel with my sister for a senior trip! Tommy Donnelly was an amazing worker and totally made my stay! Wish he could work with me!! I think that if he wasn't employed at this hotel then I would have hated my stay!!,5,2017,12,12
250,Good experience and immediate response from staff,"Great, quick service with a bar and multiple restaurants. About 30 min from the downtown area but not a bad travel as you can catch the public transit at 2.70€. Has a gym and park across the street to stroll or jog. Would recommend to anyone that doesn't want to stay near the city but it is very close to the airport with a free shuttle to and from. I should also mention we had an issue with some other patrons of the hotel and smoking - this was addressed immediately by the manager and staff and made it a better stay! // Excelente servicio rápido con un bar y varios restaurantes. A unos 30 minutos del centro de la ciudad, pero no es un mal viaje ya que puedes tomar el transporte público a 2,70 €. Tiene un gimnasio y un parque al otro lado de la calle para pasear o trotar. Lo recomendaría a cualquiera que no quiera alojarse cerca de la ciudad, pero está muy cerca del aeropuerto con un servicio de transporte gratuito desde y hacia.",5,2017,12,11
250,Room service,I came here for work purpose and was tired m sick ... i ordered for some breakfast and time was passed to order the b/f but ms. Zharmaine and chef Lui got a delicious food for me and when i cleared the tray she got fruit basket for me.. i was so impressed and happy with the gesture.. i am so happy with the room service and hospitality.,5,2017,12,11
250,Amazing staff,"I was very pleased with this place, especially its staff. I was served at the bar by an attentive and hard working young man named Tommy, who got me my drink with hardly a wait at all and was polite and a pleasure to talk to. The front desk staff and waiters impressed me as well. It was a great stay, and I hope to be back!",5,2017,12,10
250,Great stay,"The wifi is very fast and the room was very neat and big.  Front desk clirques are very accomudating . The waiters are very friendly and enthusiastic in their work. Special thanks to Stephan GM , Shauna HR, Frank and Liam Deputy Manager and the breakfast Chef , Chef Louie Nolasco.",5,2017,12,10
250,Not a hotel...it's A HOME,"We had our Xmas Party/Ball in this lovely hotel last December 8. From the very start we were given utmost attention by Laura and Shauna. All the details and expectations was met and beyond. From Stephan (deputy GM) to the nite duty managers Frank and Liam and their crew, from the people in reception, to the waiters and bartenders made sure our needs are attended. They gave their service a personal touch. The Fahreinheit Ballroom, for a 100 people is spacious enough. the table centerpieces, the lights, the temperature, parking space and the hotel's accessibility are plus factors.
Most of us decided to stay for the night, simple because, they generously gave us a good deal, affordable nite stay for 2 with breakfast. Their rooms are clean and cozy and best of all, its sound proof. The bed and pillows are very comforable. 
The buffet breakfast is also a standout, a very good range of choices, well prepared. we had the oppurtunity to experience their service several times during the planning of our event,  the managers Karolina and Jon, the chefs n the waiters and just wonderful. We the members of USAD Filipino- Irish Employees of St. Vincent's Hospital Elm Park D4. HIGHLY RECOMMENDS this hotel, for any event or occassion. We will definitely be back.",5,2017,12,09
250,Great Venue for Parties,"We held our Christmas Party at the Fahrenheit Ballroom and was looked after very well by the banqueting staff. Shauna was very accommodating and everything we have discussed/agreed from the booking until the actual event were all met. The Deputy General Manager Stephan and his team namely Frank & Liam (Duty Managers) were excellent. Aside from the excellent service from the staff, the place is in a very good location with ample parking. It is also accessible via M-50 and few minutes away from the airport.  Definitely will recommend if anyone is looking for a venue for your next event.",5,2017,12,09
250,Excellent,"Stayed here 4 adults and 3 children, rooms were lovely staff are great and breakfast was excellent, the chef even brought sliced berries for our toddler and even though we were late for breakfast he made fresh waffles and pancakes for us.
We will definitely be back",5,2017,12,06
250,Great place to meet up,"We picked this place as it was a handy meeting point for my friend and I have to say we were not sorry. Lovely bar and great staff, especially a young waiter named Tommy. Would recommend as a meeting place for business or pleasure.",5,2017,12,05
250,"Disappointing check-in, rest was better","I arrived at a busy check-in.  As a Spire Ambassador, one of the benefits is priority check-in.  The priority queue, unfortunately, wasn't enforced as the guy let two people check-in who asked if their Club Carlson cards could be used at the hotel.  Turned out they weren't even members of the IHG programme.  When I eventually got to the front of the other, usual, queue, I mentioned this to the guy who appeared to be in charge.  The reply - ""Sorry, the priority queue isn't working today"" which I thought was a strange reply.  You either offer it and enforce it or you don't.  His demeanour seemed to improve when he saw what my status was.  I had booked a suite and there was no further upgrade.  The lounge was fine although the drinks aren't self pour so you have to hover around the door of the cupboard where the waitress keeps the drinks or wait until she comes around the tables.  The room was gorgeous though.  A very comfy bed with separate living and dining area.  It was all immaculately clean.  The Thai restaurant was good (that was after I spent a few minutes waiting to be seen at the entrance as no staff were present).  This was my second time here.  The check-in soured the experience and left me thinking that it wasn't as great as my last time.",3,2017,12,04
250,A second lovely stay,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Dublin airport last year and had an excellent visit. I stayed again last weekend and had The same experience. The hotel is immaculate.  Room and bathroom the same. Bed so comfortable.  Breakfast and dinner could not be faulted,  so tasty and plentiful.  All staff friendly and helpful. I will have no hesitation  staying here again. Access to Dublin by bus from a stop very close to the hotel, we also took a taxi to see a show, I felt it was a very reasonable price. One small negative which I found was adults wearing pyjamas to breakfast.,I didn't find that acceptable.",4,2017,12,03
250,Big thanks to Lui the cheif,"My name is Nesma Hamed, and I would like personally thank Lui for such a great service he provided to us .. great positive attitude make us recommend the the hotel to all our friends and family members. 

All the staff was very helpful jon, Jams and especially Lui.

Thanks team.",4,2017,12,01
250,Thank you,"I would just like to say thank you for a beautiful meal I enjoyed with my Mam. Your hotel was recommended to us by a friend a while ago and we kept meaning to go. We finally got down to you Friday where we had a lovely meal in a lovely relaxing atmosphere. The food was beautiful and your staff were very attentive especially Anna who served us, she was so helpful and pleasant to deal with. We will definitely be back and I will definitely recommend to friends 😊",5,2017,11,26

",5,2017,11,26
250,Bar staff ,"The bar staff, specifically a young gentleman named Tommy was such a pleasure. I went down for a drink as a solo traveler who wanted some company and the bar staff was such a pleasure to laugh and chat with. Very appreciative of the atmosphere. Highly suggest if you're a business traveler to strike up conversation with this group, you won't regret it. ",5,2017,11,25
250,A great hotel. Wonderful stay,"I was there last week for a company event. The stay was great. Rooms are very nice and clean. Service was great. We had a great stay, very nice people working there. The bar is quiet nice as well. will come back.",5,2017,11,25
250,Excellent Stay ,I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights for a biz conference. Stay was superb. People are very friendly. Breakfast menu was a bit boring. Same menu for everyday. Anyway good stay overall. Rooms were very comfortable. ,5,2017,11,24
250,Mrs Hickey ,"Lovely friendly atmosphere in bar / restaurant our waitress Anna was very friendly and helpful she made us feel special as nothing was a problem for this fussy eater !! Moroccan spiced chickpea stew a must try .
Would visit again soon just for the stew !",5,2017,11,23
250,Overnight stay,"Upon checking into the hotel, we were greeted by the lovely Olga. Nothing was too much trouble. As it was our honeymoon, Olga upgraded myself & my wife to a suite and then proceeded to send a bottle of prosecco and some chocolates to our room. Such a lovely gesture. I travel quite a lot with my job and stay in numerous hotels and I would like to highlight the excellent customer service that we received by Olga and the staff of the Crowne Plaza Hotel. This is way above the standard of any airport hotel that we have used and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel to other guests. we will be back!",5,2017,11,23
250,Great Bar,Had food here with a friend and drinks. We were served by Tommy a very polite and efficient young waiter. Service was great and we appreciated the care and attention that he took with us. Food and drinks were great especially the chicken burger. Will be back again,5,2017,11,22
250,Park and Fly Night,"We stayed here near the airport the night before a flight at a price that included leaving our car behind until we returned a week later. Beautiful Hotel, Best rate we could find. No glitches, greeted by Beth at check in and Check out, very pleasant and courteous,   Comfy beds, excellent breakfast and a had a night cap before bed, the airport shuttle to airport runs every 20-30 min, will highly recommend this hotel to friends and family",5,2017,11,21
250,visit to hotel,"Stayed in sister hotel, holiday Inn and decided to use the bar facilities in Crown Plaza,    we certainly were not disappointed,  served by Shaji 
who was very professional, quite informative regarding surrounding area.  Would highly recommend Crown Plaza.",5,2017,11,21
250,Andrew H in the lounge,"Absolutely wonderful associate Andrew H. was more than helpful with our inquiries and our visit at the lounge on more than one occasion. Andrew should be commended on his great customer service skills. Cannot say enough about how pleased we were with him, thank you so much Andrew for making us feel welcome.",5,2017,11,20
250,Best nachos in Dublin,"Myself and a group have friends have visited twice for food in the last month and can’t recommend highly enough for tasty bar food in a relaxed atmosphere. All 5 had different foods- all enjoyed especially the nacho’s to share.
Both times we were lucky to be served by Tommy. He is extremely attentive without being intrusive. Would definitely return again & recommend to others.",5,2017,11,19
250,Comfortable bed,After a 14hours flight + jet lag I was so happy to find a comfortable bed and it was awesome. I don’t know if this is the mattress or the bed linen but it was just perfect. Only downside is the noisy fan in the bathroom where I could not find a way to turn it off. ,4,2017,11,19
250,Perfect Stay,"We booked one night at the Crowne Plaza in Dublin due to a long layover, and we could not have been more pleased. The staff were amazing, the bar was lovely, and the room was incredibly clean. As always, Crowne Plaza beds are legendary, and the amenities were truly useful (including the sleep spray for the pillows). 

To be noted, Andrew H at the Cinnabar was amazing. He was a great bartender, but moreover: he was a great host to Dublin. He gave us multiple recommendations that were catered to our interests, and took the time to write them all down, give us some context, and rank them in terms of his personal taste.",5,2017,11,18
250,10 mins from airport helpful staff room noise an issue,"Stayed here on business.  It's 10 mins drive from airport and was convenient.  It has an airport shuttle if you a're not in a hurry. Rooms were noisy as you can hear doors slamming and tv sound from the next door.. the staff were helpful.
Aircon seems to be set at only one temp . Breakfast was standard.",3,2017,11,18
250,Always a pleasant stay,"Staying here for work few times a year and it always makes feel excited to be back.
Staff were friendly and accomodating feom the momemnt you check in. Breakfast selection is outstanding, James gives you a warm welcome, Zharmaine and Justine were excellent and give attention to details to special requests both in the restaurant and room service. Bed is comfy and room is immaculate. Well done!",5,2017,11,17
250,Beautiful Hotel and Great Staff,"The hotel location is great. only 30 minutes from the city . Only a 10 minute drive from/to airport and taxis are  not expensive. 
The Hotel is very clean and the staff are really great. thank you Beth for the great recommendations and across from the hotel a great running track.

We had a room on  the 4th floor and to say it was amazing , great Club Lounge with excellent nibbles in the evening time we had a great sleep undisturbed,  a great hotel and I would stay there again on my next visit.",5,2017,11,17
250,Impressed,"Lovely hotel.  Extremely helpful and friendly staff.  Bedrooms are very nice and clean and bed is super comfy.  I like the fact that there is both a shower and a bath, along with a bathrobe 😊. Breakfast is delicious with a great choice and food/drinks are piping hot.  I consider myself quite fussy and am pleased to say that I have not been disappointed 😊",5,2017,11,17
250,yet another great visit,we have had yet another trade show at this great hotel     nothing is too much trouble whatever you ask the staff to do  they are more than willing to help  it was a refreshing surprise that there was a young man called darren  who was a great help in moving our equipment from the loading bay up to the rooms  on the first floor   normally young people  his age just dont move  but he was great     a big thanks to shona for all her help   as per usual  there are so many people to thank    all i can say is if you need a hotel for a stay over or a conference in the area   this hotel MUST  go to the top of your list   We have already  re booked for next year,5,2017,11,15
250,Coffee and Nibbles,"This was my first visit to this hotel as I have never had  any reason to visit it before today.
On entering I was very impressed with the decor and the layout and ambience of the seating  and bar area.
We met a work mate for coffee and decided to try their chicken wings, which turned out to be delicious.
The three members of staff we encountered were extremely pleasant and helpful a credit to the hotel.
The next time I am flying out from Dublin Airport on an early flight I plan to book in here and try out their rooms.",5,2017,11,14
250,Excellent Front Desk Staff,"Stayed at this hotel for one night for  convienence and a very good rate offered on a Sunday Night due to attending a funeral in a neighbouring village. From booking the room at late notice with Silvia at Reception a few days prior to arrival, I was lucky enough to meet SIlvia on the evening of check in. She was more than just  'doing her job'  she was kind, attentive and cared about her guests as I have  worked in the hotel business as a manager with 30 years of experience, I could see she was very efficient, kind, caring and a conscientious employee, glad she was there on check in. Thank you Sylvia
That said, the trainee Daniel and the front office supervisor were equally as kind and attentive.

On check out I had an issue which could have cost me a lot of time which I did not have and most of all money but luckily I met another concientious and caring employee, Krystian...amazing fella.. efficient, prompt, attentive and most of all capable of making a decision to ensure his customer will come back again and in my case use Crowne Plaza hotel next January in New York. Thank you Krystian.

Room was comfortable, not a fan of the ""fan"" heating system though!!! Breakfast selection was outstanding and staff in club lounge and the other staff who say hello to you in the corridors just make your day!

All about the customer service and the simple greeting from staff you encounter during your stay.

Thank you crowne plaza and I will be back/recommend.",5,2017,11,14
250,This is a great Hotel,"Everything in this Hotel is fine.  The bedroom is very cozy and the beds are the best, very nice to sleep in.   The service and the atmosphere is excellant.   The restaurants are excellent also.   
Opposite the Hotel is a nice garden with a pond,  very good to take a walk.",5,2017,11,13
250,Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Dublin,"In coming to Dublin with work for the last 12 months almost every week, the service afforded by the staff in the hotel is second to none. 

It is incredibly unfair to single anybody out in particular, however credit needs to be given where credit needs to be given. I’ll apologise for not naming everyone but trust me, they are all good. 

Olga, Silvia, Kristian and Beth on the front desk are always on the ball with me. Straight to the point and understand exactly the reception I need whether it’s 8am in the morning or 11pm at night. 

Anna, Aisling and Edit are top class and very personal with their customer service. Even if I do frustrate them with my salad orders. 

I don’t think I could actually write a review that actually encompasses everyone but every single one of your staff members should be praised from Breakfast to Dinner to Bar, from check in to lounge and Check out to the next time. 

Big thanks for the hospitality to everyone in CP Dublin Airport in 2017.

Marc.",5,2017,11,13
250,Tommy is hospitable and incredibly friendly,"I was having a drink at the bar with my friend, Eva when one of your handsome waiters came over, Tommy. He asked us about our day and made us feel incredibly at home. We felt like we were talking to a very old friend. He made sure we were comfortable and we never felt like we were a hassle or a chore. We would definitely come back again. Thank you, Tommy, you charming chap xx",5,2017,11,13
250,"Mildew in room, poor attitude, sub-par hotel experience","Very disappointing end to a wonderful vacation in Ireland.  The room was not ventilated properly, so it smelled like dirty socks.  Front desk staff not very helpful.  Definitely recommend travelers stay in one of the nice authentic hotels in Dublin instead.  ",1,2017,11,12
250,"Fabulous hotel, experience made even better by the staff!!!","As airport hotels go, this is by far the best I’ve stayed in. Close to the airport, lovely location and rooms.

However for me the experience was made even better by the staff. From the great reception team on check in to the breakfast & bar staff, it was a great experience and nothing was ever too much trouble.

I would highly recommend!!",5,2017,11,12
250,"Close to Airport, Contemporary and Welcoming","We stayed the day in October 2017 that Hurricane Ophelia raced through Ireland.  I was very nervous in all the wind and apprehension of the storm.  We called in the AM to insure a room would be saved for us.  We had used Bookings.  They were friendly and assured us a room.  Later at the airport in all the screaming wind and rain, the airport was closing.  But the Crowne Plaza shuttle was still running, ON SCHEDULE!  We waited maybe 5 minutes, drove around a huge downed tree near the hotel and were welcomed and safe.  Bar was full but charming and good bar food there.  Lovely room.  Never so glad to check into a hotel, and the hotel was great.  On time shuttle again in the morning.  Maybe a bit pricey for an airport hotel but probably worth it.",5,2017,11,12
250,"DEPLORABLE SERVICE, BAD ATTITUDE, BOGUS CC CHARGES","We arrived with our traveling companions at Crown Plaza Northwood Dublin for our last night in Ireland to be checked in by a curt, discourteous Olga at Reception, a greeting that was totally inconsistent with our visit in Ireland.  We requested that our room be billed separately from our traveling companions, which Olga rudely rebuffed. After repeating the request, Olga curtly stated, “I know what I’m doing”.  When we checked out at 7:15am both room charges had been placed on our traveling companion’s CC, requiring a credit to their card, then billing to our card. This transaction took some time, making us tardy for the hotel airport shuttle which, in turn, pissed-off the shuttle driver who sped off before the four of us were seated, sending our wives to the floor and our bags skidding the length of the bus, putting us all at risk of injury. He then abruptly stopped, slamming on the brakes, jostling our baggage and wives again. He turned around and rudely exclaimed that he could not proceed until we were seated, and glared at us, which was very weird.  He then drove forward a short distance, stopped abruptly to pick up another woman passenger, speeding off before she was seated or had stowed her luggage in another egregious show of scorn. We were appalled, especially in contrast with the genuinely friendly people of Ireland who, without exception, greeted us with sincere interest, curiosity, enthusiasm, and grace. This Crown Plaza Northwood staff appeared to be inept, with a contemptuous attitude, suggesting they could take a page, and some professional training, from Ireland’s superb and vibrant tourist professionals.  Also, to add insult to injury, the front desk double charged my credit card for our stay, which I will have to dispute and resolve. Unbelievable!  We were traveling with friends who had attended a 4-day conference at this Crown Plaza two weeks previous, leaving us with a deplorable impression. Crown Plaza Northwood was a disappointing ending to our stellar 16 days of travel in Ireland.  My recommendation is to avoid this property.",1,2017,11,12
250,Convenient and comfortable,The Crowne Plaza is conveniently close to the airport and also not far from the City centre.  It obviously won't have the atmosphere of a city centre hotel but it is comfortable and the staff are very helpful.  The bathroom was slightly dated but otherwise everything was very comfortable about the accommodation. ,4,2017,11,12
250,Fantastic Staff member and great hotel.,"Our Server, Andrew H, was an asset to the business.genuine and helpful. Overall good staff but Andrew H stood out.Shame all hotels dont have staff like Andrew.
Prices a little expensive in the bar though.Good standard of decor within the hotel.",5,2017,11,11
250,"Must Stay! Beautiful, Friendly, and Comfortable! Close to Airport","I loved this hotel. We had a long layover in Dublin so we picked this hotel to stay at. I am so glad we did. The place was beautiful and clean, the staff was super helpful and friendly. There was a problem with the heat but they fixed it the problem within 10 minutes. The bar had a great atmosphere and the drinks and dessert was wonderful. 

We paid extra for the breakfast buffet in the morning (you really should buy). The variety was amazing and the food was perfect. Again the staff was friendly and helpful.

Across the road is a beautiful park that I wish i had more time to explore. 

I would stay here again and again.",5,2017,11,08
250,Perfect for our 16 hour layover...,"So nice that I wished that we could have stayed longer.  Lovely, modern, comfortable, and with all of the amenities that one might expect.  AND enjoyed a great beer and traditional fish and chips in the hotel bar.  Our waiter, Tommy, was very gracious, helpful, and efficient in his service to a couple of Americans.",5,2017,11,08
250,Lovely start to holiday,"A group of 4 of us had a very enjoyable evening in the bar of the Crowne Plaza Santry last month. We were staying with friends in Northwood for the night before going to the airport the following morning and popped in for some light bites and drinks. The food was very tasty, well portioned and reasonably priced. We had intended on staying for just the one quick after dinner drink but ended up extending our evening, enjoying some delicious gins and tonics and hot whiskeys made by an absolute gent of a barman (Jim B). He was extremely friendly and personable to all in our party and it was clear that he was a very experienced barman, recommending new gins for us to try, also the hot whiskey was one of the best I have had in Dublin. The bar area was comfortable with nice ambient music at a good volume that allowed for easy conversation and the toilets were spotless. The staff at front desk were very pleasant too when handling a query that we had about airport taxi availability for the following morning. All in all, we had a great evening which very much got us into the holiday spirit; also the service we encountered would very much encourage us to try this hotel on future Dublin or airport trips.",5,2017,11,07
250,Very warm welcome,"I loved this hotel.  It was my fourth hotel in less than a week travelling around Dublin city and this was the best. The reception staff couldn't do enough to help us and it was nice and sparkly clean with lots of nice touches in our King Size rooms.  There's also a free shuttle to and from the airport.

Next time I am in Dublin I'll definitely be staying here again.",5,2017,11,07
250,Horrific Customer Service,"I am a frequent traveler and have had a wide variety of hotel experiences.  This hotel experience was the worst I've ever had, compelling me to write the first negative review of my life in order to warn other travelers.  We've just been dropped at the airport by the Crowne Plaza Shuttle.  The driver was very angry that he had to wait for us, even though we were loaded onto the shuttle by 7:20AM, the posted departure time.  Because he was angry, he peeled out of the driveway as soon as my travel companion (a senior in age) got on the bus, and he sent her flying.  At the following intersection he slammed on the brakes so hard that I came out of my seat and landed on the floor.  It was scary.  The reason we were scrambling to get on the bus in the first place?  The front desk fouled up our charges, charging both rooms to my account, so we had to spend time straightening that out prior to getting on the shuttle.  The night before, I'd tried to politely ask Olga, who checked us in, to make sure she charged the rooms to separate accounts, but she interrupted me in such a condescending and rude manner that I stopped the inquiry to avoid being further embarrassed by her attitude.  So turns out Olga didn't separate the charges, we had to scramble to make our shuttle, and the shuttle driver decided to teach us a lesson by driving so violently that we were literally falling into the aisles as our unsecured luggage bounced around us.  It was surreal.  I'm a seasoned traveler, I'd say I  stay in an average of one to two dozen different hotels around the world each year, and this is the worst customer service I've ever encountered.  I added a star for the restaurant service (Anna) and the porter who helped us move rooms (yes there was a major ventilation problem in our room and it reeked of mildew but I will just leave this review here.) If you are catching a plane out of Dublin and want a pleasant airport hotel prior to starting your journey, look elsewhere.  You've been warned.",2,2017,11,06
250,Great restaurant ,"Actually staying in hotel next door but had dinner at CP and had impeccable service by the lovely Anna.  After touring several countries in Europe I had a dreadful cold and Anna did all she could to make me comfortable, ending the evening with a hot whiskey so I would sleep.  Food good but mostly I’ll remember that CP is lucky to have Anna! ",5,2017,11,05
250,more than decent,"The hotel is nice, value for money. The Club on the 4th floor worth attention with very nice hungarian  waitres girl Edit ( or Edith). the hotel offers special 2h of free drinks and finger food. its nice and as long as you treat it as a bonus and not a must is nice. It was nice stay. partially thanks to very nice waitress Edit !
peace!",4,2017,11,03
250,"Great hotel (in the middle of nowhere, almost)","Great hotel, Crowne Plaza delivers as usual ! One thing though; I hardly saw staff smiling - why ? Nice park across the road for walking or jogging. Good and frequent shuttle service too. Bus stop for a ride to town just 5 mins walk away but traffic is horrible so takes much longer than the estimated 20 mins. ",4,2017,11,02
250,A Wonderful Experience,"We booked the Crowne Plaza  after reading reviews of the hotel on this site. From the moment we made the booking, directly via email, we received first class service which went above and beyond all my expectations.

Upon request, Beth  arranged airport transfers, a private car and the driver took  us around the city (to see the sites), and an abundance of local information to ease our stay.

We were allocated  a room on the 4th Floor and a glorious bathroom. The  room was immaculate with all the luxury toiletries, separate bath and shower which is fantastic to have Susan  and her staff keep the rooms so clean , 

The meals were well presented and tasty especially the breakfast we had a very nice meal in the bar 

We will highly recommend the hotel to friends and colleagues",5,2017,10,30
250,"Stephen, Jim B and Zi treated me like an old friend","So, you’ll be coming to Dublin Airport’s Hotels to meet the Irish and maybe be fitting in some work. I went to a residential conference run at the Crowne Plaza.

As soon as I sat down to relax at the bar the sincere and friendly bar staff were responsive, kind and well informed about everything I asked. Nothing was too much. Travelling away from home can be hard and it was a pleasure to be served by such able and kind staff. If only every hotel bar were like this. Many thanks.

Dublin has an explicit municipal policy of being a welcoming business hub and these folk have done their city proud again and again over my week here. ",5,2017,10,27
250,Beautiful Hotel Betrayed by Paper Thin Walls,"Nicely done up hotel and after an exhausting 3 3/4 hour bus ride I was looking to have good night sleep before my flight out in the morning. Here's where things went wrong. My neighbors came into their room at about 9:30 pm. I could plainly hear every word they spoke. I've heard from contractors that certain electrical wiring or even the nails used can conduct sound through a wall. I can't really blame the family that was next door to me but at 11:15 pm I called the front desk to complain about the sound. I told the front desk person that I didn't fault my neighbors but blamed the contractor who constructed a hotel with no sound barrier between the walls. 
Pity really, as it was a nice, smart looking hotel.
But most people stay at hotels for a good night's rest.",2,2017,10,27
250,Very nice stay,"One of the reasons I booked this hotel was it had a free airport shuttle.  We arrived very early in the day....around noontime.  I was very pleased when a room was ready for us then.  We dropped off our luggage and make tracks to the rental car return at the airport facility. (Thank goodness we had written down the coordinates of the rental location when picking up.)  First the Hertz shuttle, then the Crowne Plaza shuttle and we were back for the afternoon.  

All of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly.   

Our room had a comfy king bed and all the bells and whistles a business traveler could want....extra outlets for tech devices at the desk and near the bed,  thoughtful lighting for reading or such, and mini refrigerator.   The bathroom was large with a stall shower and separate tub and nice soap products.  

We left too early to sample the breakfast, but we did have a so-so meal Touzai restaurant.",4,2017,10,27
250,Drinks & Dinner,"The day before returning to the US, I stayed next door at the Holiday Inn Express Dublin Airport but had dinner and a beer in the bar in the Crown Plaza Dublin Airport. I have to say John was a phenomenal bartender. Since most patrons are probably there 1 or 2 nights, it would be easy to be mechanical about serving. But John easily made everyone at the bar feel welcome and as if they were long-term friends. And his friendly banter included the other staff. It was all friendly and not one of those unpleasant slam-fests that can be ugly. He prides himself on knowing something about every state. If you're in the Dublin Airport area, you would do well to have a beer and dinner with your new favorite bartender John F. Kennedy!",5,2017,10,23
250,Great Stay at the Crowne Plaza!,"We recently stayed here for our anniversary, and from booking with Nicole in reservations who was so helpful, to the lovely James who brought us wine to the room.  All the staff were so very nice, they even left a happy anniversary card in the room. The food in the restaurant was delicious, and we enjoyed a lovely walk in the surrounding parkland.  Looking forward to our next in the Crowne Plaza.",5,2017,10,22
250,Good value and nice to stay,"Stayed here recently with another couple. Rooms are grand and food in bar is excellent. Quality of bathrooms on floor 1 seem to be better than those on floor 2 in that there is a shower cubicle on floor one, but shower over bath on floor 2.

The place is good value and there is parking available.",4,2017,10,22
250,Wonderful friendly staff,"I  am a regular guest at this hotel and every time I  stay there I am delighted with my stay. The staff are truly amazing,reception staff greet guests with a smile and are so helpful. The housekeeping staff do an amazing job to keep the rooms spotless and welcoming.  The hotel has recently had a refurbishment and all rooms are so tastefully decorated. The beds are amazingly comfortable and the room has added touches of your choice of pillow type and a complimentary pillow spray and balm to help you sleep. The bathrooms have a separate shower and bath tub and are quite large and the towels are always soft and fluffy. The bar and restaurant offer a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes and the breakfast is second to none. Bar and restaurant staff greet each guest and are efficient and friendly.  I  would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and I am looking forward to my next stay.",5,2017,10,21
250,Recent stay,"We arrived into Dublin airport at 5:30 am, and had a reservation for later in the day.  When we arrived at the hotel we went in for a delicious breakfast while we were waiting to get into our room.  Staff was wonderful and was able to get us into our room early, so we could take a nap before meeting up with friends.  Room was great.  Staff helpful.  Would stay again.",5,2017,10,21
250,Great bar food,"Attended a business lunch in the hotels bar
Service was quick and friendly
Plenty of choice and variety on the menu
Quality of the food was very good
Overall is was perfect for what we required
Plenty of car parking in the multi story beside hotel
",5,2017,10,21
250,Food was delicious,"Friendly check-in (though being a wheelchair user i felt a bit daft since the counter top was up to my nose - i mean, come on!). We had 2 quiet rooms, decorated lovely (a superior & an accessible) both with comfortable king beds. The only difference i could spot was the accessible room's ensuite was larger to accommodate my wheelchair. There was no turning space however, so a lot of reversing going on throughout both the room & bathroom. But I had a bath! Hallellujah! so rare to have an accessible bathroom with bath, i was thrilled.
we had access to a quiet complimentary guest room with a really nice daytime snack & breakfast buffet & gorgeous coffee. 

We ordered really tasty filling meals with room service (30 min wait only) for both lunch & dinners. (I love that the allergens are clearly labelled on menus).
House wine was nice & bar atmosphere friendly. 
Taxis came on time.
Courtesy bus with frequent runs to/fro airport.
Hotel modern, fresh & clean throughout.
Excellent free wifi.
No waiting for the lifts. 

The only disappointments were: 
The ridiculously high check-in desk (Sit in front of it to see how it feels) 
My accessible room couldn't accommodate a turning wheelchair (try walking backwards the whole time!) 
& no ground decaff coffee anywhere in the hotel (it's a little point but i've never come across this before). 

If it hadn't have been for those 3 little points above, the hotel experience was deserving of 5 stars.  But i'd still love to stay again ❤️.",4,2017,10,20
250,Super trip,I visited your hotel in September for short overnight stay before travelling to Amsterdam we had a fantastic stay and had great help from the front desk staff Beth gave us directions to the local cinema at the Pavilion shopping centre. I will be back to stay again when I have to fly out again many thanks,5,2017,10,19
250,Mr,"I recently stayed at this hotel in August, great location close to the airport and Dublin city. A comfortable stay made and made feel at home by Elizabeth. A memorable experience and I'll be staying again in the near future. Thank you. ",5,2017,10,19
250,Great Staff,"I have stayed in this hotel many times and as always I cannot fault it. A special mention to Jon and James in the restaurant. Every time I stay here, their excellent  level of customer service is consistent. They go out of their way to ensure that everything is just right. I look forward to my next stay at this hotel.

250,Fantastic Hotel Beyond Excellent,"Staff go out of their way to help.Special shout out to Olga,Edit and the tall guy at Breakfast (sorry i never asked his name)
 We were there for 10 days for a Karate Tournament. Excellent Rooms comfortable beds. Great Food. The 1st day of the tournament we went to the lobby to order 2 taxis and because it was raining there was a hour wait. The Girl at the front desk went and asked the Shuttle bus driver if he was able to drop us off on his way to the Airport he was happy to oblige on our way the shuttle bus driver said he would drop us off every morning if we wanted.
There were 3 families in total and not 1 of us had anything negative to say
Thank You So Much For Everything

250,Excellent Dining Experience,"Had dinner tonight at your restaurant and it was thoroughly delicious. Each member at our table was cared for, all thanks to Colin, the restaurant manager. Colin really made our dining experience 5 stars. I will definitely return soon.",5,2017,10,16
250,restaurant at the crowne plaza,"Very busy evening the 26th of September, 2017, we were apprehensive the service would be slow. Not at all. Excellent food selection with mid east overtones served up with good advice by Iwona, a delightful young lady who takes customer service seriously. 

Passing through Dublin airport we'd look forward to a repeat experience.",5,2017,10,16
250,A Nice Weekend Stay,"As we could not book an accessible room on-line we had to make our booking by phone requesting a room with a walk-in shower. Unfortunately when we checked into our ""accessible"" room - it did not have a walk -in shower but a shower over a bath!!!! We went down to reception and told them of this they said that we were misunderstood at the time of booking and did we want to be moved to a room with a walk-in shower. We said no that we were happy enough with our room - 216 - as I could get into the bath with the help of the pull rails to have a shower. We informed reception that anyone with a severe disability or in a wheelchair would not be able to shower or bath. To ease our situation a little bit , they did not charge us  12 euros for the 2 days car parking...I personally think that car parking for disabled badge holders should be FREE!!! Apart from this, we had a lovely stay at this hotel...the room was very good and very clean...the breakfasts were very fulfilling and we had the bar food on our last night, and it was scrumptous. We would stay at this hotel on future trips to Dublin.",5,2017,10,16
250,"Ugly decor, great housekeeping, friendly staff ","The decor of the hotel is psychedelic and garish - it’s not an oasis of muted calm colours - the grey and pink corridors are ugly and the patterned carpets a throwback to another time

Bedroom was perfectly clean and comfy and had great lighting for reading at the desk, chair and in bed.

Comfy king size bed - perilous unzipped twin beds with that notorious crevasse between row mattresses - arghhhhhhh
I
Staff uber friendly and nice and attentive 
Had dinner twice - mediocre food and little local produce visible.
Tremendously convenient for the airport but in a lovely parkland setting

Wear sunglasses, eat elsewhere and you’ll have a perfect stay ",3,2017,10,14
250,Unimpressive,"A room ar This hotel is perfectly adequate if you require lodging for a night near the airport. The rooms are decent size (although ours had a slight musty odor), the beds are comfortable, the shuttle seems to run all through the night. But we arrived late and hungry. The restsurant closed at 10:00. Room service supposedly offers dinner until 11:00, but they didn't pick up the phone at a few minutes to 11:00 - and 5 minutes after they did pick it up but only to tell me they are closed. The remainiing 24 hour service menue was 3 somewhat unusual dishes probably put in a microwave frozen by the front desk - no thanks. So we went down to the bar at 11:00 where a nice young lady did find a bag of potatoe chips - and promptly took last drink orders. Is a club sandwhich at the bar too much to expect at 11:00 or even midnight at a good size sirport hotel?? The decor of the hotel is ... well... different - what to call it - art deco maybe?? In any case in our room it is showing some signs of wear. We probably won't be back here soon...",3,2017,10,12
250,Good hotel and food,"Stayed for one night for a conference. Room was very good and large with a nice bathroom. I ordered room service and the food was good.

The hotel is right next to the airport and a park which was great for having a run around.

Ate in the bar in the evening and do a good burger. 

Also a good site for conference and meetings with large rooms in a quiet corner of the hotel.",5,2017,10,11
250,Excellent Airport Hotel,"The whole experience was great. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, the restaurant options were good, and the airport shuttle was very convenient. The room was quite good. The beds were comfortable; the bathroom was clean and the water temperature and pressure were good; there were plenty of outlets and the different outlet options were quite welcome; and the Wifi was quite fast and reliable.",5,2017,10,08
250,Wonderful. Relaxing,Room was very comfortable and perfectly quiet. We had 2 terrific breakfasts! At dinner we were thoroughly cared for by restaurant staff Lionel and Justin who remembered our likings on the second night.  Service was perfect-warm and friendly and helped us wind down after busy days. The seating provided a sense of privacy. The food was wonderful and interesting and the wine list included some excellent offerings by the glass or bottle. ,5,2017,10,08
250,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed in the Crown Plaza for 1 night and from start to finish it was excellent. Lovely large room and bed. Great bathroom with lovely toiletries. We had requested a quiet room and it sure was. We had a very good sleep. Nice touches in the room, bottled water and nice biscuits along with the tea and coffee and chocs beside the bed. Have stayed in more expensive hotels in Dublin and they  were no where as good as the Crown Plaza. Also lovely breakfast. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,10,07
250,Excellent Receptionists in Anthony  & Monica and a great hotel,"We arrived late after a weary travel. Anthony and Monica at the reception were so warm, welcoming  and made us feel so comfortable that we forgot how tired we were.  Anthony and Monica provided great service in helping us with our stay at the Crown Plaza and our visit to Dublin. A lovely modern hotel and great staff. Highly recommend.",5,2017,10,06
250,Such an awesome hotel,"Very clean and beautiful room, large breakfast buffet, good bus connections to the town and friendly stuff. The hotel gym was fresh as well and the food in the restaurant was good. Such a great hotel for weekend trip, me and by boyfriend really enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,10,05
250,Excellent hotel,"Refurbished rooms, friendly staff, lively bar, plenty of options in the restaurant, and a great breakfast. Good parking too.

The fitness centre opens early but is very limited, focussed on cardio machines.",5,2017,10,04
250,Chose Another Location,"We were in a hurry to leave and the breakfast was late in opening.  The shower in our bathroom was stopped up and would not drain.  There was no A/C and the room was hot and stuffy.  We ordered room service and wine was not brought.  Then after we called they brought a whole bottle, saying we ordered one, while we only ordered a glass.  They over charged me when checking out.  I was in a hurry, the shuttle was waiting.  It was straightened out with the help of American Express.  I would not stay here again.  The only thing this hotel has going for it is their location to the airport.",2,2017,10,03
250,Warm Hospitality,"Having a home away from home feeling. From the warm welcome of front desk staff, carefully thought of room design (accessibility of all power points), hospitality of food and beverage staff (Zharmaine and Deborah); creates the perfect atmosphere for an enjoyable stay.",5,2017,10,03
250,The members lounge,Edit has been my server this evening in the lounge. I had told her that I had some work to finish but would have a glass of wine once I finished. I closed my laptop to find my glass of wine waiting. Excellent service. Thanks Edit. Possibly a coffee next.,5,2017,10,02
250,Crown Plaza is the best ,"We needed a one night before flying to London. They up graded us and we had a great room, very quiet, with air conditioning, and the best shower we had for our trip. Breakfast was ok and catching the shuttle was easy. Staff was courteous and professional.
Ed",5,2017,10,02
250,"A top hotel, in an ideal location with all the facilities and service you’d need","This hotel lives up to the Crowne Plaza brand... and some.  From the moment you walk into the entrance lobby, you know you have arrived.  Your expectations may be that the staff will run around after you, or you may just want to get quietly on with it.  Some how the team at ‘CP Dublin airport’ get that and are able to treat you just as you wanted... uncanny that.  

Because of our plans we didn’t make use of most of the facilities on offer but no doubt they were all fist rate like everything else we saw.  After checking in we were invited to go to the bar for welcome drinks, a nice touch and one we were going to accept.  But (and they probably realise this when they made the offer) once we had just sat/laid on the bed while getting changedthere was no moving us until we had to rush out to dinner meeting.  The room was more than large enough; with its big king size bed, sitting area, work station (desk - if you reared have to, or dressing table if you don’t), large wardrobe and chest of draws.  The ensuite was very nice, not the usual cupboard with a shower shoehorned in around a toilet and wash hand basin.  This was a proper bathroom.  A full size bath, double shower, washing basin,  toilet and unusually somewhere to swing a couple of cats.

After a good nights sleep and a lazy get up we reluctantly had to depart.  At the end of our short stay I can whole heartedly say that this hotel will be our first choice when returning to Dublin on business (maybe next time we can make more use of the facilities on offer!).",5,2017,10,01
250,FRIENDLY WEEK END,"I have just returned from a long week end stay in what must be the friendliest city in Europe.My wife and i stayed in thse Crowne Plaza hotel near Dublin airport wgere we were treated so well by caring and friendly stadff who would do anything to make your stay as plesent as possible.They catered for my wife`s specia; diet so well , the room was super and the breakfast to die for.Will definately be back.Wonderful week end.",5,2017,10,01
250,Overnight stay near Dublin airport was excellent.,"We flew into Dublin in the afternoon prior to an early morning departure to the States. The shuttle was on time both ways (takes about 10 minutes) and the room was excellent. Double king, tub AND shower, roomy well-lit bathroom, comfy bed and the HVAC worked well. Very clean also. Staff at check-in and during the stay were well-informed and friendly.",5,2017,10,01
250,Fabulous Stay!!!,This was our 4th stay at the Crowne Plaza Northwood and we absolutely loved it! Hotel is very modern and clean. The staff was so welcoming - specially Olga & Krystian at front desk! Fabulous food - both bar food and breakfast. We'll definitely come back! ,5,2017,10,01
250,Great Dining Experience & Staff,"We stayed next door at the Holiday Inn Express (great economy option, by the way!) and came here for dinner and drinks. The food was delicious and the service was a delight. Tommy waited on us and we had a great time with him - he made the whole evening fun and entertaining - he even serenaded us at one point as a joke and we died laughing. I wouldn't hesitate to come back for a meal or a stay!",5,2017,09,30
250,Wonderful Stay,"We are a group of 10.  The bus from the hotel to the city center is very easy and quite frequent.  I thought being out side the city center  would be  difficult but my group enjoyed staying here and would not have chosen another hotel.  If returning to Dublin again, we would definitely stay here.   The customer service and the staff at this hotel is wonderful.  Anthony, Michelle, Elizabeth, Sylvia and Shaji made our stay memorable.  I especially appreciate Mr. Oliver Barwell for his professionalism and how he went out of his way to locate an item for us.",5,2017,09,30
250,Good choice near the airport,"This hotel is well located near the airport. It has good restaurants in the hotel and nearby, reasonable rates, a parking garage, and comfortable, well appointed rooms. The staff is also quite accommodating.",4,2017,09,27

 ",5,2017,09,27
250,"Very nice, great staff",The hotel staff are very friendly and the facility is really nice in my opinion. The Fourth floor lounge was especially accommodating. Two staff that made me feel at home were Edit and Zi who exemplified hospitality with their service.,5,2017,09,27
250,Very nice personell,"The stay was very nice, the facilities big. I enjoyed a lot the park which is located very close to the hotel. The connection to the airport and city is good as well. I appreciate to meet Slovak colleagues in the staff - thank you very much for your attention to detail!",5,2017,09,27
250,Lovely service,"It was a pleasant surprise to be served by a very pleasant lady named Edit. I have been to many hotels but she definitely stands out in hospitality, hard work and comfort she tries to provide to the guests. Employees like her are definitely an asset to any organization. Thanks for making the evening great.",4,2017,09,27
250,One of the best experiences in a hotel I ever had,"The staff is lovely. A special ""thank you"" to Edit and Justine, who made my staying even better, but the whole staff is super. The hotel is quiet, good equipped, cozy and clean. For a small fee a day you get an excellent breakfast and, brace yourselves, FREE BEER, wine, soft drinks and snacks from 5:30PM to 7:30PM. I said FREE BEER. Actually, for this small fee you get access to this place in the 4th floor called ""Club Lounge"" I think, and you have free coffee, soft drinks, fruits and other stuff up to 11:00PM. I totally recommend and I will return.",5,2017,09,25
250,ANTHONY at the Reception Desk,"During a three-week trip to Ireland we went to this Crown Plaza to spend one night before we were going to London for three nights and then coming back here for one last night before our trip back home to the states. ANTHONY greeted us with such genuine kindness, and he could not have been more helpful. He arranged for us to store our extra luggage so that we could just take small carry on suitcases to London. Upon our return, he recognized us and greeted us with the same enthusiasm as he had on our first visit. The restaurants were fine, the room and bed were comfortable and clean, and the service was excellent. We would definitely stay here again because of all that, but it is ANTHONY that made our visits extra special. ",5,2017,09,24
250,Very nice hotel near airport in quiet but convenient area,"We stayed here before we began touring Ireland with a small group.  We asked for early check in and we were able to check in after arriving from Dublin airport about 11 am.
The room was nice with a king size bed and nice bathroom and shower. 
Some hotel now have a USA outlet, but they did not, however, the outlets they did have were conveniently located so that we could use our adapter.
We choose to have our meal off site for dinner, but returned to the bar to socialize with fellow travelers.  It was packed with people being Friday evening, but we did manage to secure a booth and had good service from the waiter.
Our one complaint would be the breakfast service.  They have two choices, one is a continental breakfast, and one is a hot breakfast.  Both options are expensive since we only wanted coffee and yogurt.  We asked the staff if they could accommodate this, and they seemed unable to figure out how to do this.  They told us they would figure it out.  We were never given a bill for this.  I asked at check out and they just said there was no charge.  It would seem reasonable to be able to order just coffee or a roll and coffee as is available at most hotel associated with this chain in the US.  
We would stay here again if we were to travel to Dublin again.",4,2017,09,23
250,From a Frequent Guest,"I stay at the Crowne Plaza Northwoods, Dublin Airport, approx every other month for a week at a time. A recent experience compelled me to write this review...

This hotel is consistently clean comfortable, convenient, and meets all of my business travel needs. The staff are professional and courteous, always warm and inviting. They are committed to delivering a home-away-from-home experience. 

Christian and Olga at the front desk are great. They welcome me when I arrive and greet me by name each evening when I return from the office.

The host in the restaurant is very sharp, knowledgeable, and friendly. The waiter's reco for dinner was spot on last week: wok-fried beef skewers. Lovely.

The bar/restaurant (Cinnibar) is also quite good. 

A slight annoyance: the hvac unit seems to be sensitive: cold or hot. but, bedding is delightful. I sleep well here.

In closing... I'll offer this... I wouldn't stay anywhere else at this point. I look forward to my return next month.",5,2017,09,23
250,One night before flight ,"Used Park and stay facility for night and 6 days parking. Hotel room was very clean..a bit small for a family of 4. Bathroom facilities were good. Ate in the bar which was very nice. Bar was really busy with only 2 waiters so we had a bit of a wait for drinks and ordering..food was really nice and breakfast the next day was good also with plenty of choice. Parked car for 6 days and came back from airport using the shuttle bus from bay 16 at airport, validated ticket at reception and headed home. Good location would come back again for airport use and parking.",4,2017,09,23
250,Super convenient and responsive management,"Very glad we chose this hotel for the night before our flight back to the US. Since customs and immigration are done on the Ireland side, it takes extra time so being near the airport is very convenient.    The shuttle was free and convenient, so it made our last day in Ireland go smoothly.  I had to delay the date of our trip from July to August, and there had been a problem initially in that we were charged for a ""no show"" even though we had cancelled and rebooked.  Upon bringing this to management's attention, they very promptly corrected the change and upgraded our room for the new date. Hence I was impressed by their responsiveness before we even set food in Ireland. 

The hotel is updated and comfortable and the staff are efficient. The bathroom in particular was done in a modern style (like river pebbles).  There was a strange noise coming from somewhere in the vicinity of the wardrobe at night but it did not disturb our sleep.   We weren't fans of the in house restaurant's Asian fusion cuisine; but the ""Gourmet Food Pantry"" is a 5-minute walk down the sidewalk. 

Excellent choice near the airport for location, room, and amenities.",5,2017,09,22
250,Wonderful hotel at an airport,"We had a wonderful one night stay.  Check-in was very efficient.  The room was large, clean with great beds.  The bathroom was large with both a walkin shower and a tub to soak!

The bar was packed due to the All Ireland Football game so service was not the greatest but they tried.

The morning shuttle was on time for a prompt and timely delivery to the airport.",5,2017,09,21
250,Great staff,"Have been staying here a few nights a week for the last few months, staff are very helpful and location is great for the airport but without the noise of the aircraft.  Good amount of undercover parking.  Olga on reception is always there to help and nothing is too much trouble, Edit who looks after the guests in the lounge on the 4th floor always greets us with a smile and asks after any of the team who are missing that week. As said all staff are very good not a bad episode in several weeks of staying.  ",5,2017,09,19
250,brilliant beth,"We had a very early flight back to the uk on Saturday morning, so thought it was a good idea to stay somewhere close to the airport. We have stayed here a few years ago so was happy to go back to what we knew. Checking was so easy, our room was prepaid and they had all the information on hand. Thelady on reception that checked us in was in good spirits and was a pleasure, Thank you for your hospitaliity Beth.  Had a meal in the bar which was perfect then a good night sleep in the big bedroom with tea and coffee and biscuits. had a very enjoyable stay",5,2017,09,17
250,Top class value,"My wife and stayed for one night on the way to the US and we stayed in a club room

We will be back!!

250,Great airport hotel,"We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, appointments and value of this hotel.. 
The soundproofing was amazing, we slept like babies. Beds veery comfortable.
When needing an airport hotel in Dublin in the future, it will be the Crowne Plaza.",5,2017,09,16
250,Excellent service ,"Thank you to our waitress Edit for such wonderful service... she was very friendly warm and approachable.. 
she took the time to explain items off the menu and make recommendations. 
She also informed me about the lounge on the 4th floor.. my stay was very pleasant.. Crown Plaza is lucky to have you. ",5,2017,09,16
250,Almost perfect,"Everything about this stay (only one night, sadly) was great except for one thing - the shower wouldn't drain. And yes, that is the only negative I can think of. From check-in (we were able to check in early!) to check-out, we loved everything. If they can get their shower drains cleared, there would have been no complaints at all. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was EXCELLENT!  It was quite possibly the best meal we had during our entire 11-day trip. It was so unexpected. The service was a tiny bit slow, but the food was so good that we didn't worry about it too much. 

The room was comfortable, the free airport shuttle was great, the breakfast was perfect - I wouldn't hesitate to stay here. It was also reasonably priced.",5,2017,09,16
250,Beautiful and large room,"I did check in with Monika which was very polite and interested in my stay. Nice friendly welcome, no complain! Room was lovely and very big, most of all bed is comfortable and I had good quiet night sleep. The only complain I would have is gym: I use it to do my cardio and around 4pm your security come over to ask me to be more quiet when I am putting down my weights. In one way I appreciate that you concern about the other guests which complain about the noise but on the other hand should the gym be placed downstairs so there is no people underneath or perhaps make it soundproof?? It make me a bit paranoid and I definitely didn't enjoy rest of my training . Breakfast again was amazing, lovely I think Filipino girl served my breakfast and offer lovely chat, I got eggs cooked to order which I really enjoy. Coffee could be better quality but for airport hotel I guess ok. Generally alright hotel and I will probably back again just hope you sort out gym issue!",4,2017,09,16
250,Almost perfect,I thought the room was great.  I stayed in a king room.  It was very spacious and modern with wonderful amenities.  I particularly liked the essential oil and pillow spray.  The robe was a nice touch and bed very comfy.  The room faced the back and was very quiet.  It was close to perfect.  The only issue was the A/C did not work.  Unfortunately I did not realize this until after I had showered and changed into my PJ's for the night.  I noticed it was a bit warm and was unable to get the air to cool.  A call down to reception and a few minutes later a porter came up and confirmed it was broken.  They offered to change my room but it was already late and I didn't want to bother given the fact I had a 4:30 am wakeup for the airport.  He quickly brought me a fan and that was quite sufficient.  I did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I cannot comment.  The airport shuttle in the morning was great.  It was on time and got me where I needed to be.  Would stay here again!,4,2017,09,16
250,Airport Hotel Bliss,"If your flyin in or out of Dublin Airport then be sure to book your stay at the Crowne Plaza.
They have excellent shuttle bus service close to terminal 1.
Rooms are excellent.
Best of all is the breakfast experience, wounderful selection on offer plus the professionial service from the manager James, Maria, Michelle & Zharma.
I observed Maria dealing with a very rude and difficult lady, she handled it with charm and a smile, in my opinion happy staff are the result of good mamgement well done James.",5,2017,09,16
250,Great place to stay,Convienent to airport with free shuttle.  Easy access to Dublin with airport express bus and pass to get around. Super friendly staff.  Tommy in bar most pleasant and helpful.  Awesome sea food chowder.  Great rooms.,5,2017,09,15
250,Cinnibar,"After terrible flt. (rolling delays Ryan air) checked in at Holiday Inn, walked next door Crowne Plaza/Cinnibar food was excellent and service was outstanding from our server Tommy, this experience melted away the frustrations earlier in the day end our day positive and enjoyable!",5,2017,09,14
250,Dinner,"The evening meal was excellent especially  the attentive and friendly service from our waitress Iwona. 
We had onion rings for starters then both had pork ribs which were very tender with a tasty  sauce and to finish we enjoyed cheesecake and Bailey's Irish creme torte, delicious.",5,2017,09,14
250,Lovely place! ,"We arrived back in Dublin today and were happy to find a lovely property, a welcoming staff, and a charming and relaxing dining experience. The food was wonderful. And it was our good fortune to have a waiter who was friendly, helpful, and bright! Thank you, Tommy, for making our experience even better. ",5,2017,09,14
250,The restaurant was wonderful!!,"The restaurant in the Crowne Plaza. Amazing job, Tommy you made our first meal in Dublin so enjoyable we came back the next day. So thank you and Oliver for the wonderful service ,we appreciate u two. ",5,2017,09,13
250,Great hotel,Great hotel  rooms lovely and comfortable  spend a week for work  nice restaurant and great bar food was served by Anna who was friendly and helpful  and close to airport with an airport bus used as a shuttle,4,2017,09,13
250,Relax after an onerous flight,You are through customs and long for a  beer and a shower.  The Crowne Plaza is just a free shuttle away (bay 16) - leaves every 30 minutes.  Nice hotel with very good beds - and a friendly bar that also serves light meals. Nice resturant serving dinner from 5:30 PM.  Menu a bit cross-over with emphasis on Sechuan kitchen.,4,2017,09,13
250,Very friendly hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights last weekend and I can say without a doubt in the world that it has been the friendliest hotel I have stayed in. From check in to check out everybody that I came in contact with had a smile on their face and was so pleasant to deal with. Other hotels could learn some lessons from The Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport.The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment and this will really add to the quality of the hotel. There was a great choice for breakfast with a very friendly chef cooking omelettes as we looked on.  We ate in the restaurant on Sat night and the food was delicious and good value. Will be changing from usual hotel that I stay in and looking forward to staying here again in the near future.",5,2017,09,13
250,Great overnight airport hotel.,"Never stayed here before, but stopped overnight on our way out to Canada.
 
We stay at many airport hotels, and most are just average in service, rooms and staff, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the hotel and its staff, who were friendly, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, whilst the hotel was spotless, and very tastefully decorated, with the room fixtures an fittings of a very good standard.

We had a queen twin, lovely sized room, quiet and with very comfortable beds, absolutely nothing to fault.

The restaurant was good, again a decent amount of choice on the menu, staff again friendly and efficient, food very good for a airport hotel.

The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, every 30 minutes, you collect it from zone 16 when you arrive, just follow the signs from arrivals, a taxi costs €12-15, so worth using.

All in all good airport hotel, and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,09,12
250,Great Place,Great hotel about 5-10 minutes from the Dublin Airport with an airport bus used as a hotel shuttle.  Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were very clean and quiet.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,09,11
250,Good location and rooms ,"Good location, rooms were comfy. Gym is a bit dated and small which is a shame as a keen hotel gym goer when travelling on business. 

Tommy at the Bar deserves a shout out...couldnt fault him. Give that man a pay rise!",5,2017,09,11
250,Perfect Hotel!,"Very welcoming, very helpful and in a perfect location to access Dublin centre by bus. Great shuttle bus service from/to airport. I travelled with a guide dog and having the park opposite was ideal to run and toilet her. All staff were very accommodating, polite and helpful during our stay. James Noonan was very pleasant and helpful! Food and drink was high standard throughout. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definitely be returning soon.",5,2017,09,11
250,Weekend Stay,"We stayed here for a weekend.  Went to the Bar for something to eat. Good menu.  We were served by a lovely guy ""Tommy"". Very friendly, pleasent and attentive.  We would highly recommend the food and service.  ",5,2017,09,09
250,"Close to the airport, but very quiet.",Hotel was quiet with helpful staff.  Club room came with continental breakfast and evening starters.  Nice selections.  Restaurant had interesting menu.  Great park across the street has a grand walkway when it is not raining.,5,2017,09,07
250,Bar for a few drinks and bite to eat,Great service quick and friendly staff great young lad Tommy who served us with a great attitude and smile. Food was great washed down with a fine drop or two of merlot will definitely be returning. :),5,2017,09,06
250,Would stay again,"My last night in Dublin I stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport. Arrived from galway via Huesten  station and got a cab to the crowne plaza. Was approximately 18 euros. Ordered room service for service. As in most Irish hotels room service was 5 euros on top of the food charge. That doesn't include tip. Check in was easy and staff were friendly. Beds are very comfortable. The room was clean and had modern amenities.   Wake up call was provided. Free shuttle for the airport leaves every half hour and was on time. Check out was a breeze and free coffee and tea and fruit was near reception on way to shuttle. 

I would definitely stay again. 
",4,2017,09,05
250,Great hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised on arrival at this hotel, it has recently been refurbished and it is extremely clean. The decor is modern and rooms are of a high standard. Bathroom spacious and great shower. Had a meal in the bar which was delicious and service excellent. Parking €6 overnight. Would recommend this hotel and will return. Great location close to airport or for business use. ",5,2017,09,05
250,Not Crowne Plaza Standard ,"My husband and I stayed for one night because of its proximity to the airport.  Upon arrival to our room we quickly realized that our neighbors were of the rowdy sort and I requested a room change as we had an early morning flight.  We were promptly moved and I appreciated the front desk clerks assistance very much.  Overall the hotel was very tired which I am positive has to do with the focus on conference groups.  There were in fact two conferences being held during our stay. Besides the noise and overcrowding in the bar, there was the ""plume"" of smoke I had to endure from the time I hit the lobby until I made it over to the car park.  Permitting conference goers/guests to smoke immediately just past the door forced me to walk through it numerous times with guests literally blowing smoke in my face.  This coupled with the worn down furnishings, sink with chipped porcelain throughout and a duvet that was literally too small for the bed has reminded me why I left the IHG hotels for Marriott a couple years back.  The only thing that saved this review from being a 1 was the professional desk clerk who helped me get a decent nights rest by changing my room. ",2,2017,09,04
250,Friendly staff,"We decided to spend our last night at the airport since we had an early flight the next day. When we arrived at the hotel  there was two ladies at the Front Desk one was Olga but can't remember the other one. We arrived at 11pm and both of them were so friendly and happy. I was very impressed with the service they offered me and my wife. 

The hotel lobby and bar was very nice and clean. I was in  room 416 it was large, clean and loved the decor. My only critic would be the bathroom could be little cleaner.

Received my wake up call the next just like I asked. Went for breakfast and the buffet was great with lots of option. Again the service was great.

Took the shuttle to the airport and 10 minutes later we were at the airport

If you need to spend one night before catching a flight, the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport is a great option ",5,2017,09,03
250,Recognition,"To whom it may concern,

I would like to recognized or nominate the excellent work of Zharmaine and Justine from Tusai outlet.
the two ladies were exceptional and possessed a warm hospitality skills.
Zharmaine welcome me by the entrance as I arrived and she greeted me with a big smile and showed me the way.
She is very attentive and she has attention to details, when I told her that I cannot have fatty food she immediately recommended me to have a grapefruit juice to start with my day. While having my food she was constantly checking back on me and attended all my needs even if they were busy. Justine is genuinely a sweet girl she offered me her help as well when I was looking for my friend. Both ladies shows that they love what they do and they are a people person.
I hope they will be recognized with their excellent job and continue to be an inspiration to other staff.
Job well done!

250,Great place to stay and eat before taking the trip back home.,Stayed at the hotel (very clean and comfortable) and the receptionist was excellent and patient.  Had 7 in our party and went to the hotel bar/lounge to eat and it was excellent!!  Anna waited on us and was patient with all of us and the food orders were spot on.  She was fantastic for a group of weary hungry travelers.  All in all a great experience at the hotel and with the food!  Highly recommend it!!!.,5,2017,09,02
250,Pleasant stay,Rooms were clean and comfortable. We had dinner in the bar during our stay. Service was friendly and the food was delicious at a reasonable price. Tommy served us quickly and made sure we were OK for drinks. Would recommend for anyone wanting to grab a fast bite in a pleasant atmosphere.,4,2017,09,02
250,Overnight Stop,"Stayed here for a night prior to returning to the UK
As it's a Crowne Plaza you expect certain standards particularly when the room cost is over €200 per night
Room was great, no issues, but the service in the bar was unacceptable
Me and my colleague ate, and although it was busy the service was desperately poor
Yes we complained and we were compensated however the damage was done. All we wanted after a stressful day was a good Neal and a few drinks to relax !!!
Crowne Plaza, I hope you're reading this and sort it out, I normally leave good reviews !",3,2017,08,31
250,Great Hotel,"This hotel is outstanding.   The staff is the best.  From check in to check out they made this visit one of my best visits to Dublin.  

Great lounge.  Food and drinks were very good.  Edit and Martina made the lounge visit very enjoyable.  Hope management will let them know what a great asset they are.  (Give them a raise😎)

Would definitely stay here again when in Dublin

Appreciate y'all 

W🇨🇱",5,2017,08,30
250,Great restaurant and service ,"Went for a meal during my stay here and was lovey. Food & atmosphere was great. Our server, Tommy, was very efficient and friendly. Cocktails were also very nice! Would recommend the burger and sweet potato fries!! 😊😊",5,2017,08,29
250,Great staff are this hotels best asset,"I'm a regular guest at this hotel and the reason is mostly their staff. They are all professional and courteous and can't do enough for the guests. In particular Edit in the club lounge and Peter in the bar could not be more accommodating. On the front desk Olga, Beth and Kristian also stand out for their warm greetings and professionalism.
As a frequent business traveller, I have yet to find a hotel that offers all that the crowne plaza Dublin Airport offers in terms of everything that the business traveller needs, including one of the fastest wifi systems I have experienced. Keep it up guys and I'll keep coming back!",5,2017,08,29
250,Best staff,"Not only the comfy bed, but great room service!!!

Staff are very friendly when I placed the room service order. The food came before I expected. Staff name Zharmaine ❤️was delivering best service with smile and warm hospitality. I greatly appreciate your service. ",5,2017,08,28
250,Amazing stay,"Absolutely stunning hotel, friendly staff and even better food. 
Stayed here using points, a bit disappointed with the room we received. Nothing to complain about the room itself however we were next to the room at the very end of the corridor on the first floor which was very loud at night which was a huge disappointment as I have stayed many many times over the years. 
However other than this issue I am never let down by the amazing staff who are very friendly, especially the girl who was serving us just outside the bar who was seriously busy but helped us in every way! 
Would 100% recommend as such a short distance from the airport and lovely walks around. ",5,2017,08,28
250,Service & Hospitality,"I stay at the Crowne Plaza, Dublin 9 on a weekly basis for work. It is most definitely the best hotel to stay in, whilst in Dublin. Friendly, helpful staff like Edit in club lounge who has a knack for remembering your orders. Reception staff are so helpful and understanding (esp when you lock yourself out your room lol). Great place, the  staff make it the nicest place to stay👌👍",5,2017,08,28
250,Excellent Service and Friendly Atmosphere,"Always a pleasure to be served by Edit, she was happy and welcoming in a genuine way. 
Great service and clean surroundings. 
Would recommend for anyone on a business trip especially as it's very comfortable and conveniently near to airport via shuttle bus ",5,2017,08,28
250,Excellent Rooms and amenities ,"This is great hotel.  Very conveniently located near airport (Not in airport).  Also, there is a bus (from near hotel) that takes to City center in about 20-25 minutes.

Very clean and great for families.  Staff was very courteous and helpful.

It is, also, served by shuttle to and from airport terminals.  There is paid parking conveniently located next to hotel.",5,2017,08,28
250,Great service. ,Tommy was our server at the lobby restaurant and was very accommodating given we had a hungry toddler.  He understood the menu really well and had excellent recommendations.  The rooms were very quiet and comfortable.  Excellent wifi.  ,5,2017,08,26
250,Great Overnight Stay at the Dublin Airport,"Stayed overnight to catch an early plane to London. Hotels were full in Dublin due to concerts and the summer crush of tourists. Service was excellent, room was comfortable, quiet and clean. Everything worked. Dinner (Hamburger and fries) in lobby/bar was average to so so--Service Excellent (Edit). Beer was good. Convenient and timely shuttle service to the airport. Hotel location somewhat isolated, so unless you have a car, meals in the hotel the only convenient option. No perks from being an IHG member except a welcome from the front desk.",4,2017,08,26
250,Shati deserves a raise!!,"Fourth time this year i have stayed here and the service was impeccable. Shati the night porter in particular was diligent, pleasant and dedicated. 
Food was of an excellent standard and all though the courses could have come faster all in all it was almost perfect. 
Thanks all, keep up the good work.",5,2017,08,25
250,Lovely staff going above and beyond,"I had come slightly late to the hotel and breakfast was over however, both Martina and Maria were very accommodating. they managed to get me exactly what I wanted which has set me up for the day. whilst accommodating me as I was set up in the lobby for a business meeting. Two very welcoming people. Staff everywhere should be like these two lovely people.",5,2017,08,24
250,Quite OK,"What's perfect is that this hotel offers an EU, UK and US socket in the room. It also has a lovely park across the street for walking, running and outdoor fitness/gym and a small map is available to select your route. This helps as the indoor gym is quite small and the eclipse is noisy and probably needs some attendance. What's annoying though is that you cannot just watch CNN news or something in the room (and at the gym) it's all packages you have to select and the news package only offers documentaries. And when you order both tea and glutenfree bread in the morning, you get GF bread, but you have to chase your tea. Not once, but this has happened 3 times with different staff. Breakfast itself is great and the provided coffee options (dedicated machine) are very good. ",3,2017,08,23
250,"Nicely decorated, read negatives:","Room was clean, shower awful - like a dribble. TV was a nightmare- you have to go through 6 instructions every time you want to switch on and changing channels takes ages. Not good if you are a tv channel hopper ! It spoilt my stay ! Take your own hairdryer - it's diabolical ! Breakfast was average- you sit in VERY close proximity with other people to eat it . I felt uncomfortable. Staff pleasant, check in took ages though as only 1 person on the desk and 4 people wanting to check in. Dinner in the reception area on sofas was a nice atmosphere- food came quickly, average and very expensive. Filthy carpets in this area though . Car park costs €6 Euros a day- shame it's not free. Close to the airport and Dublin City University. Hopefully this is helpful- best food is in the Autobahn nearby.",3,2017,08,21
250,The worst place I stayed in Ireland,"Extremely overpriced for what you get. Staff couldn't give a toss about the guests. For example, I called reception to ask about the airport shuttle. Me: ""What is the schedule for the shuttle to the airport?"" Reception: ""It starts at 4 am ...................."" Me: ""So does the shuttle come often?"" Reception: ""Every 30 minutes."" Me: ""Okay, that's not very often."" Reception: ""It comes every 20 minutes after that."" Me: ""After what?"" Reception: ""After 5 am. Look, the schedule's posted next to the reception desk. Come take a picture with your phone if that'll help you."" Staff lost the type of room we reserved (two twin beds), and although we showed them a copy of the original reservation with the room we wanted, they told us, ""You can have a twin room, but we'll have to steal the room from another customer."" How is it stealing to give me what I reserved? On top of that, a loud scraping/rattling sound periodically came out of the AC grate above the front door (not the vent in the room) all night long. Decor is really tacky. The only positive is the really nice park across the street.",2,2017,08,21
250,Great lication,"Stayed here before flying back to Canada, location is great! Reception was quick and smooth, only criticism is parking is a bit of a maze since it's attached to hotel next door.  Free shuttle to hotel. Didn't try restaurant",4,2017,08,17
250,Transit ,The hotel is located at a short distance from the Dublin airport. It's very convenient for transit travellers as the city is very far from the airport. The hotel provides good services and has plenty of car parking facility. ,4,2017,08,16
250,Great time ,"I had a lovely time in your hotel with my friends. Great night in the lounge,  very comfortable, with a nice atmosphere.Food   was good and excellent service from Anna.
So handy for parking - great location.",5,2017,08,16
250,Lunch,"I had lunch in the Cinnabar Red Bar.   The waitress, Anna, was great, so friendly and helpful.   The menu is very varied and I asked Anna for suggestions.  She recommended the Caeser salad which turned out to be a great choice as it was delicious!  I don't usually eat in restaurants alone but Anna and all the staff are lovely so I felt very comfortable. The hotel is in lovely surroundings and is very convenient to the airport and city centre.  I would definitely recommend. ",5,2017,08,16
250,"Great spot, would recommend to a friend.","I stayed in the Crowne Plaza for one night with a friend before heading to the Airport for a trip. The rooms were bright and clean, and the bar had a lovely atmosphere. I found the staff to be very friendly  - the barmaid anna was very helpful in looking after us and giving us directions for the following morning. We's booked last minute but the price was still very reasonable; I'd be happy to stay again.",5,2017,08,16
250,Great Hotel,Great Hotel with super friendly staff. Convenient for short business trips and have great restaurants in it. Heard there is a small shopping centre across the hotel so will try to go there for groceries. ,5,2017,08,15
250,Great as a base when arriving by plane or ferry to Dublin.,This is a modern hotel that has a great bar atmosphere.  The rooms are big and well-equipped.  A good nights sleep is assured.  Large car park next door is very handy.  It was ideal for us just passing through.  This has remained an ideal base for visiting Dublin and its surrounds.,5,2017,08,15
250,Loyalty to return customers - every stay out does the previous,We were married in this amazing hotel in 2012 and every year we return on our anniversary to stay swell as a few times during the year. This anniversary was our 5th and as a surprise Daniel one Of The managers upgraded us to one Of The royal suites similar to the one we had for our wedding what an amazing stay it made our evening even more special. We had an amazing dinner followed by a few drinks. The atmosphere was so tranquil.. Can't wait to return in a few weeks...,5,2017,08,14
250,Fantastic hotel at Dublin Ireland Airport,"The Crowne Plaza at Dublin Airport is a top spot to stay. Every 20 minutes a shuttle leaves the hotel for the 10 minute trip to the airport. Rooms have recently been refurbished and are spacious and well appointed, with two stuffed chairs and very comfortable beds. The bath amenities were great, large soaps and towels, very nice shower and bathtub. Abundant tea bags and instant coffee with great cookies. Free water, as well. Th staff is professional and professional extremely helpful. Great business center with computers and a fast printer. There are two restaurants. One features Indonesian food, delicious. Our server was Milisav, gracious friendly, and very hospitable. The other is a bar with simpler menu including great fish and chips. Here is also a coffee shop which has wonderful  scones. It closes at 3PM. Absolutely a first choice for us when departing Dublin!",5,2017,08,13
250,Great staff so pleasant ,I stayed for one night I went to the club lounge were I felt so welcome the girl Anna couldn't be more helpful an so nice with my child an my self she is such an assett to the hotel lovely young girl be returning again ,5,2017,08,11
250,Excellent Airport Hotel Very Near Dublin Airport,"A modern, well appointed hotel with many amenities very near the Dublin Airport. Free Shuttle available and frequent. An excellent location to stage the final night before an overseas flight. Several restaurants and a bar. The best buffet style breakfast we experienced whilst in Ireland.

Hotel was reasonably quiet although I could hear a few voice (hallway or adjacent rooms??) in the wee hours. Bed/pillows delightfully comfortable and inviting. Room was large and clean. Frig/minibar is room. Check-in and out were without problem. Staff helpful and friendly.",4,2017,08,11
250,Great staff ,"Normally I talk about food, drink, experience , but rarely do I point out a specific person . In this case I will , Edit is a waitress in the very friendly hotel bar .
She greeted us with smile and just that little extra friendliness that is rare in a airport hotel setting.
Edit made excellent dinner choices to a pair of very tired and hungry guests .
From the bacon sandwich to the fish and chips.
Her choices fit our needs.
Her professionalism and care didn't go unnoticed by us .
",5,2017,08,10
250,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here for 1 night this week as we arrived late into Dublin airport & didn't fancy the late night drive to Cork after a long flight.
We had a magnificent room on the Executive floor (which has a fabulous lounge for executive guests - the upgrade is worth every cent)!
The bedroom was divine - really spacious, stunningly decorated & so comfortable!!! We ordered room service as we were too tired to go to the restaurant or bar and the food was delightful, delicious & fresh.
All staff members were incredibly lovely.
I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay - even for a leisure break as it's a super property.",5,2017,08,09
250,Very good for conferences ,Been at many conferences here and met up with family in this hotel. The food at the conferences was nice and I really enjoyed the restaurant. The staff were good and helpful and the art way very nice. Overall a good hotel.,4,2017,08,09
250,Close to Airport in a lovely park - 20 min by bus to City Centre,"A very comfortable and modern hotel. Has a lounge for Elite members of the IHG loyalty scheme, drinks/canapes only served between 17.30 and 19.30 in the lounge. Breakfast is an excellent selection and staff always helpful and friendly",4,2017,08,09
250,OK great staff,"We stayed for 6 days having a long legacy with IHG group who help with our special needs son; interconnecting carer room complimentary.Olga on the front desk deserves special mention for securing rooms on the 4th floor therefore quiet. we needed the minibars to be emptied to accommodate medication. They had both been switched off; a fact we didn't discover until the following day when the medication had denatured.The air con is great, the ice maker fab, coffee shop ok but their staff amazing.The Beds are Awful. I have never experienced such awful backspin even lying on duvets. The pillows, foam and feather similarly leathery and painful to use.The linen is excellent. The in room toiletries, Temple Spa lovely, water pressure great; shower over bath one room and separate bath and shower second room. However , the decor is really really tired.The once white bathroom suites cracked and chipped, shower curtains bad idea, sink surrounds really chipped, flaking and worn. Opening windows, lovely facility but the continuous hum of the airport shuttle bus loitering outside is accommodated only by the hard of hearing.Complimentary water a really lovely touch but better if replaced not requiring request for replacement by guest. Parking is in neighbouring Holiday Inn a 5 minute walk away and set down area outside hotel dominated by buses and taxis. Staff are so kind though, Nicole in reservations also a star.",3,2017,08,08
250,Such friendly happy staff,"Happy staff = happy customers. 

This was our third or forth stay at the Crown Plaza but my first time to review. 

What prompted me to review today was the comment from the gentleman at checkout. He asked me ""How was your stay,  otherwise, after I shared some feedback about a slow draining shower?""

I said, it was great and complimented him on the friendly staff throughout the hotel, from check in to bar to restaurant and special mention to the smiling staff at breakfast. 

He said that it comes from the top down. Their employers are good to their staff and this cascades from Management to Staff to Customers. 

Well, I tip my hat to the Management, congratulations on a job well done and I look forward to our next welcoming stay. 

Slow drainage can happen to the best of us  but happy staff and happy visitors must be,I'm sure, your steadfast ambition. 

",5,2017,08,07
250,Last stop in Ireland ,"I choose this hotel because it was close to the airport and for its airport shuttle service. We had two rooms on first floor. Rooms were small, tastefully decorated and had complimentary water. 
We arrived at the hotel before 5 so dined at the bar/ restaurant. Anna was our waitress and provided excellent customer service. 

Our flight was early, we needed to leave before breakfast was available so the front desk (didn't get the ladies' name) arranged for a breakfast on the go which had a banana, yogurt and muffin. 

We enjoyed our stay and if we're back in Ireland would visit again. ",4,2017,08,07
250,Great Restaurant Service ,"Anna greeted us when arrived at the restaurant and inquired about some Irish Stew. She mentioned that it was not on the menu but she would check with the chef. We were seated and welcomed with news that we could order what we wanted. We also ordered a Caesar Salad to share and it was the best we've had on the planet. Because of Anna's service and attention, we will come back to this hotel and restaurant on future trips to Ireland! Thanks Anna as you made our last night in Dublin special!",5,2017,08,07
250,Excellent ,"We stayed here after a long flight and a long day at the airport coming from Barcelona back to Dublin. It was so nice to come home to friendly welcoming staff and Irish beef (there's a lot to be said for Irish Beef as opposed to meat on the continent!) we ate in the Cinnabar, Anna was our waitress and she was fab! The bar has a lovely atmosphere & the service was so friendly. The manager (John I believe) was also so friendly and was really welcoming and polite to guests. I was so pleased to see a check back on our table (we didn't get this where we ate in Barcelona). The standard was so high, food was amazing and was just great all around. Will definitely be here again when flying out of Dublin! ",5,2017,08,07
250,Fab Food and Great service !,"Stayed here for one night after a holiday abroad, shuttle bus runs regularly from the airport to the hotel for free. Hotel is Lovely, it is so clean and comfortable. Ate in the bar and got the cinnabar burger and it was delicious and so filling! Our server was Anna and she was so friendly and helpful, another man (John I think) in the bar was also lovely, the staff just can't do enough for you here! The presentation of food and overall appearance of the hotel is fabulous! Would defo stay again and would recommend to a friend! ",5,2017,08,07
250,Great hotel ,"I stay at a lot of Holiday Inn variant hotels. This one does stand out, the executive floor is excellent and the staff great.
Not so sure the restaurant really pulls off the oriental cuisine but is pleasant enough.",5,2017,08,07
250,Busy Hotel across from a Nice Park,"This is a busy better quality tourist class hotel that can double as a business hotel.  Good on-site food options and good service.

Unfortunately light on public transport and walkability, cabs and UBER were easy to obtain.  However its 10 minutes from the airport, which is a plus.  Room met all needs. 

I would stay again if it met my need.",4,2017,08,07
250,Airport shuttle NOT after 11:00 pm,"Having stayed at this hotel many times, I knew where to get the shuttle.  I arrived with my family at 1:40 a.m. and waited for 40 minutes for the shuttle.  Had to walk back to the taxi area and take a cab.  When I arrived at the hotel I asked what happened to the shuttle service that is supposed to run every 20 minutes and was told there is no shuttle after 11:00 pm.  It would be a great idea to not advertise ""airport shuttle"" on your website if it is only certain hours.  The beds were extremely hard.  Not sure if I would go back to this ""airport hotel"" again.  I forgot to take a picture of the moldy ceiling in the bathroom.  ",2,2017,08,06
250,Pre/post holiday stay,"We stayed the night before our holiday and at very short notice on our return.
The staff at this hotel are its biggest assest they are brilliant (big thanks to olga) very warm and helpful. 
We were upgraded to the club floor which had greatly improved since our last stay.
Rooms are beautiful and really clean our sleep was great. The lounge has a good selection of drinks and hot and cold snacks each evening, continental breakfast in the morning and tea/coffee soft drinks all day.
Breakfast downstairs is soooo good something for everyone hot/cold meats breads waffles pancakes fruit porridge ....really it has everything!!
Bar is great food was tasty and service with a smile.
We normally use this hotel pre holiday, and after these stays we will forfeit being closer to the shopping and definitely book here for the staff the service and overall package....#wearefussyandwelovedit",5,2017,08,06
250,"Short stay, very good choice!","We reserved a room for two just about two days prior to arrival. The hotel was very easy to find. The shuttle service to and from the airport was very predictable and comfortable. We dined in the restaurant for dinner followed by breakfast the next day. Both meals were tasty and reasonably priced. Service was very, very, good throughout our stay. 

I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,08,06
250,Disappointment,"For the first time ever it's difficult for me to write the review of a hotel. 
When you arrive after a tiring journey it's nice with a warm welcome - and not an arrogant ""wait a minute"", because the phone starts to ring. 
Anyway, we got the keys to our room, and it was not like the ones we've stayed in at other Crowne Plaza hotels!
There was a noisy ventilator in the bathroom, which could not be stopped, the a/c didn't work, and the tv was placed, so we'd have to either stand up or sit on the floor to watch it.
After 2 complaints in the reception - the last one including a rather unpleasant argument - we were moved to a much better room, and the manager followed up and made sure that we were satisfied now.
The breakfast was excellent with a large variety of dishes, but the waitresses didn't remove our used plates from the very small tables, so we had to place the plates on various tables every time we went for a new dish. 
The first evening we had a great chowder and salmon pasta, served by a friendly and professional waiter. The next evening we had a bone dry, burnt and inedible burger, served by an arrogant and rude waiter.
How can the very same hotel have so different standards when it comes to rooms, facilities, food, and staff? 
Crowne Plaza's slogan is ""10 out of 10"". It is very far from that.",3,2017,08,05
250,Overnight stay,"We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport and offered transportation to and from the hotel to the airport.

Although we always book a non smoking room when we got to our assigned room it reeked of cigarette smoke! I called down to the front desk and the sweet young lady, can't remember her name, came up to our room straight away with a room key to a new room for us to move to.

Our daughters flew in to Dublin late and the shuttle was not running so they had to take a taxi to the hotel. None of us had any euro's to pay the taxi and the taxi did not accept credit. The front desk so gracefully gave our girls the cash to pay the taxi and then added that amount to our hotel stay that we were able to pay with a credit card. They were so nice to do that! 

Btw, the taxi driver was so rude to our girls because he told them he had to wait 1 hour in the queue to just get a short distance fare to the Crowne Plaza and why didn't they take the shuttle, he complained to them ask the way to the hotel. I was very upset. The taxi driver charged them €15.00.

Breakfast was really good and well worth adding it to your accommodations. The whole honey comb they have is amazing!",5,2017,08,04
250,Good airport hotel ,"If you have a layover at Dublin airport then the Crowne Plaza is a good choice, they have a complimentary shuttle bus from the airport, coach stop 16, which runs at 20 minute intervals for most if the day and it takes about 10 minutes, it also picks up for the Holiday inn which is next to Crowne Plaza. The hotel is nice and modern with a good decorations, and the rooms are a good size. They have a restaurant and a bar in the hotel with decent prices. There is also a good sized gym with lots of machines and equipment. All the rooms have safes and the executive rooms have a nice selection of tea, coffee and hot chocolate. The breakfast is normally only €10 if you buy it at check in which is good value. All in all a good airport hotel if the rate is good.",4,2017,08,03
250,Great Server!,After approximately 36 hours straight with no sleep flying into Dublin and doing a full day of sight seeing a good meal was all we needed. While staying at the Crown plaza myself my wife and a few other family members sat down-and ordered food and was served by a wonderful server by the name of Ashling. Not only was the food great and well-needed but Ashling's service was outstanding! She was a breath of fresh air and super attentive after a long long day. Completely what our family needed and we really appreciated it!,5,2017,08,02
250,Great food and service,The hotel is in a great position if you want to stay close to the airport and a free shuttle is provided (which is very regular).  The service in the hotel was excellent throughout our stay.  We had dinner twice in the restaurant and the food was really good and the service was excellent.  Milislav and Justin were particularly brilliant and made the kids laugh.  I'll stay next time I'm in Dublin.,5,2017,08,02
250,Very nice airport hotel,"Only stayed one night but hotel was very nice, although it is the airport hotel it's about 3 or so miles from the terminal so close enough to be convenient but far enough not to be noisy. The room was large and well equipped with a huge bathroom. Breakfast is the standard Buffet but very tasty
",4,2017,08,02
250,Great location for the airport,"Our flight leaving Dublin was in the morning and this hotel was a perfect choice for our last night in Dublin.  The rooms and staff were excellent.  I highly recommend the Cinnabar Red Bar for a bite to eat.  Anna, our waitress was very good and the food was amazing.  I had the red curry with rice and it was the best I ever had.  It is a bit of a distance to the city centre but since we were looking at a spot that was close the airport, this hotel was perfect.  Also, the free shuttle was appreciated!!  We booked this room on IHG points so I can't speak to the affordability but if you are using points, it wasn't a large amount and the dates we needed were available.",4,2017,08,01
250,Amazing Staff,"Stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to Dublin with my family. Small and cozy hotel, the family room was just right. What made the stay amazing were the staff. From Olga, Krystian, Anthony and Emilia at the front desk to Colin and his team in the restaurant. They were very professional, warm and helpful. I got some excellent tips on sights to see and things to do, not just in Dublin, but around Ireland too. If your travels take you to Dublin, and you are OK with traveling into town (as this hotel is near the airport), I would recommend this hotel!",5,2017,07,30
250,Good choice :),"The free hotelshuttle picks you up at Dublin airport and brings you within a few minutes to a clean and nice hotel with a great staff.

Check in was done very fast and friendly. Front desk gave also good information about which bus to catch to go to downtown Dublin. The hotel is situated in front of a nice park where you can go for a relaxing walk (lake with swans).

We found a very clean and well kept room which gave you the feeling to be a welcomed guest. (free water, coffee and tea, cookies,... good quality products in the bathroom).
Sleep quality was very good (excellent mattress and pillows, no noise... we even didn't hear one single airplane).

3 course dinner in the evening was excellent concerning the quality and quantity served. A special compliment to the friendly and professional service.

Breakfast buffet in the morning was perfect. Great choice of well presented! products of high quality. ""The honey"" will surprise you :)
Delicious smoked salmon, tasty juices...
Also very good service team in the morning. 

Check out was quick and smooth.

Will stay there again next week the night before taking the flight home.",4,2017,07,30
250,Good value - free shuttle service,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza coming and going in Ireland. We booked a double room for the four of us and it was spacious and comfortable. Nice touch with free cookies, tea, coffee and both sparkling and still water. They even have an electrical outlet that takes US plugs. Beds were comfortable, bathroom had both a shower and tub, and it was quiet. Minutes away from the airport with free shuttle service that runs very regularly. We had an early flight on our first night so no breakfast, but we paid 10 Euro each for the breakfast buffet on the return flight and it was fantastic. Incredible value. ",5,2017,07,29
250,Visited for dinner and drinks,"We flew in from the UK and needed a late-night place to eat. The restaurant was excellent with great food and drinks. Anna, our server was a breath of fresh air. She gave us tips about the city and how to best spend our time in Dublin. Highly recommend The restaurant and you would be lucky to have Anna as your server!",5,2017,07,28
250,Decent hotel at a fair price,"Overall there were really no complaints with this hotel.  Very close to Dublin airport made it a great option for a couple of nights before heading out on an early flight.  The hotel is quite a decent drive from City center, so not a great location if you plan to spend most of your time in the City.  An easy drive out to a fairly large shopping center in Swords, and easy access to major motor ways.  The room itself was large by European standards, and I was impressed with the overall quality and cleanliness of the place.  The Wifi connection was stable and fast and all other expectations of our stay were meet to satisfaction.",4,2017,07,28
250,A fantastic choice,"My family stayed two nights. The staff were friendly and helpful. Colin, in particular, runs a first class operation managing two restaurants simultaneously. He helped out with great ideas for our visit to Dublin. Our room was well maintained and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the city and airport.",5,2017,07,28
250,Enjoyably time,Came here for some after drinks from a nearby restaurant. It's been a while since I've been here but it was as enjoyable as always. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Particularly would like to mention Shaji; our server today. He couldn't have been friendlier or more obliging. Will pop in again soon. ,5,2017,07,28
250,"Cocktails folks,what a cocktails!","Damn!!!!it was meant to be another one of those colourless,transparent in it's boring form,lazy Sundays but boy,was I wrong...me and my bff (don't even attempt on confusing it with being cute,we're GANGSTER) were in the area,slightly hungover from the night before  (as you'd expect to be on Sunday),his plan was to make an appearance on his mother's birthday  (shoutout to  Maurine* I always tend to butcher her name but nobody's perfect)my plan was to not have a plan cause in my own slightly compromised mind I'm way to cool for that bs,and right b4 we were about to part ways I said that we should have one more drink just for the road....so we ordered our usual double jack's ,but at the same time the cocktail menu caught our attention...This is when lovely Aishling (Ash)came into play with her effortlessly calming nature accompanied by the coolest cocktail mixing cat (not an actual animal,just sayin') Grand master Gavin (Gav) and this is when the change in my drinking habits  (that up until that point I was weirdly proud of) took place.Mannnn what meant to be just one for the road,turned into 7hrs+ journey for my very polish and not really used to this level of flavour taste buds....I wish I could tell you more but as I just discovered I'm running late for my haircut and beard trim,so I have to end this review.forgive me for my broken English,but I hope you get the point...Great place,but even better service by fantastic group of people. Peace out!",5,2017,07,28
250,Peter cullen,"Fabless hotel services and customer attention   
As a regular guest of the hotel I find the hotel staff extremely attentive and friendly. Reception staff always cater for every need and catering staff especially Carolina deserve much credit !!! 
excellent club lounge with customer service from Edit and Martina   !!! ",5,2017,07,27
250,Great Bar experience,"Hello, thought I'd take the time to say thank you to Pitor and Oliver who took care of us at the the Crowne Plaza bar.  Both were very helpful and polite and took the extra time to make things right - even when there was a small error on a food order.  There were no excuses or wavering they just fixed it and quickly.  Also Oliver makes a gin and tonic to die for - worth trying and watching the preparation!",5,2017,07,26
250,Ok,"Nearby airport so convenient 
Newly refurbished rooms on club floor are very nice 
Club lounge has change but snack are very poor quality and quantity 
Bar service leaves a lot to be desired and needs attention badly",3,2017,07,26
250,Perfect end to our 2 week tour around Ireland,"When we checked in, we were told there was no water for 3 hours, so we were offered a drink in the bar as compensation. The manner in which we were treated was very good. I must comment on the soft furnishings and standard of rooms, bathrooms was terriffic.",5,2017,07,25
250,Great place to stay prior to a morning flight,"Having a restaurant and bar in the hotel was very important as the hotel is not close to downtown and we were only there for a short time arriving late and leaving early.  There was a good free shuttle to the airport.  I thought it was a fantastic place for a quick overnight between two international flights.  If I remember right, this was the only hotel that we were in that even accommodated any time of plug in the outlets, which was nice.",5,2017,07,25
250,A Jewel in the Crowne ,"Visited here a few times and it's certainly a great establishment, really friendly staff and fabulous food. Must give a shout out to the two bar staff who served us on our most recent visit, Oliver who served us our food, we both went for the chicken wings and the burgers and what a delicious feast we were served up (they certainly believe in value for money here) 
And then of course John who took care of our drinks and also introduced me to some of his locals who were in for a pint, got a great kick out of the friendly banter that followed, even if I was outnumbered probably 15 : 1, what a bunch of guys. 
Will be back and fairly soon too",5,2017,07,24
250,Incredible service,"I've stayed here several times and am always amazed at the staffs level of care and service; nothing is ever too much. Particular thanks to Olga today who kindly resolved my booking error. 
Nice to always see familiar faces among the team too, even though it can be months between a visit. 
Refurbishment is great as well; nicely finished with lots of plug points in the rooms 
A good hotel with outstanding service always makes a difference. Thank you for looking after me, see you soon. ",5,2017,07,24
250,Business Stay in Dublin,"Excellent hotel, obviously situated near to the airport and about 20-30 mins from Dublin Centre approximately 17 Euros in a taxi one way.  The bedrooms are well equipped, clean, as you would expect of the brand.  I found the breakfast to be excellent with plenty of choice.  The rooms were quiet unfortunately I did not get the chance to use any of the facilities such as the gym. On site parking 6 Euro per night. Staff themselves could not of been more helpful.",5,2017,07,24
250,Good Hospitality,"Edit thankyou for your excellent services.. For being so hardworking and focussed and intuitive.. The time in the lounge was more valued, then being in a famous club and wait forever...Thankyou Edit for the lovely hospitalitt.",4,2017,07,23
250,Good end to a bad day,"After having a horrendous day where the airline lost my bag and the handle on another broke I was in a pretty poor mood.
Lady at check in was very friendly and sympathetic and as a nice gesture gave access to the club lounge.
Bedroom was light and airy. Wee touches like chocolate on the pillow were greatly appreciated.
In the lounge Edit was extremely attentive, informative and put me back into a good mood.
Thank you!
Would highly recommend!",5,2017,07,23
250,People pleasers,"This hotel and it's staff were awesome. Lleim and Beth at the front desk rocked with service. One thing of mention is when I mentioned the minibar was empty with no diet coke, I was treated to a TRAY FULL of bottles. Now that's awesome.",5,2017,07,22
250,Great time ,"Myself and my friends visited for food for our girls day out , I could not recommend the food and service we received higher , we were looked after by the bar manager Andrew who could not been of more help , we can't wait for our next girls meal out there! ",5,2017,07,21
250,Airport stop over,"We had 2 nights here! 
The staff were great, especially in the Asian restaurant. The main course was poor and I mentioned it when asked why I did not eat my meal, the restaurants manager came over and apologised! He also gave us a free drink and delicious dessert to make up for it.
The breakfast was fantastic.
The room was lovely too. ",5,2017,07,21
250,Lovely start to holidays,"I stayed here for a night before heading to the airport. I was not disappointed...from the moment I arrived I was treated so well. The receptionist olga greeted me with a warm welcome, and as I was travelling alone made me feel right at ease. I went to the bar for drinks where I was served by Andrew who made a particularly good amaretto sour. The hospitality continued in the club lounge where Edith made me feel at home...all in all a perfect start to a unforgettable holiday.",5,2017,07,21
250,Lovely afternoon lunch,"Myself and a friend visited for a late lunch in the bar, food was great and Oliverlooked after us and delivered fresh strawberries to go with the prosecco that went down a treat. Will definitely be back. ",5,2017,07,20
250,Great spot ,"I've been super pleased with my stay here. Great service, clean, modern, excellent food, and a nice whiskey recommendation from the bartender Andrew H! 

Only feedback is that my room was a touch too warm and I can't seem to fix that. The breakfast makes up for it though. I highly recommend this hotel ",5,2017,07,20
250,Convenient to airport with city centre hotel feel,"Lovely hotel, comfortable rooms, friendly staff, nice food & bar. Also an efficient airport shuttle.taxi into city centre 15 min and reasonably priced.  Theres a Park are across the road for walks and running if needed. Not your typical airport hotel rushing you in and out!
Highly recommended if you need to stay in Dublin.",4,2017,07,20
250,Errrmmm.... 😏,"So, not often I write a bad review but, after having a really bad day, this just added insult to injury.
I am a Spire Elite member of the IHG loyalty program (which means I stay at a lot of IHG hotels and spend a LOT of money in doing so) and this is the worst Crowne Plaza I have stayed at.
The desk staff couldn't (wouldn't?) modify a booking so my colleague could have his points.
Then, 12 minutes to get the attention of a waiter and 18 minutes for the drinks to arrive (after 31 mins, the starters STILL hadn't arrived).
Staff were detached and dismissive (although the bar manager DID provide a couple of free drinks as an apology).
Poor, lacking focus, falling well short of the usual level of Crowne Plaza customer care.
Bad form chaps 👎🏻",1,2017,07,19
250,Great Value,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night last weekend.  I was very impressed by the quality of the hotel and the service quality provided by the staff.  I highly recommend this hotel.  

The rooms are nice.  Every service person I spoke with provided me with help with a smile.  

I'll definitely return.  ",5,2017,07,18
250,Always such a pleasure 😊,Having arrived tired and miserable after a long journey it was refreshing to get a warm and generous welcome back from front desk receptionist Olga. She had such a welcoming manner and made the misery disappear with helpfulness and light hearted funny conversation. She surely is the jewel in your crown.,5,2017,07,17
250,A superb hotel!! ,"Olga is a wonderful lady, professional and courteous whenever I need to make a reservation. She did the booking for my Dad who has stayed here several times already, he loves the hotel and the service he gets every time he stays here. Several of our friends have stayed here too. 
",5,2017,07,16
250,Looks can be deceiving ,"So arrived yesterday, hotel was really busy. The style of the hotel is very nice. went to desk to check in gave the lady the booking name, was there for some time, she couldn't find it, finally another member of staff was helpful, we got our key cards, when to our room, key cards weren't working, so had to go back down get cards re-magnetised. Got into the room looks nice, was in a rush got ready and left. Got back quite late, was getting ready for bed the fan had sucha a loud noise had to turn it off and open the window then had the Joys of listening to all the planes come and go. Bed wasn't comfortable in the slightest, I'd say prisoners get better pillows than the ones we had. I was soo disappointed. In the morning got up was getting ready,was around 10:10/10:15 and there was a knocking on our door, accommodation staff asking when we were leaving. I said soon. I found it odd to have someone knocking on our door. When was checking out asked what time was check out, was told it was 12. Found staff rude and non friendly. I will never stay there again. ",1,2017,07,16
250,Best staff in the business ,"We loved every minute of our stay here. It was clean, convenient and the staff was truly AMAZING. Jon, James, Aishling and Krystian made our 1st trip to Ireland one of our favorites. THANK YOU!! I cannot rave about these amazing staff members enough. I will return again and again. Highly recommend!",5,2017,07,11
250,Great hotel,"The hotel is great. The room is very spacious, with a lot of lights. The large bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is also spacious and very comfortable to use. The staff was very friendly and forthcoming. Breakfast is very rich. It is off city, but if you need to stay at the airport area, the location is great. Very nice landscape. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,07,11
250,Amazing service at the restaurant,"Our servant was Lionel M. and he guided us trough the menue and give us a wonderful service at our stay the last night in ireland. We loved it to stay there for the evening.
Perfect and recommendable. The food was excellent also.
The rooms are comfortable and cosy.",4,2017,07,11
250,Nice stay near airport,"We stayed here at the end of our trip.  This was our second stay, we also stayed here last year. 
It is near the airport but not at the airport.  The parking is a walk down the street. 
They have a pub that serves food and a restaurant for breakfast and I think dinner. 
The breakfast was good, the traditional Irish buffet with hot and cold foods. 
It's a relaxing place to end your trip. Check out is 12pm. ",4,2017,07,10
250,Good Hotel,Stayed at the Crown Plaza for 2 nights on Business. Room very comfortable with a great selection for Breakfast. Staff very friendly and chatty. Good parking and close to the airport. Would stay again next time I am in Dublin.,5,2017,07,10
250,Lovely Bar Staff,"Jim Bourke was my server at the bar and he was so helpful, knowledgeable and patient.
I was there for a business meeting and my client was delayed, Jim was patient with me waiting to order until he arrived.",5,2017,07,10
250,Close to Airport with nice park for jogging across the street,"The hotel was very nice, but the room was a bit small.  The parking lot has very small spaces.  If you are dropping your car off at the airport be sure to get gas before following your gps to car return.  You will not pass a gas station.  If you turn left out of the hotel you will find one about a mile down the road.  The park across the street is good for jogging.  It has a paved path around it that is a little less than a mile around.  The restaurant was good and beer/wine was free if you get on the conceriege floor.",4,2017,07,08
250,Comfort and convenience with style,"After 10 wonderful days of exploring Ireland, and driving on the crazy Dublin tollway, we were happily exhausted. We chose to stay here because of the proximity to the airport for our morning flight out. Anthony at the front desk welcomed us with a friendly chat, and was able to situate us with an executive room. Beautiful, smart touches furnishing the room. Very comfortable. The executive lounge allowed us to relax, grab a bite to eat and reminisce about our travels. Very clean, with everything provided that you might need.  Would definitely stay here again!  By the way, best make up mirror ever! I want to find out what kind it was and buy one!",5,2017,07,07
250,flight attendant,"The service was amazing at the hotel restaurant. I have been there for a breakfast and chef louie made me one of the best omelettes ever. I would also like to thank Maria for her great assistance and help, she is very approachable and helpful.",5,2017,07,07
250,Good Hotel,"Another quality hotel on our 6 week road tour of UK/Ireland.
As usual with online reservations in busy hotels you are initially told you don't have a reservation however the guy in reception eventually found us.
Nice big clean room, great buffet breakfast",4,2017,07,06
250,Close to airport,Great hotel to stay at if looking for proximity to the airport. They have a free shuttle every 20 mins. The food was amazing and the rooms were very nice. Ate at the hotel bar and the food was awesome.,5,2017,07,06
250,Great for Business Travelers in Dublin,"I have stayed at this property several times over the years and its great for business, travel to Dublin International Airport and has great food.

I hosted conferences here in the past, using their conference centers and the hotel made a great presentation for my clients. The lobby is very clean and modern and the hotel staff did a great job of setting up the room and providing high-quality refreshments and snacks. 

After work, if you don't want to venture into Dublin City Centre, you can get a great meal at the hotel, or take a short walk to a couple of other restaurants across from Sentry Park. 

The desk staff is great and is always willing to help you with transit or things to do.

You can use their fitness center or you can go running in Santry Park, right across the street from the hotel. Santry Park is also a nice place to take a stroll to just look at nature as well.",5,2017,07,06
250,Flawless effort from Beth,"Stayed here recently before i flew out to Paris with my girlfriend for our 3rd anniversary. I planned on making it a very special as i wanted to propose. I phoned in where Beth answered the phone, i explained my situation. She arranged flowers, chocolate and a bottle of champagne for the night before we flew out. My partner was delighted when she saw the room, it was spacious, clean and very romantic. We used the gym the morning before our flight, it was just adequate for us. We had a delicious breakfast, just what the doctor ordered. Thank you to all staff, it really was a trip to remember and a special thank you to Beth for making it all happen.",5,2017,07,06
250,"Treated royally the minute we arrived, comfortable room and excellent breakfast",When we arrived we were greeted with a smile and allowed access to the corporate room which is where we had breakfast although we had prepaid breakfast. The beds were comfortable and the room very clean. There was a free shuttle to and from the airport. Would go back.,5,2017,07,05
250,AMAZING,"From our initial check-in to our departure, we had a wonderful experience at the Crowne Plaza . The Front Desk was extremely communicative leading  up to our stay, helping me organize a driver to/from Airport thank you Beth. I also told them it was my hubby's birthday, so they helped arrange Champagne (and a little cake, their compliments) in our room upon our arrival. Beth was highly responsive and organized, which I really appreciated. Beth also helped us secure spa services locally. we were in a  larger room with great toiletries the room was immaculate . Great service. They also helped secure a reservation last minute at Shanahan's on the Green after I realized I forgot to make one. When I dialed front desk as we needed a fan when we sleep),  Beth called to check if we had received it . They really take care of their guests, and it shows in every interaction. Every staff person we encountered were friendly and accommodating.. Service is attentive and detailed. We really appreciated what seems to be their ""see but not heard"" approach after a long day of sights it was great to go fro a walk in the park which is close by. All in all it was a magnificent stay, with superb staff, and we'd love to return.",5,2017,07,05
250,AMAZING BETH,"overall stay was fantastic, close to all local amenities and had a wonderful time with my family. It was my sons 7th birthday and Beth advised of a delicious bakery close by where we could get a cake, she was so helpful and my son was delighted with his birthday cake. I also met with Colin who advised to have some lunch in the restaurant, he suggested the salmon and it was very tasty- hats off to the chef! we had a great stay and all the employees should be accredited for their attention to detail.",5,2017,07,03
250,Amazing service,"I always stay at this hotel for my business trips - everyone is sooo accommodating and the breakfast is to die for! 
I come into the breakfast area with a smile on my face every time. For my last trip in June ( 12th to 23rd) I was welcomed several time to the dining area by Jon, who saw me to my table and always inquired for any other services I might need. He is extremely helpful, has a welcoming attitude and checks up on my orders regularly. 
It's almost like a ""barman experience"" - we get some chats in as we meet on the hallways , he checks up on my stay- I appreciate the ""human to human"" relationship.

I 'm looking forward to get back there again!

250,"Very nice service to wheelchair customer by ""Anna""","I brought my Mam here for lunch as it is within walking distance of where we live so We can go with mam's wheelchair without having to consider transport. 

When went in , Staff were very attentive in helping us to organise seating. We moved a few times from lounge to restaurant and help was always at hand. A lovely waitress, Anna, was especially attentive to us and made sure that we had a lovely stress free afternoon. The food in the restaurant was lovely and Anna facilitated us moving back to the less formal atmosphere of the lounge for dessert and coffee

Help,and attention to wheelchair users is, as I can evidence, not always forthcoming so this service was very much appreciated",4,2017,07,02
250,Ideal Place to Relax Between Sessions or Sightseeing,"When I arrived at the hotel, which is on a very reasonably priced bus line, Andre at the desk made a phone call and then although it was 7:10 a.m. checked me directly into a room and suggested I enjoy a complementary cup of tea from their coffee shop as I unpack and relax after my long flight. He and the others at the desk helped me solve problems many times during my too brief stay. When I needed an adapter because the one I brought was not suitable, they sold me a very nice, simple one for $5 euros; I bought two. Then, when I went to retrieve the tea, as the young woman fixed it for me and added a delicious biscuit, she said I should eat breakfast. The waitress agreed, and so I enjoyed the first of my daily breakfasts there. They provide a free spread that contains more items hot and cold (all delicious) than I could mention in three reviews, plus, of course, the array of beverages to make such a feast complete. Even on my special diet, I had to pick and choose, which seldom happens. The waitresses and waiters offer advice about the food and the chef came out once to chat with me to make sure I could eat safely. The food there is delicious. When we gathered for dinner after out conference, the menu did not appear to contain items free from fermentation, and so I thought I would eat rice and vegetables, but the waitress suggested ocean trout and  veggies. It was delicious. The fish from the ocean is unlike anything frozen we eat in the States. The brown bread and scones were also very tasty. The room was palatial, clean, comfortable and the bed was delightfully comfortable. The free cookies and bottled water made me feel welcome and provided safe snacks for me while I was at the hotel and conference. Andre volunteered to go to the Holiday Inn down the road to purchase diet soda for me, too, because it was cold and rainy out. I made the trip myself later when I was out anyway, but his kindness impressed me. The open areas in the hotel lobby invite conversation with other travelers, and I met some fascinating people who daughters do Irish folk dancing. I loved staying at the Crown Plaza Hotel near Dublin Airport. I never heard any airplanes, and we could easily take cabs or buses downtown to eat or shop a bit. The maids were friendly and helpful. They kept the room spotless and restocked the soap, water and cookies, much appreciated.",5,2017,07,01
250,fantastic,"Crowne Plaza was perfect for our recent family vacation. It's cute, modern, and the staff was amazing! Just super friendly and accommodating. The location was also amazing very close to local amenities. Beth was very helpful with check in and made us feel right at home.",5,2017,06,29
250,5 Stars!,"Cannot fault this Hotel.  Rooms are modern and fair size.  The food is really good, staff friendly and professional.  Location is great, 10 min to the Dublin airport and city Centre, but easy to access from any direction into Dublin. Nice sized fitness Centre and beautiful park for runners. ",5,2017,06,27
250,Miss Char ,"Our light meal was most enjoyable for an evening repast.  Food was very tasty and served quite quickly after the order was placed.  Anna, our server was friendly, efficient and most accommodating.  Great place.",4,2017,06,27
250,Excellent Staff,"Last week I was in Dublin for work and I stayed at this hotel again.
I was very happy with the room I was given,however when I took a shower the following morning the Hot water was only Luke warm ! I left it running for some time but it wasn't getting hot. I had to boil the kettle in the end and have a strip wash. I complained to Liam on reception who took ownership of the problem and completely turned things around. His Customer Service was excellent and I was very satisfied. Thanks Liam and I shall be back next time I'm in Dublin",5,2017,06,27
250,"Very Nice Hotel, Staff and Restaurant","We stayed 2 nights at this hotel at the end of a 5-week trip throughout Ireland and Scotland.  The rooms on our floor had been recently remodeled and were updated and comfortable.  The only complaint about the room is the fact that this hotel, like most others, insist on using duvets rather than blankets.  We were either too hot or too cold with this arrangement.  The dining room staff and food were all very good.  We had two dinner and two breakfasts at the restaurant.  The free shuttle bus runs every 20 minutes to and from the airport so it is very convenient.  It is a large bus so could handle our six pieces of luggage.",5,2017,06,25
250,"Nice one night stay, clean friendly staff and extremely comfortable bed","As always with Crowne plaza hotels my stay was very good, nice friendly staff, clean rooms and very comfortable bed, had a great nights sleep.
Breakfast was very good with a large selection to choose from, a friendly bar area 
Would stay again when in the area.",5,2017,06,25
250,Great place to stay ,"Fantastic place to stay. Husband having surgery nearby in SSC. Excellent in terms of knowledge re gluten free options and very helpful with this. Nice atmosphere, nice staff, would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,06,23
250,Fantastic Stay - First Class,"Stayed here for a weekend with my wife while taking in the Robbie Williams concert.
Went on a dinner, bed & breakfast basis. From start to finish the experience was totally faultless. Easy travel to Dublin city centre either by bus or taxi.
The staff in this hotel are among the best I have ever been lucky enough to meet - a real credit to the hotel group, their management and staff training programme.
Food and drinks fantastic.
A really fantastic feature was the executive lounge which we really enjoyed.",5,2017,06,21
250,Great Staff,"The Bar and the Bar restaurant Staff are very good at taking an interest in guests individual requirements.  A special mention for both Edit and Peter!! Always chatty and ensuring I was comfortable and taken care of,",4,2017,06,20
250,Wonderful experience ,"It is really not about the room itself so much - I travel a lot because of my work and after some time I can not distinguish one hotel from another; I have only overall impression (pleasant or not, clean or not, etc.). The most important factor for me is how I felt in this particular place. And I must say that in Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport I felt truly amazing and definitely will decide to go back there, hopefully not once, not twice, but more. 

What convinced me to write it? Nicely designed, clean rooms? The most beautiful park, just across the street? Partially yes. But what enchanted me most, were the most welcoming, hospitable people. I would like to thank especially Mr Petru and Ms Olga, for their amazing attitude, being so warm and helpful and very caring. They must truly value their guests, and I believe they do much more than it is expected; I could really feel that they actually care about my opinion and well being. The Managements must be very proud to have employees like them. Thanks to them my stay was very pleasant and they covered all the small irritating issues connected with the room itself (like for example faulty fridge).

To sum up: the hotel is very close to the airport, but the surroundings are very peaceful and beautiful (the park with very fresh air, some ponds, trees, playgrounds for children).
For me it was very important as well to have a Polish store nearby - I do not live in my home country and I could buy my favorite Polish food (just 7 minutes walking from the hotel).

Thanks once again for the pleasant stay and hopefully see you soon. ",5,2017,06,20
250,Smell of cigarettes and smoking,"The hotel is lovely. Facilities, location room size. It should be ideal as an airport hotel but I was really left down by the smell of cigarettes all through the hotel, even in the bedrooms. This is the type of smell that stays on you, not ideal for going on a long journey on the plane. ",2,2017,06,20
250,Manager of the hotel,"I visited the hotel the end of april,especially many thanks to Daniel from reception and MOD manager.He was very nice and helpful.I hope I am comming back,I was very satisfied.Thanks Daniel for everything you have done for me.Gabriela Stafsenova.",5,2017,06,19
250,Amazing Hotel with great staff,"I want to thank 3 fantastic people for their outstanding contribution to my stay:
Firstly Olga Scott and Olga Lana (hope that is the right spelling?) for researching, orgainising and refunding the prepaid room I had booked (I somehow managed to book two rooms, when i only required one). and to Olga Edit, who was on the Business Lounge and looked after me like a Lord. Thank you. You made my stay just perfect.",5,2017,06,19
250,Great Baby Back Ribs in the Bar/Restaurant,"The bar/restaurant is in the front of the hotel.  Although dark paneling, it has several windows, so is not particularly dark inside.  It is a comfortable setting to eat a meal at one of the many tables or booths, or simply have a drink.  Prices are a bit high, but not bad. I had the baby back ribs, which were excellent.  I think they were €14.95.  Anna was my waitress.  She was excellent.  As I was traveling alone, it can be a bit awkward.  But, she chatted a bit and made sure I was comfortable and taken care of.",5,2017,06,19
250,First time in Dublin,"The hotel is just 3.5 km taking 15 minutes from Dublin airport which is very convenient for business travelers. It is good hotel in Dublin, nice amenities but the price is a bit high for a 4* level. It located on Northwood avenue next to Santry park so it is very peaceful and green. Staffs are friendly however Air-con in my room was stand-by during whole time I stayed there. I did ask support from the staff but it seems not fixed fully. Sometimes it operated, but sometimes backed to standby condition.   ",3,2017,06,18
250,Great service at dinner,I went here with my family on my last night in Dublin and thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. Our server Anna was very friendly and made sure all our needs were promptly attended to! 5 stars for Anna. ,5,2017,06,14
250,Dinner,The service was excellent and very friendly atmosphere.   The food was delicious so much so that I returned back here after my week abroad.  Anna was a very attentive server and I enjoy my meal.  I would highly recommend it to all.  Thank you.,5,2017,06,14
250,Not great for a city visit but good hotel..,"Stayed here as Dublin was the venue for a recent sporting final. Very convenient for the airport with 3 times an hour shuttles 24/7. A bit too far from the city -- a €20 taxi ride of about 30 mins, but the hotel itself is really good. Nice clean rooms and has the scalability to cope with the frequency of movements of airport hotel. Perfectly acceptable venue really.",4,2017,06,14
250,Superb ,"I only stayed here once (work trip) but I truly loved it. The hotel is located in a very quiet area, away from traffic and noise. My room was quite nice and the bed comfortable.  The TV broke for some reason but the staff came and fixed it really quickly. I was given a free drink at the bar which was nice. I ate dinner at the restaurant and the food I ate was one of the best I had in a hotel restaurant. I agree with some of the reviewers here – the staff was really nice and friendly. I’d definitely come back again.",5,2017,06,13
250,Great hotel ... friendly staff,"One night with a great experience, room was very comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was superb!! Staff was so friendly and nice. The guys from the reception were so cool and very professional i would like to mention Emilia , Anthony and Beth they were amazing they did that extra mile for me to have 5* experience in Crowne Pza. Thank you guys!!  Cormac in the Club Lounge , Jon at the breakfast they were so friendly and nice. Amazing experience great hotel. ",5,2017,06,10
250,Perfect Hotel,"1- very quite and clean rooms
2- Free Internet - complimentary water - cookies - tea coffee hot chocolate iron and iron table Aromatic spray for better sleep - wonderful view
3- very friendly staff
4- Amazing breakfast - very good price

One of the best hotels in the approximately 50 countries I visited.",5,2017,06,09
250,Business hotel close to Dublin Airport,"The Crowne Plaza Santry is located in a small parkland about 3 or 4 kilometres down the road from Dublin Airport and approimately a 30 minute bus journey from the city centre. There is a shared free shuttle bus from the airport with the Holiday Inn Express which is next door to the Crowne Plaza.

We arrived and were checked in by a young man who welcomed me as an IHG member as I was using points for my stay. He then asked if I had stayed in the hotel before. I said 'no' and he said 'welcome back'. No more conversation or information after that and I was just given my room key and told the lift was around the corner. Not a great start.

Our room was lovely. A nice size, tea & coffee, iron & ironing board, good free wifi, bathrobe, minibar but no in room safe. Just a note to say you could secure your valuables at reception but I don't want to walk half way around the world to get my Ipad. The bed was very comfortable providing a great nights sleep and the air conditioning worked very well.

The bathroom was spotless with nice toiletries and a fantastic shower. There was also a hair dryer in the drawer of the writing bureau.

On the first floor there is a small gym with a good selection of work out machines, free weights, towels and a water font.

Breakfast was excellent. A great range of hot and cold foods from which to choose including fresh honeycomb. A chef was on hand to cook you eggs to your liking.

Car parking is onsite and while there is a €6 fee per 24 hours, they validated my ticket on checkout.

While I was checking out, a member of an Etihad flight crew was changing some money and asked the duty manager (I didn't get her name) how much it cost to get to town on the bus. She changed the money and put the exact fare for her two  journeys, in and out, into two money bags as the buses in Dublin require the exact fare. She couldn't have been more helpful..... the complete opposite of my check in!

Overall, a very nice hotel close to the airport and highly recommended.",4,2017,06,08
250,Still coming back here,"Good hotel easy to access the main roads into the city or up north, excellent breakfast, nice bar with good choice of draught and decent food,  had access to the lounge which where Edit was a great host and very welcoming always had a smile ",5,2017,06,07
250,Without Fault...,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for the Pro12 rugby final at the Aviva. Check in was as swift and friendly as it goes, We were in a twin double bed room (410) on the Club floor with access to the Club Lounge for complimentary evening drinks and breakfast. The room was spotless and very quiet. Getting to town by taxi was straightforward costing 20-25Euro. I can't imagine this hotel gets many complaints. If I was to look to moan about anything then the bar service could have been a bit swifter... Would certainly stay here again.",5,2017,06,05
250,Should be 5 Stars,"We stay here every time we travel through Dublin, at least once to twice a year! We have also had conferences here. We want to commend Jon Vartic, food an beverage supervisor, for his amazing work! He has always gone out of his way to make sure everything runs smoothly. We highly recommend having a function here as well as staying here. ",5,2017,06,05
250,My favorite airport hotel,"Location and convenience is a plus. The hotel has most amenities, gym, nice restaurant and bar. They are renovating so I am eager to see how it progresses. It's a short walk to the bus to go into city centre Dublin and a great park across the street. People are friendly, rooms clean, a bit old- but they are renovating.",4,2017,06,04
250,Club Lounge visit,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza prior to flying from Ireland to home in Oregon, USA. We were upgraded to an executive suite and able to use the Club Lounge. The dark haired lady at reception was amazingly helpful. We loved our room which was well appointed. Loved our time in the Club Lounge and our server Anna was outstanding. She went the extra mile by getting my favorite cider from the bar for me. The snacks were wonderful. What a delightful departure experience from this hotel and from this lovely country of Ireland!",5,2017,06,03
250,Club lounge,"We had a great experience at the club lounge.  Our host Anna was terrific.  She was friendly and very helpful .  It was our last night in Ireland and she made our trip
 even more memorable.  I would recommend this hotel because the staff is very accomadating.",5,2017,06,03
250,Unusually classy airport hotel,"I stayed here for one night for a work trip and was pleasantly surprised by how nice this hotel was to stay in.

I was in an executive room which was spacious and beautifully clean.  The provided toiletries were of a high standard and even the hairdryer was decent.

I enjoyed an excellent night's sleep in the comfy bed and a tasty breakfast in the quiet and calm club lounge which overlooks the park.

Now why aren't all airport hotels this nice?!",4,2017,06,03
250,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here twice, once on arrival in Dublin & once before departure.  We were impressed with the friendly & efficient service at the front desk.  The rooms themselves were very pleasant, with some unusual & thoughtful touches/amenities, attractive decor, very clean bathroom with separate shower & tub, comfortable beds and chairs.  The airport shuttle arrived & departed exactly on time & we noticed how helpful the drivers were in assisting some elderly people with their luggage (not part of the hotel staff of course, but it all added up to make the hotel experience feel good).  Breakfast was delicious with a good variety of foods, constantly being checked & replenished by the staff. We ate supper twice at the bar/restaurant & it was also served by very pleasant & efficient staff & the food itself was very good.  We highly recommend this hotel & would definitely return to it if we stayed again in Dublin!",5,2017,06,01
250,Best hotel of the whole trip,"If you book the club fourth floor its worth every penny. You get a club room that offers breakfast, free drinks and apetizers etc. the tooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Water was provided, cofee maker, cookies, wifi, chocolate, and comfy beds. Parking for a fee at the holiday inn express right next door.",5,2017,05,31
250,Was more impressed 2nd visit,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel almost 3 years ago and I decided to do so a 2nd time this past weekend. All of the staff were friendly, professional and helpful, but I would like to give a 'shout out' to Beth who was fantastic and because she didn't mind doing that extra bit, she made my stay extraordinary! In the end I was more impressed than I was after the first visit. Hotel is convenient to the airport with a free shuttle and to city centre on the transit bus.",5,2017,05,30
250,Friendly staff,"We were at a company training at Crowne Plaza.  The hotel is nice, the staff is friendly. The park in front of the hotel is good for running or walking. Both at the bar, reception, restaurats the staff were really friendly and helpful. Especially two of them: Szilvia at the reception helped us a lot during our stay and also helped what to see in Dublin and in Ireland, Edit was really helpful in the bar downstairs and at the Club Lounge at floor4. Next time in Ireland we will stay again here.  ",5,2017,05,30
250,"Nice rooms and facilities, with excellent staff","Was there to attend a company event, had to chance to experience nice rooms, good food and beautiful surroundings. On the 4th floor there is also a club launge with nice selection of drinks and snacks, the place was managed by EDIT who made every evening nice and peaceful. We also met her at the bar downstairs only to continue the great service provision. SZILVIA from the receiption was giving great advices about places to visit in Ireland and she helped us in all matters about the hotel. 
Recommended!",5,2017,05,29
250,Fantastic hotel,"Our family of 2 adults and two older teenage children (17 & 19) travelled to Dublin to attend a concert at Slane Castle and stayed for one night at this hotel. We arrived early, about 12.30pm and were able to check into our room, something we hadn't expected but we were very thankful for. We each had our own room key which was great for the teenagers.

Our room was lovely, extremely comfortable, very clean and spacious. We particularly liked the full size bath and separate shower, with lots of complimentary shower gels etc. Unfortunately we only had 3 bath towels in the bathroom but it wasn't a huge deal, we shared. 

We enjoyed lunch in the bar area and headed off to the concert and didn't return to the hotel until 2am. Our beds were extremely comfortable and our room was warm and relaxing. The complimentary biscuits and water were a nice touch too.  

We slept through breakfast so can't comment on that but we had a great stay and if we return to Dublin we will definitely book with the Crowne Plaza again.  We must mention the pictures above the bed, with star lights in them. What a great idea, impressive!

",5,2017,05,29
250,First trip to Ireland,"Stayed only one night, but was the best sleep I've ever had! Would like to know the kind of/weight of the duvets. It was wonderful! People nice and friendly. Everything clean. Loved all the plug-ins that were US and EU. Would definitely stay there again!",5,2017,05,25
250,Really Great Airport Hotel,"We stayed here on 2 occasions on our trip to Europe. This hotel was fantastic with clean and newly updated rooms ( they were in middle of construction while we were there). There is free shuttle from airport to the hotel which we made use of on both occasions that we stayed here and was great addition. 
We enjoyed our stay so much that on our overnight stay coming back from Europe and heading home, I cancelled another reservation we had and booked at this hotel instead. 
We ate at the bar restaurant on 2 separate occasions and really enjoyed our meals and the service each time. 
The distance from Dublin city centre is pretty far and an expensive taxi ride, I think it was close to 25 each way. But if you need a place to stay between flights or night before leaving the country this is ideal choice. 
My big complainant which there is nothing they can do about is that there is no pool, that would make this a five start hotel in my opinion.",4,2017,05,24
250,Friendly staff,"Very friendly front office staff. Check in and check out were a breeze. Free shuttle bus to the AP for those not interested in a taxi.

I was upgraded upon check in, I think as per my IHG status and it was a lovely room, with access to the club lounge.
If an issue arised over my stay, once brought to the attention of staff, was rectified quickly.
Will be returning before my next trip out of Dublin Airport. 
WIFI strong also.",3,2017,05,24
250,Lovely place to stay out of the City,"We arrived to a very busy hotel and it took a while to check in, we were acknowledge by Beth while we were waiting and it was Beth who checked us in, she apologised for the wait and swiftly checked us in and informed us of all  we were on the 1st floor and the rooms were amazing very chic,we had a delicious Irish breakfast in the morning and we asked friends to join us. we did not eat dinner but had drinks in the bar,  I stay in Dublin a few times a year and yet this was our first visit and I must say it is a lovely hotel to stay,the staff are amazing,.I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends and family",5,2017,05,23
250,Excellent quality hotel very near the Dublin Airport,"Very convenient location, close to the Dublin Airport.  The free shuttle to and from the airport departs conveniently every 20 minutes.  The check-in process was seamless, with very friendly service!  The checkout process was equally as seamless.  Room was very quiet, clean, and specious.  The beds are very comfortable, not too hard and not too soft.  Just right!  We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant, and were afforded a nice, quiet area of the restaurant away from the noise of the bar area.  If you like lots of activity, the bar area seemed to be a lively place.  The menu had a good selection of varying items, and the dishes we ordered were delicious and moderately priced.  The wait staff were EXCELLENT!  Our waiter, Colin, was extremely nice.  Colin took the time to get to know us, and offered us recommendations off the menu that were excellent.  He made our dining experience exceptional!  Highly recommend the Crowne Plaza Dublin airport!",5,2017,05,22
250,Very helpful server!,"I am lactose intolerant and found the menu at the Crowne Plaza very well detailed and helpful for someone with food sensitivities.  Plus, Anna went out of her way to find out if something else on the menu could be adjusted for my dietary needs.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our meals... Thank you!",5,2017,05,21
250,Comfortable and stylish. Great service!,This place is perfect if youre looking to get out to the airport for an early flight. They have frequent free shuttle buses direct to the airport and offer complementary take-away coffee/tea to wake you up before you leave. They even offered us a yoghurt and croissant to take with us! It is easy to get to from the city center with regular buses out and the hotel is just down the lane from the bus stop. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable with free bottled natural and sparkling water in the rooms as well as a minibar (not free obviously) and cute vials of a distilled lavender scent for your pillows. I didn't use it but it felt nice to feel looked after! We couldn't eat there in the afternoon as they had four functions on downstairs and had no room  in the restaurant but other than that we had a perfect stay. Would recommend.,5,2017,05,20
250,Perfect place near the airport,"If you want to stay somewhere close to the airport - this is it! 
Free airport transfers, professional, helpful and friendly staff, comfortable rooms, great restaurant, wonderful breakfast and.... divine smelling soaps and shampoo in the room!

Fabulous hotel, very modern and clean. We were upgraded to a double room which had two double bed's. Loads of room, very clean, had tea/coffee/biscuits even hot chocolate and bottles of water complimentary in the room. Bed's very comfortable and lovely decor in room and throughout the hotel. The staff were very professional and friendly. The room also had iron/board, hairdryer, dressing gown and the usual toiletries. The ensuite bathroom was a very generous size also. Slept well, no noise. Great selection for breakfast. Would love to stay again, it is also situated opposite a lovely park.",5,2017,05,17
250,Small touches made the difference ,"Stayed for two nights and was very comfortable . Staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was great . 
The best part of the stay was the little aromatherapy bottles on the bed on arrival to help one sleep . Loved it ",4,2017,05,17
250,Charming,"I can't say enough about the friendliness and professionalism of the hotel staff. 
From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel very welcome, the reception area had fresh water and flowers with fruit available and seats in the lobby you could sit whilst you are waiting for your rooms if you wish.. 
the rooms were lovely and able to accommodate two queen sized beds, the bathroom was  quite small but quaint with ample towels and products of top quality. The shower was  powerful  the Ac. was quite noisy bur we only slept in the room as we were out all day, Beth called us in the room as my husband had a bad headache after our long flight to check if there was anything she could do, we did mention the AC and was offered the maintenance team to call  or would like a room move, we decided not to avail but the kindness and hospitality was excellent.  . 
The bar area was fantastic, full of life and quite spacious ,
Staff and patrons were very friendly . I did  eat here for breakfast and menu had a great selection from Irish to Contintental simply delicious,. 
I would return as the staff were very accommodating and the hotel has a certain charm .

Stayed in March 2017",5,2017,05,17
250,Excellent Experience,"A wonderful experience to always remember. A special thank you to Beth from the front desk for her impeccable service and dedication,  most friendly and helpful and  great first impression of  hotel, had a delicious meal in the bar, great service from Peter very witty and had us in stitches, the soup and burgers were very tasty and desser, our rooms on the 2nd floor newly refurbished and worth it , it is so nice that hotels have not an issue in putting money back in. a beautiful park to have a stroll or a run if yo were up to it , will highly recommend, ,",5,2017,05,17
250,Lovely stay in fab location ,Stayed here for an awards ceremony and was super impressed.  Upgraded to a suite on arrival and room was outstanding.  All the facilities you could want and surprisingly good views across beautiful parkland that you wouldn't expect in Dublin. The icing on the cake was an executive lounge with canapes and beer or wine complimentary from 5.30 to 7.30. This alone would make the place worth staying but add in the friendly helpful staff and the lovely room with lots of little touches like lavender spray to help you sleep and this hotel is probably best place to stay next to Dublin airport.,5,2017,05,16
250,Great good and excellent service,Had a gorgeous lunch here! Soup of the day was lovely as was the prawn sandwich.Very generous portion size and great service especially from our waitress Anna. Small bit expensive but worth it.Would recommend,4,2017,05,16
250,Great Dinner for Last Night in Ireland,"Dinner was delicious. We had the Cinnabar burger and fries and the build your own salad. Iwona, our server, did a great job and was cheerful and efficient even though she had a number of tables. Fantastic way to end our Ireland holiday!",5,2017,05,12
250,Wow good recovery from a shaky start,"I have stayed here several times an it has always been 100% but that was before I reviewed hotels

I had been on the go since 3am so I was keen to have a shower and get a bit of rest

Unfortunately there was no hot water , after a call 4min later a technician was there fixing it   

I went to the exelent lounge had a few drinks and snacks then returned to my room

Not only was the water problem fixed ,a really nice tray of fresh fruit and a very nice bottle or red wine was left as an apology 

I had a great sleep and can certainly recommend the breakfast 

With the free bus to and from the airport.. it was a great place to stay

Be back next time I'm in Dublin 
",5,2017,05,11
250,A great venue for work,"Every day,  without fail,  we were greeted cheerfully and helpfully by ALL members of staff. The friendly and professional service made this work trip an absolute pleasure. Katie & Anete facilitated our meetings perfectly whilst Anna in the bar restaurant couldn't have been more helpful regarding menu choices. A thoroughly enjoyable trip...I can't wait to come back.",5,2017,05,10
250,WILL DEFINITELY RETURN,"We  traveled to Dublin in March  for the  first time. The staff were so welcoming - it felt like we arrived somewhere where we were known! especially by Beth who organised a great trip to Bray and beyond we went to Happy Pear I think that was the name of the restaurant all organic and so healthy,  We were given a beautiful room on the 3rd floor 
The location is really good with a beautiful park and we were a bus ride from the city of Dublin. 
We ate in the restaurant a few mornings and the food was very good - nothing was out of the question for the staff members - they are a credit to the hotel!
We will  return here - it would be hard to look elsewhere!",5,2017,05,09
250,Very Nice Stay Near Airport,We stayed one night so we could easily catch our flight the next morning.  So much nicer than expected.  Beautiful park nearby.  Spacious room.  Friendly staff.   Tasty food in both the bar and breakfast buffet.   The airport shuttle was timely.,4,2017,05,08
250,Great location - good food,"This was a great location to end our vacation flying out the next morning.  The hotel was clean, neat and noise free (even though near the airport).  The restaurant had great food and service.  Have to mention our waitress, Edit - great service.",5,2017,05,08
250,Etihad Airways Flight Attended ,"This hotel it's amazing. The rooms are very clean, the bed is so comfortable and the food,  especially breakfast it's delicious. I meet one of the staff, Maria from Romania,  she was so friendly warm and professional. She gave me a box of chocolates and asking me how is my stay. It never happen to me in any hotels in Europe. I strongly recommend this hotel, It's lovely.🤗",5,2017,05,03
250,Great Hotel,This hotel is nearby airport (10 min Drive) with helpful staffs and options of restaurant. At the ground level there is Cinnabar and a restaurant. If you are lazy like me you can order room service too with some extra charges.,4,2017,05,03
250,Two amazing staff turned around a poor start to our stay.,"We have stayed at the Crowne Plaza a number of times over the years, some good experiences and some bad. This visit started off like the latter, repeated requests to fill the mini bar and at breakfast the first day there was very little left in the buffet. However when we spoke to the supervisor Jon (Ioan) who asked us to trust him saying he would ensure all future breakfast experiences would be good. He surpassed his promise and his friendly and professional manner was a pleasure. His was not the only star  Edit who looked after us in the Executive Lounge during the Cocktail hour was fantastic, she too managed her work with an easy friendly style while ensure everything was run to perfection.

The hotel itself is of good quality as you would expect and so given the fact that the staff make the difference this is a good place to stay.

We do hope that both Edit and Jon are here for our next visit as they made our stay.",4,2017,05,03
250,Great hotel.,"We had a great check in from Kristian (who remembered us the next day!) and the room though small was very nice. Comfortable beds and great bathroom.  The bar was full so service was a little slow and there was an Irish dane competition in the ball room for 10,000 little girls, which added to the charm.",5,2017,05,01
250,Overnight stay,Stayed for there for one night as we were going to a concert at 3Arena.  Good spot and nice hotel. Suited our needs. We had a family room as such with 2 double beds for the 4 of us. The rooms were a bit tight on space but with two doubles in it I expect this. Good facilities and we had dinner in the bar before going out.  This was pleseant and we all enjoyed this.  Nice hotel and would use again for this type of trip.,4,2017,04,29
250,Oasis After Flight,"We were a little early for check here, however the staff were only too happy to see us to our room after having spent over 17 hours travelling from Singapore the day before. Great rooms and facilities. Friendly bar and wait staff. Meals in both the restaurant and the bar were substantial and well priced. We will be back here in 4 days to stay before venturing to London.",5,2017,04,29
250,Not what it used to be...,"We've stayed here many times over the years but not for the past couple of years. 

We encountered problems at check-in which meant us hanging around for half an hour and then  the heating in our room was difficult to get set up so the room was cold. 

Food in the bar was poor - particularly the awful club sandwich.

Overall not the best experience but rescued by Daniel the manager who comped us 2 bottles of wine. 

Probably won't be back as it's not worth the high room cost for this level of service when competitors do a better job.",2,2017,04,27
250,yet another show,first trade show of the year   as per usual fantastic service by every single member of staff from the moment we set foot on the bus to get to the hotel till we leave    nothing is too much trouble   even down to having something different to eat   we use this hotel on a regular basis  for the last ten years   perfect hotel  very clean  great staff great management   cannot thank them enough  too many people to mention but   beth   stefan  jon  paul just to name a few,5,2017,04,26
250,Excellent service at restaurant!,We visit the hotel specifically for the restaurant since it was recommended and it was a perfect choice!  Our waiter Lionel was excellent and served us like royalty. The price was very reasonable and the food was perfect!,5,2017,04,26
250,Good stay,I have stayed here a couple of times on business. Rooms are very nice and restaurant and bar is good. The bar serves nice food and drinks and live football is shown. Free wifi all over. There is a free shuttle bus from this hotel to take you to Dublin Airport. ,5,2017,04,24
250,Pros and cons make for an average experience.,"Lovely room with a comfortable bed and nice toiletries.
The TV remote was annoyingly difficult to operate.
The staff are generally friendly.
The breakfast is good but my table wasn't clean when presented to me.
There is a shuttle bus with a very friendly driver BUT NOTE the shuttle bus is a FULL SIZE YELLOW bus and not a branded hotel mini bus (as operated by many of the more upmarket hotels). You need to stand on the side pavement & bus parking area at bus park 16 and not at the central bus stop.",3,2017,04,24
250,Nail 1980,It is always a treat to stay at the Crowne Plaza  Dublin Airport . The staff is professional and responsive.  The Long Service is Perfekt I don't forget Edit she is very lovely girl help full very good English speaking 10/10  The rooms and housekeeping services are great. The location is very convenient. I'm  regular guests and look forward to our next stay.,5,2017,04,23
250,Ray Anderson ,We arrived at the hotel and were greeted at the front desk and assisted with our luggage. The desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We returned to the lobby for dinner at one of their two restaurants. We were seated immediately and waited on by one of the most delightful people we have met. Her name is Ashleig and she was super friendly and made us feel most comfortable. The food was delicious and the service impeccable. We definitely would return and highly recommend this hotel and restaurant.,5,2017,04,22
250,Friendly staff and comfortable accommodations,"My Airbnb fell through and I was lucky this hotel was a few minutes walk away. As soon as I arrived, I was greeted warmly and promptly given a room for a fair price thanks to Anthony at the front desk. The room was clean and comfortable along with having both a separate shower and bath. There is also a lovely park across the street that I went for a walk in. I had dinner there and they had a variety of items to choose from along with very friendly service. I asked if there was somewhere I could get bath salts and was informed by Daniel Ivan that there was a shop within walking distance. Before I finished my meal, Daniel put two boxes of bath salts in front of me. I was floored. He said he had an extra 30 minutes and they like to go out of their way to do things for guests. I really enjoyed the bath after 10 days of trekking around Ireland. If you are looking for a hotel close to the Dublin airport that has a complementary shuttle, delicious breakfast  (including hot food), and friendly staff, I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,04,22
250,Great venue for catching up with family/friends ,Myself and some old school friends meet up to catch up for a long overdue drink and chat and the bar in this hotel was the perfect venue I would highly recommend it for family gatherings or anyone looking for a place to relax and catch up over a few beers... A special shout out to our barman John he was so friendly and welcoming and made our visit to the Crowne Plaza a great night,5,2017,04,22
250,One night Stay,"We stayed in the Crowne Plaza a few times and we like it. Its near the shops and amenities but close enough to the airport, serviced with shuttle buses. The room was pleasant, clean and comfortable. Food was very good and the bar had a nice relaxing 
no rushed feel to it. Staff very attentive and we will return.",5,2017,04,22
250,Friendly staff,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza so that we could easily get to the airport the next morning.  The hotel was nice; the room was clean and quiet, and the hotel was convenient to the airport.  The biggest reason for my 5 star review though was the friendliness of the staff from the front desk clerk to all the wait staff.  They all were courteous and willing to answer your questions or concerns.  The hotel had a very welcoming feel.",5,2017,04,20
250,"Nice hotel, very convenient to the airport","We stayed at this hotel the night before a very early flights out of Dublin Airport. We used the hotel's free shuttle to get to the airport. 

We had a late dinner in the pub and enjoyed our meal. There was a bit of international flair on the menu: my companion had a vegetarian Moroccan stew and I had an Asian noodle dish. Both were tasty. Surprisingly no cider on tap, but we were able to get bottles.

Our room was very comfortable. The wifi worked well and the staff we met were friendly. I would stay here again if I need to be close to the airport.",5,2017,04,19
250,"A nice base, but probably best for conferences or before travelling from the airport","Last year we were lucky enough to win a voucher for 2 nights B and B with one dinner in the hotel.  We used it in March and arranged a few appointments in Dublin, making a mini break of it.  The room was again lovely, very comfortable beds and breakfast was great.  The dinner was nice, but I thought there could have been a better choice on the Set menu, which was the dinner included in our prize.

Our booking was handled awkwardly at first, in that I had booked the room and then mentioned that I had a voucher.  There appeared to be some confusion as to what exactly the voucher covered.  However it was sorted eventually and they honoured the voucher in full.

The hotel is not as far out as you think from the City Centre but it still means taxis everywhere.  Santry Park is just outside the door and is a pleasant walk after a day of meetings",4,2017,04,18
250,Thank you Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport!,We have visited Crowne Plaza a few times over the past few years and found the hotel and staff very helpful. Olga at the reception desk took care of our booking and made sure everything was in place to make our stay more enjoyable. Thank you Olga! Great atmosphere and excellent hotel and room facilities. Best so far! x,5,2017,04,18
250,Great experience,"Drove up from Kerry to a a family function on Saturday and the place was fantastic, the barman Eanna at prosecco stand was very friendly. Hope to be back soon. Drink prices are the only questionable thing about the Crowne Plaza.",5,2017,04,18
250,Very pleasant stay,"The room was very clean, always stocked, a delicious breakfast with lots of choice and most importantly, all the staff served you with a smile no matter how busy they were. However there are a few staff members who deserve a special mention: Daniel Ivan, Vartic Jon, Michelle Maria, Justine and Chris ( bar).
The free shuttle bus is really an added bonus as we didn't have to worry about where to go on arrival with all our luggage.
",5,2017,04,18
250,Great experience and great service at the Bar,"Our waitress Anna was excellent. She gave wonderful recommendations, and was personable and the right amount of chatty with giving us space throughout the meal.  She saved us from ordering a really expensive whisky and recommended great desserts.  I loved the ice cream and my wife the Tolberone cheesecake.  She made the experience worthy of 5 stars.  

The hotel itself lives up to the service from Anna.  The beds are soft and warm.  The bathrooms have tubs and showers, are spacious and inviting.

This is a great place to start or end your trip in Ireland.",5,2017,04,13
250,Hotel bar,"The Crowne Plaza at Northwood Park has a fabulous bar with friendly staff , live sport , great food and drink. Main barman John Kennedy is fantastic and always keeps your glass full. The place always has a great atmosphere.",5,2017,04,12
250,Good dinner. Great service. ,"I visited the Crowne Plaza for an event some time ago. When I arrived, the atmosphere was lovely, and the ballroom well set up. I was served by a young gentleman by the name of Ivan, who was very accommodating. I asked for a gluten free menu, but instead he went through everything on the menu and told me exactly what was suitable. The meal was very enjoyable - the only complaint I have is that I didn't have more! I can't stress enough how obliging the staff were. I had a very pleasant experience and I'm looking forward to visiting again! ",5,2017,04,12
250,Dinner,"Myself and my husband had dinner in the lobby on Saturday.  Dinner was really lovely and the hotel had a lovely atmosphere our waitress Anna was very nice and helpfully. We will definitely be back.  

Rachel. ",5,2017,04,10
250,Lost Nd found - amazing!,"Stayed in Crowne plaza santry last weekend , left my iPhone charger in room, rang hotel nd they had found it, posted it back to me complimentary 😊 Absolutely amazing hotel to stay in and fantastic after sales service ! Delighted !   Cork customer who will return !",5,2017,04,09
250,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here while at a forum with with last week. 

Beautiful hotel - lovely area with Santry Demesne and Northwood Park straight across the road. The room was amazing, so comfortable, cosy, comfy bed and lovely bathroom too - a home away from home.

Really good selection for breakfast. Very pleasant staff, always happy to help. As far as work goes, the conference facilities were all really good too.",5,2017,04,09
250,Brilliant service!!!!,"Edit was brilliant she was very welcoming and mannerly she was a great host.
Definitely we will be back again.
Super hotel.my visit was great but at the end edit made it such a great host thank you edit 
5*****

Thank you!",5,2017,04,09
250,Very comfortable and conveinent,"Have stayed here a few times and never disappointed. Rooms nicely decorated, very clean and comfortable.Bathrroms sparkling clean. Staff very friendly. We have family living close by so have not availed of the restaurant facilities
I'm disabled and was able to park right outside front door.",5,2017,04,07
250,Outstanding!,"I'm not typically a Crowne Plaza customer, but will absolutely come back to this hotel for future business. Room is comfortable and quiet, location is convenient to the airport with a nice park across the street, but best of all is the care and service from ALL the staff...especially in the lounge! Thank you for taking such good care of me, Edit, and for ensuring my gluten issues were accommodated.",5,2017,04,04
250,John F Kennedy in the Hotel Bar,"You must stop in and say hello to John in the bar. He is a great person to talk with. He is the best .
The hotel is nice the rooms are nice. Close to the airport for sure. You can get a taxi to downtown Dublin Ireland for around $20.00. But make sure you say hello to John F Kennedy.",4,2017,04,03
250,Good choice for airport,"Stayed one night in executive room while in transit. Check in friendly and efficient, room modern and welcoming. Had a drink in the bar, buzzing for an airport hotel which gave it a nice feel. Went up to executive lounge, unusually this was very quiet and appeared more businessmen than holiday makers, no other couples. The nibbles were varied and of good quality. Drinks were wine and beer along with soft drinks. Breakfast in the morning was just a cold spread, but adequate, we could of eaten in the restaurant for an extra 5 Euros. Would recommend hotel.",5,2017,04,03
250,Farewell Irrland,What a wonderful place to stay our last night in Ireland. Close to the airport with excellent beds and service. Dinner at the Restaurant served by Anna was simply delicious. Anna took our picture and enjoyed our KinderEggs. Amazing staff.🇮🇪💚🍀💙🇮🇪,5,2017,04,02
250,Rugby weekend,"Another wonderful Rugby weekend in Dublin watching that fantastic Irish display against the English.
Stay d again in the Crowne Plaza by Dublin Airport- yet again a wonderful experience- the staff are just so welcoming and friendly with that renowned Irish hospitality 
Must mention Liam on Front Desk as he is just the best - nothing is too much trouble and goes out of his way to help
Less than 10 mins from the Airport and the Hotel run a courtesy bus service
Taxi to City Centre is 20Euros and takes 15 minutes or take a bus from immediately outside the Hotel for 2.70 Euro (must have exact money)

Great breakfast and reasonably priced drinks - night porter available also - a must for late night rugby fans!
I have no hesitation in recommending this great Hotel
Many thanks",5,2017,04,02
250,Satisfied,"My husband and I stayed here during our 10 day trip in Dublin.  The staff overall was very friendly - especially the evening staff.  Elizabeth at the front desk was very helpful with helping us book multiple taxis for tours we had scheduled throughout our visit.  The breakfast buffet was delicious!  We signed up to get the discounted rate for breakfast ($10 per person), but we did not eat every morning (some tours we needed to leave before the restaurant was even open).  So honestly did not get a great deal since we were charged for 9 days, but only at breakfast 4 times. I would not recommend taking the deal unless you know you will be able to make the breakfast all the days you are there. Anna at the Cinnabar was very quick with serving our food during one of the nights we ate there.  Room Service was quick as well and had large servings. Having the free shuttle to the airport was very helpful as well.

The room was decent.  The shower did not work properly - seemed like the drain was clogged. They have complimentary water bottles on one of the tables in the room daily - on returning from town one day, one of the bottles was already opened and had obviously been drank from, so we ended up just tossing the bottle. Wasn't too big of a deal for me since we purchased our own beverages out in town.

Overall I was satisfied with our stay with the few exceptions.  But I wouldn't mind staying here again as long as I'm in a room with a drain that works.",3,2017,04,01
250,Great rooms but ....,"Stayed in this hotel on route to outbound fleet got to USA.

The positive:

Parking is good and at 6€ per night good value
Room design and bed comfort 
Bathrooms bar blocked shower drain

The negative:

Noisy bar where everything is sticky - not nice

Overall good option if you are heading to the airport ",4,2017,04,01
250,Meetings at dcu,"I needed a hotel close to the airport and the university. The Crown plaza came highly recommended and didn't disappoint. Nice spacious rooms with lots of little extras like aromatherapy to sleep beter and a small chocolate from the cleaners. The breakfast was amazing from full English to continental and every was delicious. If I have to complain then would it be the view from the window that was nothing. O take the bus to the city it is cheap, fast and stops close to the hotel. ",4,2017,03,31
250,Satisfied ,"Staff was very warm and helpful. Special Mention to Olga and Lana for their awesome service. Liked the chocolate gift box in the room.
Room is big and nice.
Lake and walking track around the hotel is awesome. 
",4,2017,03,31
250,Great place to stay on arrival or departure,"We have stayed here twice and will be returning this summer.  This is a great place to stay upon arrival or departure.  Close to the airport, comfy beds and friendly staff.  Restaurant went above and beyond for this weary traveler with food allergies. Highly recommend.",5,2017,03,30
250,Good hotel made better by excellent staff,"Stayed for Rugby which coincided with St Patrick's weekend.
Hotels in Dublin priced them out of the market so booked out of town.
What a it of luck could have not worked better.Usual high standard associated with Crowne Plaza brand.Fantastic staff took this to an higher level.It seems churlish to name names as they were all so good.However I can't help mention Jon and Daniel whose help made our holiday.
Took bus into Dublin 20 mins €2-65 Free bus to airport 10 mins",5,2017,03,29
250,Lovely food,"Spectacular views overlooking Santry Park,this is ideal if you want to be near the city,but not stuck in the hustle and bustle.
Also,right beside Dublin Airport with a shuttle bus.
The food is lovely,and well advised to try.
Highly recommended.",5,2017,03,29
250,Short stay ,"Lovely hotel great decor and will definitely be booking it again ,olga at reception was very friendly and helpful for the night we had stayed ,breakfast was beautiful large selection available especially the honeycomb which was delish :)
Niall ",5,2017,03,28
250,30 minutes for a Tea and a Diet Coke,"I don't often complain, but myself and some friends were at the BVPS function in the hotel we took a break to get a quick drink as we needed to be back by 2:30 after waiting at the table for 10 min we went up to the bar and stood their for a further 10 minutes until we finally got the attention of a member of staff who took half our order and then ran away leaving me fighting to get his attention. After 10 minutes I saw our drinks on the bar and 20 minutes later their was no sign of them being brought over. We eventually decided there was no way we were spending our money on disinterested staff, cold tea and flat coke. We upped and left and informed a member of staff on the way out why. He looked at us and said ye okay not even an apology. Worst experience I've ever had in a hotel bar!  ",1,2017,03,28
250,Typical Crowne Plaza Experience,"We spent a night at the Crowne Plaza, and the stay was exactly what I would expect from this hotel franchise. You get a 4-star, American style hotel with large rooms, good beds and linen, and a large bathroom. The breakfast is good, and the hotel offers all of the typical amenities. It is a 20€ ride into the heart of Dublin, so while this hotel appears most often used for business or as a starting place for tours, it might be a good option if you want a hotel that you know will feature all of the comforts and amenities of an American 4-star hotel.",4,2017,03,26
250,Excellent Staff,"I chose this Hotel because of the location to Dublin airport and I have stayed in Crown Plaza Hotels before and I found them to be very good. I arrived flustered as my flight was delayed and I was greeted on Reception by Olga who had a beaming smile and was So helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for her. The bar was packed so I decided to order room service and it arrived to my room very quickly by Krisztina, who was absolutely delightful, friendly and professional . The staff in this hotel are fantastic and a credit to the Hotel. I shall be back ! ",5,2017,03,26
250,Lovely rooms,"Hotel is located conveniently for the airport and there is a local bus service to the city centre. Hotel is well presented, decor is smart & chic...bedrooms are designed beautifully..very tastefully decorated...big bathroom. There was a fridge in the room that contained mini bar produce, I asked for it to be unlocked & cleared out so I could use it to store mineral water. Unfortunately nobody arrived to do this...nonetheless it would not put me off this place. Bar food is tasty & there's a good selection. Bar Staff are friendly. Room rate is reasonable too. Great place to stay for a one or two night stay. ",5,2017,03,24
250,Fabulous hotel and service,"I never had to ask for anything, all was laid on, great staff, lovely hotel, great room, lovely addition of reception room on our floor for teas or coffees or appetisers.  Staff very obliging.  Only issue was ""bubble effect"" shelves in bathroom as your things could not stand on the shelf, minor issue.",5,2017,03,23
250,Amazing costumer service by Daniel Ivan ,"Lovely evening time with friends reunion after while. We were served by very friendly and professional men Daniel Ivan. He has excellent customer service and he's very chatty person. I really enjoyed that night and it was great night out in that place. I recommend Crown Plaza Hotel - club bar! 
Enjoy every one!!!  👍🍀😊🍸",5,2017,03,21
250,Excellent service from Daniel,We have chosen Crowne Plaza for a reunion with some friends. Our server Daniel was a gentleman. Looked after my friends really well. Advised on delicious food and great choice of beers. We were all very happy and felt welcomed. Definitely will visit Crowne Plaza again!!!,5,2017,03,21
250,daniel was more than excellent very pleasing waiter ,"we had great time and the waiters very nice and friendly, we could enjoy our time and i can greatly recommend. 
it was time well spent in nice place which wasn't too crowded and i could have nice conversation with friends. ",5,2017,03,21
250,Cannot Fault This Hotel,"spent 2 nights either side of a few days away to visit family in England. Once again, this hotel doesn't fail to impress. Professional staff from check in to food service to bar service, this hotel cannot really be faulted. Made to feel welcomeat all stages of our stay and parking is cheap compared to other parking areas. Well done and keep up the good work, we will definately be using this hotel for our pre flight stay overs",5,2017,03,21
250,Casual And Convenient Lunch with Drinks,"We called in looking for some lunch and very surprised to find a vibrant bar and eatery. Great service provided by Anna who was cheerful, friendly and helpful. We would recommend to anyone in the area especially if you are looking for a nice afternoon and have a plane to catch the next day. Thank you",5,2017,03,19
250,Great food and service!,"We stayed at the Crown Plaza Hotel during St. Patrick's Day weekend. We wanted to find a great place to eat near the hotel and found it IN the hotel! Thursday night we ate dinner and were speedily and happily served by Ashleigh. She was very accommodating and friendly! We came back Friday night and ended up with Anna as our server. Even though it was quite busy, she didn't disappoint. We got our food, drinks, and desserts and were very pleased once again. Thanks, Ladies, for working hard for us!",5,2017,03,17
250,Excellent Business Hotel,"When you fly in for business all you want is a great room, nice food, good wifi and friendly efficient staff. This is it, when travelling into Dublin Airport. Enough said although I wish the courtesy bus was more frequent, but hey jump a cab its only €10.00.

This hotel is a very high standard and always delivers whenever I stay.",5,2017,03,16
250,Weekend Break,"We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. we had dinner in the dining room one evening and in the bar the next, both menus are very good and the staff in both certainly make sure that you are exceptionally well looked after. We had a small issue of noise from the adjoining room on the first night, this was dealt with swiftly and when we returned to our room the next evening their was a very nice gift left there for us. From the management to the housekeeping exceptional staff and just a great place to stay.",5,2017,03,15
250,TOP CLASS,"What a place ,lovely staff it was like a home from home.I had to stay near hospital as a good friend of mine was during so I had to be near.I just looked around and found this hotel,I did not tell staff why I was staying and they did not ask but they kind of new something was up.they went out of there way to help me find shops and local places around the area .there kindness was great ,the hotel was very well run, clean ,warm.I had to stay on a day to day basis as I was not sure when my friend would pass but that was no problem for hotel and as I said they did not no why I was staying.at the end of my stay the hotel gave me a special rate for my stay which was so good of them to do that.I will return again and again for there kindness to me.",5,2017,03,13
250,Great Airport Hotel,"I stayed here one night before my flight back to the US.  The hotel is really nice.  I was very surprised.  The room is large, very clean, and modern.  It was nicely appointed and the bed was super comfortable.  The bathroom is large and clean with a great shower.  I ordered room service and the food was excellent.  I had a Greek salad and Jerk Chicken and the the room service person and the chef were very patient with my food questions due to food allergies.  I got a wake-up call (doesn't always happen) and took the shuttle to the airport.  Great stay.  Shout out to Anthony on the front desk for his enthusiastic and very helpful check-in service yesterday.

My only complaint and this has nothing to do with the hotel is that the people in the room across from me were unbelievably noisy...like screaming at the top of their lungs and shouting pretty much the entire time I stayed there and literally right outside my door.  They were up earlier than me and were still shouting and screaming (I woke up at 730).  If I hadn't unpacked already, I would have requested another room.",5,2017,03,11
250,Food trip,"Me and my family were taking forever to decide on what to eat either in the restaurant or bar food and the lovely waitress (think her name was Anna) was very patient with us, and looked after us very well. We decided for the bar food which still felt like we was in a 5* restaurant. The food was very yummy and portions were massive and made up for the pricing. ",4,2017,03,09
250,Karen and Mark,"John F. Kennedy...best bartender in Dublin!  Thank you John for an enjoyable evening our first evening in Ireland.  He's awesome at what he does.   Make sure to stop in and say ""hi"".   Food was good and enjoyable atmosphere. ",5,2017,03,08
250,Great Service and comfortable rooms,"Overlooking Santry's Demense Park, I stayed at the Crown Plaza Dublin Airport for a training course for a couple of days in January. The shuttle picked me up from the airport and delivered me to the door.

The rooms are large, comfortable and had all the amenities I need including free wifi as part of my stay. I dined in the restaurant for breakfast and lunch. The food was really good, varied and always prompt. Colin in the restaurant made sure all our needs were catered for and I was very impressed with the attentive and friendly Irish service throughout.  

Make sure you try the natural honeycomb at breakfast. Unbelievable on porridge.",4,2017,03,06
250,Great service!,We are staying at the Holiday Inn Express next door and dined in the Crowne Plaza restaurant tonight. Excellent meal and even better service with Edit as our waitress. She was very welcoming and we enjoyed our conversation with her! ,5,2017,03,05
250,Dinner,We had a lovely waitstaff named Iwona. She was delightful and helpful with our needs. Food was good and very prompt. Nice for two weary travelers needy a little comfort food and a friendly smile! The atmosphere was lively for a Sunday night yet not too obtrusive.,4,2017,03,05
250,A warm Irish welcome,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza a while back and had a great stay. The rooms are comfortable and had a great night sleep. I went to the bar and was unsure what to drink. Knowing I wanted to try something local I asked John the bartender who with out hesitation got some samples lined up for me giving his own recommendation along with asking what I normally drink and giving his opinion on what I may like. I have to say it was an enjoyable experience with him and he also recommended some great spots to visit around the city. Not to take away from the rest of the hotel it was an all round great stay from check in to check out I felt comfortable and relaxed. Thank you Crowne Plaza. ,5,2017,03,04
250,Very impressive hotel,"This was our 4th stay in this hotel and we were not disappointed. The staff are excellent, food quality and service is outstanding and the rooms are fantastic. We would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Dublin. It is within easy reach of the airport and regular airport shuttle if needed.",5,2017,03,01
250,Lovely restaurant and excellent service,"While at Dublin for a couple of days, we had dined at the Crowne Plaza Dublin. The food was really good and prompt. However what we were more impressed about was the prompt service and always with a friendly helpful attitude. The team members Lionel, Justin and Milisav were amazing service staff managing a pretty big restaurant without missing out on any guest.",4,2017,03,01
250,American Style Hotel,"Just finished touring Dublin, Glasgow and Edinburgh.  This was our last night stay, as the airport is nearby.  It's the closest thing to an American style hotel room that we encountered.  

This is mostly a hotel for business travelers/airline employees as there isn't much in the immediate area, apart from the airport.  You could literally drop this in the middle of anywhere.  The restaurant was Asian fusion and quite good.  It's also possible to get a room for a reasonable sum on the weekend.  It was perfect for a place to sleep the night before an early departure, though you wouldn't want to base your vacation out of here because of the location.

Free shuttle runs to the airport every 20 minutes most times.",4,2017,02,25
250,Preconceived Notions... ,"I don't like hotels like this. The middle ground, slightly glitzy, unremarkable approach isn't for me. Though at times necessary because of cost or availability

Yet...

I missed the point. Staying in a bad version of this hotel type last night, Clayton Belfast's, made me appreciate that Crowned Plaza, mostly,  does it very well.

1. Lovely staff,
2. Clean and modern,
3. Basics like sockets, toiletries etc are done well,
4. Bar staff excellent and good food,
5. A room which felt luxurious and well maintained,
6. ..........

Ok, the décor tries too hard, with glitzy furniture, and numerous styles thrown together in the bedroom; to 'meh' effect, but 'tis what 'tis.

Thanks.

250,Really nice evening atmosphere and great cocktails too!,"Had dinner in here yesterday with my mother before dropping her to the airport, really nice and relaxed atmosphere. I had a curry and she had Singapore noodles which she really enjoyed. Staff were great, and I was recommended a lovely Amaretto Sour by one of the managers Oliver which I enjoyed so much I had three! I would recommend for sure. Didn't stay in the hotel, but it looked lovely. Huge fishtank in the reception which I loved. Will pop in again.",5,2017,02,23
250,Welcoming ,"I arrived here a few weeks ago after spending an afternoon shopping in the city. I was waiting on my husband who was near by on business to come and pick me up from the crowne plaza and decided to have a light dinner while I waited. I was served by Aishling in the bar and she was a pleasure to have around. Very informative and ensured I enjoyed my visit. It was my first time in the hotel, but I do hope to get back in the very near future. Keep it up! ",5,2017,02,18
250,Great bar food and staff!,"Stayed several nights while on vacation. The food was great and the server Anna was amazing!  She like most people throughout Ireland was so kind, informative and so pleasant to just talk to. Highly recommended this hotel and bar.",5,2017,02,17
250,Great Stay,The barman John F Kennedy was brilliant and gave us the benefit of his local knowledge. Indeed all the staff were great and made our stay. Breakfast was wonderful too. We definitely recommend this hotel to fellow travellers.,5,2017,02,15
250,Had dinner in the hotel with a colleague,"The food was excellent: well-prepared, pleasantly presented and beautifully served. We also had a bottle of wine at a reasonable price, for a hotel (a significant markup on a shop purchase, but it's worth paying a premium for the atmosphere), making for a a memorable dinner.

We were looked after by the maitre d', Colin, who went far beyond the call of duty in his warmth and helpfulness to us. Really commendable service, ably supported by the waiter from his team who also served.

I only wish we'd opted to stay in the hotel, and certainly will next time we're here.",5,2017,02,14
250,Beautiful hotel,We stayed as a group of 4 girls for 2 nights. The hotel staff were incredibly helpful and the hotel was spotless and far nicer then some of the over priced hotels in the centre. We had two large comfy double beds and the room had a large bathroom with a seperate shower and bath. Before booking this hotel we were slightly concerned about how far we were from the centre... however once we arrived we realised this was no issue. Dublins public transport is great and it took no more than 20min on the bus. The free shuttle to the airport was a big help too!! I defiantly will stay here again next time. Can't wait to come back!! Thanks Crownplaza you were brilliant!,5,2017,02,13
250,Very Impressed,"My wife and I stayed 1 night recently for business and we were both very impressed with the overall experience.  Room was big and very well appointed. Bathroom had both separate bath and shower. Wifi very strong throughout the hotel. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Bar food was well presented and very tasty. Parking in hotel car park was easy and at no extra cost.
Breakfast was excellent and had a large selection of cold and hot food. The natural honey comb is not something you see too often for breakfast in hotels adjacent to airports. However, if you are a coffee lover, take the tea.
Will use again for airport access, business meetings or show in Dublin. Note the hotel is not in city centre and taxi would be required.",4,2017,02,13
250,Overnight Stay,"Staff were friendly and the room was amazing will definitely return!Breakfast buffet was perfect the next morning, we left the hotel on full stomachs. Relaxing stay to say the least. Only downfall was it was New Years and some people were rowdy on return at 6 in the morning however things like that can't be helped.",5,2017,02,13
250,Birthday celebrations ,On arriving at hotel we were made so welcome by the duty manager Daniel who when asking about our stay (my birthday ) upgraded us to executive suite and personally arrived at the room with a ice bucket with bottle of   presseco strawberries and chocolates and a lovely card from all the team saying happy birthday I honestly felt overwhelmed the whole team of staff are defo amazing couldn't do enough for you and the hotel itself was gorjus defo recommend it and as it was our first time here in dublin and this hotel I defo no it won't be our last thanks so much Daniel u do an amazing job ☘☘👌👌,5,2017,02,12
250,lunch with friends,"had lunch with my two   friends our server was Anna who makes the best calypso coffee in dublin,very pleasant girl , curry was tasty as always will definitely be back again here for lunch again! thanks again",5,2017,02,12
250,Good overnighter,Stayed overnight as late into airport.  Really comfortable room on the club floor with complimentary breakfast in the club lounge.  Will definitely stay again in the future if looking for a hotel near the airport.,5,2017,02,11
250,Great hotel,"Rooms excellent, staff very helpful facilities are great only down side you struggle with draw space but I have been here twice and throughly enjoy it, it is very convenient for the airport and only a short ride into Dublin 
The bar was buzzing when we arrived on Friday night as the locals pop in for a after work drink ",4,2017,02,11
250,Start of Valentine weekend,"Heading to Amsterdam at silly o'clock on the 10th. As per usual we booked into the Crowne Plaza.  I love the huzzle and buzzle of this hotel.  It has a great atmosphere, reliable food menu and great staff. From initial checkin with Anthony, who went out of his way to help us, the experience was such great quality.  I also have to say Anna in the lobby restaurant was absolutely run off her feet but she managed to control her domain excellently.  I hope the hotel appreciate the quality of their staff.",5,2017,02,09
250,Disappointing stay from start to finish,"This was a very disappointing stay as I have stayed at CP in Blanchardstown on several occasions and found it excellent.

I had prepaid for my room with breakfast.
My First room was room 160. I should have known this wasn't going to be good as there was no sign indicating room 160. The signage showed up to 159, but I found it.

The room is of an excellent standard. Unfortunately there was a noise from outside the room that was quite load. When I reported this, the response was very good and I was offered an upgrade to a newly refurbished room. I accepted and the key cards were delivered to my room. Staff offered to help me with my bags too.

My new room was 447. Really nice again but there is a group of extractor fans outside this window that will again keep you company for the night.

The following morning I had a shower, water went cold, shower door wasn't hung correctly and was difficult to open and close. Good grieve!!!

Nearly there, I then went for breakfast at 8am. Shown to my table and told tea and coffee would come. I had some yogurt and then went for some hot food, placed scrambled egg on plate, no bacon or sausages. Waited and a chef from the kitchen said they would be out soon. After waiting quite a while I decided to sit down, table given to someone else. Directed to another table and told tea or coffee would be brought shortly.

With that I just put my plate down and left, I couldn't take anymore of this comedy of errors.

The staff that handled my initial problem were very good and offered me discount on my meal but all Inwanted was a lovely experience.

Anyway be aware of noisy rooms or head to Blanchardstown.

Really sad after my visit!

",2,2017,02,08
250,Always a pleasure!,Visit here often with work and it is hands down the best hotel we stay at when visiting Dublin with work. Staff always very friendly in particular Olga on the front desk and Jon at the breakfast bit. Room is always clean and tidy. All in all we always have a very pleasant stay! Keep up the good work guys. 👌,5,2017,02,08
250,"Lovely place, great team","Visited for a regulatory conference on business, and decided to stay at the conference venue. 

Very pleasantly surprised at the courtesy bus from the airport and the excellent device from all of the friendly staff. 

Gavin in particular stood out. 

Great breakfast too!",5,2017,02,07
250,Great stay,"Friendly and helpful staff, excellent rooms. Hi-speed broadband on both WiFi and if need be, cabled in the room. Rooms are well furnished and comfortable. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Good value for money.",5,2017,02,06
250,Lovely hotel. Reasonable prices,My wife and I stayed here for one night whilst in Dublin for an engagement party. The hotel and room was absolutely lovely. Clean and comfortable. The breakfast that was on offer in the morning was delicious. The only down side was the service. We arrived down to breakfast and waited a few minutes for somebody to appear. We eventually saw one of the lads on the front desk come over to seat us. The waitress was nowhere to be found. We had to catch the lads eye again just to order tea and coffee. Apart from this small fact everything else was great. ,4,2017,02,05
250,Great As Always... ,"Dear Crown Plaza, 

Home, from staying two weeks in your hotel in Dublin. I stay there always when in Dublin and can't say anything but good things about your hotel. Home away from home for me. 

The staff is some thing that makes your hotel great, from the team on the front desk to Colin whom always makes me feel welcome... Paul in the bar and the team in the restaurant... the lovely lady that makes me coffee in the mornings makes a great start to each day... 

Great rooms, clean, and well maintained... good food and drink in the bar and restaurant... 

Thanks team and see you next time...",5,2017,02,05
250,Great Quick Stay,"We had a very quick visit here but found the hotel very nice and the staff very welcoming. We had a one night reward booking but were still given Club access and breakfast in recognition of my IHG status,which was great.

The room was maybe a bit small but looked like it had been well maintained and at least somewhat recently been updated. They had a separate shower with nice bath amenities as well. The wardrobe space would have been a bit tight for two of us if we had been staying for very long though I think. I also like that Crowne Plaza always has the This Works sleep spray that you can use on the pillows. I find it really does help me relax and get to sleep a bit better.

The Club lounge was a fair size and while breakfast didn't have a huge selection it was enough to get you going in the morning. No hot food options though, which is a bit of a shame.

We were unaware that they had an airport shuttle bus, but they do. It was a pretty quick shuttle ride to the airport and almost as easy as taking a taxi. Only issue we had was how the driver of the shuttle handled dropping off passengers for terminal 2. There were four of us all leaving out of there but the bus stopped in the parking lot and made walk quite a ways to the terminal instead of letting us off by the door like all of the other shuttle buses and like he had done for those going to terminal 1. It didn't pose too much of a problem but was inconsiderate on his part.

The rest of the staff were all very nice so I would still recommend the hotel.",5,2017,02,04
250,Dinner,Mh friend and I went to Crowne plaza for dinner yesterday.Excellent meal in restaurant with suberb service from Andrew the restaurant manager.permanent Presentation and attention to detail first class. Highly recommended ..,5,2017,02,04
250,Bar ,"I had a few drinks in the bar with good service and friendly chat from John. It was an enjoyable evening and would make you want to visit again.  Nice surroundings and I hope to return again and sample the food menu.
",5,2017,01,30
250,Morning coffee,"I arranged to meet a business contact here for a moening coffee meeting a couple of days ago.
The staff are friendly and attentive but not intrusive. It is a nice hotel with a thriving business centre which I used frequently in the past. I think for the quality, care and attention it is time to consider returning.
Nice hotel. Nice atmosphere.",4,2017,01,30
250,Friendly staff,I don't wanna write review about the accommodation services because my review will be long. Just in quick the rooms are comfy and designed in modern style. Just some touches could be worked on like cleaning of the bathroom. But on the positive note I had experience the restaurant in the hotel. I must say very week done to Lionel and Milisav for they great work taking care of us. They uphold a great lever of customer service and Lionel even went the extra mile to speak about the Irish culture. The food was great the prawn dumplings were full of flavour. Our main course was chicken satay. Also very tasty. Please see pictures below.,4,2017,01,29
250,Goid,"A nice cp hotel nearby the airport
Free bus to it
Have re furnish the 4 the executive floor which is now looking very good
The Club lounge refurb look like offering nothing new
Only new furniture and paint
",3,2017,01,28
250,"Not Quite Dublin Airport, But Really Good.","The hotel is located 10/15 min drive from the airport.  It is very well presented with modern comfortable furnishings.  The staff are all welcoming and helpful. Room could not be better, except a tad too warm over night.  Dinner menu was varied and interesting.  Food was good, and breakfast next morning was plentiful and something for everyone.  Our room 306 was well located in quiet area. I would recommend it.",5,2017,01,27
250,Bar food ,Recently visited here for drinks and food before a show in helix.  Great service especially John who was very familiar with menu and made great recommendations.  Food was very good and looking forward to visiting again.,5,2017,01,24
250,Service,"I have to say that the staff here were really first rate(espcially the reception staff) they are always so polite,helpful so friendly, and welcoming, it's a perfect example of how staff should be in a hotel, they've completely nailed it when it comes to service, I was made to feel valued and every person there had a great customer ethos. 

I have been here every week for last 6 months and considering i am away for long periods the service and atmosphere is great.
The room was great, free complimentary biscuits and water. Plenty of space to work and relax, plentiful sockets and pretty much everything you could want here. 
Bathroom also was excellent and large including a shower AND a separate bath with plentiful supply of high class toiletries.

Breakfast was excellent a large range of hot and cold items of perfect quality and freshness. No corners were cut here, no cheap ingredients, just simply first class breakfast food along with service with a smile as always in nice surroundings and a relaxed atmosphere, you couldn't ask for more.",5,2017,01,23
250,Excellent,"I've just stayed here for 4 nights and I would highly recommend it.

With a 5-7 minute drive from the airport, there is a free shuttle bus which you can use, details of which can be found on the hotels website. I have used it a few times and it's very reliable and fairly frequent. Car parking is shared with the hotel next door but I have always found there are plenty of spaces.

Rooms I've have here are of a good quality, clean and comfortable. There is a small gym on the 1st floor which I've used a few times and whilst it's not big there is a selection of free weights, weight machine and some cardio machines.

My main reason for increasing my rating from from previous visit is because of the staff. Every single one of them I've come across cannot be more helpful or friendly. A very rare thing these days. A shout out for Olga on reception and John behind the bar.",5,2017,01,23
250,THE Perfect Example of How it Should be Done!,"I have to say that the staff here were really first rate. So friendly, welcoming and polite, it's a perfect example of how staff should be in a hotel, they've completely nailed it when it comes to service, I was made to feel valued and every person there had a great customer ethos. 

The room was great, free complimentary tea and coffee, biscuits and water. Plenty of space to work and relax, plentiful sockets and pretty much everything you could want here. Good heating system and very comfortable bed. The room looked like it may have just been refurbished. Bathroom also was excellent and large including a shower AND a separate bath with plentiful supply of high class toiletries.

Only issue I had was not long after checking in the hotel suffered a systems outage where all phone/TV/Internet was not working. After inquiring at the front desk I was told a technician was working on it and it would be back soon and sure enough it was.

Breakfast was excellent a large range of hot and cold items of perfect quality and freshness. No corners were cut here, no cheap ingredients, just simply first class breakfast food along with service with a smile as always in nice surroundings and a relaxed atmosphere, you couldn't ask for more.",5,2017,01,22
250,Superior Customer Service,"I live locally and frequently attend the bar located within the Crowne Plaza. I have always been impressed by the quality and service provided. The food is of excellent quality and we have never been disappointed. More recently, we have had the pleasure of having Aishling as our waitress. I cannot commend Aishling's level of professionalism enough. The entire dining experience is made just that little bit more special by the attentiveness of this lady, regardless of how busy the restaurant it the time is made to make sure all is good at your table.  Keep it up Aishling :)",5,2017,01,19
250,Voyage professionnel,"Hello, We remained one night, my grandson and me, with the hotel “Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport on Monday, January 16, 2017.

We will not fail to return for a longer stay… Andre and Florian Duret.",5,2017,01,19
250,Great place to meet up,I didn't stay overnight here but I did use the  reception area for meetings. Great facilities nice food and drink and very helpful and friendly staff. Good free 2 hours parking as well. Very convenient for airport ,5,2017,01,18
250,Superb,"I visited this hotel in early December and it was first class. The lovely Nicole in reservations helped me organise my stay as it was a suprise for my Mother and Nicole could not be more helpful no request was too much!
We stayed in a beautiful newly furnished twin room. The fabric upholstered chairs were extremely comfortable not to mention the beds. The furnishings and little touches really gave a sense of elegant luxury. 
Staff throughout were pleasent and attentive from our server in Cinnabar to the lovely receptionist (unfortunately I don't remember his name, possibly Jenga or something similar, please excuse the terrible attempt of guessing) who checked us out next morning he was very friendly  and offered us a takeaway tea or coffee which was much appreciated as we had to leave before breakfast.
Free shuttle bus to the airport very convenient, leaves right outside the front door.
All in all this is a fantastic hotel and I am already looking forward to my next chance to visit",5,2017,01,16
250,"Very relaxing,felt like home from home","The location of the hotel is great,near the airport and a short bus ride from city.From the time we arrived at reception the experience was excellent.On checking in Beth was most friendly and welcoming as was Paul.
   We then went for lunch and enjoyed and had enjoyed warm efficient service from a waitress named Anna.
 Overall a relly nice stay.",5,2017,01,14
250,Convenient to Airport,"The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport.  It is only about 10 minutes to the airport.  The staff was friendly and the room was comfortable.  There is a restaurant and coffee shop at the hotel.  There is a nice park across the street from the hotel.  We actually took a 20 minute walk to ALDI (grocery store).  There is also a good Italian Restaurant close by.  It was easy to get to the hotel by bus from central Dublin.  Oh, if you need to weigh your luggage the Holiday Inn Express next-door to the Crowne Plaza has a scale but it charges one euro.",4,2017,01,11
250,Great Hotel with Excellent Service,"A really good hotel. Service is excellent, whether at reception or in the restaurant. 
Rooms are of a good size and well furnished. Great extra touches with complimentary water, biscuits and tea/coffee making facilities as well as towling bath robe.
Wifi throughout the hotel complex. 
Good choice of restaurants for lunch/dinner and good selection at breakfast.
Parking available 6euro for 24 hours. Free shuttle to/from Dublin Airport which takes about 5 minutes. 
The best Dublin Airport hotel that I've stayed in.",4,2017,01,03
250,Best wifi ever - very good hotel,"The best wifi I have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world - this is a huge deal for me. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The staff are polite and helpful - would stay again.

The only problem I had was with the hot water. Sometimes there was none! Strange for a hotel of this size!",4,2016,12,29
250,Outstanding Customer Service,"I stayed together with my family in  Crowne Plaza Dubin for 12 nights and it was one of the most enjoyable  stays ever.  Starting with the free shuttle bus collection at Dublin Airport through to the efficient check in by Beth and everday warm greeting by ALL staff we met..Jon and Karoline at Breakfast,  Beth on reception and Marija in housekeeping...apologies for omitting other names..everyone was a delight to deal with   and nothing  was too much trouble.  The atmosphere in the hotel was lovely and warm ...and it was very nicely decorated for Christmas.

The room was spacious and comfortable..we had twin double room...and no complaints at  all. 

Crowne Plaza have done a superb  job getting this team together and have mastered the customer  service experience.  Well  done team and keep it up.

For the  record I have no  association at all with the  Crowne Plaza group but merely like to call out great customer service when on the receiving end of it!",5,2016,12,28
250,Visit the restaurant!,"Excellent service. Very polite and helpful personnel (On the 4th floor we had Martina, Edit, Kristina). 

Don't miss the opportunity to visit the restaurant downstairs. The food is perfect! As well as service.",5,2016,12,27
250,Excellent ,5 stars all the way. From the minute you step in the door the staff make you feel so welcome. The food is gorgeous the rooms are spotless. Unfortunately we were only staying one night as we had to collect someone early the next morning from the airport but I'll definitely be back! ,5,2016,12,26
250,Memorising!!,"Had another fantastic stay at the Crowne plaza, it is always a pleasure staying here. Staff are exceptional. Beth greeted me in reception with a warm smile, her professionalism and kind words really ensured i had a delightful stay. She was so welcoming and made us feel right a home. We went down to the restaurant and had a delicious meal. Could not recommend any higher! Brilliant staff and beautiful grounds around hotel.",5,2016,12,26
250,What a fantastic Hotel and Club Lounge!,"My wife and I stayed  overnight at the Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport on Thursday, 22/12/16. Well, were we impressed! The decor, style and cleanliness all round was first class. Our room was opulent, so comfortable! Only issue we had was that there was no hot water at 05:00.
We visited the Club Lounge. It was fantastic. I stay in hotels on a weekly basis. This one and it's lounge stand tall amongst them all. A very comfortable lounge which catered for the discerning business and holiday traveller. Unlike most UK lounges now which also cater for package holiday makers and with small children, this lounge was peaceful, tranquil and so relaxing. Stephanie was our hostess and what a lovely young lady and splendid representative of the hotel she was. The food available,was excellent.
 Samosas, pakoras and mini barbecued ribs made up the hot selection and were to die for. Small canapes of smoked salmon were on offer in the cold selection and were very good too. Good wines and beers served by the smiling, efficient Stephanie washed it all down.

We had bar food in the Cinnabar restaurant. Excellent fare and reasonably priced.

When we fly from Dublin again it will be the Crowne Plaza for us. A great start to our Christmas/ New Year break in Spain.",5,2016,12,23
250,Stay for Business and vactions,"Excellent service by staff.  Location was good for business requirements but a bit far from city centre for sightseeing ( 40 min bus ride). Staff were very helpful with directions, bus fare ( Dublin transit requires exact change!).  ",5,2016,12,14
250,Excellent service from front Desk,"I would like to thank all the staff at the front desk at the hotel they are superb in their customer relations and client service 
with specific reference to Arijan where he as facilitated both myself and my colleagues with great service, attention to detail and ability to facilitate unexpected changes in accommodation needs !!! 
my sincere thanks to all in Crown Plaza Front Desk",5,2016,12,13
250,"Super Comfortable, Convenient to Airport, Great Staff","I stayed here the other night, which was probably about my 10th stay - which in and of itself says something.  I had a short layover in Dublin and was only at the hotel 7 hours, but it re-affirmed why I keep coming back.  I had made a mistake with my booking, which the staff kindly took care of without any fuss.  My room was obviously recently refurbished and was super comfortable after a long day of work and travel.  I was up early to get the shuttle to the airport, and the cleaning staff overhearing my plans, made an extra effort to make sure I didn't miss it.  The above may seem like small things, but I'll remember them.",5,2016,12,12
250,Very Convenient to airport and nice staff!,"Lovely park across the street from hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful!
Will stay here again.  
Had a small issue with the room, and the hotel staff fixed it immediately.  Nice little bar/lounge.

Transport to airport is easy and leaves frequently.",5,2016,12,10
250,Lovely place,"Loved everything about this place, will deffo visit again It was clean and was very handy for my purpose of visit, staff were great and room was spotless.Staff cant do enough for you,food was amazing 100% recommend.",5,2016,12,10
250,Weekend in Dublin,"Crown Plaza staff are the best, there is always a warm welcome at the front desk. 
The rooms are typical and inviting as always with crown plaza however this hotel at Dublin airport is quite new and a notch up on some of the older in the group. 
Definitely worth a visit if you are near Dublin or going to Dublin airport.",5,2016,12,09
250,EXCEPTIONAL STAFF & SERVICE,"Anna, our waitress, went above and beyond to serve our table of six. She helped with our unique shot order and brought our food quickly and with a smile. The food and drinks were delicious, as well. I highly recommend! ",5,2016,12,09
250,Absolutely phenomenal staff !!,"While I myself didn't stay, my friend was in town for business and was staying here on her birthday. The staff  went above and beyond to assist me with making my friends birthday to be memorable, namely Nicole and especially Kim. After 20 emails exchanged our little surprise went off with out a hitch all thanks to their A+ extremely impressive customer service! I will definitely stay with them the next chance I have.",5,2016,12,08
250,Great service from Anna :),I have been living basically in this hotel for the last 2 weeks. I have had different rooms as I'm never sure where I will be based with work and I can only say this is such a luxurious hotel. I have had food every evening at Cinnabar and only to be served by Anna who is such a pleasant and helpful worker making sure I am happy with my service each evening. She is a credit to the team at the Crowne plaza and I would definitely recommend the cinnabar and hotel as a leisure and work stay to anyone.,5,2016,12,07
250,Stayed here weekly for a year - Excellent service,"Rooms were decent. Not much to complain about and when I did, staff were very quick to get it sorted. Only real issue was that in the Exec rooms, plug sockets are on the opposite side of the room to the bed - not great for charging your phone or using your laptop on the bed.

The staff are definitely the best thing about this hotel. Very friendly throughout my stay - especially Ciara, who worked in the Exec Club and the bar. Didn't have one complaint when I was there. 

I would not hesitate to go back there.",5,2016,12,02
250,"Really modern friendly hotel, a few minutes drive away from the airport","Stayed for just one night, it was quiet, the room/bed very comfortable. The breakfast menu was basic but good quality food. The bar service was good - it closed about 11.15/11.30.

The check out process was quick and there is a regular shuttle to/from the airport",4,2016,11,30
250,Dining in the Cinnibar,"Stayed at The crowne plaza in Santry to go to the 1st National Cross Country Championships to be held in Abbottstown. Dined in the Cinnibar on Saturday night & was served by the loveliest waitress who gave us great attention. Her name was Aishling, from Dingle, & she made our night. She was a breath of fresh air, most efficient & very friendly. The Crowne Plaza are lucky to have her on their staff.",5,2016,11,27
250,Very good experience,"Overall good experience! No remarks what so ever. It is close to the airport and definitely the perfect choice for business travel. Nice modern rooms, good breakfast, good service and free wifi. Maybe a less interesting choice looking at the location for city trips.",4,2016,11,27
250,Convenient to Dublin's busy airport,"Stayed here two nights before flying back to the States. The front desk people are first rate and extremely helpful. My room was quiet, clean, and attractive. Free breakfasts were provided and the quality was good. This hotel is located close to bus service to Dublin's city center. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the airport which can be very busy.",4,2016,11,25
250,Excellent Crowne Plaza - Service Spot on!,"Stayed here for just a single night recently and have to say it's hands down the most complete crowne plaza experience I've had for a while. They recognised status, they gave a choice of reward, they offered help when needed and were just generally 'there' - bar service good - the Guinness especially good and not bad value. Food tasty and not just standard stuff on offer - it actually had flavour and was different!

The room decoration is a bit all over the place - a bit too much going on but otherwise comfy and nice!

Really enjoyed the stay - everything was excellent!",5,2016,11,25
250,A treat before foreign travel!,"Our daughter gave my wife and I a big birthday present of dinner B+B. Superb service (Kim in reservations, first class. Receptionist equal) - and we had a lovely day, evening. Tourists to Ireland please note airport shuttle and great location to visit tge beautiful city of Dublin, only a 30 minute bus journey from the centre.",5,2016,11,23
250,"What a place, what great and friendly staff!!!","I had the pleasure to stay in the Crown Plaza Dublin Airport for a week and was thrilled by the place. In the end it is a standard Crown Plaza...what simply says it is very clean, has a great interior, super bath, nice you can always trust the Crown Plaza brand to be superior, a breakfast that makes you eat too much as it is so delicious (of course i avoid the blood pudding that does not fit my taste buds, but my colleagues simply loved it...so it must be good too, if you like it  :-))! Now what makes this hotel special is the staff, when i checked in close to midnight the front desk team was still in very good mood and it was real fun to check in with one or to hearty laughs. The restaurant staff was very friendly too. But above and beyond all i want to mention Olga personally. As i had to leave at 4 a.m. i asked for a take away breakfast with a smoothy and and granola bar. As the hotel ran out of it she drove to a store (what i would have never asked for!!!) to get me what i asked for. This is what a computer company calls 'fanatical customer care' in its most positive way. So i want to thank CP for a great stay, and Olga for a great breakfast in the car, airport and on the plane!!!  I will be back!",5,2016,11,22
250,Great hotel with airport shuttle and lounge ,"Stayed here for one night before a loooooooong flight to Honolulu. Hotel had good restaurant on site with fast service and decent prices. 

Check in was fast

Lounge was decent size

Room was clean and spacious

Airport shuttle ran efficiently though the signs could be improved.

",5,2016,11,21
250,Bar Food,"We flew into Dublin, checked into the hotel and realized we hadn't eaten since early that morning!  We rushed over to the restaurant and it was closed.  That is where ANNA rescued us in the Cinnabar in the Hotel next to the restaurant!  We were debating on whether we wanted to wait till the restaurant opened or just eat in the Cinnabar.  Anna sat us down and got a menu from the restaurant and her menu and went over them with us.  We decided to eat with her and she did an amazing job!  She was quick to bring whatever we needed and gave us great information on the menu.  Her recommendations were wonderful.  She also helped us with things we should see while visiting Dublin.  Our food was great and the service thanks to ANNA was even better!  I sure hope that the management of this establishment appreciate the job she is doing.  It made our visit exceptional.  Thank you Anna and thank you Crowne Plaza Hotel.",5,2016,11,19
250,Business,Recently visited for a business lunch.  Nice hotel with a very business feel.  Food and coffee was good with helpful friendly staff..  recommend for business.  Meeting was was very over priced but with good facilities.,4,2016,11,17
250,Very Friendly & Helpful Staff,I met my son here for one night stay as we were going to a concert in Dublin.  We booked a twin room which was ok but my bed was not that sturdy . The staff more than made up for that & were very helpful.  Cant comment on food as we didnt eat there .,4,2016,11,16
250,"clean, good nights sleep","Clean, quiet and nice room. Abit pricey without breakfast- but on par with similar standards. Excellent bus service down to city from top of road. 2.7 euros- or 20 euros by taxi. Had decent room service food one night and taxi to nearby Kealys pub behind the airport- amazing pub food and reasonable too. Room lovely- shower abit tired and difficult to alter temp but minor point really.",4,2016,11,15
250,Lovely staff and a lovely stay ,"Stayed here for two nights in November. The hotel was lovely, as was the room and the staff were exceptional. Olga, behind reception, was lovely and couldn't have done any more to make our stay any better. ",5,2016,11,13
250,Very nice business Hotel,Excellent business Hotel 10 min from the airport. 2min off M50. 2 restaurants. 1 bar. Gym. Free wifi. Good choice of breakfast with fruits juices full irish breakfast. Rooms are spacy and tidy. Bar offers also food and variety of irish draft beers and continental ones.,5,2016,11,08
250,WONDERFUL!,"Staff were so kind! Everyone was kind and thoughtful! Beth at reception, Karolina at the dining area hostess and ALL the staff were friendly and professional.  The room was pleasant and comfortable.  I NEVER heard the planes and we were close to airport.  CLEAN! LOVED the bathtub and shower! Nice bathroom! SUPERB! the conference rooms were nice and everyone lived the gift of hospitality to strangers! THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!",5,2016,11,07
250,"Personal Touch by General Manager, Mr Garret O'Neill made a great difference","I always have problem traveling around Europe as a Muslim especially during breakfast when all the hot meat like sausages and bacon are all pork. It was the same when I arrived in Crowne Plaze Dublin Airport. I requested for some hot meat for breakfast which is not pork but the hotel could not arrange. Then in the morning I asked the chef's assistant but was snubbed.

I decided to write to the GM as his card was left in my room as a welcome gesture which is a great way of showing guests that the hotel cares about us.

It wasn't long before I heard a knock on my door and was pleasantly greeted by the Duty Manager informing me that Mr Garret O'Neill had made the effort of purchasing some Turkey sausages for me and it would cover my next 2 days of breakfast in the hotel. He wasn't able to greet me directly as he was busy for the rest of the evening.

That gesture made me feel great and special. It was more pleasant the next morning when I had my breakfast. I approached the chef and he knew what I wanted and when I was served with my breakfast, the sausages tasted delicious and it really made my day.

Besides this great experience, the room was amazingly clean, kept clean daily by the housekeeping team and the services at the lobby was excellent.

I had a meeting with my boss at the lobby and she was really pleased with the service and the friendly waitress that's always there to provide us with what we needed. She's always smiling and willing to recommend what's good on the menu and was also very fast with providing us with what we ordered.

Although this hotel is not in the heart of the city, it does not matter to me because the service made up for the distance.

Keep it up Crowne.  I'll certainly be back soon.",5,2016,11,07
250,Excellent Hotel,"We just stayed the one night as we where going to a show at the Helix.  Staff at the hotel from the front desk, to bar staff, to restaurant staff, waiters and cleaning staff very friendly and helpful.  Excellent food and service and great atmosphere.The bedroom was spotless and just loved the touch of a spray and roll on stick to help get a good nights sleep and it sure does work.  There is also a beautiful par opposite the hotel for walks. Well done Crowne Plaza.  Will definately recommend this hotel and will be back again for sure.",5,2016,11,06
250,Lovely experience.,"From checking in to leaving, we really enjoyed our stay here.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful at all times.  Food in the restaurant was excellent, as was the service.  We stayed in the executive suite.  The room was very tastefully decorated, immaculately clean, warm and comfortable.  Everything in the room worked perfectly, and felt very well maintained.
I couldn't find any fault during my stay here, and that's a credit to how well the hotel is run and managed.

Overall a lovely experience!  

P.S (I've attached a photo of my favorite part, the chocolate hazelnut brownie😜)",5,2016,11,05
250,Birthday surprise,"The staff are really helpful & pleasant especially Daniel & our waiter in the bar area.
Rooms was very comfortable, as was the bed.
The exec lounge was a big bonus too & much appreciated.
Housekeeping on floor 4 was excellent.
Look forward to returning in the future.
😄",5,2016,11,03
250,Where is my book?,"I left the room to go to the office, when I came back at night, the room was clean. So clean that they even ""cleaned"" my papers and book. They THREW my book. Just incredible.

They told me that they will recover it, but 2 weeks later I have no answer from them. 

First time that I feel unsecure inside the room of a hotel. 

The views of my room was a white wall. Quite interesting.

The breakfast was good and the personal very kind.",1,2016,11,01
250,Your holiday starts here!,"I've stayed here on a few occasions in the past both for business and pleasure and have always been happy with my stay. Most recently my husband and I chose to stay here before an early morning flight and were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Ducati Suite on the club floor. It certainly got our holiday off to a great start! We enjoyed a tasty meal in the restaurant and found all the staff we encountered to be friendly and courteous. We also availed of the 8 night car parking service and shuttle bus to and from the airport which was convenient and efficient. And although we were checking out too early to avail of breakfast I appreciated the opportunity to grab a courtesy coffee-to-go before hopping on the bus. The suite was beautiful, with a very comfortable bed, nice toiletries and quirky themed decor! This is definitely my hotel of choice near the airport! ",5,2016,11,01
250,Enjoyable stay,"Nice hotel  overlooking a park
Big reception area with helpful staff.
Great bar to have a beer in , sky sport channels showing on the tv.
Fantastic selection of food to choose from at breakfast, a lot of it cooked freshly in front of you by the chef.
Nice room with very comfy bed, clean and tidy.
Tea, coffee and condiments provided along with a kettle in the room,
Making for a very nice overnight stay

2. Rooms are lovely and bathroom is very big with with separate shower and Bath.
3. Food is average.
4. Free shuttle bus every 20 minutes. You can pick up the us from airport at bay 16.
5. Bad points, I can't think of any. 
Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,10,31
250,Great relaxing place to stay+,"After 30 hours travelling to Dublin from New Zealand it was a real pleasure to arrive at this hotel and be greeted with friendly, efficient staff. Check in was a breeze and we were in our room within minutes of our arrival. We were pretty exhausted and we relieved to find the room excellent, spacious, clean and a very comfortable bed.  We had dinner in the casual dining area adjacent to the bar that night and the food was very good. Breakfast in the main dining room the next morning was excellent as was the service.  We liked the Crowne Plaza so much, that when we had finished our tour of Ireland over the period of 2 weeks, we booked in again overnight before our departure for England. This time we were upgraded to a suite on the 7th Club floor and were delighted to be told we could avail ourselves of the complimentary drinks and nibbles in the 7th Floor Club lounge. The range of drinks available was great and the ""nibbles"" were very tasty and generous. Complimentary light breakfast was also available in the lounge the next morning. All in all a very enjoyable stay and I would not be surprised if this was the best ""airport"" option in Dublin. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone transiting through Dublin airport.
Rose.",5,2016,10,30
250,Nice bar & service,"We decided to stay near the airport, to catch an early flight. We ate at the bar, and served by Anna. The food was both good and reasonably priced. Our server, Anna, was also great. Highly recommended for a good, low hassle meal before a flight.",5,2016,10,30
250,Conference attendee- international conference on Violence in the Health Sector,"First time to Dublin, wonderful hotel, lovely clean rooms, excellent helpful attentive staff without exception, superb food, I have coeliac disease and there was a great range of glueten free food. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel without any concerns what so ever. Close to the airport and Dublin itself, great courtesy bus service to and from hotel and airport.

I would definitely stay there again and recommend without hesitation, the staff are wonderful and made the stay truly memorable, many thanks",5,2016,10,29
250,Conference attendee-International Conference on Violence in the Health Sector,"The hotel staff were professional and very attentive. Room and corridors are nicely decorated, very clean and well-maintained. Really appreciate the airport shuttle and proximity of hotel to airport. Food at the Asian-fusion hotel restaurant was delightful. A breakfast buffet each morning with many choices.The dinner selections were just as tasty and appealing. The restaurant staff were superb. This evening Chef Jarryl came to my table and engaged in conversation; he crafted a unique and delightful dessert sampling tray for me!  Server Wilisan was highly attentive, ensuring that my dining experience was 100% excellent! I highly recommend the hotel. The people make it a success.",5,2016,10,28
250,Good choice,"We stayed here for one night, arriving a day early for our scheduled tour. Transportation for the airport was a perk, hotel was modern and rooms very comfortable. The breakfast offering was one of the best I have experienced for a hotel, lots of options, freshly made eggs, great presentation. City bus stop just a block from the front door made transportation to the city convenient and inexpensive. Front desk staff very helpful and accommodating.",5,2016,10,28
250,Lovely,"Had a lovely stay here. Great location close to the airport and town. The rooms were spotless and quite modern. Also I found that the staff were very friendly and helpful. Wasn't expensive for what we got.. breakfast wasn't included which was a shame

250,Crowne Plaza-- great place for dinner,I had dinner a few times the hotel and one of the waiters-COLIN LIONEL was very helpful ---the food was excellent and a very nice atmosphere and COLIN made me feel right at home- a very nice place for dinner---,5,2016,10,27
250,Excellent Service,"A very frustrating day of computer incompatibilities, glitches and gaps was smoothed over by the excellent staff that did not wot in making things work! :-) It was all topped off by a visit to the lounge where Anna, our sever made sure we bubbled our writers away. Lovely accommodations as well.",5,2016,10,26
250,Weekend away,"Booked the crowne plaza after our original booking closer to the city had fallen through. Staff and hotel were brilliant, we were very pleased, especially how little we had paid for the room. Although not in the centre of Dublin- which we did want, the bus service at the end of the road had regular busses into the city for only €2.70 made it very accessible. Taxis were €20 one way. ",5,2016,10,26
250,Great staff,"Gavin and his bar staff always extend a warm welcome, front of house is also great, Beth, Olga and the team are as welcoming, always greeted with a smile and nothing is too much trouble, good standard of food for a hotel chain and always feels like a home from home.",5,2016,10,25
250,Lovely Hotel in Beautiful Location in Northwood Park.,"Spent seven nights at Crowne Plaza in September whilst visiting a relative in Cara Care Nursing Home which is also situated in Northwood Park.   Was given a lovely room on the third floor but sadly had problems with the telephone which would cut out without warning for no apparent reason.  As I was receiving two calls a day from London this did prove a bit irritating.  Apparently the phones were new and the fault only happened after about ten minutes into receiving the call. As soon as Olga heard of the problem she immediately transferred me to another room on the same floor which was equally as nice as my original one and I had no further telephone problems.  A 'big thank you' to the lovely Olga who handled the situation so promptly and efficiently - she was a real star.
Really lovely breakfast, with so much choice and excellent staff who made my stay very enjoyable indeed. I have nothing but praise for all the staff I encountered - those on reception, serving in the lounge and restaurant and looking after the rooms so nicely.  Hope to return again before too long.",5,2016,10,24
250,"Convenient, congenial and comfortable","My one night stay here as a lone female on business was in a large, well-appointed double room (not a stingy single) with a spectacularly large bathroom (full bath and separate shower), plenty of plug points, including US and EU ones, good lighting, good towels, extremely good bed, multiple mirrors, iron, trouser press, etc etc and even a sensible TV control system that did not require a degree in electronics to make it work. Food was also good - dinner in the restaurant was delicious and breakfast buffet suitably comprehensive. So why only four stars? Well, maybe I am fussy, but there were irritations. First, the bathroom. Large and lovely, but toiletries were clearly aimed at the stereotype male businessman, who may be admirable, but have a smell I don't wish to copy; and the extensive, freezing tiled floor was crying out for the underfloor heating standard in Germany and Scandinavia. Second, the restaurant. I reserved a table easily within ""early bird"" hours, ordered only from the set menu, yet still had to wait nearly two hours to be fed. This was almost French speed and I had no romantic partner on hand as an excuse. Third, it was not clear that the shuttle from the airport is shared with the next door hotel, and is not clearly named ""Crowne Plaza"" on signage, so I ended up getting a taxi, spending €10 unnecessarily.  And finally, back in my room, a steady thumping from below started to shake the bed at about 9pm. No chance of an early night! The noise and vibration stopped and restarted several times, following a regular pattern as if a massive tennis ball was being hit with force on  the ceiling directly under my bed. Andy Murray practising? Should I resist the need for sleep (it had been along day by then) and rush down in the hope of an autograph?  I eventually called reception. My room was directly above the gym....",4,2016,10,24
250,Best of the Best,"I have visited many hotels around the world but so far this one is the best. There are many things that make it special. First of them is the greenery surrounding the building. Then, of course, there is kind, welcoming, hospitable and helpful personnel. What I also liked is the vicinity of buses that can take you to the city centre very quickly, and they are quite frequent. Tickets are less than €3 and you can pay on the bus. The rooms are beautifully decorated and well equipped with anything you might need, even with the spray for pillow and small inhaler to sleep better. But what I appreciated most was a socket next to my bed. When you see the photo, you will understand. ",5,2016,10,23
250,GREAT PLACE TO STAY NEAR DUBLIN AIRPORT,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport, the night before we were to depart Dublin.  Having stayed at a hotel closer to Dublin airport on arrival, we were not that happy, so opted for the Crowne Plaza even though it was further away.  The distance was not a problem as their courtesy bus provided a great service.  From checkin, when we still had our hire car, to departure the next morning, the service was excellent.  Rooms were clean and beds very comfortable.  We ate at the restaurant inside the hotel that night and were also happy with that service.  It was also better value for money compared to the hotel closer to Dublin Airport.",5,2016,10,23
250,Crowne Plaza,"I have stayed here many times on business trips to Ireland.  Very convenient location, especially since the flight back to the US is early in the morning.  Great staff that recognises me when I return on each trip.  Breakfast buffet is good, but the room service menu is a bit limited.  After staying here one to two weeks at a time and working into the night in my room, a little better variety for in room dinning would be welcome. ",5,2016,10,21
250,Great Service!,"We stayed here the night before our flight out of Dublin, and it was excellent.  The room was great - large, immaculate, king bed.  The club room provided awesome snacks and drinks. The meal at the bar was awesome and our server Iwona was delightful! ",5,2016,10,21
250,Convenient hotel for the airport,"This is a very convenient hotel for the airport - with a free shuttle service and ample parking if you're planning a short trip away. Rooms are inviting and comfortable and there's an excellent breakfast with plenty of choices. But what really makes this hotel is the staff. They are warm, welcoming and all problems are solved in a very short time. As an example I was having a small problem with printing a boarding pass and sought some help from Shauna from their sales department who immediately went to her own computer and printed it out for me. Highly recommend this hotel",4,2016,10,21
250,Convenient location for early flight,"We stayed for one night as we had early flight next morning. Returned our rental car, used hotel shuttle to get from airport to hotel in the evening, and back to airport for our morning flight. Very convenient.   Had decent dinner in hotel restaurnat",5,2016,10,19
250,The very best of everything,"We were booked into the Holiday Inn Express, but we arrived late after our flight and were told the room had gone, so the guy booked us in next door. We weren't sure what to expect as we were very tired and just wanted a bed. What a surprise we had in store, we walked through the door of the Crowne Plaza and were totally stunned by how beautiful and posh the reception was! The reception guy was very helpful and informative, he even offered to fetch someone to take our cases to the room. The room was perfect with a modern decor and a 'designer' touch of class. It was very clean, you'll probably laugh but the thing I noticed most was the 'new' smell of the carpets! Hats off to the cleaners they did a great job. We had a lovely sleep in all the luxury of a king sized bed. After a nice shower in the spacious bathroom we headed downstairs to have some breakfast. We were greeted by a very nice gentleman who ushered us to our seats and informed us about the breakfast, which was delicious. The most amazing sight was a slice of honeycomb dripping honey into a pot, fantastic idea so original. We left the hotel very very happy and slightly stunned by such a wonderful experience. It must be the best hotel we've ever stayed in so far. Thank you to all the staff at Crowne Plaza for making our stay so perfect in every way.",5,2016,10,19
250,Olga ,"We arrived late and tired only to discover that we had booked the wrong Crowne Plaza in Dublin . We had an early flight the next morning and did not have the heart or energy to move to another hotel further away from Dublin Airport . 

Once Olga on reception understood our dilemma she took responsibility upon herself to solve it . The hotel was fully booked so we went to to restaurant for a wonderful meal . 

About an hour later Olga came over to tell us that she was able to arrange a room in the hotel ... a total angle . 

What so impressed us was Olga's total dedication to ensure Crowne Plaza customers have a good experience . 

I hole heartily recommend the Crowne Plaza , Dublin Airport. ",5,2016,10,18
250,Do the right thing by their corporate crowd,"I've just stayed at the Crown Plaza for a training course and have been very impressed. I'm gold/diamond/platinum across a few rewards programmes so I have certain expectations. I won't say that the decor of the rooms is amazing, but the staff are.

From checking in after a delayed flight and being able to sort some room service so simply, to restaurant staff (on following days) checking in unobstrusively to make sure everything is up to standard despite their overworked kitchen (most of their guests would come down to dinner exactly the same time!), it was the people that most impressed me with the Crowne Plaza.

Moreso than anyone, it was Mr. John F. Kennedy, bartender extraordinaire who impressed me most. As an Australian, I'd've been horrified to see all my English colleagues bail from a networking event in the first hour were it not for John's brilliant recommendations for what to see in Ireland, his hilarious observations from life in Ireland and a good stint over in Australia, and just being that physical embodiment of Ireland's traditions and craic and goodwill. I'll gladly be back at the Crowne Plaza",5,2016,10,17
250,Good airport hotel,"We had an early morning flight so decided to stay here for one night.  Getting from the airport to the hotel on the shuttle was not as easy as it should have been.  The shuttle stop at the airport lists all the hotels EXCEPT this one.  Very strange.
Check in was great.  Monika was very helpful.  As an IHG Platinum member, I got access to the lounge.  There wasn't much going on in the evening other than fruits and soft drinks, but the breakfast had some good options.  And the lounge itself was quiet and relaxing.  The room was spacious and the bathroom was big.",4,2016,10,17
250,I'll go back!!!,This was one of the best Hotels I have ever stayed in!!!! Our room was very nice and the hotel staff was amazing!!! Helpful and friendly and they really cared about how we were doing . Garrett we love him!!!!,5,2016,10,17
250,Excellent customer service,"Visited this hotel recently, The hotel itself is very modern and clean and the food is delicious. However the best part of the visit was the staff. Excellent customer service from the two girls working on the night Stephanie and Aishling. Very attentive and polite. Will definitely return",5,2016,10,16
250,Great hotel,"We stayed one night in this clean, quiet, modern hotel before returning our rental car early to Dublin airport and flying to Glasgow the next morning (free parking on site). It was extremely comfortable and also great to not worry about proximity to airport when we had to check in early. The staff were all great, the room and bathroom big, with two large beds. Room service dinner and breakfast in the restaurant were both good. The hotel is opposite a beautiful big park and only a few minutes drive from the airport. The decor is unusual in that it's a bit ""Las Vegas"" - highly colourful - but is a fairly recent refurb. The only thing that bothered me is the room lighting is all side lights and dim. It was a but hard to see for this short-sighted person when you're packing but good for romance! I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,10,16
250,One night stay,Excellent hotel and very nice room. Huge comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Was here for business so a little out of the town but was close for where I needed to be. Would definitely stay here again. Definitely no complaints !! ,5,2016,10,13
250,Excellent Customer Service,We stayed at the Crown Plaza for one week.  The rooms were comfortable and the staff were very friendly and customer service oriented.  They handled our reservations for a few tours seamlessly in the face of a transportation strike that occurred on the last few days of our stay. The location was a block from the bus route which made for a convenient trip into Dublin on the first few days.  The food was also very good.  I would recommend the hotel for business and personal travel.,4,2016,10,12
250,Hotel was clean but service left a lot to be desired.,"Stayed here with colleges in August. The hotel itself was fine but the staff were hit and miss. With the way my company booked I had to  check in on 2 separate nights, the first night was perfect with a lovely girl who dealt with me efficiently. The second night wasn't so with a lady who was quite sharp. 

The dinner service was extremely slow, especially drink orders during the meal. 
The breakfast staff were impeccable with a very nice gentleman on the counter. Breakfast was lovely. 
 
The bar staff were abrasive (all be it after hours). Having said that, table service waiters we very professional.
 
So all in all quite mixed.",3,2016,10,12
250,"Great hotel, amazing Wedding Day","Our dealings started 18 months prior to our wedding in September.  We dealt with Laura, and had lots of contact coming up to the day. She was brilliant at tailoring exactly what we wanted for our guests and our stay.
Our honeymoon suite was so nice we stayed again for a second night, again thanks to Laura for arranging.

The redwood suite looked amazing on the Day, we had it split so a room for dining and moved seemlessly next door for the party afterwards.

From the drinks reception through to the end of the night, everything was handled excellently, thanks to Paul who was there on the day also.

The food served was delicious, Beef and Salmon were the main options and everybody commented on how good and plentiful it was .

All in all this was the perfect venue for our wedding, and would recommend for anybody else looking for a lovely modern venue in Dublin.

Thanks again to Laura and Paul for everything you did to ensure our wedding day was perfect. 
P.S. there is a nice park for photos opposite the hotel.",5,2016,10,12
250,Great Customner service,"The room is lovely at the Crown Plaza, very spacious with a big bed which I love!....The food is delicious and I was served by a very nice and helpful waitress, Anna.
I particularly love the breakfast here. Looking forward to going back.",4,2016,10,11
250,Perfect,"We only stayed one night as we were flying out the next day but if we had had more time in the Dublin area we would definitely have stayed here. The room was clean and well appointed. The room included full breakfast buffet which was good and adequate. And for those who really need it, the wi-fi worked well. As I said we would recommend the Crowne and would book here again if we get the chance to come back to Dublin.",5,2016,10,09
250,Good Hotel great food,Room was clean and spacious. there was a shower and bath.  We had a meal in the restaurant the food was great and the service great.  Good range on offer for breakfast.  Reception staff very helpful and its quite easy to get to the town centre by bus.,5,2016,10,09
250,Great hotel near the aiport and city center.,"We have been to Dublin many times and make this hotel our home base. It has a shuttle service that transports you to and from the airport. There is a parking garage to park a rental car. There is a restraunt in the hotel. The restaurant has allergen ingredients printed on the menu that make it nice for someone like me with food allergies. The hotel is a right down the street from the public bus stop to take you into the city center. You are right across the street from a large park with walking trails and a small pond with swans in it.  The hotel is clean, has modern decor, and comfortable beds in queen and king sizes. We got a suite once that my sons came and hung out in instead of being in their rooms where we all had dinner ordered from the restraunt and relaxed after a long day traveling and it was awesome. My family is always comfortable here.",5,2016,10,08
250,Convenient and Great Hotel,"Really nice hotel and really modern and large. The  free shuttle from the airport was really convenient and runs every 20 minutes. It only took 5 minutes to get to the hotel since there wasn't traffic when we traveled. It was 2,70 pounds to take the bus one way to the city center. It was just a five minute walk to the bus stop and because there was a lot of traffic it took about 35 minutes to get to the center. Going home there was no traffic so it was only 20 minutes to get home.",5,2016,10,08
250,Comfortable and Convenient,"Stayed for 1 night. The room was very comfortable, clean and well maintained. Reception staff were extremely helpful. A free shuttle bus is available to the airport and if you want to go into Dublin town there is a good bus service at the end of the road.
The onsite bar was good and unusually for a hotel, had atmosphere.",4,2016,10,07
250,a satisfying experience,"mostly good things to report here:

1) Olga checked us in, lovely woman, efficient and friendly without being over the top.

2) Double Rooms was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Great connectivity for chargers, room for bags.etc only one bathrobe though :-(

3) We had an early flight the next day and the complimentary tea/coffee station next to the front desk was a nice touch

4) The shuttle service on the morning of departure was efficient, came on time, dropped us at terminal.etc

The not so great:

1) We landed at the airport not having booked the shuttle to pick us up, thinking that if the hotel is called Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport that it would be within walking distance. Not so. And a 10 EUR cab later we arrived. Google maps says they are 5kms from the Dublin Airport Terminal so I think calling themselves an Airport Hotel is a bit cheeky.

2) Restaurant experience was middling. My partner ordered their ""signature dish"" - a Tom Yum soup which ended up being an entree size and the dumpling dish only contained three small dumplings. 10 euros for 3 dumplings. ooft.

3) The decor in the room is a bit flashy - hieroglyphics on the bathroom wall and a cool forest wallpaper behind the bed head - but it's the basics that need an upgrade. The shower looked like it's been there since the 1916 uprising, there was paint peeling off the bathroom roof and the interface on the television looked like it ran on MS DOS. Speaking of which, when you are paying in between 130 and 150 EUR a night, forking out another 10 EUR for movie seems a bit rich.

But aside from small gripes like this, if you need a place (near) the airport it will do the trick.",3,2016,10,05
250,Great Rooms.,"Very helpful staff. We are not world travelers, but the staff have seen to our every need: bus routes, services and the like. Anna serves with a cheerful spirit in the cafe. The All Ireland Match was taking place and the pub crowd was into it in a big way.",5,2016,10,03
250,Good bar food,"We ate in the bar - its nice and relaxed.  Good options for food. We had the Singapore noodles, curry and burgers. 
All of which were nice.  
The bar is laid back and casual. 
Service was good.
Price average for Dublin and its location.  ",4,2016,10,02
250,Weekend stay in Dublin,"airport hotel located located close to the airport but in  quiet business/residential area.
Check in staff very friendly and efficient when I arrived late on Friday night after a long week.
Club floor room was on 4th floor, and included free bottled water /biscuits. (cookies for our US friends !)
Continental breakfast was included in my rate and upgraded to full hot breakfast for €5 which seemed very fair. Breakfast choice was very good.
Free shuttle bus to/form airport every 30 mins",4,2016,10,02
250,Airport choice,"We had an early flight from Dublin Airport and decided to book a room nearby.  After considering many different properties, we selected the Crowne Plaza Hotel at Northwood Park.  Having stayed at several luxury hotels during our European trip, we weren't expecting much from this facility.  We just wanted a quiet, clean place to sleep before flying across the Atlantic the next day.  Gosh, were we pleasantly surprised!!!  From the moment we entered the hotel lobby until we left at 5 am (!!!) the next morning, we were very impressed by the Crowne Plaza and its staff.  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel was very clean and although some of the color choices seemed a bit overwhelming, our room was terrific.  There were pleasant notes everywhere in the room which further cemented the idea that guests were very important people.  We appreciated the free bottles of water and the chocolate chip cookies in our room.  There was even a pants press in the closet.
We asked about the shuttle to the airport and were told that it was always, always on time.  Sure enough that turned out to be totally accurate.  We joined a busload of travelers at our early departure.
We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants but chose instead to take a short walk to Little Venice, an excellent Italian restaurant located on the main road near the hotel.  Check it out!!!
We slept well and awoke refreshed for our long flight.  We'll choose this hotel again if we're flying early from Dublin.",5,2016,09,30
250,Super place to stay,"A very convenient hotel for both the airport and for getting around on the highways away from the city. 

Modern rooms, well equipped . Friendly helpful staff , great breakfast . Wifi was free when i stayed. Easy parking in the nearby multi story building for an extra charge .

There are some shops nearby in the Northwood area. A short walk or a quick drive. 

Will definitely stay here again when I visit Dublin area.",4,2016,09,30
250,Lovely hotel beside a park with airport shuttle bus,"This is a lovely hotel with very helpful staff and spacioua rooms. We have stayed here a number of times and enjoyed the food and service each time. 
The rates are typically cheaper than the hotels located right in the airport grounds but there is a shuttle bus free whi check runs every 20 mins ",5,2016,09,29
250,My treat of the week,Typically stopping in hotels through the week whilst in Ireland this hotel is really the best night I have and look forward to my stay. The rooms are really comfortable and the service and person attention is first class. I often book for the deluxe rooms on the 4th floor which give access to the private lounge in which you get snacks and drinks inclusive as well as a relaxing place to chat or work. Anna is a real gem and looks after everyone making them feel really special. I cannot fault this hotel and the staff which always make me feel at home.,5,2016,09,29
250,Perfect for an early flight would definitely go back for a leisure stay.,"We stayed here only 1 night unfortunately, for our early flight from Dublin Airport. The shuttle service is quite frequent and arrived on time with very friendly drivers. Reception check in was fast with no issues, staff were very friendly. Rooms were very clean with large Tv complimentary water. We had dinner in the Bar, which was of a very high standard, lots to choose from and again very friendly and knowledgeable staff. We didnt have breakfast due to our early flight but there was complimentary coffee and water at 5am in the morning. Overall great hotel. And i will definitely be back for a few nights stay.",5,2016,09,29
250,"If i would have to rate only the hotel, it would be 5 star, but there is something wrong with bar and restaurant...","Hotel itself is very nice, and staff very helpful. It was a business trip and there was 7 of us. First evening we decided to eat in the restaurant. We have been waiting for waiting for our dinner over an hour. Do not order fish and bhahija: for 25 e you will get two tiny fillets of fish (less then 10cm each) and 1 onion bhahija. Much, much overpriced. 

Keeping in mind the time we have been waiting for the dinner in the restaurant, next evening we decided to eat in the pub. And there was more fun there: 
- we have been waiting over 1h again. 
- instead of shrimps, i have received chicken dish that was.... cold. I was hungry enough, and decided not to complain and eat what i got.
- after dinner we decided to stay for 2-3 drinks. And every time at least 1 drink was missed by waiter. 

To summarise: its ok hotel to stay, but avoid bar and restaurant. ",3,2016,09,29
250,Great location and great service,Our room was spacious and pretty. When we had issues with the electrics not working correctly the manager was quick to get us a new room. Any request we had was given personal attention and quickly resolved. The restaurant had very good food and drinks. Anna was an excellent waitress. Great information racks. They really catered to runners/walkers. The front desk staff was so helpful with suggestions and directions.,5,2016,09,28
250,Night before flying to New York,Very helpful staff and great clean large room.  Nice friendly bar sports on the TVs and casual setting for the dinner that was reasonably priced and very good..  Was perfect for night before next morning flight.,5,2016,09,27
250,Priority Elite lounge - wow VIP treatment,"The perks  of IHG Elite membership didn't get me the famous Ducati suite but Anna in the priority lounge did make sure my glass of Merlot remained topped up and the nibbles were a great pre-dinner appetiser... awesome service, 5 star *****",5,2016,09,26
250,Very relaxing !!!,"The room as ok, with a wet bar and  hook ups for WIFI. The hotel and our room were very clean . The staff was amazing and very helpful. They answered our questions very politely. The food was expensive, but very good. The continental breakfast had many choices and offered sweets, cheeses, fresh meats ! Everything was beautifully displayed. They offered a work out room which we were glad to see. Highly recommend this . Easy access to airport and hop on hop off bus.",4,2016,09,23
250,Lovely ****,"Beautiful room..... Lovely atmosphere. Breakfast buffet was beautiful.... Shuttle bus too and from the airport was easy and convenient.
Would highly recommend it.

Complimentary water, tea and cookies were a nice touch to the room. 
",5,2016,09,22
250,Interesting...,"My first experience with this hotel was less than positive due to the fact that it's shuttle service does not run 24 hours so despite booking an airport hotel you have to take a taxi if you arrive after 11.30pm. The times of the shuttle service are not on the IHG website.

Upon check-in I was told to wait as the duty manager clearly had paperwork to do. I was eventually warmly welcomed by someone else and given my room key and a voucher for a welcome drink which I thought was a nice touch. 

Upon trying to enter the bar however I had an opportunity for a 5 minute argument with security. Apparently there is nobody welcome in the bar between 12.15am and 1.00am when it is closed for cleaning then reopens. Instead I had to sit and wait in the lobby whilst the invisible staff would serve me a drink.

Upon getting back to the room I was tired and went to bed. Found it really warm and stuffy so turned on the AC. A few minutes later it cut out. I called reception and someone was sent up to reset everything. Working again I retired to bed, only to find that the same error occurred. 

This time I was asked to move rooms at 2am so I had to gather my belongings and move to a different room. I informed them that I would speak to the manager in the morning (decided against speaking to the scary duty manager who was too busy to check me in...)

I was offered a free breakfast for my troubles. A nice touch but when your business is selling a good nights sleep and it was after 2.30am before I was able to settle I think a lot of 4 star hotels would have discounted the room rather than throw in a 10€ breakfast. After all the rate is over 110€ and they should provide the advertised services without having to mess their guests around.

Breakfast was ok, not a lot of hot items available and no tea and coffee was offered which is an interesting approach. I'd have been disappointed if I'd paid 10€ so that's the only consolation.

Check out was quick and the agent didn't seem to know what to say when I informed him of the dissatisfaction during my stay and having to move rooms at 2am. Maybe I could give you 500 points? Ha ha again it's laughable that a hotel can get it so wrong and not come up with some form of decent service recovery.

I'll probably try to stay elsewhere near Dublin airport as the Crowne Plaza made everything difficult including a good nights sleep! Worth about half the advertised rate!",2,2016,09,21
250,recognizing staff,"I was staying in Crown Plaza during my short business trip. After a long day all I wanted is to relax and have a pleasant room service. 
One of your staff, Krisztina assisted me with some minor technical issue, what she managed to fix and she also recommend a dinner. 
Krisztina was genuine, friendly, highly motivated and most importantly guest focused . 
She was ready to help or to answer my questions. 
It was a great experience meeting her and she should be recognized by her guest first attitude. 
I hope other guests will have the luck to be served by her. Thank you",4,2016,09,21
250,Olga,"We arrived in Dublin on Friday, September 16/2016.  We had previously book for Saturday and Sunday at the Holiday Inn Express.  We tried to book for Friday nite but they said they had no rooms.  We went to the Crowne Plaza, next door.  This amazing staff person, Olga, came to our rescue.   SHe was soooo helpful.  We got a room and she went out of her way, to make sure, that our room was good.   Every time we went by the desk, she would ask, us, if we need anything.  Olga is a very good ambassador for this hotel.   I would recommend this hotel, and stay there again.   She was the difference maker.  All the small things, Olga did for us, made a huge difference.   Thanks, again, Olga for everything you did , to make our trip, even better..",5,2016,09,20
250,Pre-Flight Sleepover,Booked the Holiday Inn Express (with car-parking) & were upgraded to Crowne Plaza Hotel. Staff very courteous & helpful. Room small but clean & comfortable. Breakfast served from 6am & while we didn't have time for full breakfast we were offered a grab bag & take-away coffee to go (we took the free airport shuttle which left promptly at 6.20). Only downside is that we got a twin room but had requested a double when booking - however not an issue. Would stay again.,5,2016,09,19
250,Great location,"Stayed here many times on business.  They out on a free shuttle bus from the airport right to the front door, so that's. Great bonus to start with.

The hotel is finished to a high standard and rooms are first class.

Restaurant is also high quality and staff very friendly. 

There is also a very nice park opposite where you can stretch your legs at the end of the day.

Would highly recommend this hotel for business and pleasure.  ",5,2016,09,18
250,Dinning Experience,"We dinned at the Crown Plaza located at Dublin , Ireland Airport on 9/14/16. The food was good and the service was excellent. Our waiter was Milisav who was  knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful. In fact we ordered dessert but were not ready to eat it. Milisav delivered the dessert to our room even before we returned to our room following dinner. If you dine at the Crown Plaza ask for Milisav.",5,2016,09,17
250,Five Stars All The Way Around,"I just spent twelve days traveling around Ireland so I got to experience a lot of hotels. The Crowne Plaza is the last before leaving tomorrow. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the things this hotel gets right. It's clean, modern, and the staff are very caring and attentive. The bed is comfortable, the room is well appointed, and the bathroom has sufficient vanity space. The flat panel TV is large, the lighting is good, and there's a nice full length mirror.  Unlike many hotels in Ireland, this one has AC. One of my biggies: accessible electrical outlets. The room has plenty.   ",5,2016,09,16
250,Great hotel,"Stayed here with my daughter who flew in from London, for one night only so we could spend it in Dublin. Lovely rooms, with full amenities and very helpful staff. Check in was quick.
Shuttle bus provided to and from the airport. There is also a public bus stop across the road going straight into O'Connell Street. Just ask the reception they provide the bus numbers. 
 Car parking also available next door. Breakfast was also very good. 
Would definitely stay here again",4,2016,09,16
250,Eating at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport,"This Hotel is very well positioned in Dublin for both the airport and access to the city. Its in a nice location, with a good opportunity to stretch your legs.  for us, its regular meeting point for some friends. We meet to have a chat over a meal.. The Lounge is very comfortable with a nice ambience and a good menu. Anna was a very attentive server recently, took very good care of us. Would really recommend it as meeting point for locals, not just travelers.",4,2016,09,14
250,Cinnabar Pub,"Aine, our server, was lovely. She took great care of us! As well as being quite friendly, she was very attentive to our table. The food offerings were pleasantly varied and well prepared. Our salad of sweet potato, pumpkin seeds, and cherry tomatoes on a bed of mixed greens was creative and delicious!",5,2016,09,14
250,A quiet osasis,"On a flight to the USA we decided to take advantage of the USA inward immigration clearance at Dublin airport. Those of you who fly to USA on a regular basis know of the hassles arriving in any east coast destination, so to land as a domestic arrival is an added bonus and to save long haul tax another!
The Hotel has an excellent shuttle service to and from the airport as long as you arrive in their service window from 0600 to 2000. 
We checked in at 1700 and were upgraded to a club room, which gave us a free breakfast. So after snacks and a drink in the club room we dined in the Hotel, as the only other restaurant is a ten minute walk down the road. Had an excellent dinner at a fair price.
The room on the top floor was one of the quietest rooms I have ever slept in, with the hotel being located in an estate 3 kilometres south of the airport.
Every single member of staff looked after any need that arose. I could not fault anything about this hotel, a pleasure to find one as good as this. Rooms of ample size and well laid out with plenty of room for all purpose.
The Hotel is very fit for purpose.",5,2016,09,13
250,Excellent hotel,"We just had one night here but it couldn't be faulted. Very friendly and helpful staff, excellent facilities and good food - especially the breakfast, which was as good as at the Messeturm in Frankfurt, which is saying something.",5,2016,09,13
250,Nice Airport Hotel,"This is a nice hotel in the airport area.  We stayed there for two nights in early September.  The staff was helpful and nice.  The room was clean and spacious.  One complaint about the room was the lighting.  There needs to be some overhead lighting so that the room is brighter.  The bathroom was beautiful but the water pressure was not strong.  The shower also has a very high step so you need to be careful when getting in and out of the shower.  Overall, it was a good experience and we would stay there again.",4,2016,09,13
250,Surprisingly good hotel bar/restaurant,"I rarely like to eat in hotel bar/restaurants but the one in the Crowne Plaza Northwood Park was very good. Instead of the usual mostly fried food choices, the menu was quite eclectic with many healthy choices. The ingredients were also  fresh and there were a wide variety. My server, Anna was terrific. She was attentive and  put me in the right direction on some of my selections. Very nice young woman  with a can do spirit that hotels need to bring back guests.",4,2016,09,13
250,POWER SHOWER & BREAKFAST HEAVEN,"I spent one night in this hotel prior to taking my flight home.

I checked in around 7:30pm and was attended to by a lovely lady called Olga. Her customer service skills are excellent and she is exceptionally professional as well as warm.

The room was not large but adequately sized, beds comfortable and I appreciated the tea/coffee making facilities with cookies within the room. The night concierge from Croatia (sorry forgot his name) was attentive and personally brought us blankets when housekeeping had forgotten.

The shower in the bathroom which has a separate bath, was fantastically powerful...the best in the whole of my 3 day trip to Dublin but the BEST, the very BEST was the Crowne Plazas breakfast which is so very worth every single '€'! 

What an amazing selection available! The berry smoothie was delicious, the live food station serving 3 egg omelettes of your choice or poached eggs, excellent and they even had a fresh slice of honeycomb, something I have never seen in any other hotel, for you to get fresh honey from!

TIP: if you have not booked a room with breakfast, don't worry, if you book & pay in reception the day before, you will only pay 10€ instead of 17,95€ on the day.

I cannot wait to return to this hotel!",5,2016,09,09
250,Double charge; no food available after 9:00 p.m. and no shuttle bus after 8:00 p.m.,"I just received my September 2016 Citicard bill.  On that bill was a charge for our room at this property on July 4, 2016; unfortunately,  I had previously paid for the room when I booked the property on August 31, 2015 on Hotels.com.  I had the confirmation from Hotels.com which had the date of the stay and the charge as well as a copy of my September 2015 credit card bill which reflected the charge and the payment.  To make matters even worse, our flight from Edinburgh was delayed.  There were no shuttle buses and no food was available in the hotel after, I think, 9 p.m.  Since the plane landed after 9:00 p.m. we were out of luck.  We had to take a taxi.  The final insult was to be recharged for the room after we presented the copy of the Hotel.com invoice/confirmation as well as a copy of the credit card bill which was paid in full.  To say I am irate is a mild statement; this is supposed to be an airport hotel and double charging is illegal. I will think twice before ever staying at a Crowne Plaze Hotel.",1,2016,09,09
250,Service,Room was very tidy staff was very helpful and friendly waitress staff was very helpful Anna kept my drink full all the time and helped me and my partner out with places to visit in Dublin I would come back here,5,2016,09,08
250,"Excellent rooms, excellent service","Top hotel, clean rooms, top serivice staff. We really enjoyed it during TTF16. Daniel even managed a private shuttle service downtown for our Reservix team, what made our day. Thank you so much & see you 2017!",5,2016,09,07
250,Fantastic hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a prime location. Been here for a conference and the staff are wonderful, helpful and polite in every area.

Easy access to and from the airport and into the centre of Dublin. 

Food is amazing, wonderful selection and caters for gluten free. ",5,2016,09,07
250,Refurbished and outstanding!,"I love this hotel and have been a regular guest for over 10 years.  The recent refurbishment is both beautifully elegant and relaxing.  There is always a warm and efficient welcome from Olga and Beth in reception, while the bubbly Ciara in the Club lounge is a joy to encounter.  Highly recommend staying here.",5,2016,09,07
250,"Very Nice Hotel, a little out of town but good for the airport.","I've just returned from a week of work where by I stayed all week at the Crown Plaza in Santry.

It's a very well presented hotel. The lobby is very modern, clean and tidy with a great bar and lounge area. The bar food is good and reasonably priced. The restaurant food is very good but obviously the price is notably higher than the bar.

The room I had was everything which was needed, although the view was a bit rubbish. One downside to the room I had was that it was on the back of the hotel and it seems that mail and cargo flights still operate through the night as I was woken by a few. It may have been better with the window closed but I like the fresh air.

Anyone interested in exercising, well I'd give the gym a miss and head out for a run. There's a great map by the concierge desk with runs from 1k to 3k from the front door and you can combine them to go further. This is generally in the park on the other side of the road.

Don't be too excited about getting a night in Dublin as the journey can be a bit of a struggle from here, it took us nearly 45 minutes to go the few miles into town.

Happily stay here again and I would have given the hotel 4.5 (not 4, but this wasn't an option).",4,2016,09,07
250,Enjoyable stay - a good hotel close to Dublin Airport,"Likes:
+ Room size was compact but functional
+ Proximity to Dublin Airport - quick 10m transfer by shuttle bus.
+ Small, compact exercise room but the equipment is sparse and outdated.
+ Good conference facilities.
+ Friendly staff in general; check-in process was fine.
+ Complimentary wi-fi and very good speeds; 13 Mbps download and 24 Mbps upload
+ Plenty of UK/Euro/US mains sockets
+ Complimentary in-room teas & coffee making kit
+ Air-con that worked very well
+ Nice buffet breakfast with an omelette chef.
+ Well-stocked mini-bar
+ Several Pokemon stops and a Pokegym in the area to help keep the kids entertained ;-)

Dislikes:
- Proximity to Dublin Airport - loud aircraft noise at times, especially when they fly overhead.
- Shower; the shower valve handle came off in my hand when turned and the mixer-head and the whole shower unit for that matter need refurbishment.
- An item of the previous guest's dirty laundry had been left in one of the drawers
- The armchairs were not particularly comfortable as their seats were literally only 6 inches off the ground; awkward to sit into and get out of.
- Uncomfortable desk chair
- Nothing instantly ready in terms of vegetarian main course options but they did offer to ""talk to chef"" to see what could be done.But a lengthy delay in getting anything.",4,2016,09,06
250,The Redwood Suite and Food,"I attended a recent corporate event here.  I found the food portions to be very small but tasty.  The bar service was poor, and a lot of people from the function went to the main bar in the Hotel lobby as service was much quicker.  The drinks, higher than those in Dublins drinking den of Temple Bar, with 6.70 for a glass of wine!!  Sadly the Hotel did not discount rooms for guests of the function so I did not stay here and saved over 100 euros on my room rate at another Hotel.",3,2016,09,06
250,Great food! Great service!,"I called into the Crowne Plaza last night (Saturday) after an exhausting day in the Santry Sports Clinic. It wasn't extremely busy and thankfully a waitress, Catríona, approached me immediately and seeing that I was very drained found a seat for me on the spot and had water and a coffee ready for me before I knew it! I felt very comfortable and was just beginning to relax when my dinner was brought out by the manager. It was a delicious crispy battered cod and chips. I was visited again several times by Catríona before the end of my meal, she made sure I was completely looked after and introduced me to a very flavoursome McGargles craft beer. I've never felt so relaxed after a long day at the hospital. Thank you Catríona!",5,2016,09,04
250,Wonderful Staff,"From check in, to dinner, to the gentleman driving the courtesy bus to the airport the staff at this hotel are the most professional we have ever met.
Check in went very smoothly and the room was well equipped with tea&coffee making facilities.
We made our way to the hotel bar which was very lively,for our dinner,a waitress directed us to a table and within seconds we met with Darel,our waiter who offered to take a drinks order.Upon enquiring which beers were on tap he proceeded to list all off the beers/ales/cider,my wife was very impressesd at the selection.His recommendations for dinner were also very helpful.It took a bit longer to arrive than expected but we didn't really notice because the beer was soooo good.
All in all,this is a great hotel in a beautiful location with fantastic friendly staff.I hope we'll be back.

250,High standard. Modern hotel. Close to airport,"Wonderful, clean, tasty food, good location. Very professional service. Private parking, Internet available in the rooms. 
I had there Graduation, Coffee served was delicious and very tasty finger food.
I would recommend this hotel.",5,2016,09,03
250,Quality hotel,"We started the trip with a little bit of a hiccup. 
 we were booked at the Holiday Inn and unfortunately wasn't happy with the single rooms they provided. ( please know the holiday and staff were quite helpful unfortunately the room was not acceptable for our needs)
 lucky for us, the Crowne Plaza had rooms available and we quickly came next-door to the holiday inn's sister hotel. 
 Garrett at the front desk  was a  breath  of fresh air after a long day of traveling.   Not long after checking in we headed to the restaurant for dinner where Daryl continued our great service. 
 Thank you for the great service so far",5,2016,09,02
250,Nice hotel Friendly the best is Lang CIARA ...,"Beautiful hotel, clean rooms, and friendly helpful staff. In walking distance to shopping mall , would definitely stay again in the future.
the Lang was very very good very friendly the girl she is very nice friendly lovely everything you want it from here ,
CIARA ,
hope you gonna be all the time in the hotel every one love you .
thank you CIARA FOR EVERYTHING .
",5,2016,09,01
250,Very Satisfied,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night before we left Ireland
for a very large king room. A wonderful hot buffet, full irish breakfast was included.
We also had dinner in the dining room and were very satisfied but why are you served a 200ml bottle of pop when you order a soft drink. Beer is cheaper.
The room and all of the hotel we saw, was immaculate. The hotel looked new even though it may be up to 15 years old.
It is about 10 minutes from the airport but shuffle buses run frequently. A taxi will cost about 10 Euros if you are in a hurry.
Staff was  very friendly and helpful. This hotel is highly recommended as long as you do not want to stay nearer the action in the city.",5,2016,08,31
250,Recodorated rooms are a big improvement,"I regularly stay at this hotel & I was delighted to get one of the newly decorated rooms this time. The look is much more airy & modern. The check in staff are very friendly & even the bar staff always have a friendly word.
The bar menu is reasonably priced & the quality of the food served is great. 
My only criticism is that the bathroom, particularly the tiles & the shower door were looking a  little tired. 
I had stayed there a few weeks previous & the bar had been relocated so that the bar area could be renovated to be honest I didn't see much of a difference in it when it was reopen.",4,2016,08,31
250,Clean and comfortable,Very convenient location if you need to catch a plane. We stayed on our last night before leaving Dublin. The rooms are clean and comfortable. They have a regular free shuttle to and from the airport which is convenient. I think parking should have been free considering the price of the stay. Breakfast is also a little pricey.,4,2016,08,31
250,Excellent!!,"The personnel were fantastic when I managed to forget my wallet in the taxi from the Airport, both Marion and Shubham were very helpful and supported us until I was incredibly lucky that the same taxi was standing waiting at the taxi rank on my return to the Airport a half hour later...and low and behold it was lying on the back seat. Somebody was smiling on us that day.
Again can't thank you guys enough for all you did for us.",5,2016,08,30
250,"A bit overrated, especially food","Stayed here for 2 night because of flight out of Dublin Airport. Hotel rates are not cheap at all, and hotel food is even more expensive, which was surprising for me. Stay was quite fine, though, room was nice and clean, bed quality also quite good. Wi-Fi was free and reliable. Used airport shuttle - hotel should mark shuttle more clearly (maybe paint it in hotel colors?).",3,2016,08,29
250,Convenient and next to airport,"After a week-long tour of Ireland, we wanted our last night to be in a hotel near the Dublin airport so it was easy to make our early morning flight.  I chose this hotel because it was the nicest one located near the airport and it has a free shuttle to the airport, and served it's purpose.  It was a clean and quiet hotel, with some nice dining options we didn't try, and most important of all, had a free shuttle to the airport.",5,2016,08,29
250,Great room - mediocre food ,"The guestroom was recently renovated, and very comfortable. I especially liked the wall outlets with every possible plug choice. The only downside is the bathroom lighting which is oddly dim and the strange location for the hair dryer (bolted inside a bottom drawer). Unfortunately you are limited to eating there if without a car. The only restaurant in the hotel was mediocre for dinner. Breakfast was better. Good access to the airport with the shuttle leaving about every 30 minutes. 

 ",3,2016,08,28
250,Well done Holiday Inn/Crown Plaza - Sports Bar Experience!,"We had checked in next door to sister hotel Holiday Inn Express, and were desperate to find a TV with Sky Sports/F1 to watch the Spa/Belgium race live.  James, at Holiday Inn check-in called next door to Crown Plaza and found that they had access to the channel we need.  We went and our waiter, Peter, gave us front-row seats in a cozy area with our own screen,, and scanned the system to find the race!!  Success!!  Great meals for lunch while watching the race live!  Thanks Peter and James!!  This is what  fantastic service is all about!  We've stayed both places before in past trips and will continue to stay here when we visit from U.S. - nice setting with trees/park/swans across the street for a nice walk after dinner.  Thumbs up!",5,2016,08,28
250,From the moment we arrived we were treated to the best service. Thanks Gareth. ,The rooms are fantastic and the service in the Restaurant was terrific. You cannot go past the Singapore Noodles for dinner. Just a side note Gareth on the front desk you are amazing. Breakfast was an awesome spread. The omelettes were just the best. ,4,2016,08,28
250,Airport close,"Great rates. Nice, modern room. Good breakfast selection. Housekeeping staff was awesome! Close to airport. Also close to public transportation. Wish we had been able to book room for outbound flight. ",4,2016,08,26
250,A mixed experience,"For the most part, this is a nice property. unfortunately, as we arrived late there was only one executive room left which had no working minibar or air conditioning.

On a positive note, the hotel found us another  lasser room and allowed us to stay at a much reduced rate We were given a free upgrade to a much better room for the following night's stay.

While our stay started off unpleasantly, the staff made sure that the rest of our time at the hotel as very good. Very good service and staff who know how to treat their customers when things do not go to plan.

Nice rooms, comfortable beds, and an excellent property in general. 

I would stay again and recommend to friends.",5,2016,08,26
250,Great stay,"Great location,very close to the airport with a free shuttle.Easy to commute to the city center with the public bus which is just a few minutes walk from the hotel.Comfortable room,with a nice restaurant and bar.
Excellent breakfast!",4,2016,08,25
250,Great spot! ,Excellent food and service! The food was top class and we had very quick service. Would definitely recommend! Only stayed for one day as a stop over before flying out of Dublin; would have loved to stay more! Will definitely be returning here. ,5,2016,08,25
250,Overnight Stay,"Had to collect my husband from Dublin Airport late one night so stayed over instead of making the long journey home.  While waiting for my husbands flight to arrive, myself and my daughter had dinner in the hotel.  It was very pleasant with a good variety of food.  The bedroom was very nice and the bed was really comfortable - a great nights sleep.  The bedroom / en-suite was very clean and we had no problem with noise, even  with leaving the window open all night.  The fry-up the next morning was very good (probably one of the best hotel fry-ups I have had for a good while).
The hotel is spacious and is only about a 5-10min drive to the airport.  The hotel also has a shuttle bus to and from the airport.",4,2016,08,25
250,Good & convenient,"Good typical Crowne Plaza hotel, you know what you will get. Nice bar & restaurant, good food, rooms comfortable & well maintained, parking at hotel & very easy to the airport from here. Breakfast buffet extensive, friendly restaurant staff. Receptionist had a real attitude when we arrived but we sorted it out quickly. It's a good convenient overnight hotel. ",4,2016,08,24
250,Great stay,"Great location, offering reasonably priced and smart for the traveller, rooms extra comfortable...Dublin is a great ""so what"", this hotel a great stay. They are very welcoming, connections to city center by bus are very efficient and the shuttle to the airport timely and well managed. ",5,2016,08,21
250,First-rate restaurant staff,"We stayed next door at the Holiday Inn Express. We arrived late in the evening, hungry. The front desk told us the Crowne Plaza restaurant would be open for another 20 minutes. Though we were the last customers of the day and I'm sure the staff was eager to clean up and go home, we were warmly welcomed and patiently served. Our meals were all delicious, and the service -- especially from Lionel and David -- was memorably first-rate.",5,2016,08,21
250,"Wonderful, wonderful stay, with such caring employees.","We arrived in Dublin after seven hours of travel and had another long haul flight the next day. We had originally rented a B&B that was on a very noisy road. When we transfered to the CP a lovely employee named Olga, who had already helped us by phone, truly listened, heard how exhausted we were, and went the extra mile to make sure we got a quiet room with everything we could have needed and dreamed of. She also gave us a pint on the house while we waited for our room to be ready. It's not every day someone offers you this kind of care, and we remain grateful today, having had a good night's sleep in a clean and spacious room with the most comfortable bed we'd slept in on the whole trip. Perfect stay.",5,2016,08,20
250,"Great place, great service","We stayed here the night before flying out and upon check in the staff recommend we return our rental car that day to avoid issues the next morning. He suggested we drop it off and take the free shuttle back to the hotel and then back to the airport the next morning. Great suggestion and I'm super happy we did that as I would have had no idea where to drop off the car as the rental place would not have been open prior to us flying out.
Our room was very clean however we found the beds a bit small but had nice bedding.  The room was big enough for all our luggage and us. The bathroom was a fair size however the drain in the shower was super slow causing water to pool. We ordered room service and the food was really quite good. I would have actually enjoyed this hotel for a longer stay.",5,2016,08,19
250,Quick stop before airport ,Stopped at this hotel before I went to the airport for a drink and was greeted by John at the bar who was more then happy to let us take our time to pick our drinks. We took a seat to order some food and Aishling who severed us was very friendly and helped us pick out what to eat and was right in recommending the noodles and chicken pasta. Will definitely be returning to this spot. ,5,2016,08,18
250,Excellent hotel for Business or Leisure,"First review to Trip Advisor though well overdue, always planned and on the 'to do' list. Great to make my first review one on Crowne Plaza as I have stayed in this hotel on a many occasions for business purposes and have always found the service delivered with the  greatest of efficiency and professionalism with a great business centre and excellent wifi.The hotel is well located to the airport and the staff at reception are excellent and always welcoming  on return visits. Special mention to Beth who always remembers a face. 
I recently had the opportunity to stay with my husband prior to an early departure flight from airport the next morning. This was equally excellent and had time to savour the great food and service in the lounge/ bar and also had the opportunity to enjoy a run in the park located just across from hotel.
Would highly recommend for business or pleasure .",5,2016,08,17
250,great bartender,"The bartender was knowledgeable and friendly and made some great recommendations, have a chat with John F Kennedy and I'm not kidding that is his real name. He gave me some tips on place to visit. His favorite beer was Hop House Lager by Guinness. And he was right it was awesome!!",4,2016,08,16
250,Great hotel & staff,"Stayed in the hotel for 20 days
It's a great hotel location is perfect
& staff is very helping always thr for u
They will guide you very well to dublin city
Especially Mr. Shubham he guided us all the way.
",5,2016,08,16
250,"Nice hotel, near the airport!","We stayed here the evening before a long flight.  The rooms appeared to have been recently refurbished and was lovely! The hall carpets are a little dated.  Over all a pleasant experience and would recommend.  The free shuttle bus to and from the airport is great!!  Also, a short walk to city transportation.  We rode the bus into Templebar area and it was seamless!",5,2016,08,15
250,Great airport hotel,"Stayed here our last night in Ireland before our morning flight out the next day.  Very nice hotel and was exactly what I wanted.  I was amazed by their internet speed, fastest of any hotel I have ever seen in the world.  Highly recommend this hotel if you need a room by the airport.",5,2016,08,14
250,Great stay on our last night in Ireland! ,"We stayed here as we had an early flight in the morning and didn't want the hassle of walking up very early. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The hotel is very modern, well decorated and the staff were lovey! All in all a wonderful night. The park across the road is also very nice to walk/run around. I particularly liked how the hotel had a counter with a map of the running tracks around. ",5,2016,08,14
250,Great night!,"We needed to book a hotel for our 24 hour layover in Dublin. The Crowne Plaza had a room for 4 and was a perfect stop for us. We were able to catch the shuttle from the airport (the shuttle runs pretty consistently until about 2315 or so. We did ask at the info desk in the airport and she called to double check for us). We crashed for the night, they delivered an extra towel very quickly after it was requested, and they graciously held our bags for us while we explored the city the next day. I would recommend it!",5,2016,08,14
250,Perfect Stop,Lovely welcome late at night and a really comfortable room. The shuttle was on time and very fast. I was particularly impressed with the staff who made that extra effort both late at night and early morning,4,2016,08,14
250,Fantastic Food at the Plaza,"Picked up our son from the Airport and fancied a family meal before long journey south.  Stopped into the Crowne Plaza next to the airport.  Got a table in the lounge/bar.  Menu catered for different tastes and scale of apatite.  The grub when it came was just fantastic quality. Good ingredients, well put together and great taste. We could not have been happier. Good value too for the four of us.
Lounge atmosphere and decor very nice and the staff very pleasant.   Probably needed a bit more cover for the number of customers present.   Seating layout also good if you were doing a business meal with comfortable spaces between tables and booths.
Also, and a nice touch, car parking was free for up to two hours: very convenient.
I will certainly be back there for food again. 
 ",5,2016,08,13
250,Excellent hotel and staff,"I stayed in Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport between August 2015 and April 2016 due to an assignment in Dublin. It was a great hotel with an excellent staff. I want to thank Olga (reception), Ciara (Club lounge - afternoon), Martina (club lounge - morning) and Kristina (room service). They were always very charming and helpful. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.",5,2016,08,13
250,Another great stay,"I stayed for one night at the beginning of August . On arrival we were checked in by the lovely Olga who had great charm and a very warm smile. She was also very helpful with arranging a taxi for us to go into the city centre. We were upgraded to a club room which was very nice, however the bathroom door would not shut. We also went into the club louge but they had no Tonic water in the fridge. When we went out for the evening Olga asked if we liked the upgrade and we said yes apart from the bathroom door. She said we could change rooms but as we were there only for one night we decided to stay put. I would stay at this hotel again even though we had some small issues as he staff are so attentive",4,2016,08,12
250,Lunch,Great lunch at a reasonable price....service very good. It's a very comfortable hotel with friendly staff particularly Tony at reception who was extremely helpful. The food was delicious and a good portion was served by a lovely friendly waitress... Staff seem happy & smiling ... Always a good sign. The ladies was spotlessly clean & fresh. I would definitely recommend a visit 👍,5,2016,08,11
250,Very comfortable and convenient,"We returned late in the evening from a holiday in the West of Ireland into Dublin Airport. The courtesy bus was prompt and we got to the hotel quickly. The check in was quick, efficient and very personable. The room was away from the elevator, quiet, very nicely decorated with a very big bathroom with a huge tub. The room had all the amenities, coffee and tea, trouser press, iron/board, robe, complimentary sparkling/still water. We called the front desk for toothpaste and were provided with ample supplies. I would highly recommend this hotel for a layover I travel for a living and I consider it great value for money.",5,2016,08,11
250,Complaint dealt with extremely well.,Having booked through Gulliver Travel and requested a higher room and away from the elevators this information was not provided to the hotel. This was referred to the front of house manager who dealt with extremely professionally. The room we were allocated was very clean and roomy. Would recommend and come again.,5,2016,08,11
250,"Excellent hotel - excellent food in bar, great for airport layovers","I have had two recent stays and both times it has been excellent.

The rooms are really good, clean, up to date, working aircon, good showers, everything you need.

The bar is really good as well.  Good selection of beer and excellent food.  I had the thai/singapore noodles and they were excellent - everything was clearly cooked from scratch.  Burgers and thai curry also great.

The barman, John Kennedy, was also friendly and offered great advice on the menu - thanks!",4,2016,08,11
250,"Helpful staff, great airport shuttle service, close to Airport","I attended an event at the Crowne Plaza in July and had to fly in and out of Dublin Airport same day. Shuttle service was great and hotel is a short drive from the Airport. Friendly helpful  staff in Events, Shauna and the reception staff were very efficient.
Overall I'd recommend the hotel for business or leisure and airport convenience.",5,2016,08,10
250,Exactly what the Doctor ordered!!,"Tremendous stay at the hotel, was greeted by the friendly Beth with a welcoming smile in reception, she gave us information on local amenities which ensured our stay was excellent. It was obvious her hospitality skill's were exceptional. easy access to all main routes, great location. Food was delicious! Room was perfect, very clean. Highly recommend this hotel as the staff, especially Beth, are willing to go the extra mile to accommodate your stay.",5,2016,08,10
250,Ideal for a short business trip close to the airport,"Excellent service (complimentary small breakfast take away), comfortable rooms, easy WiFi access (no passcode) and very friendly staff (thanks Shubham). Next time I come to Dublin, this is my first choice!",5,2016,08,09
250,Ideal if catching a plane or the ferry.,This is a modern hotel that has a great bar atmosphere.  The rooms are big and well-equipped.  Good nights sleep is assured.  Large car park next door is very handy.  It was ideal for us just passing through.,5,2016,08,07
250,Bat visit at Crowne ,John F Kennedy was great (very animated and willing to be part of our 'selfies' 🤗) and provided local info. Looking forward to visiting his recommendations. Drinks and service were great. Will be visiting here again. Love the hotel and ambience. ,5,2016,08,06
250,Amazing stay!,Immaculate rooms topped up with complimentary water daily. Brilliant service with friendly staff who are happy to provide whatever your needs. Amazing food for reasonable prices. Comfortable beds and spotless rooms. Altogether a brilliant stay and would happily stay again,5,2016,08,05
250,"Great customer service but tired, worn out asset condition","Stayed in this hotel for approx 20 nights across 2 months and the experience was variable.

The pros
- excellent staff, very helpful, very professional
- Great location, at least for me since I was working close to the airport
- The Gym was abysmal to begin with but after a couple of complaints they sorted this out
- Fridge in each room
- Willing to cater to bespoke requests on most occassions

The cons
- The condition of their building is terrible! Noisy air conditioners and clogged drains are typical
- Ordinary bathrooms
- Tiny room size

Overall, it's the quality of staff there which makes me want to go again, although some of them are an exception to this. Shout out to the wonderful receptionist Garreth- always willing to help and great to speak to.",4,2016,08,03
250,AMAZING STAFF Gareth #1,"Arrived by ferry and got cab to hotel.  Had used my HI points.  Was pleasantly surprised by the area and entrance. I had requested a KING and roll away since I had my 2 teenage daughters. Room only had King and no room for rollaway with out any walking space.  Front desk combed thru and found me a much larger KING room and space to spare.  It was my birthday and Gareth took it upon himself to call and make me special reservations at TUCANA's AWESOME Highly recommend! The next day Gareth gave us special places to visit and recommendations.  Hotel was clean, large and well laid out.  I need to go to business room to print special airline info .  It closes at 11 and they opened it for me at 111:30 pm.  HOW nice and accommodating!  There is a Holiday Inn Express attached and buses run smoothly 15-30 to and from the airport.  A bus stop is just a 3 minute walk from hotel in safe area and goes straight to down town center area and around.  We went back and forth several times.  We stayed near A/P for convince of early flight and quietness.  Lovely place. Highly recommend.  Look for Gareth.  The other staff were great also.. but he was always at our mercy!!!",5,2016,08,02
250,Business trip to Ireland,"The location is perfect if you are flying into Dublin with fast transfer to the hotel.  I am lucky enough to access their club room which is normally staffed by Ciara who is charming, bubbly and happy in her work providing outstanding service for food and drinks.  Highly recommended",4,2016,08,02
250,"Excellent staff, great stay and comfortable beds.","We stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon - they even had towels shaped as swans in our room. John Kennedy at the bar was very helpful for places to see that was unique and suggested food items from the menu - his choices were spot on. The room was quiet, very comfortable with a nice bathroom.  We thought the stay was just as nice as another hotel that was about 100 euros more.  Will definitely suggest to others to stay here and will return.",5,2016,08,01
250,Loved our stay,"The Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport hotel is a short distance from the airport itself and is situated next door to its sister, the Holiday Inn. Both hotels share the guests car park.  
Check in was smooth and efficient. Our club room on the 4th floor was beautifully and tastefully decorated and the ensuite bathroom had both a separate bath and shower. The room overlooked an apartment block and a side view of Northwood Park. 
The bed was very comfortable. 
We dined in the Touzai restaurant, which is one of the integral eateries within the hotel. 
The meal was delicious and the service from Lionel in the restaurant was exemplary. 
We hope to stay at this lovely hotel again sometime when we are visiting Dublin",5,2016,07,31
250,Very nice,"We stayed at this hotel on the last night of 14 hotel nights and it was great!  The staff were all very friendly and very professional.  The hotel was very modern, clean and comfortable.  The hotel also has an airport shuttle that leaves very 20 mins or so.  It was very convenient.",4,2016,07,31
250,"Excellent staff, good location, very good restaurant, comfortable rooms","The Crowne Plaza is a quick drive by free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. The staff are welcoming, knowledgeable and responsive. A large park immediately across from the hotel beckons the weary traveler for a relaxing walk or energizing run. We appreciated the help of the staff in finding us a room for an early check in. We also enjoyed the excellent dining in their restaurant. As frequent travelers, we appreciate being welcomed by name, and the sincere effort of the hotel to make us comfortable.",5,2016,07,30
250,Nice crowned plaza,Convienent to the airport.  Shuttle runs every 20 minutes starting at 4 am.. bus to city center is a block away and only 2.4 euros although you need exact chane.  Hotel staff are friendly and helpful.  The crown plaza and the holiday Inn express next door are connected. ,4,2016,07,30
250,Nice venue,"This was a business meeting location, I didn't stay at the hotel but we did use it a place to meet and had some drinks there. There was a wide selection of drinks on offer and they appeared reasonably priced for a hotel, the service was quick and we were offered additional service at our table which we declined but was nice all the same.",4,2016,07,30
250,Restaurant and service was excellent,"The restaurant that is located inside the Crowne Plaza is of a fine quality.  We had dinner there two nights ago and the dinner was the best prepared I have had in the last six months.  The service by our server Milisav was the best on this vacation to Ireland.  he was friendly and took his time to explain the menu and passed our compliments on to the kitchen staff.   The presentation, quality of the meal, and taste was more than we expected and the price was well under €50.00 including the beer.  This was the perfect ending to our Ireland vacation!  Thanks to the staff at the restaurant.",5,2016,07,29
250,"Helpful staff, great location for bus to city center & nice restaurant","Reception staff has been very helpful with tips for getting around. Room is quiet and comfortable. 
Dinner at Touzia was tasty and well presented. Milisav and Justin were helpful with suggestions and attentive.",4,2016,07,28

Tahir Munir Accenture",5,2016,07,28
250,Touzai Restaurant,"Went for dinner with a group from work recently.  We really enjoyed our evening, the food was lovely, the wine was great and the service was even better.  David our server was very helpful, friendly and went out of his way to ensure we had an enjoyable evening.
We'll be back!! :)",5,2016,07,27
250,great service,"another great stay, Ciara in the club lounge providing excellent service as usual. 

been staying here for over ten years, nice to see the same staff again at each visit.

club lounge now available for drinks / snacks at the weekend",5,2016,07,26
250,Viera was outstanding,"Our food was excellent as we ate at the lounge every night!  The food was wonderful and moderately priced. The menu was varied with still a local flair. Our server Viera went out of her way to make the experience for my Mother just that, a wonderful experience. Viera is a great representative of what Great Service is!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2016,07,26
250,Amazing Stay!,"We recently spent two nights here and instantly fell in love with this hotel!  First and foremost I have to mention that this hotel has air conditioning!!  This was very important to us since we live in South Georgia and are accustomed to sleeping in very cool conditions.  Very beautiful grounds, lobby, restaurant, and rooms.  Our bed was extremely comfortable and was quite large.  Room service is available 24 hours and we had desserts on both nights which were fabulous!  The rooms also offer a mini-bar for an additional cost which we really liked.  The breakfast which is not included in the room price is one of the best we have had at any place we have ever stayed...do not miss the wonderful food prepared fresh each morning!  They even had fresh honey from an actual honeycomb and you could take the honeycomb and chew on it...delicious!  Great shuttle service to the airport, not too far from Dublin downtown, and very secure.  Wish the parking was a bit closer to the facility and would love it if valet parking was offered. You can't go wrong with this hotel!",5,2016,07,25
250,Same bar menu for at least 3-4 years,Went in for a Sunday dinner today. Had a great service and food was nice. But its now boring as I have been eating on and off here and it has been same menu for at least 3-4 years. I really think that a new menu will drive more sales.  Guiness was good tho. ,4,2016,07,24
250,Perfect Experience,"Everything is perfect in this hotel.

Rooms are stunning, staff always gentle and helpful at any time and for all your needs.
Many services are offered by the Crowne Plaza, punctuality and honesty are at the first place.

And the food quality of the restaurant is really high.

Always a pleasure",5,2016,07,24
250,Fantastic venue for a business trip,"I stayed here with my business colleagues as we had a weekend conference. Not alone is it wonderful as a conference venue, but also for accommodation and food. Staff are polite and friendly.  Rooms are modern and spacious.  Would return.",5,2016,07,24
250,Efficient business hotel,"Good efficient check in, good sized room room, huge bed - good wifi and aircon- handy parking behind the adjacent Holiday Express. Good , reasonably priced food at the Asian themed restaurant - breakfast is good with a diverse selection on offer ",4,2016,07,24
250,Regulars and love this hotel.,"The Crowne Plaza has always been a favourite of ours. We make it our business to stay on the club floor every time. The staff are so welcoming professional and friendly. The comfort of having access to  the club lounge is ideal and my daughter feels it is a home away from home.It allows us to take a real break without having to be in the busy hub of the main bar and lounge which also offers a superb bar food menu if you don't choose to eat in their fab restaurant. Breakfast is extensive and they provide such a wide variety of delicious delights that should tempt all nationalities and meet most  dietary requirements. Chefs are on hand to cook to ones needs too so have a blast. The hotel is located only minutes from the airport and there is a shuttle bus around the clock for guests of the hotel. 
The park is beautiful and on its doorstep. No excuse for not getting ones daily steps in. Congratulations to the ream behind the new renovation and stunning decor. You did a beautiful job. I have to mention that on one occasion I had arrived after  a long haul flight having been picked up by the shuttle bus. It was around 6am. I had popped in to have my car park ticket validated and the guy on duty at the desk asked would I have a coffee and my daughter a water before getting on the road. I thought it was a very considerate gesture and lovely reflection on the hotel and the type of personal they employ at there. Thank you. I guess if there was one thing that I might rethink if I was part of the management team is the car park charges especially for guests staying a few nights.  Guests pay for their Car park tickets in the lobby at a machine on departure. Otherwise a fab hotel.

250,Pleasure as always ,"Always getting my upgrade due to my status, something other crown plaza can learn from. Clean great rooms, clean, good lounge. Perfect Asian restaurant. Nice bar, good meeting rooms and easy good shuttle service from and to airport. Good business hotel.",4,2016,07,20
250,JUST WOW,"I should have wrote this months ago, better late than never, I attended an event regarding health and we stayed for 3 nights,, I have to say from the moment we arrived to the very end the staff , management were excellent, the attention to detail exceeded expectations, how ever small they were,  my wife did not attend the meetings but Beth had organized her days to be very busy, I envied her going off on her day's outing,  Thank you Beth, I will highly recommend this great hotel and especially the staff and management , Mark",5,2016,07,20
250,Better,"The Club floor on the 4 th has been renovated now after a long time.
The rooms are clean fresh new and good.
Refurbished club lounge also.
Worth a little extra payment if you can.
Too many Airline staff in hotel so sometimes difficult to book.",4,2016,07,17
250,Two hundred Buddhists and everyone was special,"I spent two nights in the Crowne Plaza on a Buddhist Summer Training Course.  With two hundred arriving at about the same time and that number for lunch and dinner, there was every possibility of a wholesale carve up!  Not so.  The staff were competent and charming.  Food was served on time and hot, and the meeting rooms were very fine.
The bedroom was well appointed and comfortable.
All in all, an enjoyable visit.",5,2016,07,15
250,Bar,"Came to eat dinner here at the bar the night before we flew back home. I wasn't overly hungry, but wanted a light dinner. Our waitress Anna was great. She went and asked the chef if he could do a 1/2 serving of the Irish stew for me and he was more then willing. The stew was delicious and just the right portion. Thanks Anna for getting me just what I needed!",4,2016,07,14
250,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here on Monday 4th July in advance of an early flight. Everything about the experience was superb, reservation, reception (outstanding), rooms & bar food.
Didn't get to stay for breakfast but I'd imagine that too would have been brilliant.
Will definitely stay again, thanks.",5,2016,07,13
250,Average Hotel,"Bed was comfortable.  Room was spacious and clean.  We stayed here after being put into hotel accommodation after 6 nights of not having power or water in our apartment so anything that had heat, lighting, warm water and television was a luxury to us!  

The reason I booked this hotel was becuase they put sleep aromatherapy kit on the pillows but there was none this time!  

I also had booked through a third party so was unable to receive an invoice from the hotel, I really needed one for insurance purposes (being that we were put up in the hotel for the night after 6 days without power & water).  This was quite disappointing.",3,2016,07,11
250,Good choice near the airport,"We were bumped to the Crowne Plaza after the Holiday Inn Express overbooked.  This was definitely a nicer place and a good upgrade over the other.  Check-in was quick and the room was great.  The breakfast was huge and caters to all tastes.  We didn't try the bar, but it looked busy and inviting.  The courtesy bus is no charge and picks up directly in front of the hotel for a quick trip to the airport.  We asked about going downtown and the desk provided very helpful bus information and a map.",4,2016,07,09
250,Nice hotel and convenient to airport ~,"we stayed for the night before flying back to the States after 12 days in the UK - comfy, clean - they accommodated us to be across from my Mom and nephew - nice, modern facility - sorry we missed the breakfast - too early to airport - no time - :-( - but the shuttle comes and it's great -",5,2016,07,09
250,Great Pasta!,"We stayed next door at the Holiday Inn Express and had a bar meal at the Crowne Plaza. The service was quick and friendly. We both had salmon pasta and it was excellent, a good size portion, hot and very tasty. It was also a reasonable price. It turned out to be the best meal we had in our Tour of Ireland!!!",4,2016,07,09
250,Wedding nearby,"This hotel was spotless..nice place, felt clean tidy and comfy .Bathroom was very high spec modern with all mod cons...reception very helpful.. we left our passes for the coach to the wedding, they replaced them straight away..Causing us a lot less stress....enjoyable stay! ",4,2016,07,09
250,Always a great pleasure,"Our room's beautiful, spacious and has modern decor. It's always a pleasure coming to Crowne Plaza because we know we will never be disappointed. Their rooms are always on point, nothing to complain about. The hotel is very quiet, no noise in the corridors. 
The staff is ever friendly and we were booked in by a very nice lady Olga. She's so sweet. It's a shame we are here just for one night because we are in transit we have to catch a very early flight.",5,2016,07,08
250,Overnight stay before flight ,"Stayed here for one night before early morning flight to LHR then MIA. Hotel was good, convenient for DUB - courtesy bus runs. Staff in bar could have been more helpful, free drink voucher used for soft drinks rather than alcoholic! So over 15 euro for a beer and wine instead of lying for two cokes!",3,2016,07,08
250,Flying Visit,"We had a wonderfull one night stay at this hotel before our early morning flight.The hotel and our room was luxurious! The staff were welcoming and friendly,I would particularly like to thank Subhan at reception for all his assistance during our brief stay.He is a real asset to the front of staff team.To summerise I would highly recommend this hotel for all those in transit at Dublin Airport.",5,2016,07,08
250,breakfast with a room,"modern, attractive, tidy hotel near the airport. service was lovely, location convenient. Best Hotel Breakfast of My Life! we travel a good bit and have stayed at some nice hotels over the years, but this facility takes the cake for bet breakfast ever. full irish/English, fresh pastry, an absolutely wonderful selection of local fresh cheeses, local butter, breads and a huge honey comb. simply amazing!",5,2016,07,08
250,Wonderful!,"Overall, a wonderful experience! The rooms are comfortable, modern, and accommodating. The food was also delicious! We loved having a beautiful park right across the way as well. John Kennedy was the best bartender in town. :)",5,2016,07,07
250,"Great waitstaff, comfortable and convenient hotel","My family stayed one night at hotel next door (Holiday Inn Express) and decided to have dinner at the Crowne Plaza for its convenience. The food selection offered more than the usual Irish stew/potatoes, I had the singapore noodles, my husband had burgers and my kids enjoyed the nuggets/spaghetti. Dessert was fantastic. But the best part about it was ourwaiter, Peter, my kids were waiting for their food to arrive, he offered to bring them into the kitchen to see their food being prepared, my kids were ecstatic! It was great customer service!",4,2016,07,07
250,Lovely experience!,"We were here for the end part of our honeymoon before the long ride back to the states. It was only for one night. The customer service rep, Olga, was outstanding. She could tell that we had been traveling, tired, and wanted to help in any way she could. Once she found out that it was our honeymoon, she made all the possibilities to make our stay the most enjoyable happen! It made my cranky, irritable moment turn right around. The hotel itself is very clean, beautiful, comfortable, and the breakfast was amazing! I would totally stay here again!",5,2016,07,05
250,A Thoroughly Nice Airport Hotel Experience,"Great bed and room, very clean and modern, helpful staff, a very tasty meal, and a timely transportation service to the Airport.  Overall very impressive and as good a way as any to get ready to depart beautiful Ireland.",5,2016,07,05
250,Long day made much easier by great team in bar restaurant.,Long day but thanks to John kennedy and Paul O' Reilly for great comms.  Was upgraded by IHG today which was also a great touch. Well worth investing in the IHG rewards program!  Back soon to this hotel. Station14 at the airport and you also get a free bus to the hotel.,5,2016,07,04
250,Nice hotel👍,Lovely hotel!We stayed three night at Crown Plaza.Room to be lovely and clean.Hotel and lobby nice decorating and comfortable.The staff from reception and restaurant very friendly specially one Slovakian girl Viera /she lovely person😜/ Really enjoyed to recommend this hotel *****,5,2016,07,04
250,Very disappointing,I often stay here but won't again. Given a disabled access room so everything in the bathroom was way too low and no sink plug made it virtually impossible to wash comfortably . No bath and the shower  was dirty and in need of a complete overhaul.    When I complained  the  receptionist apologised but didn't offer to get the manager and as I'd already paid no compensation was offered.  Very disappointing. ,2,2016,07,04
250,Great As Usual,"Regular visitor here and again it was a pleasant stay.

All staff a pleasure to deal with and go above and beyond. This is a real strength of this hotel.

One small slip and missed cleaning my room one day, but the pluses out way the minuses...

Clean and good food... 

Keep it up team👍🏻",4,2016,07,02
250,Enjoyable,Stayed in June travelled as a couple. Skipped dinner and the menu wasn't to our taste but the bar was nice and busy with friendly staff. Front desk staff was nice and accommodating. The room service breakfast was excellent. The bar manager Mr. Lawlor was very hospitable and chatty. 4/5 would stay again.,4,2016,06,30
250,Excellent Menu and Waiting Staff,"I recenty visited Crown Plaza Hotel for dinner with a friend. I feel it worth mentioning the fact that they have excellent food & service! Their waiting staff are very warm and attentive, checking in periodically to ensure we were happy with our food and drinks. One of the Waitresses, namely Anna was taking care of us. She is an absolute asset to Crown Plaza! Her knowledge of food and drink is extensive, she did a great job explaining the menu to us and we followed her recommendations!
Overall, this is definately a place to visit for coffee/lunch/dinner or any occasion for that matter.",5,2016,06,29
250,Enjoyable Business Trip,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times to take part in company training schemes.  The staff are extremley helpful and polite and nothing is ever too much trouble.  The hotel has a shuttlebus to and from the airport and is very efficient.

The hotel and facilities including bar and restaurant are fantastic.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,28
250,Convenient for layover,"Spent probably a total of six hours at the hotel prior to a too-early AM flight to Frankfurt but had a good experience during that time. Restaurant was open at least until 10:30PM and the free airport shuttle starts running at 4:00AM, which was an absolute necessity for me. Frequency is every 30mins. Pickup at the airport is in the Coach Park stand zone 14.

If things get hairy, you can also contact the hotel using the courtesy phones in the terminal arrivals area, which are not pre-programmed with the Crowne Plaza, but can still dial the hotel if you punch in 9 followed by the local number.

The only quirk I encountered was the hotel not having my IHG Rewards club number on file upon arrival (honestly, first time I've encountered this problem on a booking made through ihg.com), but this was quickly rectified. Not sure if this influenced my ability to receive a free upgrade, though, as I am IHG Platinum. Did collect my reward points for the stay, however.",4,2016,06,26
250,Great grub at the bar!,"We weren't staying, so only used the bar for a meal, but the food was really delicious! Reasonably priced, and we were served quickly, even when we asked for ammendments to the meals. Staff were very friendly and happy to help. Our waitress was Anna. Just what we needed after a lot of travelling! ",5,2016,06,26
250,Food,"Decent pub food at decent prices, served by the lovely friendly Anna! Thank you!

200 characters Tripadvisor? Ok;

Perfect omelette.

Fry and toss around until golden, then turn the heat down to medium. Add your eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the Cheddar, finely chopped cucumber, red onion and ham.",4,2016,06,22
250,Nice room and best breakfast ever,"Had a lovely night on last Saturday. very friendly staff, nice location and what a breakfast! Good location if you have a car since it's slightly away from the centre. Will definitely return when we are next in Dublin.",5,2016,06,22
250,Restaurant,"Last night we had a meal at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport Hotel's restaurant. We were served by John F Kennedy (seriously), and he was excellent. We arrived late in the evening and not long before the kitchen was set to close, so we relied on his recommendations (he told us he had worked as a cook in the kitchen for 6 years). The food was just as good as the service. We will definitely be visiting here again the next time we're in Dublin. Sláinte. ",5,2016,06,20
250,Far from the City but a good choice!,"The hotel is so calm, clean, modern and cozy. Its about 25-30min by bus to the city. The park next to the hotel is so soothing! 
Breakfast buffet was so good, the staff was so friendly, and there are restaurants near the lobby. 
Overall it was a very good experience :-)",4,2016,06,20
250,A nice change for us,"For years we have been staying at the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport (as its the handiest for the Terminal) and we have always liked that establishment.

This time we thought we would give the Crowne Plaza, Northwood,  Santry a try, even though it is quite a bit more remote from the airport – maybe a 10 minute drive by their half hourly (and free) bus transfer.

It’s a really nice hotel - a pity we did not discover it earlier and we were given the Ducati Suite is decorated with motorcycle memorabilia – see my photos.
""In room"" internet is very fast indeed and free, at least it was for us.

The usual 4/5 star amenities were available and our room at the front of the hotel had a beautiful view over the park.

Staff were superfriendly but the main bar was a bit busy as it attracts sports fans so if you want to snack or eat properly, us the main hotel restaurant - Tsuji or something like that - which is excellent.

All in all, this will now be our hotel of choice at Dublin Airport",4,2016,06,19
250,So Disappointed,"Stayed here for one night before taking off for my flight to the United States. They gave me a room right by the elevator and it was noisy.  The room was so small for two. Only had twin beds. My biggest complaint was with the restaurant.  The portion was ridiculously small.  I ordered the trout and it came with 2 bite-sized pieces of fish. Not enough for even a child. When I complained to the manager all he did was offer me a free dessert. My meal was already coming with dessert, since I ordered from the early bird menu. What a deal!",3,2016,06,19
250,Drink and Meal at the bar ,"Had a great meal and drink at the bar and restaurant at the bar. Served by Paul O'Reilly and John Kennedy he did an amazing job. Great selection of food and drinks. Great service all around, friendly staff, and could not have felt more at home. Will come again ",5,2016,06,19
250,Quick trip to Dublin ,"Chose the hotel out of convenience -- got in late and didn't want to scramble to find a place in the city. Staff is very warm and friendly. Olga helped me with the perfect room. I've been an IHG rewards member for years, but this was by far the best treatment I've received for being a loyal customer. Very clean. Comfortable. Highly recommend the suite! ",5,2016,06,18
250,A great place to stay,Stayed here one night - it was great. Room was clean and well appointed. Staff were in suites and were very professional. The place had a aire of pride to it. It`s a great place to stay. We had supper on the bar side and our server Anna did a great job with helping us sort through some food troubles we had. She was very studious to our needs and we appreciated her service to us.,5,2016,06,18
250,"Ok hotel, unacceptable service","At this price for a room and they try to get away with this crap. I'm chilling a bottle of wine in the bathtub right now. Absolutely unacceptable service for a room that cost this much.
To be honest I have never seem this practice anywhere else and I find it thoroughly offensive!

Luggage weighing services are unavailable at this hotel and they lack a scale in the bathroom or exercise room.

Quality of the hotel other than this met expectations, but I will not be staying here again.",2,2016,06,18
250,Beautiful Hotel,"Absolutely outstanding hotel. Modern and clean with an old school vibe. I used it for a overnight business trip, a great hotel. Breakfast was nice and they brought me up additional complementary water! 5 stars!",5,2016,06,16
250,"Much too far to walk, but a great hotel","A very clean, modern, comfortable and recently renovated hotel. We enjoyed a light dinner in the bar area and we loved the fact that our room had every conceivable kind of electrical outlets-- including U.S. and USB! It was a longish wait for the shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but we caught the shuttle on schedule in the morning.",4,2016,06,15
250,Great location great customer service,I will definitely stay here again. Customer service was great. A nice gentleman by the name of Tony went above and beyond for us during our stay. The airport shuttle was very convenient and runs until about 11:20pm.,5,2016,06,14
250,Great Breakfast,"Overall a fine stay. Check-in was easy, room was fine, simple check-out. Location is near the airport and while transit to city center is easy, this is not a hotel with a lot around it. Very few restaurants in walking distance.

Front desk staff very friendly and accomodating. They were able to provide easy directions and gave me bus fare in each direction in separate baggies to make it easy to get to city center. 

The bus stop is located at the end of the street near the hotel (5 minute walk) and goes to City Center. 3 different busses work, so it was very easy and better than driving.

Parking at the hotel costs up to 6 Euros every 24 hours, but it charges every entrance and exit, so could be more if you go in and out a few times.

Hotel is next to Holiday Inn Express.

Breakfast was really great. Full Irish buffet.

The only downside to the hotel is the pillows on the bed. They closely resemble a ream of  computer paper in a pillowcase - flat and hard. They should be replaced quickly.",4,2016,06,13
250,Amazing stay,"My fiance's family and I had a wonderful stay.  One bartender, Jon Kennedy, was so friendly and nice! We would be at the bar till 1 am chatting with him about places to see in Ireland and he was so nice.",5,2016,06,11
250,Amazing hotel ,"Amazing stay. 
I was here for one night. I can't fault it. Comfortable room very clean food is amazing and probably the most friendly staff I have come across in a long long time. Garrett at reception was particularly helpful and very professional. 
I will define tally be back, thank you. ",5,2016,06,11
250,Tony the concierge,Tony gave us awesome help when we needed support getting to the airport.  He was very personable and helped us out...  I only wish that more hotels had as helpful concierges as him. 5 Stars and 2 thumbs up buddy!!!  Thank you tony,5,2016,06,09
250,Sweet Hotel,"I have been to numerous Crowne Plaza's worldwide. Again, they deliver at this one. From the super kind folks at reception, to the gorgeous, well-appointed room, to the lively and reasonably priced bar and restuarant(s), it would be difficult to issue a complaint of any sort. It is for the above reasons that I issue this hotel a solid 5 (five) stars! 
 ",5,2016,06,09
250,Perfect hotel before your flight,Modern hotel with a quality restaurant and bar facility. Nightly reception and drinks for club level guests. A quick and efficient shuttle whisks you right to the airport early in the morning and throughout the day. I would stay here again definitely.,5,2016,06,09
250,Average hotel,Ok hotel but not great. Ok for only one night layover. The room is dated and bed and pillow is hard. Bathroom moldy.needs good remodeling.  Not much choices on restaurants around. Good perk is shuttle service to airport.  Touzai restaurant ok but not great . ,3,2016,06,09
250,'Free upgrade'?,"My partner and I visited this hotel for a concert 
When we first arrived we were told we were in luck as we had a free upgrade however to our disappointment we were upgraded to the room we actually booked!
The room was lovely and very modern and the bed was very comfortable 
We were told we had lounge access however were not told that the lounge is not open for anything other than self service coffee and soft drinks at the weekend which was bitterly disappointing
The next morning we went for breakfast only to be told that we were only entitled to a cold continental breakfast and that if we went for a cooked breakfast there would be a supplement
That day we were out most of the day but returned at night for a night cap
We went to use our voucher for a free drink but we're interested as we ordered
Honestly what happened to the Dublin hospitality???
Only reason I gave this hotel 3* was due to the room and the cleanliness of it
We were so disappointed as my partner has been an IHG member for yrs and this is the first time he has not been sent feed back for a hotel

",3,2016,06,08
250,Great place to stay before flight,"This hotel is not on the airport property as others are, but is very close with a free airport shuttle running every 20 minutes from early a.m. to midnight (verify times but this is how it was for us).  The room we stayed in was a corner room, very well appointed and quiet.  A big + was the choice of outlets by the desk - Ireland, US and the three round prong type.  I loved not having to unpack my adapter!  At the end of the trip, the small things count!  Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,06,08
250,Comfortable and convenient,"After a long haul flight we found this hotel very comfortable for an overnight stop. Free shuttle bus pick up delivery to the airport was useful. The bus pulls into Zone 14 for pick up and drops off at respective terminals. Room was very well appointed, with some thoughtful touches like nice biscuits for peckish late arrivals and complimentary bottled water.

Breakfast buffet had an extensive range of hot and cold foods, nobody could leave hungry. A bargain at €15.95pp.

In front of the hotel is a large park with walking/running paths. Just the thing for getting some fresh air and cleaning out the jet induced cobwebs.",5,2016,06,06
250,Good hotel close to the airport,"The hotel was fine but not great.  I am giving it a very good rating because it seems that by Irish standards (I visited 2 other hotels on this trip) this was actually a very good hotel.  Free shuttle from the airport, relatively quick check in, helpful staff at reception, excellent quality breakfast.  Breakfast variety wan't huge but everything was very fresh and tasty.  The twin room was small and the single beds were very small, the bathroom was spacious and the cleaning was ok.   So nothing really to complain about but it didn't wow and for a 4 star some thing could have been better (simple things like more kinds of tea offered in the tea tray).  I would still recommend this hotel for airport or conference.",4,2016,06,05
250,Nice Hotel but worn out,"had a early flight so i decided to spend my last night in Ireland in the Hotel, staff were nice and helpful but you get the sense that the hotel had seen better days. the room i stayed in was a bit stuffy and i didn't get the chance to try the breakfast because of my early flight.",3,2016,06,05
250,Breakfast at 6am! As if!,"This buffet is crap. Almost nothing hot was ready at 0600. Some items began to appear. It's 0630 (time to leave for my flight), and still no waffles. Other items suck. Bacon...nasty. Croissants...limp and lame. Thank God this was complimentary; I wouldn't pay for this mess. Old Country Buffet has s better buffet, and that ain't saying much. ",2,2016,06,05
250,Amazing food,"We stayed next door at the holiday inn express, but chose to dine here on recommendation of the lady who checked us in next door.  Not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality, quantity and service.  Katie, our waitress was attentive and friendly and a real asset.  (Even to putting a piece of her notepad under the wobbly leg of our table). Starters were incredible followed by fillet steaks, cooked to perfection. Local beer and cider served, so when in Ireland.....  It's a shame we were only staying 1 night, as they would certainly have received a return visit if we were there longer.",5,2016,06,05
250,Conference Weekend/ Awards Dinner,"I managed an event here recently on behalf of the organisation I work for (with very particular requirements, due to the high numbers of wheelchair users attending) and was incredibly pleased with the outcomes on site. 
The hotel is of an extremely high quality, with recent refurbs on many of the meeting rooms/ bedrooms also. The 4th floor holds a number of executive suites and an executive private bar/ area where one can escape and find some quiet time.
Our conference utilised all 3 sections of 'The Redwood Suite', the pre-conference area and also the conference foyer.  The hotel turned the room around in no time at all for our Awards Dinner there in the evening.  The Redwood suite is a beautiful room with excellent space, AV etc, and with a very attractive decor. 
The physical layout of the room was very easily changed for our evening event, to allow the bar area to be integrated into the room.The interior lighting and decor on the tables allowed our evening guests (many of whom has attended the day event) to feel as if they were seated in an entirely different space. 
Areas of the hotel / experience throughout the conference weekend I was especially impressed with are as follows:
Expert attention to the function sheet/ my requests in lead up to event (Judith Graham) 
A comprehensive and detailed handover meeting to the Duty manager (Paul..)
Careful attention paid to our room bookings and billing requirements
All aspects of our meetings/ rooms/ requests were handled efficiently, and courteously.
The staff there have all been trained also in 'Disability Awareness' and treated all clients with incredible care and respect. 
The bedrooms are beautiful, incredibly comfortable and I slept brilliantly! (not always the case on a busy conference weekend!)
The catering throughout the entire weekend - all of our delegate breaks/ lunches/awards dinner etc was excellent -we received many positive comments on our post event evaluations.
Service overall was among the best I've experienced in a hotel over the last number of years. I was really very impressed.
In particular, the Duty Manager who worked on our event over the weekend was outstanding - Paul. He worked tirelessly, with superb attention to detail and professionalism. He is a credit to the Crowne Plaza Team.  Everything we needed was in place at the  times we requested, any late changes or additions that arose he attended to swiftly and with no problem at all. He really helped our event run so smoothly on site. 
The Crowne Plaza team were incredibly helpful to us,also helping us resolve some of our parking concerns for our fleet buses. 
I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone - whether for a meeting/ conference or even a private stay. It's a beautiful hotel, close to the airport, shops - opposite a gorgeous park - you'll love it.",5,2016,06,02
250,Great Hotel,this is my go to hotel when I'm catching an early flight back to the U.S. After visiting home (Donegal).  The price is good and the quality is much better than other airport hotels. It's close to the airport with a shuttle service but far enough that you are actually staying in a hotel where the locals live near by. Rooms are great and clean.,5,2016,06,02
250,Unsatisfied,"We stayed here on our last night in Ireland in order to get to the airport in time the next morning. This hotel was average at best. The decor and finishings were nice enough, but the bed was so hard that i considered just laying in the floor. My brother stayed here as well and said his bed was ok. Maybe they use different mattresses  through out the hotel.

While the hotel is located close to the airport, there are not many options for food near. The hotel bar had a pricey menu for what they were offering. 

One positive, they offer a free shuttle to the airport that runs frequently throughout the day. This helps reduce the stress of getting to the airport. ",3,2016,06,01
250,Amazing hotel,"Loved the place. People are so friendly. Went for dinner in touzai restaurant and food was very nice. Late checkout was given without problem. Beautiful decor and everyone who I encountered were really helpful and friendly!!No problem stay!!I will definitely recommend this hotel to others and will certainly stay again!!

",5,2016,05,28
250,Nice conference and airport hotel,"Nice and clean hotel with good service and free shuttle bus from 4:00 AM,
It takes 20-25 min with taxi to the city center. Small park just next to the hotel for trekking and water and fruit in the lobby when you are done, good service.",4,2016,05,22
250,Convient and very comfortable,"We stayed on night prior to our flight and found this hotel to be clean, comfortable and the staff were very friendly. It would be my choice if I were to stay there again. They provided a shuttle service to the airport terminal.",4,2016,05,22
250,Excellent first trip to Dublin,"Stayed three nights here on my first visit to Dublin. Only ten minutes from airport. Very welcoming and we'll set out hotel. Rooms very spacious and well appointed.
Very good buffet breakfast - perfect for a traditional full Irish Breakfast.
Hotel bar is very good place to sample Guinness and grab a snack.
About 15 minutes taxi ride into town or you can catch a bus nearby into Dublin which takes about 25 minutes.",5,2016,05,22
250,New years time away,"Me my husband and two children stayed in the hotel for the new year, our first impression when we walked in was breath taking, lovely staff amazing food, beautiful hotel, staff helped us find things to do while there, would stay here again. X X",5,2016,05,20
250,Great place for a conference,"Had our Biennial Delegate Conference here a few weeks ago and extremely pleased. Facilities excellent, staff always obliging and willing to help. Bedrooms very comfortable and food good. Well worth considering for conference / meeting room hire.",4,2016,05,19
250,Shuttle service 👌🏻,Tony was great he made sure we made it on time for our flight and the hotel was within 10 mins of the Dublin airport.  Clean nice and convenient to reach the city of Dublin.  The hotel went above and beyond to ensure our happiness and to reduce stress.  Would recommend staying here to anyone especially if you'll be flying in or out of Dublin airport.  ,5,2016,05,19
250,Did the job !,"It was convenient to stay here for one night and the shuttle to the airport leaves every 20 minutes..

Spacious rooms and bathrooms , good free wifi , polite employees made for a pleasant but brief return stay.

Had drinks in the bar and service was friendly ..

A good choice at the right price before flying out .",4,2016,05,19
250,"Lovely hotel, Great staff",This is a beautiful hotel from the lobby to your room. It is conveniently located ~2 km from the Dublin airport making it very easy to get to the airport. The staff was exceptionally nice. Parking is a shared lot with the Holiday Inn next door. The person at the counter helped me bring the bags up to the room.  I would definitely recommend staying here if you come to Dublin.,5,2016,05,18
250,Get ready to be nickel and dimed...,"Had reasonable expectations for the place, only to realize you have to park about 700-800ft away (not a big deal but I HD a lot of luggage to sort through before my flight out, so had to make multiple trips on blistered feet from previous day's hike). Oh, and that parking costs money...per hour you're parked there. 

Also, if you don't specify online when you book (which I didn't see an option for) then you're most likely only booking the ROOM ONLY with no breakfast (not even an American style free continental with yogurt and what not). Add another €10 per person for breakfast -.- 

Rooms were large which is nice. Huge bathtub, comfortable bed etc. and plugs for USA, UK and Ireland type outlets. But my ceiling was falling apart and there was a super loud mechanical noise coming from our bathroom 24/7. 

Overall just a kind of crappy place. Maybe my expectations were too high, since the Bed and Breakfasts here in Ireland were AMAZING for the rest of my two week journey.",2,2016,05,17
250,A plus front desk,FYI - I have never been here before and do not know anyone connected to this hotel.  I was not sure what to expect as I booked via Priceline but the place is really nice and the check in was very smooth - got free upgrade without asking to executive room and lounge access.  And I got comped for parking even though I did not ask.  That is what I call real customer service and that is why I will return.Room was lovely,4,2016,05,17
250,Fantastic service! ,"What an amazing welcome when I landed after a long day travelling- I was greeted by John who was so professional at reception and got me checked in straight away, made great genuine conversation and was really friendly. Just what you want at the end of a long day. Room is beautiful too - and food delicious in the bar. 
Will definitely be back ",5,2016,05,17
250,"Nice hotel, restaurant al la cartel not so great","We stayed at the hotel this weekend, 13-15 May and were very impressed and thought we had made a good choice as we were here visiting my son & daughter who live not far from the hotel position was ideal, the rooms were very well laid out and roomy, bed was very comfortable and staff very helpful, my dad had a problem with his tv and somehow managed to order a film when he was trying to watch the news (he's 85) however the reception staff soon sorted that out. I thought it would be a good idea to book the a la carte restaurant for the evening meal, I ordered a rib eye well done and my partner ordered a Caesar salad, my steak came up cremated, and my partners salad which had prawns which were frozen, we were in a party of 5 and all the other meals were fine, it was really busy so against my better judgement listened to my partner and did not complain. Breakfast was superb so I think we were unlucky but it's not cheap in there otherwise I would have given 5 stars. A little tip eat in the bar although the food is general pub grub you have a bigger choice   ",4,2016,05,16
250,Over all it was very good,"Stayed for a weekend, the hotel is situated across a park and overall is in nice and quite, pleasant surroundings. Really loved the decor of rooms and the whole feel of the place. The staff were also helpful.",4,2016,05,14
250,Glad I Returned.,"This was my second visit, and I will now always book this hotel for my annual business trip to Dublin. So much to choose from. The quiet location, the comfortable beds, the atmosphere in the bar, the relaxed ambiance of the whole hotel, the restaurant, breakfast....... Just love the whole place.

Everywhere is clean well decorated, customer service is great, check in is fast. The bedroom was large and light, made working easy. The bed was really comfortable and I had two great night's sleep.

The atmosphere in the bar was great, unlike a lot of other hotels that seem sterile. A great mix of customers, football on the TV and a great choice of well cooked meals available in the bar at sensible prices.

Great customer service, staff all welcoming but not smothering. 

Overall a great place to stay and I will be returning again and again.",5,2016,05,14
250,Nice Stay,"My second time at this hotel and I have to say just as good as last time. Hotel room nice and clean with a big comfortable bed, allowing for a good nights sleep. Bar in the hotel was pleasing and had good quality food. I would stay at he hotel again in the future.",4,2016,05,12
250,Poor experience,"I stay at this hotel every fortnight and find it generally very good.

Despite my company spending c50k pa here, I was greeted poorly at reception, with ""we can't find your booking""

I hired a meeting room for 45 mins, and was not supplied coffee, given a phone that worked to contact services and was charged €100 for 1 hour, despite all being guests.

The room I requested, as always was for a quiet corner away from banging doors and lifts, the request and challenge was both ignored so I was kept awake till late and woken up from 5:45am with the Club lounge door slamming shut every minute.  (""We leave the door arm loose as if we tighten it, the door does not close and people can walk in"")

Bad experience",1,2016,05,12
250,Great Hotel That Sets The Bar for Airport Hotels,"I have stayed here many times when on business in Ireland and it never disappoints.  The hotel is always welcoming, has attractive decor and above average staff.  My room was large and well laid out with plenty of space for work and relaxation.  My only complaint regarding the room was that there was insufficient lighting and had only entry hall lights bathroom light and two beds lights, one of which was not working.  Thus  one half of the room was very dim and sadly this was the end with a desk as well as two chairs and a table.  On this occasion my wife wasn't with me but if she had been she would have had a problem in that the hair dryer was fixed into one of the desk drawers and although on the wall was a good size mirror there would have been totally inadequate light for her to dry her hair and apply her make-up etc.  However, this is my only complaint as the rest of the stay was exemplary.  We dined in the main bar as well as the main restaurant, Tozai.  Both were superb with a great variety of meal options to suit all tastes and pockets.  I used the Club Lounge and this is worth a special note of commendation.  It is a large room, well laid out and with comfortable tables and chairs.  The snacks provided are excellent and substantial, as is the standard of the wine.  The Club Lounge was presided over by Ciara and nothing was too much trouble for her.  She was friendly and highly efficient, and ensured that all guests needs were attended to throughout their visit to the Lounge, and all with a smile.  Ciara is a great asset to the Crowne Plaza and she has greatly improved the overall excellence of the Lounge.
I realise this review may seem effusive but excellence deserves recognition, and all other staff were also courteous, helpful and highly efficient from the Shuttle Bus driver to Reception and Bar and Restaurant employees.  This was one of those rare occasions where the entire experience was memorable for all the right reasons.",5,2016,05,11
250,Brilliant Beth,"Another great stay at the Crowne Plaza! All staff were helpful, especially beth she was immensely accommodating to my partner and I. She recommended we had dinner at the hotel which was delicious. She organised activities for the following day so we really immersed ourselves into the culture of Dublin. Highly recommend this Hotel!",5,2016,05,10
250,"Nice location by park, great service, quiet rooms","Relaxing location across street from park with walking trails. Quiet, comfortable accommodations with great service. Pub and restaurant food is very good. Couple of restaurants within walking distance provide some variety of staying several days. Airport shuttle but a hike to pick-up location. Definitely recommended.",5,2016,05,09
250,Excellent food and service ,We had lunch in the hotel today. Food was excellent and service was great. Anna was our waitress and was very helpful. The place was very relaxed and there were no delays in food and drinks coming out. Will be returning again in the near future.,5,2016,05,08
250,Great hotel,this was the last night of our family vacation and we stayed here because of the location to the airport. The hotel wonderful.  The best part of the night was the young lady who waited on us in the bar for dinner. Stephanie is an Irish girl who really did a great job. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2016,05,06
250,Mr ,"Excellent service ' hilton standard, good food an drinks reasonably priced, friendly staff ,nice and close to airport ! Lovely public park in front of hotel for more energetic guests!! 5 stars from me !",5,2016,05,06
250,Good place to rest and relax,"A good place to take your time to rest or you can go out and stroll around in the park infrom. If the weather is nice, it is so refreshing.
At z fourth floor lounge, served by Ciara, was a good relaxing time.",4,2016,05,04
250,Convenient and comfortable,"After a long flight, the extra attention paid to organise an early check in and upgrade was appreciated. The suite was large and offered an extremely comfortable bed and a large bathroom.  The breakfast was the usual fare but to a high standard with gluten free offerings. Staff were friendly and efficient. A very pleasant 24 hour stay.",5,2016,05,04
250,Bank holiday weekend stay,"Came to Dublin for the first time with 3 friends, had a free transfer bus from the airport to this hotel which was very convenient. We were tired from our early flight so the hotel let us check in 4 hours earlier (foc) which was a life saver as we all needed some rest. The hotel staff brought our luggage up,the room was a nice size with modern decor and lots of mirrors which is much needed for us girls. Two double beds were comfy and the bathroom had a bath tub aswell as a separate shower unit. The bar staff were very friendly and we had the best stay here. The bus stop was located close by and it cost around 20euros for a Taxi to and from the center. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks for a comfortable stay!",5,2016,05,04
250,great service,"Only stayed one night but have to say room, staff, breakfast excellent. Ate in the bar...delicious fish and chips! Also Kim Jones from reservations is a WONDERFUL ambassador for crowne plaza group. Well done to all concerned. Highly recommend! ",5,2016,05,03
250,Staff to be proud of,"I stayed here for 3 nights recently as a single guest due to my wife being in a nearby clinic for a serious back operation.  I was apprehensive about staying in a busy and popular hotel on my own. Fortunately the professional and friendly service I received quickly put me at ease. I was able to relax and concentrate on my wife and not feel awkward. The hotel is situated in a very convenient location to the airport, the m50 or dublin city. I would highly recommend the crowne plaza and fully intend going back with my wife when her recovery is complete. Thank you very much to all the friendly and professional staff. ",5,2016,05,02
250,Shame about the hot water in the bathroom,"Had an overnight stay, check in quick and efficient and room adequate but had no hot water to bath/shower.  Rang reception and they advised running water for 10 minutes - this is not what I expect both before and on the morning before a flight when I want to go to the airport.

Across the road is a lovely park for a walk to stretch your legs before or after a long haul flight from Dublin.",3,2016,05,01
250,Excellent staff,Attended an Irish dancing feis in Crown Plaza this weekend and have to praise the staff of the hotel who were all very helpful and courteous at all times especially Olga on reception who was extremely helpful to my daughter xxx,4,2016,05,01
250,"Olga, you're the best! ","We just arrived from a long day of travel and were greeted with the warmest welcome by Olga at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport. We are beginning our honeymoon and quite unexpectedly, there was a knock on the door of our room. It was Olga with a chilled bottle of Proseco, chocolates and the loveliest and most thoughtful card wishing us well as a couple. We are so absolutely touched! Thank you Olga for your hospitality! 

For those arriving from the airport, it is a quick trip to the hotel. There are restaurants on site as well as a room service option. We are more than pleased with the size and decor of our room and would definitely stay here again! ",5,2016,04,30
250,Nice room,"I stayed here my last night before leaving Ireland. The hotel staff was pleasant. Check-in and out were easy.

The room was on the slightly small side, but not bad. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. No noise. The room had a stand up shower as well as a tub. Water pressure was good.

In-room safe was the standard hotel safe. It was locked by the previous occupant, but the hotel had it open within 30 minutes. No further issues.

I was not impressed with the Touzai restaurant food for dinner or breakfast, but it was adequate.

The hotel is actually part of the Holiday Inn express next door and they share the same car parking. Car parking is 6 euro per day, but the front desk person gave me a voucher to exit the car park for free the next morning when I checked out. I don't know if this standard, but it was a nice surprise. They do offer regular shuttles to the airport for free for guests.",4,2016,04,29
250,Very friendly and efficient staff,"I was there on a business trip. I was supposed to stay  there for 3 nights. Upon my request, Daniel at reception kindly re-arranged the reservation so I spent the second night in the other Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dublin, closer to my working location and back to Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport for the 3rd night as my plane was leaving early the next morning. Bonus :  the room I got on the 3rd night  was upgraded to a suite !",5,2016,04,28
250,Transformation ongoing,"Very smooth checkin en checkout. Friendly staff. Decent bar when you are with a group.
Had access to the business lounge. But was disappointed with the breakfast. Ok, much more  quiet but i think more choice at the buffet.
Rooms are a little bit old.",4,2016,04,27
250,Weekend Away,"My second stay at the Crowne Plaza, commendable effort from all staff as usual especially Beth. Her mannerisim's were exceptional as always, it is essential to have a helpful and upmost professional receptionist like Beth. Could not fault any member of staff or hotel. Great location. Easy access to city and all other main routes. Overall great hotel, highly reccommended.",5,2016,04,26
250,Great location for The Helix,"This hotel was ideally located for North Dublin , a graduation in DCU ! The hotel was clean and the staff were lovely . Breakfast was good and the rooms had everything one needs . I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends  either for travelling from the airport or North Dublin events",5,2016,04,25
250,dinner,Restaurant was amazing  service was amazing Andrew was an excellent customer service. 5***** highly recommend. Its worth going to in an excellent location 20 mins from dublin city and 10 mins from the airport with free shuttle service as well,5,2016,04,24
250,Service ,"Had a fabulous time at the Crown plaza, great food and excellent service. Our waiter Anna was superb, very helpful, friendly and all round lovely Would definitely be coming back.
 The Singapore noodles are to dye for😍 and had the best tequila sunrise cocktail.
",5,2016,04,24
250,conference Weekend,"Fabulous Hotel in which to stay. Rooms comfortable and well laid out. Very elegant ensuite. Don't know why they had to empty the glass bottle bins at 6.30am though! Pillows could have been a bit better. Food was excellent. I was attending a conference and they catered well for a large group of people -Evening meals, breakfasts, and 1 dinner. Coffee on demand all day.would recommend it to anybody",4,2016,04,24
250,lovely evening meal and great friendly service,"I went for an evening meal tonight in the Touzai restaurant which was really fantastic. Andrew dealt with me throughout and I have to say his recommendations were spot on and he was extremely pleasant. The Singapore noodles were excellent. 
5 star service. Thank you.",5,2016,04,23
250,Unfortunate stay,"Stayed here with my fiancé a night before I flew home to the USA.  While the beds are very comfortable and the room and bathrooms are clean, the walls are extremely thin.  We could hear conversations between the family that stayed across the room from is and they were up all night long.  It was very difficult  to get a good night sleep with so much racket going on.  If the hotel was to invest in thicker walls or even have a designated floor that is for quiet occupants it would improve the experience.  But good rate and shuttle service to the hotel was on time and friendly.  ",3,2016,04,20
250,Excelent service,"I've been staying at this hotel for more than 3 years regularly and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Just the opposite: the service is really helpful and thoughtful, specially Olga, one of the receptionists. The Hotel is always clean and quiet and the surroundings are very nice to have a walk.  The breakfast is highly appealing. 

if I had to highlight an objection, it would be the wifi sometimes is not strong enough inside the room specially in the upper floor.",5,2016,04,19
250,Lovely hotel,"Hotel is lovely although about 10 minute drive from the airport. 

The people on check in were very friendly & helpful
Rooms are nice and the bed is comfortable.
We ate in the restaurant where the food was ok but we were served by a waiter called Andrew who was helpful and friendly.  
Would definitely recommend ",5,2016,04,17
250,Not a bad place ,Nice hotel clean tidy rooms clean bathrooms fresh beds quick check in bar was nice for a quiet drink a bit out of town so would only recommend if you were driving not a hotel for more than one night with kids as no amenitys for kids in all 9 out of 10 ,4,2016,04,17
250,Excellent service!,"Quick note to thank you for a lovely stay. Special thanks go out to Daniel the manager, who was happy to help out as we had a few minor issues. The hotel is beautiful, classy and elegant and set in the most amazing setting, definitely will be back soon.",5,2016,04,16
250,Lovely hotel conveniently located,"As a frequent user of this hotel, I must say the service is excellent. I forgot my iPad once before an early flight and staff kept it aside for me. I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms and it was very pleasant. Nice bright colour scheme. Beth, at reception, was extremely helpful. Top marks overall.",5,2016,04,16
250,Great Hotel and Very helpful Staff,"The hotel is very near to the airport and about 20 minutes from the city center via Taxi.
The rooms were good and comfy. Were there for a week. My sincerest thanks to OLGA, SHUBHAM AND JOHN (Front office ) for taking such good care us.
Thanks for making us feel so welcomed. Thanks to the staff of Touzai for your hospitality.",5,2016,04,15
250,Great park location & good hotel,"We enjoyed our one day and night here before an early morning flight.  We arrived early and were able to check in immediately, this is worth so much when you are tired.
Hotel is situated about 15 minutes from the airport opposite a lovely park.
We had booked a club floor room, the room was fine, clean, comfortable bed, great bathroom with both bath and shower cubicle.  
Not much of view, car park and staff smoking but it was fine.
Went down to the bar for lunch, reasonably priced and huge portions of very nice food.  Used the club lounge for drinks in the evening, excellent staff & service.
Room service sandwiches were also good and politely delivered.
Checked out very early and used the complimentary bus to the airport along with lots of airline staff.
Would recommend to everyone.",4,2016,04,13
250,Horrible smell,"Just spent a night there... They are refurbishing the Executive floor and it smells paint like hell.
Hotel is overall pretty poor with old furniture and zero charm.
Dinner at the restaurant was ok with good service but the table was hidden in a corner and extremely small to accomodate two people
I will avoid it next time and look for a room in the city center",1,2016,04,13
250,Very Helpful,"I recently spent a weekend at the Crown plaza santry for a business meeting. It was a very pleasant stay. I had one difficulty, my keycard would not work on several occasions, I was initially annoyed but John at reception was extremely efficient with his help. He explained why they did not work (we had too many cards on the go with 3 sharing the room). He gave me access immediately and sent a bottle of wine and fruit platter to my room. Thanks for acknowledging the problem.",4,2016,04,12
250,Ripped Off,Checked in Sunday 4/10/16. Heat took a long time to work. Turned on the shower and the handle fell off.  Went to the front desk and asked for a wake up call as I was flying back to the U.S. the next morning. No wake up call so I woke up 1/2 hour late. Called the front desk and asked them what happened they said they did not know and I was on the list(this I know as I had to sign for the wake up call  when i requested it. The man at the desk said he would have the manager take care of it when we checked out. I asked them to call a cab for me as I didn't have enough time to take their shuttle as I was now late which he did.So I checked out no manager just the man telling me to write my email address down and the manager would be in touch. I asked why do you have signs all over the place saying if you don't receive the requested wake up call your stay is free then? He could only tell me that the manager would email me. Then he proceeded to tell me the hotel took care of the cab for us.....I guess that was all a lie to as when I got to the airport the driver was not paid by the hotel so I had to pay the 12 euros. Didn't ask them to pay for my cab but why would he say they took care of it when they didn't. Would not recommend this hotel very misleading and dishonest.,1,2016,04,12
250,excellent hotel,Room was very clean and spot on temperature wise. Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. The restaurant was very good.We had a camp bed added for our son and my only criticism was that it was very uncomfortable. All in all though a great atmosphere and we would would have happily stayed a few days.,5,2016,04,11
250,Very Nice,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights in April for a Business trip to Dublin.
Lovely comfortable room with everything you could expect.
If you do not book a breakfast included room you can book it the night before and pay just 10 Euro which is very good value.

Free shuttle to Airport, Great Staff and great service.
Wifi a little weak in the rooms but adequate.",4,2016,04,11
250,Crown Plaza airport Dublin,"This hotel has a good location for the business traveler who are using Dublin airport.
You get a free shuttle to from airport for this hotel. 
But beside this there is nothing to do much. I would not recommend for a family stay in this hotel. 
Price is little over in my opinion. If you are travelling late night or early morning recommended to stay.",3,2016,04,10
250,first  visit this year,this is the first of three trade shows we will be doing this year at the crowne plaza we have been doing trade shows here for about 10 years and I can honestly say that the service is constantly excellent there are so many members of staff that strive to help that its unfare to name themjust incase I miss anyone out  but I feel I need to mention a few   Ciara in the club lounge  peter in the bar  Brendan  and Daniel  paul   Stefan  Judith are just a few  all these people make you feel very valued   we will be showing here again  I have no problem in recommending this hotel to anyone   although  I am here on business I would have no problem to use the hotel as a base for a holiday   the  hotel is undertaking a face lift so that will make it even better,5,2016,04,08
250,A lovely hotel.,"I stayed here in March, for one night only. Great location to and from the airport. Shuttle service was good, although the small bus appeared to be very old.  As an IHG member I was upgraded to an executive room, upon my request.  Very pleasant staff.  Room was large, comfortable and very modern. Good restaurant, and the perks of a members lounge for cocktails. I highly recommend this hotel and will continue to stay here, whenever I fly in and out of Dublin.",5,2016,04,05
250,Very welcoming....,"Unfortunately no hot water in our room, maybe because the hotel was full but both the welcome at the Front Desk and by Ciara in the Club Lounge made up for that. Thanks Ciara especially for her great hospitality. 😀",4,2016,04,05
250,Fabulous hotel and staff,"Well as a spire ambassador I have stayed in a lot of IHG hotels and this is a gem. The rooms are lovely and are being refurbished as we speak. The new rooms are so comfortable and relaxing to be in, with calming colour schemes and refreshing soft  furnishings . The thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff as the welcome you get is amazing and they don't forget a face or a name. Beth the lady on check in was most informative, smiley and nothing was too much trouble, she gave us time and a real genuine interest in our trip which in a busy hotel is brilliant. You really feel that you are treated well here. We got upgraded at check in and that was wonderful as my wife loves the spa baths and so she was elated. The club lounge is great with a beer and wine selection and I must say your glass never gets below half full. The food selection was nice and had both hot and cold canapés . The lady in attendance really keeps an eye on everyone and her hosting skills are spot on. We have come here again a few days later and have been treated once again to the staffs wonderful customer relationship skills. Again we have eaten in the bar for lunch and again it was lovely food and plentiful and the lady who served us was really pleasant. I must say that other hotels need to take note of how these staff are as to us it has made a massive impact and we would choose this hotel out of others again in this area on our return. So all in all two very nice separate nights in a lovely hotel with staff that make you feel special. Thank you to you all from Mark and Diane Butcher",5,2016,04,04
250,Lives up to the billing,"Stayed overnight pending s flight back to early next morning.

Lives up to the billing of this classification of hotel with an extra sense of pride in what it is offering.
Can't fault it.
Set off on your journey in relaxed fashion.",5,2016,04,03
250,Really like this hotel!,"I love this hotel.
Regular shuttle buses to and from the airport. Excellent. efficient and friendly check in at reception. Lovely bedroom with very comfortable bed. Large bathroom with both bath and shower cabinet. Big, fluffy towels. Hospitality tray. Proper hairdryer, not the horrible tube dryer type.. Large wardrobe with proper hangers.
Quiet room. Efficient and prompt room service.
My family and myself all stay there now when visiting Ireland.",5,2016,04,02
250,Olga was wonderful!,"We left an awful B&B at 9:30 at night and arrived at the Crown Plaza. Olga greeted me with a huge smile, calm demeanor, and expressed how sorry she was to hear about the B&B and how hopefully, she could turn our stay around. She DID! She quickly got us checked, finding a lovely room, gave us all the details and directions we needed to know and directed us to our room. About 20 min later she called to make sure that we were happy with our accommodations and wish us a good nights sleep. I will most definitely be sending folks to the Crown Plaza and Olga. Job very well done! Many many thanks Olga for changing the ending of our 10 day Ireland stay from dreadful to fabulous! The hotel is wonderful - I highly recommend it.",5,2016,03,31
250,Mr A Pacey,"Good location and food. Slightly over priced but good hotel and staff.
Excellent shopping and location if you do not want to spend all the time in Dublin city centre. Lots of things to do in walking distance",4,2016,03,30
250,Excellent in all ways!,"I had to stay in Dublin over the period of July 2015 to April 2016. After November 2015 and till the end of my stay there, I chose to stay at Crowne Plaza in Santry, and I never changed again.
This is a fantastic hotel, wonderful bedrooms, spacey, clean and with all the amenities necessary to make a hotel feel like home, excellent staff, and fantastic food both at the bar or the restaurant. All the staff were excellent, but I must say special thanks to Olga at the reception who is a true angel with her help all the time, Ciara in the lounge that was always there to serve another glass of wine to help me get rid of the stress of the day and Viera in the restaurant, always friendly and making sure that my dinner is always served on time and according to my tastes. Maybe I am forgetting some names but those 3 ladies I mentioned, really made my life all those months easier. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anybody that wants a great hotel in a quiet location near the airport.",5,2016,03,30
250,Treasure at Reception.,"I arrived on a Monday Night.
Turns out my prepaid reservation was for the following night.
the wonderful lady at reception sorted it there and then , no fuss and Upgraded me.
What a Relief, I think her name is Olga, she is a Treasure.
The Rooms are excellent, service fantastic, really quiet.
My ""go to "" Hotel near Dublin Airport.
Great Breakfast.",5,2016,03,29
250,Excellent airport hotel,"Very nice airport hotel. As Spire Elite was upgraded to Club floor, but unfortunately Club Lounge doesn't operate on weekends (coffee still available, and continental breakfast available in main restaurant, or full Irish for EUR5 upgrade cost - well worth it).
Regular shuttle bus available to/from airport.
Friendly staff.
Bar had some character, which is rare for an airport hotel.",5,2016,03,28
250,excellent service,"the hotel is in a great location for the Dublin airport, the staff were very helpful and the facilities were excellent,  the food was very good but we had to wait a very long time for my wife's desert, the problem was handled very well",5,2016,03,25
250,Great Hotel,"I've just come back from a business trip to Dublin and this hotel was very convenient. Pick up from the airport was seamless, although the bus they use could do with an update. 5 mins from the airport and you're welcomed by very friendly staff. All aspects of the hotel were great and it's in a nice quiet location ",5,2016,03,25
250,Brilliant Bar and reception,"Peter and the team in the bar make sure it's a great place to get a drink, grab a bite to eat or just watch the big match.....and the team on reception always make sure a stay in the hotel is a pleasure when nothing is too much trouble.....thanks for making every stay away from home an enjoyable one.",5,2016,03,23
250,Spot On,"Stayed at this hotel at the start and end of a short trip away. Staff are very polite and courteous, food is of a high standard and the rooms are lovely. Breakfast in the morning is buffet style and run from 6.30am to 10.20 am no need to be rushing in the mornings you can have a lie in. Would recommend this hotel",5,2016,03,21
250,Room 226,"Easy checkin, lovely staff on check in.  Room was ok...bit dowdy but one of the beds was so creaky!!  Bedroom very warm and air con very noisy.  Bar/Restaurant lovely.  While we enjoyed our stay a good nights sleep for all would have made a huge difference.....change the beds!!",3,2016,03,21
250,Plaza Northwood,Great hotel modern and clean. I spent Patrick's day having drinks with friends in the bar. The atmosphere was great with live music. A big thanks to the staff and to Gavin for keeping the drinks flowing,4,2016,03,20
250,Birthday Treat. ,"We Arrived on the 16th of March, from the moment we arrived to the minute we left everyone was so nice & helpful.The rooms were very clean/big. 
Big shout out to the staff you were great, except the housekeepers they were miserable. See you soon",5,2016,03,18
250,Caring front of house staff.,"My son was undergoing surgery in the Sports Clinic and this hotel gives a special rate to anyone attending the sports clinic who needs accommodation and family members. 
I met Olga and Irina at the front desk and they were more than helpful during my stay. They went out of their way to make my stay stress free. I was offered a token for a drink during my stay and I thought it was a very nice touch. The breakfast was to die for and I was amazed at the availability of the fresh honey from the honeycomb a lovely touch. Met a manager called Andrew who impressed me also. I will certainly stay in this hotel not just when up at the sports clinic but on any other occasion that this location would suit. Well done front of house as for customer care, friendliness and understanding.",5,2016,03,18
250,Very convenient for early morning flight (DUB airport),"This is a very busy hotel, the bar was full and the check in rather slow (only 1 person who was on the phone and a queue at reception). We stayed here only for 1 night as we had a very early flight and the hotel is only 5 Minutes from the airport.  The bed are very comfortable and the room was quiet.  Check out was speedy.  
What we didn't like was that we had a toilet/bath room for disabled and I will ask for a normal bath room the next time.",4,2016,03,17
250,Early bird meal,Went to this restaurant last night for the early bird menu. Was really impressed with the choice and the meal itself was top quality. Was served by Lionel and Christophe who were both extremely friendly and polite. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2016,03,16
250,Great bar man!!,"Decided too come down after hearing friends talk so highly of this hotel.(I will be back very soon) had a spot of lunch in the bar when I arrived there was a great vibe about the place I decided to order a drink and was a little indecisive so asked the bar man who seemed to be running the whole show throughout the hotel bar his name was Darell,what this young man  recommend I could have stayed all day(cocktails bear liquires,coffees he could do it all) food was great very clean but my hats off too that bar man not sure if he is bar manager either way very friendly nature and a credit too this hotel. Can't wait too return too this hotel also very close too Dublin airport very convenient. Not. Bad word too say ",5,2016,03,15
250,Good Choice,"Clean, modern.  Staff very polite and helpful.  Very close to Dublin Airport with free shuttle.  Nice amenities.  Good food.  Good value for the price.  Would choose this hotel again when traveling thru Dublin

",5,2016,03,15
250,Good airport hotel,"We chose this hotel because we had a morning flight out of Dublin, and the hotel suited our purposes well. Our room was small, but very clean, very modern, and we had everything we needed. Staff was very helpful getting us into the city center for our last night out in Dublin. Free shuttle bus runs about every 15 minutes to the airport. Very convenient.",4,2016,03,13
250,Stuck but helpful and informative staff made the difference.,"We arrived from a long hual journey only to realise that the reservation I had made at this hotel was for the next day. I spoke to the receptionist named Olga who arranged a room for us. Gosh she saw the exhaustion and panic on our faces - both my husband and i and jumped into action trying and successfully alivating the panic. She arrange a room and we set off for a well deserved rest. Tony the porter was also on hand with relevant information should we require further assistance

The initiative Olga took to ensure weary travellers are relieved of further stress of having to search for another hotel made all the difference to our experience. . Great, helpful, friendly services. Thank you, we will most certainly be staying at your hotel again.",5,2016,03,13
250,The easy warm ways at check in ,Arijay and Olga had my room / keys ready ... And a calm gentle welcome .. Nice after a long drive from Connemara.  Tony at Reception obviously loves his new job ... John was at front desk prev day and is becoming like a ' General'. ( manager). A great team at this hotel is the norm.  A treasure of C P hotels ,5,2016,03,12
250,Crown Plaza hotel and exelent bar ,"Just woudl like to sher my experience after visiting the hotel and hotel bar, it is very nice place and friendly staff, with outstanding barman Darell:) hi is really cracker!!! Me and my friends had really good fun there I would highly recommend for everyone. ",5,2016,03,12
250,Plaza northwood ,"friendly staff, excellent restaurant and superb service there from Darell.  With a close proximity to the airport and a short bus ride to the City Center, this is an excellent hotel choice. I would highly recommend this property.",5,2016,03,12
250,A+ service,"This hotel has not just the perfect location, but also the most amazing staff you can imagine. They make you feel welcome, and they pay attention to your needs in any situation. The girls at the business lounge (Ciara in the evenings, and the brunette girl - sorry, I don't know your name, but you were really nice - in the mornings), and Olga at the reception threat you like a long time not seen family friend.
P.s.: the young guy at the reception (maybe he was a dutch trainee, because he was wearing a small flag brooch) was handling problems amazingly professional and efficiently. Thank you all!",5,2016,03,11
250,"Great Hotel , staff exceptional","I stay quite often at the hotel for business purpose mostly but lately i find myself staying just to enjoy some off days. The staff surely make my stay worth it everytime. Being a gold member i feel always privileged. One of my favourite staff member is Irena in reception who does a great job, always greets me with a smile, helps me with everything i need and recommend the best places to visit in Dublin and cost. Tip for everyone, visit the cliffs. The club lounge is very relaxing and the bar fun. It's perfect located near the airport and not to far from the city so that is a plus. Will be back!",5,2016,03,11
250,"Top end chain, great choice for the airport","Sometimes it doesn't really matter what a hotel is like because you get in late and dash for your flight early,  so a clean room and decent mattress will do the job

Truth is, I didn't actually stay in this hotel, but had to spend 3 days next  door in the Holiday Inn, but I spent my whole time in the Crown Plaza because the Holiday Inn Express is, well you know, the Holiday Inn.

The reason? The Crown Plaza  is a lovely place to be in, quality, quiet comfy public areas, a decent restaurant, above average sports bar, way above average bar food, places to do a bit of work. Everything you want, well maintained

What elevates it above other hotels on the airport offer is that you can actually go for a walk in the park across the road and stroll down to a retail park if that's your thing. It doesnt feel like you are a prisoner within the one way motorway madness that is Dublin Airport.

The staff are great. I actually sloped off, accidentally your honour, honestly, without paying for my pint. I returned a few hours later and fessed up and they just had a laugh about it, didnt make me feel like the dope I was.

This is a good chain and this one is well done. ",4,2016,03,11
250,Happy to accomodate ,"We are members of the International Hotels Group (IHG) so booked our stay with Crowne Plaza.
We checked into our room & had an issue with the safe in the room.
The staff were up in our room in a flash & realised that there was a fault with the safe. We were told that reception would contact us shortly. Within 5 minutes, we get asked if we were happy to change rooms & they offered a complementary upgrade on our room which was wonderful. We then went for drinks in the club lounge & was totally spoilt by the wonderful service from Ciara in the lounge. She went above & beyond to make sure everyone feels like they are at home.
You couldn't wish for better service from anyone.",5,2016,03,10
250,The extra mile,"We stayed here for 1 night in February.   We were en route to Miami
for Honeymoon when our flight was cancelled due to bad weather.   We were devastated to lose a night on our luxury honeymoon but the team at the Crowne  Plaza pulled out all the stops!  We arrived before checkin, they quickly arranged a room for us and upgraded us to an executive room.  A few mins later the porter arrived with a key card to the executive lounge.   They invited us to enjoy complimentary nibbles and drinks from 5-7pm.  We had a lovely meal in the bar and relaxed with a few drinks before having an early night.  The staff are so friendly and really go the extra mile to make sure all of their guests enjoy their stay.  I've stayed in many if not all of the airport hotels and this is by far the best? ",5,2016,03,10
250,Fantastic friendly service. ,"I'm a regular visitor to the hotel and the service is above and beyond. The staff are very friendly. I came to the lounge tonight and was warmly welcomed and remembered by Ciara, her friendly personality is one of many reasons I stay here. Thanks you. ",5,2016,03,07
250,"Airport hotel, good",Stayed one night between flights. Shuttle bus relatively easy to find and it was on time. Approx five mins to hotel. Hotel in a nice area with a big park opposite. Reception friendly. Room was fine. Eat in the bar which is friendly and busy. Good service. Breakfast is good. Self service with hot food. Hotel is smart with some nice sculptures in the ballroom / conference area.,5,2016,03,06
250,exceptional service and hospitality,"warm friendly staff, excellent restaurant and superb service there from Lionel and Justin and very pleasant bar. Ciaran ensured top standards of service and customer satisfaction. Definitely the place to stay in the airport area. Relaxed stress free environment and top class conference facilities. Looking forward to returning.  Peter, March 2016",5,2016,03,02
250,Airport transport let's the hotel down badly,"I been have visiting the Crowne Plaza at Dublin Airport for the past 9 years where the staff and quality of the hotel has always been excellent.  As a Holiday Inn Platinum Elite member I stay in many of these across the world and the Dublin Airport compares favourable to any of the others.
However as an airport hotel, efficient  transport to and from the airport is critical.  Reducing the bus service to two an hour is ridiculous, it means that in an hour you have a 90 second window to catch the bus as that is how long he spends at the airport. 
As a result I shall stay elsewhere as I have spent one two many cold, wet nights waiting for the bus.",3,2016,02,29
250,The Bar,"Having only moved to the northwood region, myself and a couple friends were looking for somewhere decent to have a drink. Our past couple of experiences have been extremly enjoyable. The bar was being run by a barman called Ciaran a very helpful and professional barman. He is a true credit to the establishment. We have for sure found a friendly environment for a local stop off for food and a drink and we will certainly not hesitate in returning. So thank you to Ciaran. ",5,2016,02,28
250,Great for business stay,"Have used this hotel a few times now and the experience gets better and better.
Reception staff were friendly and informative.
Rooms are pleasant with first class amenities
Very busy bar , but with excellent table service.
Fusion restaurant is excellent with a varied menu although some staff a bit off on my second night when i only wanted a couple of starters and not a main course.(take note Ruslan.)
But the hidden gem here if you can get access is the club lounge, both nights staffed by Ciara who had a cheery word for everybody and did an excellent job of looking after everyone.",5,2016,02,28
250,The Bar,"The bar was very well run by a nice Irish gentleman called Ciaran, just a nod of the head and he'd have the next round on. Nobody was left waiting on a drink. Floor staff were very pleasant too! Drink was a little expensive but the atmosphere was lovely",5,2016,02,27
250,Best Customer Service in Ireland,"I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel, especially Beth in Reception.  Our trip to Ireland was memorable because Beth made it her personal mission to ensure we had a wonderful trip, including helping us select tours, arranging for cabs to get us from the hotel to the tour busses and back, explaining everything from tipping to nightlife and asking us to report back to her to make sure that everything went as planned.  She always greeted us with a friendly smile and genuinely wanted to know how we were enjoying our trip each day.   In addition to Beth, every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful, especially our servers in the Pub.  The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  We would highly recommend this hotel for excellent customer service, friendly staff and great food at great prices.",5,2016,02,26
250,Top class service from Peter,"My server was Peter....a cute wee thing he was too, his service was more than helpful! He got the music changed for us, which was very loud jazz music.. Very friendly server, without being over familiar. Food was excellent also!",5,2016,02,24
250,Excellent Service,"I have stayed at this Crowne Plaza hotel for the past 8 months, on average 4 nights each week. The Hotel location is convenient for the Airport with a regular shuttle bus service, and there is a public park across the road which is ideal for joggers or a brisk walk. I have found the service to be exceptional across the board and the staff are always attentive, polite and cheerful. In particular I’d like to thank Ciaran (bar area / restaurant) for his great service and a big thanks to all the hotel staff for making all my stays an enjoyable experience.",4,2016,02,24
250,A Crowne Plaza Horel Dublin Airport A Hidden Treasure,"A very modern five star hotel within driving distance from Dublin Airport After arriving in Dublin after that long midnight flight from the United States, pick up your baggage ten walk the seven minutes to Car/Bus Park Pick  up point number #7, and take a free bus limo to the hotel free of charge. The hotel bus runs every 15 minutes. Arrive at your hotel, get a quick rest, or even a wonderful 4 Star Michelin Breakfast, and then relax in your room (if its pre-booked) that picks up their guests. A great hotel to travel around Dublin from due to the quick access to taxi and bus. Great Dinners, a wonderful bar, and a staff that is trained to meet and exceed your every desire. I look forward to my next trip there. If its only business or casual, I will always stay there due to its location and services.",5,2016,02,23
250,Great service and convenient location,"I have stayed at this Crowne Plaza hotel many times over the past few years, probably an average of 6 – 8 nights each month. The Hotel location is handy to the Airport and there is a public park across the road which is ideal for joggers or a brisk walk. I prefer this hotel over any other in Dublin as I have found the service to be exceptional across the board and the staff are always attentive, polite and cheerful. In particular I’d like to thank Olga, John (Reception) and Peter (bar area / restaurant) for their great service but a big thanks to all the hotel staff for making all my stays an enjoyable experience.",5,2016,02,22
250,Amazing staff!,"Most people return to hotels because they are clean, provide good service, great food and convenient for their needs.  My husband and I return to Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport for all the these items and one staff member in particular.  We first met Ciara S. when visiting in July.  She was a breath of fresh air!  Friendly, humorous, caring and a great conversationalist while still attending to the tasks at hand.  When we booked our stay last week, it was with high hopes that Ciara would still be there.  We were thrilled when we entered the Club Room and there she was.  She immediately recognized us.  It was like we had never left.  There she was, working the room, tending to all customers, (it was a busy evening) and still found the time to ask us what we had been up to the last 6 months!  She even remembered that we had purchased a puppy in Limerick and had it shipped home!  
I am in hospital administration.  I know good customer service when I witness it.  Ciara does not provide good customer service, she provides exceptional customer service.  She is the icing on the cake of how the staff at the Crowne Plaza Hotel treats their guests.",5,2016,02,22
250,Irina was wonderful in every way...,"I've stayed at crowne plaza and i must say it was a great experience. Even though we were upset we had a long flight with delays, at arrival Irina took care of us, gave us drinks on the house to wait for our friends to arrive. We enjoyed a perfect launch in the bar with the drinks .We were also staying for one day so she made it worth it by recommending us where to go in Dublin, how to manage our time and see more. I will be coming back at the hotel and to see more of Dublin. Was a pity we didn't had more time. Who ever needs a close hotel to airport and feel comfortable and looked after I definitely recommend it! Cheers and thanks to the lovely staff!!!",5,2016,02,21
250,Amazing customer services. Best hotel in Dublin ,"Wow. Simply put:
This hotel is stunning. The whole of it is aesthetically great. 
The downstairs bar is lovely and lively with a great selection of draft beers and good quality wine and spirits selection. 
The restaurant is amazing. I'm a bit of a geek with food and to be honest the menu (at first) didn't blow me away, but the food itself (I had the pork chop with barley risotto served with a whiskey and cream sauce) blew me away. 
Breakfast was equally brilliant with the best poached eggs I've ever had. 
This is as good as ANYWHERE regardless of Michelin stars or AA rosettes.

The bedrooms are modern and comfortable with good facilities that you come to expect from the IHG brand. 

HOWEVER....
The main reason for writing this was the stunning customer services we had. 
I had an issue with something and the staff went way way over and above expectations. 
The whole experience of stopping in this hotel was amazing and I shall now make this my regular hotel of choice on my monthly trips to Ireland. 
This hotel is fantastic for business, couples families etc. They cater for all ages and I will be recommending this to all my friends, family and staff. 
GO. ENJOY. 
Thank you IHG / Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport. ",5,2016,02,20
250,Excellent hotel set in a restful location,"Everything you come to expect from a Crowne Plaza Hotel, from the very comfortable rooms to the wide range of food and drink , this hotel is set across the road from a relaxing green area, although this is an airport hotel you are well away from the hustle and bustle of the airport itself. It has a bus link to the airport if needed. I would certainly recommend booking on the club floor if you are able and take advantage of the lounge rewards between 5.30-7.30pm each evening.",5,2016,02,18
250,Very pleasant informal business meeting environment,"I organised that a number of clients would join me for coffee / snacks in bar area of this business friendly hotel on a February afternoon. The staff were most friendly and efficient. The bar snacks were both good value and flavoursome. The service was attentive but not intrusive. I have used the formal meeting rooms often over the last number of years, but this afternoon's informal experience has reminded me that I sould put this hotel back on my active business location. Its a good place to do business and enjoy the eating experiences among very good staff.
Thank you",4,2016,02,18
250,Amazing,"Was delighted with my stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, the welcoming I received overall but especially from Beth at the front desk, Her inviting smile and hospitality shown ensured I chose the right hotel! Was extremely helpful and provided information about local amenities which allowed us have a very enjoyable stay. Would highly recommend to anyone! ",5,2016,02,18
250,Great service,"In recent years I have started speak about the great service I receive when out in shops, restaurants and hotels Etc ... On my arrival to the Crowne Plaza Hotel myself and my husband checked in with a lady by the name Beth she was so welcoming and pleasent, I was feeling tired and unwell with a headache and needed to get ready to go again in a bit of a hurry to meet friends, whilst in conversation with Beth I had mentioned feeling tired and unwell with a headache and being in a hurry with no time for a cuppa, we where only few minutes in the room when a knock came to the door with tea and cookies compliments of reception it was a really thoughtful thing to do unfortunately I did not get to see Beth before I left to thank her for her thoughtfulness. Many thanks to the hotel I had a wonderful stay with all the great staff working in the hotel at your beautiful hotel and the bar food was very tasty as was breakfast, I will be back to stay when I am in Dublin next time.",5,2016,02,18
250,Family Wedding Celebration,Fantastic hotel with lovely staff . A private family function on St Stephens Night that everyone was delighted with and still talk about would not have gone so smooth if it had not been for the event planner Laura and John who looked after and guided us from the moment we arrived to decorate the function room to the very end of the night. Thank  you all.,4,2016,02,16
250,Incredible doesn't even cut it,"The staff were all amazing, nothing was too much trouble! 
The food was absolutely incredible, all fresh and delicious.
The hotel itself was spotlessly clean, elegant and highly sophisticated.
A special thanks to Kim, Beth and Daniel.
A trip of a lifetime!",5,2016,02,15
250,The Best Crowne Plaza,"Brilliant - Upgraded to a Suite Fabulous Room + a lot of goodies
Every one of the Staff Great
Stayed twice and the service from the hotel manager throughout the hotel second to none
As they say in Ireland ; Thanks a million'",5,2016,02,15
250,Always wonderful,"I am a regular visitor to Ireland and have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions. The service is always excellent, rooms very comfortable, facilities excellent and the location very convenient for flying in and out (they also provide a regular and free shuttle bus to and from the airport). I would particularly like to mention Irina, Olga and Cath who provided me with exceptional and friendly service on my recent visit, including allowing me to leave some of my belongings free of charge for two weeks between one visit and the next.",5,2016,02,12
250,Ok,"Was ok. They are currently refurbishing the rooms or mainly the corridors?????
Was in need.
The Executive club room a little poorly serviced.
Snacks very tiny and not a lot selection.
Drinks monitored by staff member and not fast service.",3,2016,02,11
250,"Kind staff, nice rooms.","Stayed at this hotel for one night before having to fly out from Dublin Airport the following morning. The staff were very friendly and the room was very pleasant, extremely clean and very cozy with a nice big bathroom. Would advise to bring own toiletries however as shower gel / shampoo provided by the hotel was terrible quality. Beds very comfortable.

Unfortunately during our stay the restaurant was closed for whatever reason and we had to eat at the bar - food was disappointing especially the Asian noodles which had no flavor at all - but perhaps that was our fault for ordering Asian noodles in an Irish bar :-) In our defense, they were out of fish and chips :-( 

Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for something close to the airport for a short stay. The hotel offer a shuttle service to and from the airport free of charge every 30 minutes or a taxi will take approx 5 minutes to the airport which was perfect!",4,2016,02,11
250,Thank you!,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights, Thursday to Sunday. Polite and helpful staff in every department. Receptionists eager to assist when asked, even helped with broken luggage.  Bar and restaurant staff, amiable and helpful, I personally didn't sample breakfast but friends of mine did and they said it was plentiful; I had lunch and dinner here, both dishes were excellent.Housekeeping, you're doing an excellent job, the place is spotless. 
Thank you for making our stay enjoyable.",5,2016,02,11
250,Thoughful Staff & Hot Meal for Weary Business Traveler,"I had a short layover in Dublin - my flight didn't arrive until 10PM.  I knew in advance that the kitchen at the hotel closed at 10PM so hungry as I was, I had not hopes of a meal.  When I arrived at about 10:30PM, the front desk staff suggested I take a look into the dining room - where just one table was finishing up their meal. To my surprise, a really kindly and very Irish waiter ushered me in, insisted I ""had to have something"".  His suggestions was fast and delicious. The restaurant was relaxing and cozy. I never felt rushed, just enjoyed my meal and headed up to my room. The room was clean, well furnished and quiet. The next morning, the courtesy van was ready and waiting for my short trip back to my terminal. A very pleasant - if short - stay!",5,2016,02,08
250,"been roughly 5 years since I reviewed last, not good changes","So where to start, last time I reviewed this hotel I gave it 4 stars. It had just been renovated and the places was pretty decent. Alot has gone down hill since then. Where to start. In the bathroom, the shower door didn't hang straight, so it had a 1"" gap on top and closed on the bottom, the glass counter around the sink was stained, it looks like it was stained from below. The sink was a dingy yellow color that looks like someone had taken a small pick hammer to it, a million chips on it. THe towels were rough. Moving into the sleeping room. THe tv system is pretty horrible, if you want to surf channels it takes at least 4-5 seconds for each channel to come in, and almost always during every show the screen would turn blue and tell you it couldn't get this channel .It would not come back unless you changed the channel and came back to it. Now onto the reason I rate it 2 stars. The beds. The only beds that tie for these for worst bed in the world is the circus circus reno. These were the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. They may have well been sheets of plywood to sleep on. These beds hurt every single day. and the pillows may have been comfortable roughly 20 years ago, but now they are a sad sad reminder of what a pillow could be. Heater was extremely noisy with a constant clicking sound, and also took forever to kick on. 

Pros: 

-Staff was actually amazing. Very friendly, very accommodating, they were the best part of the stay 
-room service was actually pretty good
-shuttle to and from airport

Cons:
-horribly uncomfortable beds
-rooms have dated horribly since their remodel
-parts of the property seem very neglected
-no atm on site
-free internet, but at absolute best it clocked in at 2mbps, but on average dropped out every 30-45 seconds for anywhere as short as 15 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes. 

So the question I always ask: would I stay here again. IF I have to for work, then yes. BUt if I have a choice, absolutely not. I'd rather drive further, or stay next door, or any of the many accommodations nearby. I cannot in good conscious recommend this property.",2,2016,02,08
250,Weekend Break,"The Hotel is ideally located for a trip to Dublin, close to the Airport and good access to City Centre  and other attractions. We found the Hotel staff friendly and the check-in was quick and without any fuss, room was spacious and very comfortable. Not only will we be back, but we will be recommending to friends.",5,2016,02,04
250,Fantastic,"Genuinely couldn't fault anything with our stay here. Had a 2 night stay b&b for a weekend in Dublin with my girlfriend. Only 20 minutes on the bus from the city centre and with a free shuttle bus to & from the airport it made for a much more cost effective stay than paying more for a more basic hotel in the centre.
Rooms are spacious and the bed huge. Can't comment on the daytime food served but the cooked buffet style breakfast was very plentiful, hot and to a very high standard.
Wouldn't hesitate to book again.",5,2016,02,02
250,Fantastic stay!,"From the moment we walked in all the staff were really friendly and helpful especially Catherina went out of her way anything we wanted she assisted. We even used the free shuttle bus. 

Thank you very much.

Mark and Kieran Kelly.",5,2016,01,29
250,Worst aspects of an airport hotel,"Busy and disinterested reception. Food was absolutely dreadful. Service very indifferent and food was particularly poor - gloopy noodles that were inedible and we had to wait 40 minutes for them in the main restaurant.

But the worst aspect was my room was next to staff room/store on the third floor. I was woken several times throughout the night with staff talking loudly and shouting on one occasion - clearly no thought for guests sleeping. At 3.00am I woke because of a loud crash as someone pushed a trolley through the door of the store next door.

I have low expectations of airport hotels as guests are usually passing through and staying for one night. But staff who clearly have no thought for guests sleeping. Will avoid in future.",1,2016,01,28
250,Stayed here the night before we flew hoem,"We were searching for a hotel to stay at the night before we flew home from be Dublin airport. It is just a few miles away from the airport and our car rental. Very nice interiors and restaurants inside. Comfy bed, great bathtub, closet, bar fridge inside. Loved it!",4,2016,01,27
250,Nice hotel but not perfect,"Nice hotel if you aren't worry how far it is from the city center. The breakfast was perfect, so many things and flavours. The rooms are okay, not much bigger but comfortable. First night, we have a lot of noise from the heating. They change our room the next morning, previous complaint, and our new room was on the 4th floor (business room I think, much better). People are so charming and king with us.",3,2016,01,26
250,Perfection ,"Really have had the best stay in this Hotel, I am more than impressed. Staff were so friendly and helpful, going above and beyond with their service. The hotel should be so pleased to have such great staff. The room was spotless and decorated to such a high standard with super comfy beds and a beautiful bathroom. Breakfast buffet was delicious with so much choice - great start to a busy day in Dublin. Shout out to Cathrina from reception for being so great. Would definitely go back and will recommend to anyone going to Dublin! ",5,2016,01,24
250,very annoyed with restaurant service,"Checked in to a lovely greeting at reception. Room beautiful. Everything very positive until we went to the hotel restaurant where we had dinner booked. Looked for kiddies menu as have a 10 and 8 year old. Was told no kiddies menu but they could do nuggets, wings, pasta, chips etc. Order 2 x chicken wings with pasta in tomato sauce. Bill comes and charged 35 euro for the 2 kiddies meals. Spoke to Assistant Manager and complained about the price. He advised this was the correct price and in a very rude manner said he'd see if there was anything he could do, however when he walked away from the table ne started shaking his head and muttering under his breath. I called him back and expressed my annoyance and his treatment towards me, he did agree he was unprofessional and shouldn't have shook his head and muttered under his breath. The annoying part is my 2 daughters turned to me and said it was embarrassing. I'm here trying to explain to them that you cannot treat customers with such disrespect.
Fabulous hotel, lovely staff on reception but charging 35 euro for 2 kiddies meals is ridiculous. Also charged 4 euro for a childs glass of miwadi.",1,2016,01,23
250,Great staff,Haven't had my stay here yet..booked in for next week but I must say when I have been on the phone about my booking the hotel receptionist Olga was more than obliging..she was polite and nothing was too much bother for her..very friendly lady..I'm looking forward to my stay there,5,2016,01,21
250,"Nice Hotel, convenient for Airport","Arrived late afternoon.

Free shuttle from airport is great but not clearly advertised.

Check in fast and easy, room on club level was excellent.

Sounds of hotel perfect for a morning or evening stroll.

Very nice restaurant and the bar doe a very nice pint of Guinness",5,2016,01,16
250,Good well positioned hotel,"Stayed here for 7 nights over Christmas whilst visiting family in Dublin. Arrived on 23rd and allocated a room on 4th floor (club rooms). Large stylish comfortable room. On check in we were given details of agenda over the Christmas period I.e. No restaurant or bar facilities 25 & 26th Dec. also only continental breakfast available. On the morning of 24th I asked at breakfast if I could pre-order smoked salmon for Christmas morning, immediate answer from the young man was a definite 'NO' as there would be no chef on duty. The 4th floor club room was supposed to re-open on Monday 28th offering free drinks and food between 5.30 - 7.30pm, when we left on Wednesday 30th it hadn't re-opened! I would mention that we had access to the room for coffee and soft drinks. During our stay there were a lot of families with young children staying. Overall our stay at the hotel was fine however I would suggest that they have a policy at breakfast to not allow young children to help themselves at the buffet breakfast!",4,2016,01,08
250,Excellent!,Stayed here on two separate occasions in January 2016. Delighted with the service from the staff and quality of the rooms. Breakfast was amazing and was buffet style :) Shuttle bus to the airport is convenient and runs every 20-30mins although is not 24hrs. Will stay here again. ,5,2016,01,08
250,Excellent Hotel close to airport ,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights and found the hotel to be excellent especially in relation to the customer service from check in to check out... I am writing this at 5.45am as we await the curtesy bus to the airport and as we have to wait a few minutes we have been given complimentary tea :) 

Beds comfortable 
Our room had both shower & a bath 
Rooms large
Quiet hotel 
Good value for money 
Excellent staff 
And finally the food was really excellent - much more so than one would often expect with hotel meals... Irish Stew and the Chilli Beef we recommend highly 

All in all an excellent stay and we will be staying here again for our next airport stay :) ",5,2016,01,06
250,Night of new year eve,"The hotel is near to the airport with schuttle to the airport, the location is quite nice, staff is very friendly and the service is good. It takes about 15 minutes by car/taxi to get to the city center but public transportation is also available.",4,2016,01,05
250,A bit mixed,We stayed here for a running event.  The staff on the front desk and night porter were really helpful and went out of their way to try to get us a double room instead of a twin.  The room was clean and of a good standard.  There was a bit of noise from a disco party that was in that night.  The breakfast was really busy and seemed fine except for the gluten free option that one of us needed.  The staff were too busy to properly help and we ended up with very poor quality food that was either soggy or still frozen. A real shame after everything else had been really good.,4,2016,01,04
250,Lovely Hotel,"Was only here for an overnight stay for celebration. The  room is spotless and very nice, just what you need after a long night. 

I always go her for food.  The breakfast buffet is divine! Touzai for dinner was amazing and the bar food was delish!",5,2016,01,02
250,Short stay,"I was staying in this hotel a few nights in December.Rooms spacious,very clean with very comfortable beds had a very good night sleep.Staff in accomondation and reception very friendlly and polite.Breakfast very good quality and very tasty lots of things to choose.I would highly recommend this hotel ! Well done Crowne Plaza keep up the good work ! ",5,2015,12,28
250,Another great stay,We stayed just for one night before flying out of Dublin for a holiday I've Christmas.  We arrived quite late to a very warm welcome and to find we had been upgraded and awarded a free continental breakfast.  The room was very clean and comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. Breakfast was generous and good quality.  The free shuttle too and from the airport is so convenient.  We will make this our first choice in Dublin every time. Highly recommended. ,5,2015,12,27
250,Good airport hotel ,A short free transfer from the airport. Bus was a bit rickety and didn't give a good impression though. Smart hotel with efficient and friendly staff. We were upgraded to the club floor. Beware if booking over Christmas as the hotel effectively shuts down from Christmas Eve afternoon with only limited services after that. Breakfast was decent but not outstanding. ,4,2015,12,24
250,A good night rest,This hotel is well presented and provided me a good night rest after attending party and dancing all day. The shower was refreshing and calming and I slept like a baby. thanking the staff for their effort at making sure I woke up early and did not miss my flight.,5,2015,12,21
250,Wonderful service,"I stay a great deal of my time at this hotel and all the staff, especially Olga, Beth, Shaubaum, Irena on reception, Arijan, Marlon in concierge and Petr in the bar along with all the great team in the bar that are too numerous to mention make sure that it feels like home and I don't think you can get better than that !!",5,2015,12,15
250,Awful customer service,"I never review or rate any place I stay in but I had to share my experience at the crowne plaza.
I was booked in to stay in a twin room for my work Christmas party on Friday night 4/12/15 there were more than 50 of us staying the night over.
I arrived at 7.00 with my colleague Sophie ready to check in. When I approached the desk and gave my name I was told our room wasn't ready and that we would have to wait. 
Now a hotel room not ready at 7.00 on a Friday night ? Come on now. Even with a late checkout I would still expect a room to be ready at that time considering check in was at 2pm that day.
When I questioned why our room wasn't ready I kept getting the same answer ''5 minutes'' now our Christmas party was starting at 8 so you can image I wasn't impressed. As I was being repeatinnly fobbed off the receptionist, they then proceeded to check in another couple and completely ignored me. 
When I mentioned that I would be doing a review on here about the hotel they only then seemed to acknowledge my existence. 
Now it was 7.40 before this happened and my Christmas party was at 8. I had been getting the same excuse the past 40 minutes ''5 more minutes''.
We also had a drinks reception at 7.30 but sure I missed that thanks to the reception staff!!
I then got escorted to my room by a gentlemen from the reception, seriously like about time. 
When I arrived to our room there was no trolley or anything in the hall to even suggest that our room had been cleaned or anything. When I got into the room I was told the TV was on the brink aswell and I was only given one room key.
I got NO information about check out, breakfast or anything!!! Nor was there any information in my room. 
My colleague then arrived and used the shower, the shower didnt heat at all so she had a cold shower, it also leaked all over the floor. 
 
I had one of the worst night sleeps of my life, between people fighting in the halls between 4-6am and the most lumpiest uncomfortable bed ever!! 

The next morning I went to the reception desk to make a complaint and was speaking to John the duty manager. He couldn't have cared less what I had to say at all. After scribbling down a few bits on a envelope he went to the reception and came back and offered us a reduced rate on our room.

Now that was all well & good except for our room had been previously paid for by our company. He also mentioned that we could get lunch in the bar, but it didn't start until 1 and it was only 11am and we had only just finished our breakfast. With check out at 12 I was hardly hanging around the lobby for an hour. 
I didn't want to hang around the hotel another minute I just wanted to get home to my bed. 

I will not recommend this hotel to anyone and I certainly will not be returning!!!",1,2015,12,07
250,Very Good! As Usual!! ,Just spent two weeks in this hotel and I always stay here when out from New Zealand... Staff were at there normal best and the restaurant and bar staff were exceptional. Colin Mulligan you and your team were brilliant and I enjoyed the occasional chats on rugby! The young lady who made the coffee in the morning for us was fantastic and her service with a smile everyday should be recognised👍🏻  room and cleanliness at a high standard as always... Thanks again and see you very soon... ,5,2015,12,04
250,Great Breakfast,"I recently attended a two day function at this Hotel. Check in was slow despite their being no queue, but staff were courteous and helpful. 

My room was rather small but very comfortable and the heating was turned off when I requested it. Everything required was supplied, however there were no spare pillows available and housekeeping did enter the room on the second day, despite the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door.

The dinner served at the function was a big disappointment. There was vegetable soup (served with very hard rolls) and chicken & cabbage drowned in gravy followed by baileys cheesecake on the menu. No fish option and vegetarian meals had to be booked in advance.  The staff did oblige me with cannelloni but this was very chewy.                                                    

Most of the attendees were visitors on their first trip to Ireland and I spent each course telling them that this was NOT typically the type of food served in Irish Restaurants. Strangely, the bar food was excellent, however this did not extend to the dinner.

Breakfast was very good. A huge array of choices to suit every taste. I did get hard poached egg, but nothing is perfect.

All in all, we enjoyed our visit to the Crowne Plaza. Great bar food, good, attentive staff, great breakfast. But NO SMOKING AREA ?? This is almost unheard of in this day and age. One could use the smoking patio of the hotel next door but at the Plaza you had to stand outside the front door like a lady of the night.

The other great advantage is the hotel is 10 minutes from IKEA :)
We will be back.....",5,2015,11,29
250,A STYLISH AIRPORT HOTEL FOR A WEEKEND TRIP TO DUBLIN?,"Accomodation in Dublin city centre can be notoriously 
expensive for a good quality hotel.There is a way that you can
feel you are getting bucks for your money by staying a
short bus ride into the heart of the city. The Crowne Plaza is
About 10 mins hotel shuttle from the airport and about 25 mins
public transport into the centre of Dublin. The hotel is set in a 
Park like area,3 minutes walk from the stops that the take you to 
City centre. It is a stylish hotel, good a across all areas, rooms
Modern in style, nice bar and good quality resteraunt, we ate in
the tokazi resteraunt for our first night, they do a happy hour.
Food was fine. The rooms have all you can require for a stay,
can be a little dark as previously stated but this appears to be their
way of generating a modern ambience in the room. It may 
not suite all. Tea coffee walk in shower trouser press free safe
Drinks in cooler flat screen TVs, the whole bang lot is in the room,
Great to relax after a day in this vibrant city. The bar was reasonable,
Around 5 euros for a pint of guiness,not bad.

It cost us about £ 250 for 3 nights with breakfast through Bookings.com
Probably cost twice as much in city centre for hotel of same standard

I would stay again, no problem. Worth thinking about?",4,2015,11,28
250,2 nights in the Crowne Plaza,"Very nice hotel, looks recently furbished, the staff at reception were very helpful. Room was on the 2nd floor, the room had a decent bed and fitted out with all the usual specs. A great select for breakfast. I also had lunch and dinner which was also very good.

A special mention to Karolina who was amazing in helping find a bill which I need. Took a lot of her time and was very accommodating. True asset to the hotel!",5,2015,11,26
250,Good but the room lacked lighting.,"I like staying at Crowne Plaza's as they always provide an excellent service. The room was large with a very comfortable bed. I was right above the entrance on the second floor an noise wasn't an issue. 

Disappointed that the main part of the room only had 3 lamps and didn't have any ceiling lights. This made the room quite dark and not very good to work in, yet the bathroom and entrance hall had plenty!

Internet was slow both WIFI and LAN connections which i haven't come across at a Cowne before. The TV had plenty of channels but the custom menu/guide was slow and cumbersome and didn't show now or next info.

Food as always was fantastic, possibly one of the best I have had. Wide variety of choice and the chef ready to cook you fresh eggs etc.

Staff very friendly and helpful. Recommend the hotel to anyone.",4,2015,11,24
250,Delightful,"This was an unexpected pleasing surprise for an airport hotel.  We generally stay at the Hilton Dublin airport hotel, but the price at the CP was a bit lower, so we decided to try it.  I am glad we did.  They have a restaurant on the site (Thai), and a bar with more American-type fare.  Lobby is large, spotlessly clean.  The bar food service was excellent and we adored our waitress.  Our sandwiches were top notch. Room was large with two double beds which squeaked a bit.  Lovely linens and towels.  The shuttle to the hotel from the airport is a bit of a walk to pick up spot 14, but drop off at the airport is at the terminal.",4,2015,11,23
250,Hit and miss,"Stayed here twice in the past week, once for business and once due to proximity to airport.  The first occasion I was in the 1st floor, and on booking room for a few days later at reception I expected a similar standard. However, the rooms were different in quality, 1st floor is much nicer than 2nd floor - maybe it has executive rooms. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, On a few occasions we waited ages to be served both at the bar and in the lounge area.",3,2015,11,23
250,"Close to airport, not too far from city.","Caught the free airport shuttle from Dublin Airport to the hotel. Shuttle runs every 20 minutes or so and takes about 15 minutes to drive to the hotel. Check-in was fast and efficient and I was lucky enough to be upgraded to an Executive room.
The room was very comfortable, probably one of the best I've had at a Crowne Plaza and bearing in mind the fact it was not very expensive in my opinion it was a bargain.
I ate at the resturant and the food was truly excellent and reasonably priced if you took the earlybird special (order by 7.30pm), and the service was good as well.
The next morning I took a taxi into central Dublin, it took about 25 minutes and cost Euro20. The saving I made by staying at this hotel rather than my usual hotel in Dublin city centre paid for the taxi, dinner and lunch!
Very happy I stayed here and will stay again when on a flying visit to Dublin.",5,2015,11,16
250,30th Birthday Party success!,"I hosted my 30th birthday party recently at the Crowne Plaza and the experience was exceptional from start to finish.
The staff were so obliging and accommodating and that certainly contributed to the success of the night!
Thanks to all involved!",5,2015,11,16
250,crown plaza airport,"really enjoyed our stay at the crown plaza hotel dublin,really impressed with professionalism and friendliness ,so glad we booked at this hotel we spent ages deliberating which hotel to book with we eventually plumbed for this hotel mainly for the free airport transfer and early flight which we had,we had a few issues with the room but this was swiftly dealt with.
anyone not wishing to take a taxi into the city there is a local bus stop a stones throw away the local buses only take change and the cost is 2.80 euros one way happy days!",5,2015,11,12
250,Birthday party,Enjoyed my stay here great room king bed and mini bar if wanted found bar food pricey burger and chips 13 euro got my room at a reduced rate because of party don't think I would stay here if I was to pay full rate good service at bar,4,2015,11,12
250,Awesome Hotel,This is a modern hotel located less than 10 minutes from the Airport in a nice but secluded part of town. The hotel does offer free transportation to and from the Airport. Downtown Dublin is about a 15 minute drive. This is a corporate hotel as it has lots of meeting space. The pub and coffee shop were great. The staff are all frienldy and professional. The rooms were clean and comfortable but not spacious. However they are nicely decorated.,5,2015,11,11
250,yet another visit,3rd time this year that we have done a trade show at this hotel   we are made to feel very welcome in fact we feel part of the family there    nothing is too much trouble for them  all the way from the cleaners to the management they are fantastic   too many people to single out but great service by one and all   strongly reccommended to use this hotel if you are in ireland   and only 7 mins from the airport,5,2015,11,11
250,Good airport hotel,"The first big plus is that the free shuttle bus to and from the airport is wheelchair accessible.  This is certainly one of the best airport hotels at Dublin. Staff are friendly and very efficient, nothin seems to be too much trouble for them. Disabled access room is well appointed, if a little tight with the wheelchair. Comfortable bed and a bathroom big enough to wheel around. Breakfast was buffet style and very good with plenty of choices, once again, although buffet style, the staff were more than willing to assist. I won't be using any of the other sirport hotels again.",4,2015,11,05
250,Weekend stay,"Great hotel yo stay in if you wamt to stay close to the airport and wants a good nights sleep. A bit far from town and maybe a little expensive but great rooms, great breakfast a very good restuarant and bar.",4,2015,11,05
250,A well priced hotel close to Dublin airport,"An excellent hotel for a short stay, with friendly staff, comfortable rooms and excellent restaurant. Internally, it's a bit dated in style but the rooms are a good size and the bar and restaurant area very good. The breakfast was excellent and the staff very attentive. The only criticism was that the room (and hotel itself) were very hot with no way of reducing the temperature, and this made sleeping rather uncomfortable.",4,2015,11,03
250,Luxuary overnight close to the airport,This hotel is great for an overnight either prior to or after a flight to Dublin. This  hotel is well up to the Crown Plaza standard. Very good standard of facilities within the hotel. The  rooms are spacious and well appointed with loads of electric sockets to recharge all your tech. Comfy beds and the bathroom has everything you need. Nice big wide screen TV. They have a small gym with enough equipment for a quick workout. The best thing for the fitness freaks is the large park across the road from the hotel entrance which is always open and has good paths and two sets of fitness trial equipment for everyone to use. The hotel has produced a very helpful running/jogging trail map of the park with a selection of route marked on. A great idea- other hotels please take note! The restaurant and bar facilities are large and give a good selection of food and drink. Staff are very friendly and helpful too. I will be staying there next time I fly in.,4,2015,11,01
250,Nice hotel,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a private function and therefore was fortunate enough to avail of a special discounted rate. The hotel itself was in an excellent location next to the M50 and Dublin airport. We had a king size room which was clean and comfortable, however considering the initial price of the room i was expecting a wow factor which unfortunately i did not feel. We dined in the hotel bar and I am pleased to say the food was lovely although we did have to wait almost 20 mins which was suprising considering the bar wasnt particularly busy, prices in comparison to what you would pay in the airport. My only really complaint about this establishment would be in relation to the residents bar. Our private function finised at 12.45 and being residents we thought we would have a few more drinks before heading to bed. We asked reception if there was a residents bar as the bar we had utilized earlier in the day was closed. Reception initially asked if myself and partner were residents which we confirmed before being advised yhe bar was closed, however if we took a seat in the foyer seating area someone would come and take our order. 15 minutes passed at which stage we had been accompanied by another 4 family members, confirmed we were all residents a 3 further times and reminded reception that we were still waiting before someone eventually arrived to take our order. Upon placement of the order for 6 drinks we waited circa 25 minutes for the waiter to return with the drinks. After waiting almost 15 minutes a family member went to the reception to complain regarding the service that we were receiving at were informed that they would contact the bar to expedite, they appeared 10 minutes later with no apology. At this stage more family members (also residents) had arrived and were trying to order drinks. They eventually managed to order drinks although they weren't asked to confirm if they were stayin in hotel, 2 basic drinks took 15 minutes to arrive. At this stage i decided to go to bed as getting a drink was like getting blood from a stone and you were made to feel like a complete inconvenience to the staff. The following morning during check-out I was informed the residents bar did not open until 2am which was the first time i have ever encountered a residents bar closing. The clerk offered to compensate me by offering drink vouchers for the bar, however I was driving and the bar didnt open til 12 so even if we could avail we would have to wait 1.5  hrs to utilize. Nice hotel but for the money I don't think it is any better than other airport hotels in the same region which charge slightly less. Also note that the holiday inn is directly next door. Carpark was 6 euro for 24 hours.",3,2015,10,26
250,Great hotel!,"Use this hotel with work on a regular basis and I am always impressed by the standards at the hotel.  The staff are great and very helpful, running education courses here is a pleasure - they always get it right.  The hotel is clean, well presented and the Touzai restaurant serves great food....only about 10 minutes from Dublin airport with a regular shuttle bus it is very convenient too. It sits opposite a lovely park which is nice to walk through....",5,2015,10,13
250,Nice hotel near airport,"I chose this hotel as it was near the airport, was reasonably priced and had a free shuttle. I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door about three years ago so I was familiar with the area. Check in was efficient and friendly. I arrived a couple of hours before check in time but was able to get into my room as soon as I arrived. 

The room was very comfortable and modern. Bedding was comfortable and if you're one of those people who likes a really firm mattress (I do not), you're in luck. The bathroom was also clean and modern. The desk area includes outlets for other European countries as well as an American outlet, so no need for the converters at this place! Wi-fi was good and located throughout.

The hotel has a couple of restaurant options - the Cinnabar Red Bar looks like a pub. Service is okay. I had the lamb stew and was not too impressed especially for the price. 

I also ate at Touzai, which is a nicer restaurant but not too fancy. The service was outstanding. If I remember correctly, my server's name was SImon? I was not too hungry as I was still trying to adjust to the time differences and had already eaten a snack in City Centre. The server gave great recommendations for a smaller appetite and served up a really nice glass of wine. I also splurged and had dessert which was also  delicious. 

In this same restaurant location, the hotel offers a breakfast which includes the option of a buffet which I recommend. Lots to choose from, food was very fresh and hot. I learned about scrambled eggs with baked beans the last time I was in Dublin and was really looking forward to this again. I was not disappointed.

The hotel is within walking distance of the bus which will take you straight to City Centre for about $3.00 each way.

If you plan to use the free airport shuttle from the airport, be sure to do your research on how to get to the pickup area. It's a little difficult to find, but eventually you'll get there and it is quite a long walk. Everyone is friendly enough they will tell you where to go if you have trouble finding the bus.

I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Dublin.",4,2015,10,13
250," A mere €30 upgrade turns this 4-star hotel to a five-star experience!","We opted to stay close to the airport on our last night in Dublin. It turned into an even better idea than we had anticipated. For  an extra €30 we could upgrade to a room that would include lounge privileges such as complimentary alcoholic drinks & hours d'oeuvres during the evening, a spectacular, huge room with an Asian flair, cozy robes, complimentary continental breakfast during the week, and full buffet breakfast on the weekends.  As we stayed on a Friday, we got to enjoy the full breakfast. 
Dinner in the restaurant was also excellent. 
We were so happy to have chosen to stay close to the airport on our last evening. Being a mere 5-10 minutes from the airport with complimentary shuttle allowed us to sleep a little longer and more soundly. 

",5,2015,10,07
250,Airport hotel,Stayed here last week overnight before our week away great hotel food was good lovely rooms and great atmosphere free shuttle to airport will definitely use it again very quiet at night staff very helpful  the price very good with parking included ,5,2015,10,05
250,Perfect for business trips,"The location is perfect is you're looking for an hotel close to the airport but very well connected to the city center with public transport.
The rooms are spacious and very clean. Nice choice at breakfast. Perfect if you want to walk and run thanks to the nice park right in front of the hotel.",4,2015,09,30
250,Nice,Stayed here for 1 night as we were attending a wedding. Check in was ok. 3 staff behind the desk but 2 looked busy doing nothing which left the lone person flustered. Room was lovely. Family room which had loads of space. Wedding and reception after was superb. Well run by hotel. Breakfast next morning was also very good. Great selection. Checkout was very good but for a small gripe. The car park. Why does a four star hotel insist it's guest's pay for car parking. It's not the nominal fee we had to pay but the insisting we had to pay it even though we paid 139.00 for the night. Only after other wedding guests told mevthey didn't pay that the person behind the desk gave me an exit ticket that they had already printed. I know it's only a small gripe but it's a bit penny pinching....,4,2015,09,28
250,A Series of Pleasant Surprises,A hotel near to the airport with a good bar and restaurant and good service. We were surprised to get lounge access and it was very nice.  Weirdest thing about this place is that all the beer with the exception of Guinness is bad US beer,4,2015,09,26
250,"BEST American-friendly amenities, great food, clean, a true oasis","This hotel is not a resort but it IS the best of 7 hotels that we stayed in while in Ireland, because of the American-friendly amenities - king size bed, free wifi, movies on demand, an American electrical outlet in our room, both a tub AND a shower, within a 5 minute walk of 2 great restaurants and a bus stop; they have a great restaurant and coffee shop onsite as well, there is a beautiful park with walking trails right across the street, amazing coffee, plus, over the 5 night stay there, we found we needed some emergency items and they were supplied to us without problem - tooth brush, paste, bandaids, etc. We were one day late checking in (due to overnight flight), and though we were considered ""no shows"" they still gave us a lovely room and we were able to check in by 9am (you will understand why this is important if you are flying over from the USA). WHAT IT DOESN'T HAVE - old world charm, ambiance, or a true Irish feel. But that's ok with us when traveling in Dublin. We plan to stay here again.",5,2015,09,22
250,Disappointed ,"I visited Crowne Plaza today for a supposedly 'quick bite' as we had just under an hour. Just two of us, and we ordered from the sandwich menu in the lobby area.  20mins after ordering we asked a manager what was the delay. Approx 5 mins later the sandwiches arrived and yet another couple of mins wait for the coffee and tea. In total 30 mins, although we did receive a verbal apology for the delay!  Not a good experience and I won't be going back.",2,2015,09,21
250,ticked all the boxs,I was staying at this hotel as I was attending a 3 day conference in the hotel.  First of all the food was really good even when they were catering for 180+ as part of the conference. The service was excellent and the rooms and facilities were excellent. Staff were also very attentive and everything ran like a well oiled machine. Also they have a regular shuttle bus to the airport. This is definitely a hotel I would recommend,4,2015,09,19
250,Oasis by the airport,"Extremely clean and tidy hotel with great service from the staff. Ciaran, the hotel bartender, was extremely welcoming and always made me feel at home. With a close proximity to the airport and a short bus ride to the City Center, this is an excellent hotel choice. I would highly recommend this property.",5,2015,09,16
250,Perfectly fine airport stop over,"Stayed here for one night on 11 September and I had a good stay.

The airport shuttle is convenient and the directions are clear until you reach the coach park.  I am not sure whether I was supposed to then go and look for the bus or wait under the sheltered walkway but anyway I flagged the bus down as he was leaving (it was pouring with rain!) and I was the only one on the bus for the short journey.

The lobby area was warm and inviting and there was no delay to check in.  The guy on duty was friendly enough and welcomed me as a 'Platinum' member of IHG Rewards.  I am actually Spire level, which IHG introduced about 2 months ago now.  I don't blame the CP for not recognising this really but I do think IHG have handled its introduction poorly - I think a lot of hotels are waiting for system upgrades.  Anyway, I was offered a welcome drink or 600 points.  I had booked a Club room and wasn't offered an upgrade even though there was a big sign up saying ""Upgrade your room from EUR30/night"".  Nice to know that somebody who qualifies for IHG's top tier (other than Royal Ambassador) is so valued.  Not.

Anyway, I went up to my room, and immediately heard a lot of music emanating from the corridor as I exited the lift.  As I approached my room, this music increased in volume - turned out the person in the room next to me was presumably using iPod speakers to blare out RnB.  I was going to go back down to reception but once I closed my bedroom door and bathroom door it was still audible but not unacceptably so.  I heard a person from a few doors down bang on the door and remonstrate quite loudly - anyway it did the trick as the music was turned down.

The room itself was large in size - with plenty of storage which is good for an airport hotel.  I couldn't work out whether the room was newly renovated or not - I think it may have been 'soft refurbished' in that the carpet looked new and the TV was up to date, but some of the other fixtures were not.  There were also no plug sockets by the bed for charging electrical devices.

Bathroom was large and had a separate shower, which I like.

Didn't actually use the Club as my flight was delayed inbound and I slept in the next morning.  Sound proofing must be good here as I didn't hear any other guests after the music incident - normally in airport hotels there is loads of corridor traffic with doors banging, suitcases being dragged around and so on from about 4AM!

Anyway, I checked out without incident - same guy - didn't charge me for a Diet Coke from the minibar so i presume this is an unpublished benefit of the Club level - nice touch.

I noticed the park whilst waiting for the shuttle bus - I had seen it online but assumed the hotel would be on an industrial park and the 'park' would be some brownfield site but it looked very nice and as it was a nice morning I wished I had got up earlier to go for a stroll!

Bus back to airport was a few minutes lat but no biggie and dropped people right outside T2 and then in the coach park for T1 - again, no problem as it's signposted clearly, is an easy and flat walk if you have bags and is clearly signposted.

Overall, I would definitely stay here again for an airport stop over - rooms are a bit dull / tired but public areas are nice and it's clearly a well run hotel.  Nothing really stood out hence the 'average' review - but don't be put off - it's a perfectly up to standard Crowne Plaza.",3,2015,09,16
250,Our usual stay before flying ,"We have stayed here multiple times before traveling, still pleasantly surprised with the friendly reception and staff, did not enjoy evening meal as much as usual. Room was small and had no view (well an adjacent building) however all amenities were good so no issues otherwise.",4,2015,09,16
250,Comfort and style in abundance,"This is a great hotel both in terms of looks and style. I stayed here at the beginning of September just for the one night. A spacious room, large bathroom and a colossal sized bed. Extremely clean and tidy hotel with great service from the staff. Food in the bar was great value and well presented. Would recommend this as a business stop over every time. My workload will have me over in Dublin on a regular basis and this will be my hotel of choice without a doubt.",5,2015,09,15
250,Overnight Stay before departure on Holiday,"The Hotel has a very warm and friendly atmosphere, Very good food and a great service.  Its location to Dublin Airport and shuttle bus service to both terminals every 20mins. Highly recommended to anyone travelling on or visiting the Capitol.",5,2015,09,15
250,Excellent in everyway,Myself and my wife visited here for our anniversary I must say we truly enjoyed it. The rooms where fabulous and food was gorgeous. The staff was very helpful and kind. Hope to be back in the near future ,5,2015,09,11
250,Excellent hotel - very handy for the airport,"This hotel is very close to the airport and there is a free bus to shuttle you to and from the hotel.

Check in was quick.  I had booked a room with club lounge access.  Unfortunately, the canapés and drinks finish at 7pm (not 8pm as per most other IHG hotels).  I went down to reception to ask about this and was given one voucher for a free drink at the bar.

The restaurant stays open quite late and serves food later than the bar does.  I had some great Pad Thai served by a really friendly waiter.

The room was of a fine size with a comfy bed.  Sleep quality was great.

Breakfast in the morning in the club lounge was good.  There was a selection of continental breakfast - cereals, yoghurts, fruits, hams, cheeses and breads.  There was a friendly waitress on hand to bring tea and coffee to your table (even though there was a self service machine!).  She was great.

All in all, a good hotel which is great for travellers wanting to stay over the night before a flight or relax after a flight.",5,2015,09,11
250,"Appalling , terribly dirty ","I never review or rate any place I stay in but I had to share my experience at the crowne plaza - 
Below is the complaint I sent the hotel- got no reply 
I also wrote this and left it in my room - never heard anything back from them . 

On Saturday 5th December 2015 I arrived at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Santry with my 5 year old daughter. 
I checked in about lunch time and the lady on reception was wonderful, she really brightened our day after a long drive from Mayo. 

We got to our room and on opening the door there was an ironing board with a wet towel hanging over it, clearly used. I didn't care much , but I was worried the room wasn't ready so I found a girl from house keeping. She said yes it's ready .... I went back and the hand towel in the bathroom was also wet. 
I knew it couldn't have been refreshed so I collected all the used towels and brought them to the housekeeping lady. She gave me clean ones and said she would check the bathroom was ok for shampoos etc and that her supervisor checked it and said it was ok. 
I said ok and she got on with her duties. 
After she left, my 5 year old daughter was pottering about and came into me with used sanitary items in her hands .... I felt physically sick. 
They had been left in the bin by the previous guest. 
I then did a check of the room, public hair in the bed, used bloodstained facecloth in shower, spider in top right corner of room. 
We were about to attend the Mayo V Dublin match so we were in a hurry to get going. 
After the match we arrived to the hotel at about 8pm. 
I asked the man in reception what part of the hotel was best to get a pasta dish for my daughter .... His reply 'I dunno' I said well which menu has pasta ... He said 'I don't know try the bar' !!! 
Please note I paid €189 for this. I could have got much cheaper but wanted to treat my daughter to a nice time in Dublin. 
I went to the bar at 8.15, waited till 8.30 for my order to eventually be taken. 
Our food arrived to our table at 9.15pm- we were sitting under an air conditioning fan and my daughter was absolutely freezing. No other seat available. 
Food was also very basic for the price. 

Got back to the room .... Filled a bath for my daughter . Only to find brown scum all along the rim of the water so I couldn't put her in . 

Instead she had to in the shower which she hates. She slipped twice so I had to use a towel as a bath mat. 

That night I filled out the breakfast room service card as it was 22:45 when my daughter got to bed. 

Next morning she woke at 8am so I decided to cancel room service and go downstairs for breakfast . 

I rang reception for 20 minutes - no answer . 
Rang duty manager- eventually got heights and she cancelled the room service. 

I am appalled at the service I got at the Crowne plaza , I spent €189 for a room that I expected to be first class in cleanliness at that price.

250,Excellent Comfort,"Just had to write about this Hotel From booking over phone to check in and perfect room there was no hiccup .Polite ,welcoming staff at reception .Coffee and tea facility in our room .really comfy bed.Then breakfast .Yes I have to say 5Stars for this .So many times I've experienced issues with buffet breakfast in other hotels but definitely not here I observed fresh supplies  at short intervals to all the hot plates Lovely fresh breads and good choice of cold meats. Cheese and fruits Well done to All Staff and Management .We will be back .",5,2015,09,09
250,Fantastic service as one would expect,"Visiting the Crowne Plaza following a very pleasant telephonic enquiry with Olga about dining for a meeting with friends. I arrived at reception and was greeted by the very friendly and pleasant Olga who directed to the restaurant  where i enjoyed a meal with great service delivery. Afterwards I went back to the desk to enquire about the parking and again was pleasantly informed by Olga,the first 2 hours were free for all guests visiting or staying at the hotel there after a cost of 1euro per hour applied. I have to admit whenever I visited your property the welcome was warm and friendly.
well done such a great employee.",5,2015,09,08
250,Nice hotel close to the airport in a quiet environment !,"I stayed in this hotel a few times already, each time on a business trip. The hotel is located only 15 minutes away from the airport and there are free shuttles every 15 minutes getting you to and from the airport. The hotel is located in a residential area but there is a large park right in front where you can take a walk or go jogging. The hotel also has a gym which is quite nice. Hotel staff is very friendly. The pub is quite big and pub food is good and price is reasonable. The restaurant is open in the evening but I never tried it. The breakfast is served in the restaurant and the variety and quality are good. Hotel rooms are what you can expect from a Crowne Plaza. 
I will certainly return to this hotel as it is convenient and offers everything you need on a business trip. If you want to visit Dublin city center, then this hotel is maybe not the best choice, as it is 25/30 minutes drive by taxi away from the city centre.",4,2015,09,07
250,Very good airport hotel,If you are looking for a quiet and good airport hotel. The crowne plaza is a good choice. A bus stop to the city center is within 5-minutes walking distance. From there every ten minutes a bus leaves for the center. The bus ride takes approximately 30 minutes to O'Connell Street.,4,2015,09,07
250,First-class ,"I arrived here after a very long flight journey and I must say I felt absolutely relaxed and felt like ho
E when I walked through the door. Receptionist was very helpful and also friendly. Room spotless food lovely ",5,2015,09,06
250,Disappointing sleep!!,"Long delays for check in and out which were very frustrating. Staff also attempted to charge me €20 more than the agreed hotel rate! So check your bill thoroughly!! Staff were polite and appropriately apologetic. The bedroom booked was for a Kingsize bed but I got allocated two singles and the bed was extremely uncomfortable, causing a poor nights sleep!  Bar prices were reasonable and the bar manager was very personable as were his staff.  Free shuttle bus from airport to hotel is very handy. There is a holiday Inn Express literally adjoined to this hotel which is cheaper, think we will try there next time.",3,2015,09,03
250,It was good to be back.,"I have not stayed at this hotel for quiet some time, as Dublin hotels are getting busier its not always easy to get the hotel you want at a competitive price in the right location.
we booked the hotel directly and got it at a good price, the hotel is nice, food was great and the staff were all very helpful.
We also ate in the bar which again was really nice and the beer was good and cold, the hotel could maybe do with a bit of a makeover but it was clean. The bathroom and shower show their age but again everything was clean and the sheets were fresh so no complaints from us.",4,2015,09,01
250,Hidden Gem very close to the airport,"I booked in to make an early flight the next morning and was really pleasantly surprised.. I had stayed in the Holiday Inn next door in the past and that was truly ""Functional"" at best... for a few euro more this is the better option by far... the bar downstairs is great and the food was excellent... the staff were a little bit ""cool"" but I'd expect that from a hotel with high traffic... pleasant rather than friendly.... the rooms were excellent [I have to admit I got upgraded as I'm a member of their program] and very well fitted out... the car park is underneath the hotel and for 6 euro per night is not exorbitant at that... as for location, very easy to find off the M50 and getting to the airport is less than 10 minutes... in short, I'd use it again",5,2015,08,31
250,Very noisy rooms!,"My family stayed here in August 2015 hoping to get a good nights sleep prior to a long haul flight early the next morning.  We normally stay at the Premier Inn, Dublin Airport however having left the booking until a week before departure the Crowne Plaza seemed the best available option.  
Check-in was friendly and efficient, and as the reception / bar area looked nice we decided to eat our dinner there.  The food was reasonably priced, and service was very good, however the actual standard of food was pretty poor, so I would recommend eating elsewhere. 
Our hotel room was located on the first floor of the hotel and the door opened from the corridor directly into the bedroom (no bathroom buffer) meaning the head of the beds were against the corridor wall.  I suspected that this would mean a noisy room and i was correct. We were all woken several times in the night by conversations of passing guests, neighbouring rooms, doors banging etc.  I definitely won't stay here again and will be more organised in future and ensure I get booked in to the Premier Inn.",3,2015,08,31
250,Probably the best hotel experience I've ever had!,"With a warm welcome, our check-in was pleasant and my membership status valued.

The rooms were very clean, well-furnished and lacked nothing.

The bar area was relaxing and inviting.

Breakfast served up everything anyone could possibly wish for and the food quality was very high.

Thank you for being a great hotel. Having stayed in hundreds of hotels, many, many other hotels could learn a great deal from your attention to customer service!",5,2015,08,30
250,Irena at the Front Desk,"We were ""wowed"" by the service of Irena when we checked in on Aug 26 at 6 pm.
The booking site we used did not provide the option we were with our 11 year old granddaughter.  With a thorough search Irena found us a family room. Thank you for going the ""extra mile.""
Allow travel time from Trinity College to hotel took 75 minutes at 5 pm - 8 kilometers. We took advantage to walk about the park to relax before back to US.
",5,2015,08,28
250,Best airport hotel,"Very comfortable and clean rooms, close to the airport. Plenty of parking spaces and convenient to City centre and M50 motorway. Great breakfast and service with a smile. Excellent hotel for overnight stay before travelling from Dublin airport.",5,2015,08,25
250,Very convenient and with a delicious breakfast!,"We bought a package for 139€ including a night in a double room and 15 days car park and it was the best price after considering other hotels such as Travelodge and Metro hotel which are usually cheaper. The hotel is very quiet and clean and offers a free shuttle service to the airport. We really enjoyed our stay and we had a delicious breakfast with scambled eggs, bacon, sausages, croissants, marmelade, juices, tea and coffee, etc. We really recommend this hotel if you need to be close to the airport.",5,2015,08,24
250,What a treat,"I was just coming in for a layover and was sad to not be able to stay a few days. Thankfully the hotel offers a FREE continuous shuttle from the airport (located near the church directly across from the terminal walking under the fiberglass tunnel out the doors of the airport crossing the street)The staff was efficient and friendly, the breakfast was delicious and the room was comfortable and quiet. I could not ask for anything more I only wish I had the time to use the amenities.",5,2015,08,23
250,"Great room, weak room service","I always like the quality of Crown Plaza airport hotels. Our room was really well designed and furnished, huge bed and a great nights sleep. 

The only problems we had were with the room service menu. After a delayed flight we called down for room service 10 minutes before the main menu was supposed to end and were told we were too late. So we were left with the minuscule '24 Hour' menu. I had a great Irish stew, but Jake got a tiny chicken sandwich (second choice as there were no prawns left either). 

Also had a good mini bar. Well, I assume it was good as we couldn't open the door. Neither could the room attendant. We gave up and decided that it was just an overnight and that it wasn't the end of the world!",3,2015,08,21
250,Lovely hotel with excellent staff,"A recent one-night stopover provided us with a fast check-in and lovely warm welcome. Sadly, the first room's air conditioning was out of order, but the wonderful desk staff and duty manager had us moved in under 5 minutes and then provided us with a nice free drink by way of apology for our ""inconvenience."" Wish we had been able to try breakfast, but had to go at 5:00 to catch a flight. Perhaps a bagged snack for early risers would be a good option to at least offer on check-in if staff is made aware that the guest will not be able to partake, yet has paid for breakfast (included in room rate)?",4,2015,08,21
250,Conference...,"Stayed here whilst attending a conference. 
Check-in was efficent. The room was nice and clean with coffee, iron and trouser press + all the other normal items.
We ate in both the restaurant and bar area, both of which were tasty meals with good service.
The only niggle....the toilets at reception and by the conference halls were practically out of toilet paper. Perhaps a better checking method?
Absolutely no issues and would stay again if visiting the area, work or personal. ",4,2015,08,21
250,Loud Lobby,"We arrived late Saturday evening and the lounge that opens onto the front desk was loud. The people where drinking and arguing and very loud. The parking was a bit confusing being on the other side of another hotel so dragging luggage was not as simple as it should be. The man at the desk was helpful getting us checked in quickly but seemed a bit impatient. This was not the cleanest lobby we’ve been in.
We made our way to our room and was impressed when we got there. It was a regular size hotel room but everything we needed was in place. The room was quiet, considering the noise in the lobby. It even had one North American style power outlet. Our sleep was good. The check out was quick.",3,2015,08,18
250,Much better than the usual airport hotel,"Do yourself a favor and stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel near Dublin airport; it's so much nicer than the ugly concrete box hotels closer to the airport, and it is only a 10 minute drive from the airport. The hotel is located in an area called Northwood Park. There are jogging and walking trails throughout the neighborhood in a beautiful park setting. The hotel provides water bottles, fresh fruit, and towels in the lobby for guests who avail themselves of the outdoor exercise opportunities. Hotel guests can keep the car parked there for a very reasonable cost of six euro per day. The rooms are large and clean. I would have given it 5 stars but the first two rooms we tried smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. To their credit, the front desk staff kept working with us to find a suitable room.",4,2015,08,16
250,Great Option Close to Airport,"Great option for the night prior to a morning flight.  We were able to drop our rental car off and took an $18-20 Euro cab ride I to Temple Bar for dinner.  Free airport shuttle on a large bus, so space is no issue.
Great park across the street and safe local roads for added space to run or exercise.  
Room is modern and clean and lives up to the Crown Plaza standard.",4,2015,08,15
250,A good option if you need to be near the airport,"Stayed one night after a long flight into Dublin. Overall it was very good, but this establishment is more suited to the business traveler than the holiday maker.

BOTTOM LINE: If you’ve got a reason for being in this area, this is a worthwhile option. I doubt I’ll be coming back this way, but I’ll definitely check rates here first if I do. My experience was very pleasant and I’m happy I stayed there.

LOCATION: Not a bad choice if you need to be in this area, but there’s nothing out here for sightseers. Taxi from the airport was 9 euro. There is a free hotel shuttle that runs every 20 minutes throughout the day, but it’s not 24 hours so check the times.

CHECK IN: Took a while but this was half my fault as what I thought was a queue of several people turned out to be a big group. Then there was a problem with the computer showing my room as dirty when it was actually clean. It took the clerk three or four calls to verify the status as he kept getting foisted off onto someone else, but I don’t blame him for that. But neither did I turn down the voucher he gave me for a free drink in the bar. Except for that, everything else was smooth, and I appreciated the fact that the gentleman who checked me in took the time to make sure the room was all right rather than send me along and hope for the best since other rooms in the system were flagged as clean.

ROOM: I had a standard with a king-sized bed. The room itself was on the small side but sufficient for me as I was alone and only wanted a place to sleep, shower, and relax before beginning my holiday properly the next day. Décor was nice, not so dated as in similar properties I’ve stayed at. My room was 359 – quite a hike from the lifts but that may be because I requested a quiet room when I booked. It was quiet for the most part, though the next morning I heard a couple of wakeup calls but I don’t think I would have if I hadn’t already been up. Everything was clean. The view from the window was nothing to write home about (other parts of the hotel and a rooftop, some trees), but it’s not that kind of hotel.

Bed was harder than I like but comfortable enough. Pillows were good as were the bedspread and comforter. Blackout curtains did their job – important to me as light keeps me awake. Other furniture was comfortable. 

Complimentary amenities included two bottles of water (sparkling, not still, to my delight), a small chocolate mint, Bewley’s brand Irish breakfast tea (no decaf), Bewley’s instant coffee (regular and decaf), Cadbury Highlights chocolate powder, milk and sugar. The tea was nice but nothing special about the instant coffee. I didn’t get anything from the minibar or room service so can’t comment on those.

Iron and hairdryer are provided. There’s an in-room safe that looks big enough for a full sized laptop. It was certainly large enough for my ultrabook, wallet, passport, et cetera. The TV had good picture and sound, but the only way to get a channel list was to scroll through them with the remote control, a rather tedious process. I’d have preferred a hard copy listing of available channels. 

The only thing they didn’t offer that I missed was a robe and slippers, but that is a minor point. Certainly not the sort of thing that would prevent me from staying here again.

Newspapers are only delivered in the morning upon request, plus you have to pay. Seems a bit cheap to me, but with free WiFi it’s not something I missed. I quite like reading local papers of places I’m traveling through, but these days I understand how a hotel might see it as an unnecessary expense.

INTERNET ACCESS: Both cable and WiFi are available. I only used the free WiFi and found it fine. Easy to get on, no loss of connectivity, and ample speed for what I needed to do. Granted, that was limited to checking my email and browsing websites. I didn’t try more intensive tasks like streaming video. At the desk where I set up my ultrabook, I noticed a US style grounded outlet (for flat 2-prong plugs) on the wall near the UK style outlet. Good for those who forgot their adaptor.

BATHROOM: Separate tub and shower. Towels were all right – not thick but large size and plenty for one person. Pressure in the pipes was okay. Lots of hot water and very hot indeed. While I understand that many places limit this to prevent injury, I sometimes like a very hot soak, so it was nice to have that ability. Free amenities were shower cap, shampoo, shower/bath gel, bar soap, and lotion – nothing special but all fine in terms of getting the job done. The lotion had a slightly masculine scent when applied. That didn’t bother me – on the contrary, I thought it was nice – but neither did it last long, so don’t worry about it clashing with other scents. Other items (deodorant, conditioner, etc.) were available for purchase at the desk.

ACCESSIBILITY: To be fair, I didn’t ask for an accessible room because I didn’t need one, so it’s quite possible there are fully accessible rooms available. As always, ask before booking. But in looking at this particular room, I’d say it’s probably okay for someone with limited mobility. The bathtub is equipped with handrails. The shower has one as well, though there is a step to climb over to get in. Also, the shower head is a little high on the wall. I’m 5’2” and had a little difficulty adjusting it. Someone taller could do it easily, but it might be a challenge for those with limitations. The stall is large enough to accommodate a stool. The room itself is a bit tight in some areas. People who use wheelchairs might find it too small to maneuver around in, but those who use canes or walkers might be okay.

FOOD: Room service available 24 hours. I had an early dinner at Cinnabar shortly after checking in. My bangers and mash (called something else on the menu, but that’s what it really was) tasted good and the portion was sufficient so fairly priced in my opinion. Staff were efficient, attentive, and nice, but not intrusive or overly friendly. WiFi worked fine down there as it did in the Touzai restaurant the next morning when I went down for breakfast. Here again, it wasn’t cheap (very little is in Ireland), but the food was good and the buffet had quite a lot of choices. The coffee was especially nice. Breakfast runs from 06:30. I thought start time was 06:00 and went down about 06:15, but the staff were nice enough to let me get started as they were mostly set up at that point anyway. However, I wish I had looked at the menu before starting as there were a few extras available on order (for example, smoked Irish salmon) for another 3 euros, but I enjoyed what I got off the regular buffet. 

I also noticed free coffee in the lobby when I went down for breakfast but it was gone when I came up, so I suppose it’s only on offer for those who have to leave before breakfast. Also near the front entrance is a runner’s station with free maps of suggested running routes, water, green apples, and towels. I’m not a runner myself, but I thought it was a nice touch.

GYM: Didn’t use it but stopped in for a look. Typical hotel gym – little space, small selection of free weights, a few cable based stations, a number of kettlebells, and the usual cardio options (bikes, treadmills, stair stepper). There’s even a shower down there, though I’ve no idea why you’d use it instead of your hotel room. The gym is good enough for the traveler wanting to keep up on their workouts, particularly if cardio is your concern, but it’s not something you’d want to use long term if you’re serious about weights.",4,2015,08,13
250,A good place to stay. Needs some more lighting in the rooms.,"This would be rated higher if not for how dark the room was. If you don't care about that, it's a fine choice, and it was okay anyway. We were on the concierge floor and all the lights were out in the lounge too, and I was unable to figure out how to get lights in the bathroom. 

The hotel is clean and modern and very busy when we were there. The staff was nice and the food was decent. There's a nice park across the street for a jog or walk, but there is NOTHING else around.

The bus to the airport is convenient, though it was late when we left.",3,2015,08,09
250,Good hotel,"About 10 mins away from the airport, there is a handy shuttle bus from the airport every 20mins - worth checking

The hotel felt very new and was really clean. Rooms were spacious and modern and had everything you needed.

Had a couple of issues with my evening meal in the bar but these were put right by the staff who were very helpful.

Will stay again.",4,2015,08,08
250,Handy stopover hotel for Dublin Airport,"Have stayed here three times, all overnight stays coming in from - and departing from - Dublin Airport. Rooms are clean, with modern bathrooms, ample furniture and comfortable beds. Staff, especially front desk, are friendly and helpful
Food options are OK, preferred bar to restaurant, and room service was quick and accurate. 
There's a pleasant park opposite the hotel if you want some fresh air, and the stop for a bus into Dublin is only a couple of hundred yards away, but I would only really recommend this as an airport stopover. The free shuttle bus service is reliable.",4,2015,08,07
250,Very pleasantly surprised!,"Excellent service from the most courteous and professional staff; beautiful surroundings and outside seating areas, easy access to the airport and close to all Dublin city attractions. The breakfast each morning was the best I've had from any hotel in a long time, lunch and dinner were just as impressive.  Ambiance in the bars was just magical.  I look forward to my next stay and will bring my family along. Not one fault - the best value for money:-) Rooms are of the highest standard - pure luxury in the bathroom too!",5,2015,08,06
250,"Peaceful family retreat, ideal preflight location. ","Stopped one night,family of 4,night before early am flight.

Cheap and quick bus ride to city. 
Opposite beautiful Park. 
Shuttle service to airport. 

Room was clean , modern / art deco, iron and board,TV , mini bar, etc.

I would say ideal family retreat for Dublin city break or for final night of a Dublin holiday. 

It's quality.  definitely recommend. ",5,2015,08,05
250,Perfect place to stay in luxury,"Perfect stay came to Dublin for a holiday. Staff were extremely friendly -Beth on reception was extremely helpful. Although out of the city it's only a bus ride away €2.80 about a 15 minute ride, but an extremely quiet, clean and luxurious motel, with great food and awesome service. I am from Australia and this truely made my trip a wonderful experience I would highly recommend this motel to anyone going to Dublin. Breakfast was also fantastic. The main features of this motel that make it fantastic are the spacious rooms, amazing food from both the bar and restaurant, wonderful welcoming service and luxurious feel. I thank the staff for my wonderful stay. 5 stars out of 5 :)",5,2015,07,29
250,5* stay ,"Stayed here for 2nights for a concert, stay were lovely very helpful. Had minor issues when checking in & out, all were resolved quickly and even got complimentary drink & carparking for the wait! Lovely hotel and very handy to get to. Bus also at end of road leaves you straight into town. Asian restaurant OKA on the grounds is lovely and very reasonable. Will return again!  ",4,2015,07,28
250,Close to the relatives,"We have stayed at this hotel many times.  This year we stayed for three nights, left for a few days and came back the night before we flew home.  We were really annoyed by several issues when we first checked in but the hotel managed their service recovery very well.  The main plus for us is that this hotel is close to family and to the airport.  The beds are comfortable and the windows open.  Tub and shower are separate and spacious.  A real bonus is that three different kinds of electrical outlets are provided:  for North America, continental Europe and the British Isles.  The downside though is that there are no electrical outlets next to the bed so if you have two CPAP machines, as we do, you have to run an extension cord across the floor.  Not very safe.  We also, as usual, object to queen size sheets and duvets on a king size bed.  There is no excuse for this.  The rooms are small with very little cupboard space.  Okay for one or two nights but no longer.  The hotel also seems to be skimping on toiletries as they only offered shampoo and shower gel and one tiny bar of soap - no conditioner or lotion.",3,2015,07,27
250,Super Helpful Manager,"I stayed at this hotel recently. Unfortunately we had a lot of confusion on our flights home.  All I can say is that Krystian, the manager, was beyond helpful and really helped us solve our issue. He got us the number of the airline so we could manage the situation and was very calming.  All I can say is thanks for helping us make the best of a tough situation.  It was very much appreciated!  Good deeds don't go unnoticed.",5,2015,07,26
250,Ok,"Location near airport and getting very expensive for a CP. SERVICE NOT THE BEST AND VERY lacKing at time in the bar.
Changed the CP AND HI BUS to a subcontractors bus. It's yellow in colour. But old and dirty.",4,2015,07,26
250,"Quiet, restful, and clean","I flew into Dublin an day ahead of my husband. I needed a hotel for the night as our hotel in the city center was not available. This hotel had a shuttle to/from the airport and was available. I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet, and clean the rooms were. The hotel lobby was very nice. I was able to relax and recover from jet lag for my husbands arrival the next day.",5,2015,07,21
250,Incredibly friendly and welcoming,"I stay at a lot of IHG properties - such as Crowne Plaza - and the welcome I received here at this hotel by Catherina and Irina was outstanding and much better than average. I'd had a long journey, and they were great at checking me in, recognising my Platinum status, and ensuring I had a quiet room. Looking forward to my stay here!",5,2015,07,19
250,Good hotel close to Dublin airport ,"Stayed in this hotel for 1 night .hotel located very close to airport yet in a very quiet locatio. Good rooms, quiet and comfortable, good resturant . 
So if you land late and need a good night sleep to start fresh on the morning this is a great option. ",4,2015,07,17
250,Excellent Hotel for relaxing,"The hotel, staff and room where excellent.  On arrival, reception had us booked into a twin room.  Asking for a double room required the manager approving it without too much drama.  Many thanks to him.

Hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport, 20 mins from the centre of Dublin (€15 taxi max fare) or frequent buses from the main road nearby.  The room was spacious, bath and shower (ideal), though I found the shower water pressure (on warm to hot 38c) bearable, not to usual hotel standards.  

Overall, a good hotel to stay at.  Hotel staff very friendly.",5,2015,07,16
250,Excellent,"We had booked into Bewleys & it was so appauling that we refused to stay. Thankfully this hotel stepped up & found us a room at very short notice. I will always  stay there when in Dublin.
The room was a very good size & it was spotless The bar food was absolutely perfect & it had and excellent choice. 
The staff were some of the friendliest that I've ever encountered.",5,2015,07,13
250,Excellent service,"Just returned from a one night stay at this hotel we have stayed here before & have to say the service is excellent , lovely toiletries & a lovely added touch a sleep pack very welcome , breakfast again outstanding we travel a lot & the breakfast here simply cannot be equaled , loads of vegetarian options too , check in & check out great with a guy called Shiabhaun ( possibly spelled wrong ) nothing was too much trouble , looking forward to staying here again",4,2015,07,08
250,Great Hotel near Dublin Airport,"We stayed here for 1 night on the return leg of our holidays to Ireland during Xmas 2014, We had originally booked in their sister hotel directly next door, but upon checking in we received a free upgrade.
The hotel was a perfect base to get to the Airport for an early morning flight. The free shuttle bus to the Airport is great.,The staff were helpful, the hotel was spotless , The room was nicely decorated, The food in the hotel bar was good",4,2015,07,08
250,Wonderful airport hotel,"For an airport hotel, and for the price we paid I would have to give it five stars.  I suggest paying extra for the executive room.  It was updated, and well appointed.  You also have access to the lounge which offers a happy hour, and continental breakfast.  The woman working the happy hour the night of our stay could not have been more lovely(don't know her name but it was the afternoon of Tuesday July 7th).  Would definitely make a return trip if I needed a hotel by the airport.",5,2015,07,08
250,Nice hotel in good area,This hotel has everything you need for an overnight stay close to the airport. It's very easy to access from motorway and is located at the north of the city. The restraunt is Asian style food and very good. Would defiantly recommend this hotel for business users and airport overnight stay. If your looking to head out and about in Dublin it's about 30mins in a taxi.,4,2015,07,07
250,Lynda45,"We have stayed in this hotel for many nights with our 4 young children and it is our favourite hotel by far.The staff throughout the hotel are so welcoming and friendly. The front desk staff were very well hand picked, Olga, Beth, Marlon and their manager Christian, and Liam at night time. Each one of them could not do enough for us and went that extra mile to meet our requests, which having 4 young children, we have had quite a few. The hotel is very well maintained and is spotless throughout. ",5,2015,07,07
250,Lost its Crown,"We have used this hotel for many stays for the last decade. We are Ambassador Status with the IGH group and are loyal to that brand. This was the worst stay in many years for both. The room was not clean. Not quiet. The furniture was very worn and bad of. The bed was a total wreak with squeaks every time you move all night long. I felt terrible that I spent that much money on this stay. It is not worth it. So after a long successful relationship with CP Santry, I am afraid it's over. ",2,2015,07,05
250,Good all round hotel - very friendly staff,"Hotel rooms: Spacious, clean tidy, tv reception works well Individual A/C keeps turning off during the night - annoying! Beds are very comfortable. bathrooms are clean and well maintained daily. Windows actually open to allow natural air flow. Some rooms are better than others, ask for one with a view. L4 has its own kitchen and facilities.
Reception: Are very helpful, minding bags while I popped over to Cardiff for the week end prior to commencement of my stay. The moved rooms for me once one was available with a view.
The bar: is very good - great selection of beers, wines and spirits, super friendly staff, tv's with sport in the background yet not overbearing.
The Gym: is basic, clean and has a shower facility.
Location: Close to the airport excellent for conferences, about a 20 euro cab fare into the main strip.
Check out: very efficient.
Transfers from airport: Go to bay 14 near the George cross and get a free shuttle to the hotel every half hour, very useful.
Restaurant: Meal quality excellent - pricey like everything else in Dublin - friendly efficient service through.
Tip: you can go to the holiday in next door and charge drinks to your room at the Crown and vice versa.
Washing: like all hotels a total wrought. Take your washing up to Swift Square and get an entire load done same day service for 10 euros.
Generally a very good stay.",4,2015,07,04

250,Comfortable business hotel,"I had a flight leaving at 5:30am so wanted a hotel near the Dublin airport.  Desk staff was superb - very helpful at every step of check-in, car return, extension cord, personalized service, etc.  Room was very comfortable with king bed, good work space,  separate shower and whirlpool tub.  I had reserved a junior suite but this room was perfectly adequate so I called the front desk to confirm.  They said that they had upgraded me but had failed to unlock the connecting door.  Said door opened to an enormous living/dining room with a boardroom table for ten.  Over the top but nice.  Common areas of the hotel very pleasant and popular.",4,2015,06,30
250,Great place to stay between Downtown Dublin and the Airport,Stayed here for 4 days while visiting Dublin. Great location 15 minutes to downtown by bus so if you are looking for a quiet modern hotel this is the place to stay. Restaurant menu clearly indicates all food allergies. Our package included breakfast which was amazing.  Really good Gluten free bread available.  They offer a free shuttle to and from the airport which came in handy.,5,2015,06,28
250,Hard to Find,"Even the cabbie had trouble finding the Crown Plaza, but it is close to the airport and it has an adequate breakfast.  The room was nicely appointed and quiet.  We were happy for a sound rest that night.",3,2015,06,27
250,Perfect Airport Hotel,"Typical Crowne Plaza accommodations with clean comfortable rooms and great service. Shuttles run every 20 minutes and  was on time with a quick ride from the hotel. 

We wouldn't hesitate to stay here at the beginning or end of a trip to Ireland flying in or out of Dublin. ",5,2015,06,27
250,Fantastic Hotel,Always stay here when in Ireland and fantastic rooms and facilities through out the hotel and staff always friendly... Food and bar always good food and a cold drink... Close to the city and airport for people travelling through.... CLEAN rooms... Keep it up and I will keep coming here... ,4,2015,06,26
250,Wedding reception ,"We had a fantastic day and everything ran according to plan.  The staff were more that helpful in organising and arranging our wedding party, they made everything easy for us. The staff on the day were fantastic and went above and beyond their call of duty.

I would also like to mention that Paul was fantastic, and was so helpful when it came to setting up all the equipment the day before.
The food was perfect and a lot of our guests also commented on how nice it was, Thank You Chef!

I would have the pleasure in recommending The Crowne Plaza to anyone looking to have their special day catered for.

And of course the lovely Laura Lynch for making our day so special. She went out of her way to cater for us and was very professional warm and friendly.

Our wedding suite was immaculate and fit for a king and queen.

Overall I would definitely go back to the Crowne Plaza Hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice friendly and professional atmosphere.

We couldn't of met any nicer staff and management anywhere else.

Thank you so so much Laura Lynch Paul and crew our special day was amazing!",5,2015,06,26
250,The perfect end to our stay in Ireland,"We stay one night on June 9 before our flight out the next morning. We were in executive room 405. I was surprised to be impressed from beginning to end. 

Check in was easy by a very pleasant lady named Irina. It's nice to be greeted with a smile.

The rooms are somewhat small but extremely well laid out and efficient that size is of no importance. We were on the executive floor with executive lounge access. The king size bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large and really quite nice with a separate shower and tub. All standard toiletries are included - even the conditioner which isn't as common in Europe. The only little issue for the entire stay was that once in the shower, I noticed that mildew was beginning to grow in the grout around the inside of the shower door. I did report this and feel confident they will get right on top of it. Everything else was immaculately clean. This wasn't an issue for me since I'm from Florida and know how this can start suddenly and is easy to resolve. Otherwise there was no problem at all with maintenance or housekeeping so this one thing doesn't detract from my rating. 

There were nice aroma therapy products for sleeping. Lavender/camomile pillow spray and eucalyptus to inhale if desired. I thought this was a very nice touch and it's nothing I've seen before in any class of hotel. 

In the closet was a safe, iron, ironing board and a separate trouser press. There was so much desk and counter space that it was easy to feel organized and uncrowded. 

Wifi was very easy with a password. I measured the speed with Ookla at 13ms ping, 8+Mbps download and 5+Mbps upload. Consistent and worked great at all times. 

The club lounge was very nice with wine and beer included. It was not over crowded but there were enough interesting people to talk to. There was a nice lady who worked up there who we later saw working in the restaurant. She was hard working but I don't remember her name or I'd mention it. 

We had dinner and opted for the salads in the bar which were excellent. You have the option to pick the items you want to customize your salad right down to the types of leaves you want. They were prepared to order quickly and they were generous with the portions. 

Breakfast was available to us in both the executive lounge (continental) and the restaurant (full Irish with buffet). We were pleased to find excellent ripe fruit nicely cut into small enough pieces. The scrambled eggs were delicious. There were many options - something for everyone. 

Directly across the street is a very large park. It is really great with both paved and mowed paths for running or walking with huge natural meadows and exercise equipment scatter throughout. 

Our stay here was a perfect end to our 11 day stay in Ireland. I highly recommend it for a stay of a day or longer.",5,2015,06,25
250,Great hotel and facilities,It is a little bit out of the city but on a main bus route. Nice modern hotel with a good bar area  and very good-sized rooms. . Rooms have a fridge and a mini-bar The food in the bar is top rate as well. The bus to the city is very close,5,2015,06,25
250,Great food,"We were attending The Script concert, and whilst we stayed else where our friends stayed here so we meet them for something to eat. The Thai red curry was lovely and my husband had the chilli chicken pasta. The only downside was they only sell 1 bottle of Rose wine which is 33 euros. Service was good with friendly staff.we were able to get a taxi from here to the concert.",4,2015,06,21
250,Needs to improve cleanliness...,"Was allocated a room that hadn't been cleaned, bed not made, bathroom towels used, dirty cups still in room.

Receptionist did offer apologies and a drink voucher.

Ate in bar area and ordered the fish....being so close to the coast that fish should've been brilliant, it wasn't.  It wasn't anywhere near fresh and was rubbery to eat.

Breakfast wasn't that great either, sauages, black pudding, mushrooms all cool.

The Guiness seemed to be watery towards the bottom of the pint but unsure if that was the pipes or the beer !
",2,2015,06,21
250,Nice place to return to,"I have used the Crowne Plaza for a few years now. Nice location, great rooms and nice selection of food and drink.

The hotel has a great location near the airport.

Fairly close to main roads into Dublin.

Just be sure to book in advance to a void disappointment.",4,2015,06,17
250,Lots of good going for this hotel,"If you need a hotel near the airport and you want a nice experience, go here.  It's a lovely modern hotel with spacious rooms and all the amenities.  The bar serves good food and the breakfast is great.  The shuttle to and from the airport is timely.  And as a bonus there is a great park across the street for nice walking.  Perfect airport hotel.",4,2015,06,17
250,Retirement/Birthday Party in Fahrenheit Function Room,Had a great Retirement/Birthday Party in Fahrenheit Function Room.  The room was fabulous the way it was laid out - everyone commented on it. Similiarly with the food - superb. Also the manager and his team on the night were all so helpful. I would certainly recommend it for any function.,5,2015,06,17
250,Comfortable room near the airport,"Had an early morning flight to Spain, so wanted to be close to the airport.  Having a comfortable bed and a quiet room is a must and Crowne Plaza lived up to it's name.  Although it's very close to the airport and the hotel was full, I didn't hear any noise whatsoever.  Check-in was quick and efficient, room was immaculate and large, water pressure was wonderful, and the shuttle to the airport quick.  I will definitely stay here again when I fly out of Dublin.",5,2015,06,16
250,One of the better hotels near the airport,"Of the hotels I've stayed at near Dublin airport this is probably the best. The rooms were as you would expect for a Crowne Plaza hotel, spacious enough and comfortable. Dinner was good. The staff were all friendly and helpful.
I now know which hotel to stay at when i need to be close to the airport",4,2015,06,14
250,Good hotel close to Airport,"Very close to Airport, with free shuttle is one upside, on the downside its a bit down do central Dublin if thats what you are after. 

Large nice rooms, I had a single room that was much larger than many other hotels superior rooms, and with a large bathroom with separate shower and bathtub.

WiFi was free, but painfully slow.",4,2015,06,11
250,Very pleasant stay - helpful staff,"We enjoyed our one night stay here after our long flight from the States. We were well ahead of check-in time, so we knew that very often rooms are not available. This was the case here, but John at the front desk tried hard to find an available room as the housekeeping staff got them ready. Special thanks to him for going the extra mile to see that we were taken care of. It meant so much to us to know that guests are put first. We were off to a great start!

We were impressed by all the staff.  In the restaurant Norbert and Barbara were so friendly and helpful. 

The hotel itself is modern and very attractive with a nice lobby, restaurant, and spotless guest rooms. If you have time, take note of a side hall near the lobby that has projected graphics on the floor. Just a fun thing. 

The room was comfortable; the bath was modern. There was a small mini-bar refrigerator in the room, but this was not for guests' personal items. I would say that it would be nice to have a refrigerator to put your own drinks in.

To know before you go:
Shuttle pickup from the airport is in Zone 14. This means that you walk a fair distance to Zone 14(maybe a third to a half-mile. We came out of Terminal 2.) You walk mainly under a covered walkway to this parking area. Once at Zone 14 you'll need to go across the parking area and look for the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn Express courtesy pickup sign. Shuttle is prompt and the drivers are so friendly.

We would definitely have no problem staying at this Crowne Plaza the next time we're in Dublin.",5,2015,06,09
250,Last night on our honeymoon ,"We chose to stay here as an easy way to get to the airport after an amazing 2 week honeymoon.    We were not disappointed.  

Had an amazing room and were most likely upgraded due to our circumstances.  

Great dinner at the restaurant and an amazing walk at the park across the street before our 8 hr flight home in the morning.    The shuttle was easy and on time.  ",5,2015,06,07
250,Nice last night in Ireland,We wanted to stay by the airport our last night in Ireland. This was a very nice hotel with nicely appointed rooms. Very comfortable and nicely quiet. Breakfast was good and nicely varied. Highly recommended.,4,2015,06,07
250,Nice large hotel,"We stayed there with my family as we had an early flight from Dublin Airport. Great location for that, the airport is only a few kilometers away and they have a shuttle if you need. Nice large modern rooms, and the value was good for four people. Only slightly more expensive than a B&B close to the airport that we booked a few months ago and was a total disappointment. On the negative side, our check in was not exactly smooth. We needed to know how to get in/out of the hotel parking (there a gate and a ticket-machine) but the two young ladies didn't seem to want to try to understand our simple questions. It took us a bit of patience to get a clear answer from them. A part from that, it was a very good choice.",4,2015,06,07
250,"Nice rooms, busy hotel","I booked this hotel because it offered good value for money. We had 2 rooms and both the rooms were very good. Neat and clean with very comfortable beds. Breakfast was also very good by 4 stars standard. The hotel offers parking in a nearby commercial car park however you can get exit pass from the reception.
Negatives are mainly for the busy reception and restaurant. We had dinner in the restaurant which was extremely busy and it appeared that staff was not able to cope with the traffic. Most disappointing part of the dinner was that our 4 year old 's dinner arrived 20 minutes after everyone else's. Food was not great; hence 4 out of 5.

I would stay again for the value, room and sleep quality but would stay clear of the restaurant.",4,2015,06,04
250,Nice Quality Hotel,"Busy large hotel; we had a great room on the 4th floor.
Everything was nice about the room; big comfortable bed and all of the usual things you would expect from a hotel like this.
The restaurant was busy; but not packed and there was a fair range on the menu; with large portions served.
Service could have been a bit quicker; we did feel that we were forgotten about at times.
Overall though very pleasant hotel.",4,2015,06,02
250,Clean & Friendly,"With meetings in the centre of Dublin I decided to stay a bit out of the city (closer to the airport) for arrival/departure convenience.  The free shuttle 'bus is very handy and runs regularly.  This hotel has exceptionally friendly staff in all areas reception/bar /restaurant and concierge services.  Food was well above hotel average and reasonable priced. I found the hotel spacious in public areas and also in the bedroom which was spotless.  The gym', although basic, had the equipment that one would expect and was conveniently situated on the 1st floor.  I'd definitely stay here again on a return visit.",5,2015,06,01
250,Best Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for the second time recently, and it's a great value if you don't mind being outside the center city. A short walk to the bus will get you into the city in about a half hour. The staff is fantastic and the rooms are very nice - comfortable bed, large modern baths. The included breakfast is outstanding, and the restaurant is also great for dinner if you don't feel like going out. Convenient to the airport, just off the motorway too. Highly recommend!",5,2015,05,29
250,Nice stay at the airport.,"We've stayed there 2-3 times. Very accommodating. Nice restaurant for dinner and breakfast the next morning. Good shuttle service to the airport.  I haven't ventured outside the office part to the restaurants/pubs outside, but those look like a good option and a short walk.",5,2015,05,28
250,"Very pleasant stay, super friendly staff",Just stayed in that hotel for a meeting and really enjoyed the time. SUPER friendly staff everywhere and the room was very nice. The hotel is just next to a very nice park and I enjoyed a relaxing walk. The hotel is also easy to reach from the airport which makes it really an ideal location for a business meeting. ,4,2015,05,28
250,Great Place.,"Great place to stay. Booked into the hotel for the Dublin match and had a brilliant night.The room was lovely and the overall look of the place was excellent.

Had food later on that evening and we were a bit late but the staff were really accommodating. Served us from the bar menu even though it was closed. The added bonus was a beautiful steak cooked to perfection. Great gargle food.",4,2015,05,27
250,Pleasent Visit!,"We booked into this hotel to meet up with friends on a stop-over, personally I hadn't heard of the hotel before and was pleasantly surprised, it was a bit more expensive than what we normally pay but had a lot of extra little touches and we both enjoyed every minute of our stay.",5,2015,05,26
250,Great stay,"we had a lovely stay here last weekend for our juice plus conference. Meals were excellent and the room was fantastic. Would really recommend whether you are staying before travelling from Dublin airport, business or just staying while visiting Dublin",5,2015,05,26
250,Attending AN AGM,on arrival early morning we headed to the restaurant for breakfast we were met by a pleasant waitress who showed us to a table and explained where everything was and proceeded to provide us with tea and coffee when we were finished we headed into the main hall for the agm at 2 pm we booked into the hotel to a fab room later that evening we attended the gala ball food was excellent and service  very good a great experience overall and we will be back,4,2015,05,26
250,"Great Hotel,","I stay here frequently. Beautiful rooms, really great, friendly staff...they are really exceptional friendly people. The bar serves lovely food. Breakfast is great...one of the best hotel buffet breakfasts I can remember having. Handy location to city and airport.",5,2015,05,26
250,Coming & Going  Perfect!,"Beginning and ending our wonderful Irish Highlights trip here was awesome. Olga at Reception met every need and made suggestions that made our trip nearly perfect. A attractive comfortable facility. Restful, relaxing, airport shuttle gratis, luggage storage. Whatever needed the staff delivers.  Don't miss it !!",5,2015,05,23
250,Recent upgrades -excellent,"Crowne Plaza has had a recent upgrade on the 1st floor. New paint and carpets are great but the best thing EVER is the new power socket next to the bed. If only all hotels understood what this meant to guests!! #snoozebuttononphone

I cannot recommend this hotel enough. I stay here at least once a week and everything is just brilliant. I had a small issue recently and the manager put it right straight away. 

The staff are just brilliant (Olga and Beth on reception and Ciara in the club lounge deserve special mention)

The menus in the restaurant and bar are very varied...I'm never bored.
 Keep it up guys and I'll keep coming back!
",5,2015,05,20
250,NICE HOTEL,"we 20 people group  stayed 2 nights from 4th May to 6th May, services are excellent right from the check in , rooms are clean, good break fast, restaurant and bar is reasonably priced, the location of the hotel is little far from the city centre and very closer to the Dublin airport. Wonderful relaxed  stay in the hotel for 2 days, we enjoyed the stay and like  to stay in next visit.",5,2015,05,20
250,A very good Airport hotel,"Stayd for three nights on a business trip. The overall quality of the hotel feels nice, the public areas are comfortable and clean as was the room. Had a twin room for myself, on the second floor. Cannot recommend the view as it was to the other hotel next door. The wall to wall carpet was a bit stuffy but I have come to expect that in British / Irish hotels, a wooden floor would be better. 

The Hotel is ideally located to airport and has a free shuttle service running between it and the airport. Otherwise the hotels is a bit out of the way and the nearest stores are a few bus stops away. There is a bus stop right next to the hotel, and from there you can take at least buses 16 and 41 to the city (2.80e Exact change at the time of the trip). The buses take you past a shopping center, there is also a grocery store near the southern tip of the park.

Breakfast was plentiful, only thing that I couldn't find was lettuce/fresh tomato etc. The food in the pub restaurant was above normal airport hotel food. 

All in all a good airport hotel with good(ish) connections, a bit out of the way but servers the airport well.",4,2015,05,20
250,Good location,"We stayed at this hotel our last night in Ireland based on its proximity to the airport and good reviews.  The location is very convenient and the shuttle was right on time and got us to the airport promptly the next morning.

Rooms are very nice, but the service was average.  We didn't get the wake-up call we requested and when I inquired about the cost of adding breakfast the concierge didn't know the price.  It was a buffet so I'm imagining that it's a flat rate?

Finally, the thermostat was difficult to work and the temperature reading was incorrect.  They give you directions to read, but it's user-friendly.  

Fine experience overall, but some minor annoyances that seem unnecessary.",3,2015,05,19
250,My little hub at the airport,"I love this hotel. They always upgrade me (though I am a platinum member, this doesn't always happen at ihg hotels), the staff are super smiley, the club lounge has lovely nibbles and alcohol should you want it and the shuttle does what they say it will. A lovely stay in a nice place guaranteed. Just ignore the weird lobby art :)",5,2015,05,17
250,The best service for a place I couldn't stay,"Thanks so much to Alex .  We stopped at his Crowne Plaza very late last night, but they were booked.  Instead of just sending us away like the previous hotel, he proceeded to call every hotel in the area until on the TENTH try, he found us a room.   Thanks again Alex. Cheers.",5,2015,05,13
250,Lunch visit,Had lunch in this hotel today. ..menu was simple. .I had fish ...presentation was very good...cooked perfect...staff were friendly and attentive. ..hotel itself it very nice and presented very well...and with free parking makes it a very attractive proposal esp so near Dublin airport,5,2015,05,12
250,Weekend away,"Arrived down to the Crown Plaza on Saturday for a last minute weekend trip away and was immediately impressed. We were checked in by Beth at the reception desk and she was brilliant. She explained everything and it was a lovely welcome to the hotel. We spent the evening in the hotel and ate/drank in the bar. Service was brilliant once again - especially from Viera who was very attentive and always seemed to appear just as you needed her. Breakfast in the morning was once again - fantastic. there was a wide range of food and we were spoilt for choice.
over all, we had a wonderful stay at the Crown Plaza and will definitely be back!",5,2015,05,11
250,Like a home,"We can say that we are among the customers who have come to expect from a four star hotel next ... Clean rooms, friendly staff, luxurious facilities, quiet surroundings and offer extra services.They have already traveled a lot and slept in a number of mainly four-star hotels. I must say that this hotel fulfilled all my expectations. Very friendly staff to help with everything with a smile helps, very nice bar and cozy rooms. Everything is clean, beautiful, and you feel that you are welcome here. The hotel is outside the center, but the bus stop is 3 minutes away by foot and by bus to the city center for £ 2.60, takes about 30 minutes. We stayed in the room for three people and we really enjoyed it. Breakfast can not judge, we had paid for it. If you revisit Dublin I would sleep here.",5,2015,05,11
250,Wonderful Dublin Airport Hotel,"We decided to spend our last night in Ireland at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Northwood as several in our party had early morning flights. We were pretty tired from a long day of sightseeing and driving. We checked in with no problems and went to our rooms while the guys turned in our rental car. The hotel decor was very modern with big plush king beds, flat screen TV's, clean modern bathrooms, huge towels, nice toiletries, a tub and a shower! Everything was above average. The pub downstairs was busy but our waiter was very attentive and we wound up eating appetizers and a light dinner. It was typical bar food but nice and hot. No problem sleeping. The next morning we checked out and only waited maybe 5 minutes for the free airport shuttle. Highly recommend.",5,2015,05,10
250,Fabulous stay ,"One of the best experiences I've had in recent stays in hotels. Staff great and rooms well serviced with decent Towells and linen. 
My only complaint is breakfast is a bit lack lustre really and the quality not the same as the rest of the food eaten here. ",5,2015,05,09
250,Great Hotel.,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza over a weekend visit to Dublin. Really happy with the experience.
The hotel itself is situated next to wonderful big country park. Nice for walks and jogging in the morning. Looks great at sunset.
Whilst not in the centre on Dublin, it is easy to get to the hotel. There are at least 3 bus services which go between the here and Dublin city centre. Fairly regular too. #16, #41 & #33. A single fare is €2.80, only takes coins or a ""leap card"".
It takes around 25 min by bus but it's not an unpleasant journey at all. We had absolutely no problems getting around Dublin.

The hotel is really nice. We stayed in a club room on the 4th floor. Would definitely recommend it. Big rooms; comfortable, big bed; well cleaned and presented.
Quiet in the evening; easy to sleep.
We had the continental breakfast buffet option and it was really more than enough. We didn't bother to upgrade to hot breakfast; we were more than satisfied. We had breakfast in the restaurant on the ground floor which was nice and looked like it would probably be a good place for an evening meal too.
We didn't really use the club lounge; but we checked it out. It was spacious and relaxing and would be a good place to get work done. Accessible until 11pm, I think.
The staff were wonderful. Extremely helpful and friendly. We really felt well taken care of.
We will definitely be back.
",5,2015,05,09
250,Upgrade,"We had originally booked to stay in the Holiday Inn next door to the Plaza but after a late flight we arrived at the Holiday Inn to be told we had been upgraded to the Plaza.
We arrived at the reception to be told that we now had a twin room (we booked a double). After a word with a supervisor we were upgraded again to a bigger room with a double bed. It was late a night and we could have done without this but it was resolved in the end and in a very professional way.
The hotel itself is lovely, clean, tidy and well decorated. The pillows were a little lumpy but I bet if I'd have asked I could've got a different one. The bathroom in our room was spacious and the shower was great.
Free water, teas and coffee facilities, a hairdryer and free WiFi in the room.
Breakfast was an excellent buffet in the restaurant, good selection of breads, cheeses, meat and bakery products were available along with a cooked breakfast. 
Would stay here again.",4,2015,05,09
250,no complaints,"Stayed here last weekend for a much needed weekend break. 
Firstly the airport shuttle bus is very handy and the hotel only 10 mins away. we arrived very early, just before 8am but luckily the room was ready and we were able to check in.
The room was nice and clean, big bathroom. we didn't experience the complaint of some people that the shower water pressure wasn't up to much and the lack of hot water, the shower was fine and a double one.
The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. 
Whilst we didn't use any of the other facilities in the hotel it is certainly somewhere I have no complaints about and would certainly recommend to others.",5,2015,05,05
250,Excellent service recovery,"I am writing this review as it shows how with excellent customer service a BAD experience can be turned around into a VERY POSITIVE experience.  I booked a three night stay over a bank holiday weekend at the Crowne Plaza for myself and my 12 year old son.  The first night all went well and breakfast was good - diverse choice, something for everyone from the health conscious (porridge, seeds, etc) to the full Irish breakfast.  The second night was a disaster - drunk people on the corridor slamming doors for hours and shouting etc in the room right next to us...that went on til 4.30am when I decided I had enough, we couldn't get to sleep and I phoned security who responded very promptly and the noise ended at 5am.  I reported the incident to Reception the next day and they were very courteous and apologised and without my asking for any redress they gave us the last night of our stay for free and moved us up to a higher floor where all was quiet and we got a great sleep the next night....they also extended our check-out time from 12 noon to 4pm on our day of departure, free of charge.  I left feeling like all the staff we had interacted with were friendly and professional and that they had gone out of their way to remedy the situation.",4,2015,05,04
250,Very pleasant hotel,"I stayed here as part of a conference. Everything was great. Very pleasant an efficient staff. There is a good bar with nice atmosphere. 
Check in was good as was checkout. Room service was top class, on time and a good standard. 
Conference facilities were excellent and conference lunch was very good. Breakfast was very good and varied. 
Only niggle was that room lighting was poor for working as I had quite a bit to do on my first night. There was no way to get adequate light to the desk .
Overall very good.

",4,2015,05,03
250,Good Staff and great experience !,"Had stayed there half a dozen times last year as I had a project in an industrial estate  nearby ... found the staff very efficient, friendly and enjoyed my stay 

The WiFi infrastructure is good , you get a newspaper of your choice - for that morning coffee news glance, in house bar for a pint late evening is good , in house breakfast is also perfect - the staff keeps a lookout for your needs and you feel welcome 

The location allows for a good run around, if you are interested in running or a good walk (if the weather is kind enough) as the hotel is located in outskirts and not in the city center 

The rates are good and the location is also good for airport travellers , I like this place and would recommend this place if you are not interested in staying in the centre of the city. This place helps you to have a good pint of Guinness after work and head back to your room to have a good sleep for the night ! Perfect !",5,2015,05,02
250,marvellous hotel,"We arrived from the airport after our holiday. Didn't have to wait very long for the free shuttle and the driver was very polite. We booked in very promptly, were given our free WiFi pass. The room was lovely. Clean, well furnished and warm. Mini bar and usual tea making equipment .The bed was huge, linen good  quality and mattress comfy. All in all we were very impressed, the front of house staff helpful.
The breakfast delicious, great choice and staff so helpful.We really could not fault the place and will certainly return!",5,2015,05,01
250,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location close to the airport but no noise to disturb you in any major way. It is good value for money, the rooms are really nice and I couldn't fault anything.
The public areas are great and the bar menu good - although not for veggies so could improve there.
There is a lovely park opposite so you can get outside for a walk if you want to.
Would recommend this place without at doubt and personally will be using it again.",4,2015,05,01
250,Faultless,"From the shuttle bus there and back, my experience of this hotel was faultless. Spacious, modern, clean room with large bed and bathroom, excellent little extras, great Wifi, rapid lifts. Attentive reception. Dinners were superb, as were breakfasts. Highly recommended for airport and nearby business.",5,2015,05,01
250,Excellent,"Really great stay at crowne plaza northwood. Staff are excellent, food was very enjoyable, room had everything I needed. I will definitely book again. Also used a meeting room and had great service provided by shauna.",5,2015,04,29
250,Great airport hotel,Was in Ireland on business and spent a night here - had lunch which was lovely and some fab noodles for dinner - very clean in a lovely location - i wish i had taken some appropriate  clothes to take a walk in the park - maybe next time.  Friendly and professional staff and would definitely stay again either on business or on vacation,5,2015,04,28
250,Ideal for airport ,"Needed somewhere close to airport.
Takes 10 minutes on free shuttle bus which runs every 25 mins.
Hotel typical Crowne Plaza standard.
Efficient staff at check in. Rooms well appointed with great comfy bed. Nice and quiet. Room 143 was mine.
Breakfast is fine.
",5,2015,04,27
250,Good standard Crowne Plaza,"Stayed for 2 nights for a conference. This is a good hotel, located in a quite area but convenient to the M50 and Airport. Staff are all very polite and pleasant. The place is kept clean and well maintained. The rooms are still pretty fresh, even if a bit cramped with furniture. Beds are comfortable and pillows and linen fresh. The food is generally okay'ish. 
My only niggle was lack of flexibility in eating restaurant food in either the bar or the lobby, but to be fair they did explain how they didn't want to encourage this, which I scratch my head at, but it's their right.
WiFi worked great.",4,2015,04,24
250,Extra friendly staff.,"I arrived at this hotel at app. 10.15pm only to find the bar food kitchen closed. I mentioned it to the receptionist, who promptly asked what I would have liked. ""Anything at all,"" I said, ""chicken and lettuce sandwich, whatever."" With a smile she replied that she could do better than that. She phoned the kitchen and told me to go into the bar, handing me a voucher for a glass of wine. 15 minutes later she appeared with a lovely Club sandwich and fries. Olga, you are a star. First class customer service !
The room was was spacious and grand with jacuzzi style bath and separate shower with three sets of water jets coming from the wall. A desk, keyboard and armchair allowed for business and comfort.
I only had the continental breakfast which included a good selection of cold meats, fruit, yogurts and cheeses. All the staff were friendly and helpful as they are in their sister Hotel, the Crowne Plaza, Blanchardstown. The location is good if using Dublin airport or business meetings, or indeed the nearby giant Ikea store. I wouldn't recommend it for touring Dublin, better off with a city centre hotel, solely for convenience purposes..
All in all, an excellent hotel with great staff.",5,2015,04,23
250,Airport Hotel with Character,"This is the sister hotel of the Crowne Plaza in Blanchardstown and the similarities are obvious from arrival in terms of decor, in room amenities and the high quality of service. The reception staff go out of their way to provide a warm welcome. The rooms are clean, with good quality linens, but are a little on the small side. they do offer excellent fast wifi. Inexpensive parking is available at the adjacent Holiday Inn Express to guests, and a complimentary shuttle bus takes you the 6 minute drive to the terminals
The club lounge was disappointing, the breakfast offering in the lounge was meagre by comparison to other CP properties, and was not freshly prepared.  and the cocktail hour offered a limited selection. The night i attended  they struggled to find ice, and the canapes were gone within minutes of the lounge opening, and not replenished, leaving most guests to arrive to a messy set of empty platter that were not removed. Overall I would stay here again, but not in a club room, unless they up their game and provide a dedicated club concierge who takes ownership of the issues and has a pride in the presentation of the food and beverage offering in the lounge. Remember this is an airport style hotel, with all the bustle, and ambiance of a hotel with high room turnover. Nevertheless the staff do go out of their way to make you feel welcome, and despite the few hiccups offers a relaxing and above average airport hotel experience.",4,2015,04,19
250,Found by Error But Will Be Back,"Booked this hotel only because our usual stop whilst in Dublin, the Crowne Plaza at Blanchardstown was fully booked. Were very pleasantly surprised, this is on a par and we will be back. Were upgraded to a suite, and everything about it was spot on especially and most importantly the cleanliness. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, the bed was comfortable and work area plentiful. 

Had early meal in the restaurant, service and food was spot on , enjoyable experience.

The bar was showing Champions League football so unusually for a hotel bar it was rocking and buzzing, a great atmosphere.

Will be back great value great time",5,2015,04,15
250,Great staff and great rooms.,"Had a great stay at the Crowne Plaza twice in the last month. My girlfriend and I have been staying in Dublin quite a bit recently when we travel and decided to try the Crowne Plaza instead of the usual Bewleys and we were happy with our decision. 
The Crowne Plaza staff are excellent.  Both times they were very helpful and welcoming. The second time we arrive to find out check in date was a week previous and we were put down as no shows. I was very surprised but a mistake was made with the booking either on my behalf or the receptions behalf but nevertheless Olga came to the rescue.
Gave us a suite for the same price as the one which was previously booked for the wrong weekend,  two drink vouchers for the bar and a complimentary continental breakfast. We were over the moon at this and are very grateful! 
The room itself was second to none. We have stayed there twice now and both times the rooms were fitted out nicely and had everything we needed. 
Bar is nice and they have a sports area and a more quiet area too. 
So overall, great staff and great rooms. Need more?",5,2015,04,15
250,Training Hotel with some poor and some great service,"Stayed in this hotel, near the airport, on a weekend business trip to Dublin. We paid for a Club Class room for a little more privacy. In the even tthis was a good choice.
This hotel prides itself on being a training hotel taking students from local Hospitality Colleges.  All very laudable, but the people we met had poor english language skills and were not identified as trainees. At check-in the receptionist was unable to understand a question about wifi and a nearby colleague had to step in to 'translate'.
We faced the same problem with room service where the employee was unable to understand one of our menu choices, didn't deliver it and I had to point it out on the menu.
Subsequent discussions with the management suggested that they are aware that the language skills of their trainees was not good.

On the other hand the service in the Club Lounge was excellent with friendly and efficient staff who remembered us and our choices day - to - day.  

The room as very comfortable with the exception of the noise from the other doors in the corridor.  None, including the lounge, are fitted with soft close door closers and being an airport hotel with people arriving and leaving at all hours it was very noisy with slamming doors.

We didn't eat in the hotel, other than room service, as we were out alot.
On our last night the in-room safe failed with our passports inside leading to some tense moments as I threatened to get a crow bar!  In the end a nocturna, 2am, visit from a locksmith saved the day. The management did remove several charges on our bill as compensation.

The location is great, right opposite a big park, but I wouldn't stay again because of the language problems.",2,2015,04,13
250,Great room and good price,"I stayed here for one night and arrived in the early eveing.  The bus to get here was a bit of a faff - I was turned from the obvious bus with Crowne Plaza written on it as 'it was for crew'.  In fact getting to the bus stop was a bit of a nightmare - I asked at the infomation desk as to which stop the CP used and was told that the hotel had now changed to the Maldron (or something like that) and to go from stop 9.  I knew the CP had not changed names so luckily did not get on that bus but tried to find the stop.  It really is not well signposted at all and by the time I found stop 14, I was thoroughly fed up!

CHeck in was quick and I was soon heading up to my room.  The room was nicely decorating and pretty modern - I really do like the Crowne Plaza rooms.

I headed off down to the bar for some food and thought it was a great mix for all tastes.  A bit of a sports bar, a bit of a bisto, a bit of a wine bar and ti had pretty good food.  I spent a very pleasant couple of hours there before heading to bed.

I slept like a baby - the room was very quiet and the bed super comfy.  I had been upgraded to a Club Room, although the Club lounge was closed on the day I arrived due to it being a bank holiday.  I was given 2 drinks vouchers instead which was perfectly acceptable.  I went to breakfast in the Lounge though and it was a continetnal breakfast.  The choice was sufficient, and I had fruit that was super fresh.

I was soon chekcing out and heading back to the airport - the bus that took me back was horrid - really really old and I was a little worried my cream trousers would be stained by the seats - not a great experience - although the bus driver was really friendly.

Overall, I would recommedn the hotel to anyway staying for a night close to the airport.",4,2015,04,12
250,"Great location, very welcoming","Stayed here for 5 nights early April on a business trip. 
The location and setting of this hotel is second to none, close to the airport and directly opposite lovely park. 
I had a problem with a whistling window in my room, reported to reception and it was immediately repaired! 
I was a little disappointed with the Irish stew though. It was more like boiled lamb swimming in a bowl of stock, I did mention this to the waiter and he apologized and brought a complimentary drink, although on our final bill was a bottle of red wine which we didn't order, this was also quickly rectified. 

All in all a good hotel, good service, especially the receptionist.",4,2015,04,11
250,Would stay again despite the problems,"I had a very brief stay for 1 night and arrived just before midnight. I was advised they were full and apologies offered for the lack of an upgrade.
My room was some way from the lifts but was very pleasant with two beds and the usual paraphernalia. It looked recently refurbished. 
When I tried to have a shower however there was no hot water and the shower ran for some time before it got even tepid. By the time it was warm the shower tray was filled with cold water and would not drain away. 
I called the front desk to tell them but it was now well after midnight so I did not want anything done. I had a very brief cool shower!
In the morning things were no better and I had to check out at 5.30.
The front desk agent was great and after a brief discussion refunded my night charge in full. It was brilliantly handled and I could not fault the way he handled things.
Things like this happen occasionally and my experience would not stop me staying at this hotel in the future.",4,2015,04,09
250,The nicest staff I have ever encountered!,"Outstanding level of service, particularly from Olga on reception who managed to sort out a booking error caused by my own stupidity! I have stayed at almost all the hotels in or around Dublin airport, and this is by far the best. Clean, efficient, great bar, great food and, as I said, the nicest staff i have ever come across in a hotel. I can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2015,04,06
250,Excellent,"Really enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza Northwood.  The hotel is one of the best I have been in.  The service, room, food and location was top class. I stayed there in August and went to a championship match in Croke Park and really enjoyed the weekend.   I would highly recommend this hotel.

250,Disappointed ,"I recently stayed at the Crown Plaza hotel on the last night of my vacation. I chose this hotel based on the previous reviews, it's location and price. All in all I was rather disappointed with this hotel. The room was furnished fairly nicely and the bathroom looked amazing having a stand up shower and bathtub. Unfortunately, as my girlfriend found out quickly, there was very little hot water. I mean very little by it was about a minute long before it cut out and didn't return. I have never experienced such an issue with such a large hotel. Also the shuttle service didn't even start until 5 a.m. So we had to get a taxi to the airport. Out of our whole trip this was supposed to be an easy comfortable night before our flight back.  Unfortunately I would not putting any faith in this hotel for future stays.",2,2015,04,05
250,Comfy Airport Hotel,"Stayed one night after arriving in Dublin on our way north - as usual, a nice stay at a Crowne Plaza! Staff were friendly and accommodating, room was quiet with attractive decor, and the bed was comfy. Only issue was a backed up bathroom drain which was fixed immediately after notifying staff. The location is close to the airport, but a bit far from the city centre. However, a lovely park is across the street and a nice place to walk after a long flight. Overall a positive stay!",4,2015,04,03
250,"The hotel is lovely and well located, but the best part is the staff","I stayed in room 213 on April 3rd. I found a great, last minute value on booking this hotel and wasn't expecting it to be so nice. From the front desk, the restaurant and especially room service, they went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and cared about. A minor issue was quickly fixed and they just have more heart than staff at hotels I have experienced in 2014-2015. The rooms are well appointed with everything you need and free wifi. This is the hotel to stay at when in Dublin, It is convenient to the bus and there is a beautiful park across the street. Thank you Crowne Plaza Dublin.",5,2015,04,03
250,Great Place,"I have been staying in this property twice a year for the past 3 years or so now. I always find it clean, quite and excellent service. My only comment is the beds are not the most comfortable. This stay (8) days, the bed squeaked every time I moved and was hard on the back. ",4,2015,04,03
250,Great Customer Experience and IHG Member Treatment,Great accommodation and amazing upgrade from the near by Holiday Inn Express to Crowne Plaza for an IHG member as the HIE was fully booked due to a party...Everything was great truly recommend it for a close by stay at Dublin airport!!!,5,2015,03,31
250,Grand Job,"We had a Formal Ball here on the 26th of March in C&E, one of the best nights I've had! The Hotel was so accommodating. The function room was fab, the layout was gorgeous, red carpet and all!! Rooms were unbelievable. Well worth the price. Not much choice in food but the chicken dish was lovely and the dessert was too. Didn't take long to come out either. Staff were lovely, seemed busy but organised! I had to ask for water 3 times at the Bar until someone else got it, I found that odd! The night staff had their hands full yet they were still nice. The security guard, who also works in Coppers (i never got his name), was such a Gent! 

Now that night, I stayed in the Holiday Inn and a shout out to the Indian female receptionist, I couldn't read her name but it started with an 'O'. She was especially nice! (She's the main reason i'm writing this) The breakfast was amazing, well needed. The rooms were nice, not as nice as the Crowne Plaza but comfy and warm. 
Now the T.V. was a bit difficult to work.

I'd come back again.",5,2015,03,31
250,SUPER HOTEL,"Very nice hotel close to airport and only 10 min by taxi to city center. Perfect service, very nice big rooms, good restaurant bar open till late hours. Breakfest was ok. Fast free internet. Only problem was very samll choice of room servis menu and poor quality of it when restaurant was closed",5,2015,03,31
250,Hidden gem,"I stayed at this hotel the night before an early morning flight and was very pleasantly surprised. It's in a really quiet location yet only a 7 minute drive from the airport. Stayed in a standard room, it had lovely modern decor and all the mod cons, plus a white towelling robe and two free bottles of water. Well priced, secure car park and friendly staff, will definitely be back",5,2015,03,27

250,Very Good,I was staying here as it was handy to the Sport's Clinic where my son was having surgery.The room was a good size with a very comfortable bed.It is always nice to have tea and coffee making facilities with a few biscuits to go with it.Food in both the restaurant and room service was very tasty.Reception staff very pleasant.,4,2015,03,25
250,"nice ,comfortable hotel",Great for parking and getting hotel bus into airport which is close enough. Friendly staff and good selection at breakfast and bar food. Little extras in rooms and toiletries available if you forget something.,4,2015,03,24
250,Nothing was a bother,"We stayed here at the  weekend. My husband and son stayed in a family room which was very big and very comfortable with lovely views over the park.  My parents stayed In a club  room at check in my mother was  told that the rest of the family could use the club lounge too which was lovely.  

Breakfasts are brilliant and well worth the money.

Shuttle bus between the airpor is a real bonus too. The hotel ordered us a five seater taxi which took us right into the centre of Dublin for €15.

The food and drinks In the hotel is very reasonable too.",5,2015,03,23
250,High standards,Although this could be classed very much as an airport hotel it is set in a secluded location served by a free frequent shuttle.  It is ideally placed for public transport direct to the Herat of Dublin. Checkin was smooth and the room very well appointed. Staff very good do all in sll a deserved rating.,5,2015,03,22
250,"Good, but rooms need updating and maintenance.","I stayed in this hotel for one night on my own. For my single supplement it was €119. Little bit expensive for one person in a double bed bedroom. I got a room for disabled. This room needs updating. The chairs were too low when sat on. The mattress in the bed needs to be changed, its past its sell buy date. One of the tiles in the toilet inside the door was raised and could cut the feet of someone. The shower head needs replacing. 
The bar food was good and plentiful. Try the marvellous burgers. The staff were more than helpful. The buffet breakfast was very good and there were ample foods on display.
There is wifi in each room and a computer room available. There is a beautiful park for families directly across form the Hotel and taxis available at the front door.",3,2015,03,21
250,nice place but take your hairdryer girls,"stayed for paddys weekend love Dublin, nice hotel spacious rooms well equipped clean helpful staff. some of the party said the shower was cold but we found it fine, a long way from the centre so taxis are costly, would stay again but the hairdryer was useless you are better off sticking your head out of a window",4,2015,03,18
250,"Fine Crown Plaza,  super service.","This Crown Plaza is a nice hotel.  it lacks just a few minor things to be absolute top of this level of hotel.  I do stay a lot in Holiday-Inn (Express), Crown Plaza, Intercontinental, hence IHG.  So I can compare :-)  A swimming pool, sauna is an unfortunate lack. The breakfast could be a bit more of an experience.  The difference between a good Holiday-Inn and this Crown Plaza is in my view minimal. To make a true difference and bring it up to the expected level of a Crown Plaza, the good business and leisure hotel level.  The above points would have make that difference.

The food quality of the restaurant is good, the finesse on the composition of the plates could just a bit more subtle.  Also doing an evening special next to the set menu card brings an other extra touch. The Bar is nicely styled and the busier place compared to the restaurant. 
Unless going to Sword, Drumcondra, Malahide or Downtown Dublin there is nothing around there. So keeping the bar and restaurant at good top level is an absolute key value for this hotel.

The staff lucky makes up on the minor points I mentioned.  They really take care of their guests and for people that are longer from home, make them feel truly welcome and as much as home as possible. When the family was over for a weekend they also took care. We had a room with double beds. :-)",4,2015,03,14
250,Pre-flight Pleasure,"Recently stayed for 1 night before a flight to Egypt, using the park and fly arrangement.
This hotel is a little more special than the normal airport hotels and there are no major junctions to cross to the airport.
We had a relaxing evening eating in the lounge beside the fish tank! Food ok and not too expensive.
The shuttle bus to the airport runs every 20 mins and we found it quite convenient.
There's an Italian restaurant just outside the main gates of the demesne which is quite pleasant.
All in all a pleasant evening to get in the holiday mood.",4,2015,03,12
250,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights to attend a concert at the 3 arena. Really lovely hotel, only a short drive or free shuttle from the airport. Well decorated with a lovely, modern room and a huge bed. Excellent service and delicious breakfast - I recommend the pancakes and waffles. The only negative was the shower - you practically had to run around to get wet. I would stay here again though.",4,2015,03,10
250,If only England had won as well.......,"Stayed here over the weekend for the rugby international. Good hotel, very reasonably priced. Could only book 'room only' online but when we arrived we were offered breakfast at €10; when I asked what the price would be if we were just to turn up and have it we were told €15 so we took advantage.
Hotel clean and tidy; the room could have just done with a few more lights available as it was quite dark but no complaints.
We stayed for 3 nights for the cost of one in the City / nearer the rugby ground.
Great location near the airport with free courtesy bus every 20 minutes; bit of a hike from town but there's good public transport outside on the main road and a tourist ticket for all public transport (bus, train and tram) is €19.50 for 72 hours and that was worth having.",5,2015,03,05
250,Weekend in Dublin,We stayed here at the weekend and had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is lovely. We booked an executive room and it was well worth it. The staff were very helpful and always pleasant. The food was lovely.,5,2015,03,03
250,Convenient for airport but thats about it,"As with all chain hotels they can often lose personality & unfortunately this is the case with the Crowne Plaza in Dublin. 

The convenience to the hotel is great for the airport but the breakfast was disappointing. On arrival to the breakfasting restaurant even although guests are asked to be seated, the waiter just said we could find our own table (bearing in mind the restaurant was very busy).

I did not feel this made a good first impression. To be fair I did feel sorry for the waiter as he was greeting & serving all guests - this was short staffedness as per the hotel management - NOT GOOD.

On the positive side of things our room was satisfactory, the bathroom looked tired & shower curtains are awful. The bed was comfy enough but the duvrt was thin & I did appreciate the complimentary relaxing bed mist & pulse point rollerball on arrival - this was an original complimentary toiletry & beats a useless sewing kit any day.

In future I would stay at a Premier Inn as the beds, bathrooms & facilities are on a par - only a good bit cheaper.",3,2015,03,03
250,nice hotel   nice staff,"Stayed here before an early flight
had a bite to eat in the bar   very nice well served and reasonably priced .
room excellent in every respect but the room s appears dark at first but then the lights seem to ""warm Up "" and the light level improves

left my car there and took the hotel shuttle to the airport   €6.00 a day for the car and the shuttle back to the hotel   great value for money 

all in all a very positive experience",4,2015,03,03
250,"Very comfortable hotel, friendly staff, great for airport","Hotel room was very comfortable and well furnished.  Staff were very helpful and welcoming.  The free airport shuttle bus runs every 20 minutes and is only 5-10 minutes from the airport, so very convenient.",5,2015,03,02
250,pretty good hotel.,"Stayed for a couple of nights in this hotel before flying out of the airport. The room was pretty good and well organised, however the bathroom was fairly poor considering how new the rest of the hotel looks. I'm not a fan of shower curtains and the lack of space for showering in the bath took the shine off the effect of the room. Some nice touches in the room including a pack with sleep spray and pulse point sleep roll on were really good. 
The staff were really friendly and helpful and the only issue we had was a really noisy school party who were having some kind of do in the lobby while we were in the restaurant. Sort of ruined the nice relaxed atmosphere. 
To sum up, it was as good as a Premier Inn,  but significantly more expensive and out of the way.",4,2015,03,02
250,Blissful - thank you,"My husband and I spent Thursday/Friday at this hotel and it was fabulous.  The reception staff (Beth in particular) were welcoming, attentive and helpful.  Our room (it was on the 4th Floor Club Level) was great, filled with everything and anything we could need.  The Club Lounge was fantastic and expertly ran by helpful people.  Dinner and breakfast at the hotel were excellent.  Breakfast in particular had just about every choice of food available, all fresh and cooked to perfection.  The bar prices are slightly above average but when everything else was just so good it didn't matter.

Thank you CP Northwood.  We hope to return one day.",5,2015,03,02
250,"Good hotel before or after a flight, but breakfast in quality / experience could be much better","We have stayed before at the Crowne Plaza Northwood, but preferred the neighboring Holiday Inn Express, because the property offered 1000 Bonus Points per stay. Now the bonus points were not available at our favorite property, but at the Crowne Plaza. We were collecting points at IHG's loyalty program, so we booked a night at the property during a weekend in November 2014.

We took the Airlink bus 747 from the city center to Dublin Airport and changed to the Crowne Plaza/Holiday Inn Express free shuttle bus. We had heard there was a new bus, but unfortunately we had on each occasion the older one, which wasn't that comfortable.

Check in was pleasant and we were recognized by a member of staff from previous stays at the Holiday Inn Express. She was delighted to see us and it made us happy too. Since we had achieved gold status within the IHG Rewards Club we were upgraded to an Executive Room with club lounge access, which we appreciated.	The lounge has a Happy Hour during the week, but serves only non-alcoholic drinks and hot beverages during the weekend. Unfortunately it wasn't regularly re-stocked, so when we wanted still water it was already gone on Sunday morning.

Our room was on the 4th floor. 

It was large and held mostly in red, brown, white and black with some Asian touches. There was a chair and ottoman. It was comfortable, but didn't face the TV, a slight inconvenience. Even though the room was large, it felt a bit cramped.

The bed allowed for a great night's sleep.

The bathroom was inspired by the Burren. 

The amenities were from Temple Spa London, Gilchrist & Soames, a first for us. We liked these upscale products.

The bath tub and shower were separate. The water pressure was very good.

During our stay we also went to Touzai on the ground floor for dinner. There was a special offer available, which we used. We had one two course meal and one three course and a bottle of water for 50.15 Euro (ca. 62.65 USD). The cuisine is Asian (For example fish mouoli and chicken assado were our main courses.) and was good quality and delicious, but the portions were way too large. 

The staff was attentive.

Afterwards we went to the bar for hot chocolate, because we received a voucher, which could be only used at the Cinnabar, for a free drink. The bar was extremely busy and under staffed. Our waitress was stressed out and for some reason thought we believed we were entitled to two free drinks. Having cleared we were aware of the voucher was only valid for one drink, she took our order. The hot chocolate was slightly too sweet for our flavor, but otherwise good.

Breakfast was the worst we had in a longer time. There was somebody at the front, but the person only asked for the room number and left us to our own devices. The restaurant was full; there were some uncleared tables and it wasn't obvious which ones were in use and which ones weren't. 

The restaurant manager advised us a table would be available soon, so we had to wait, disturbing other guests on the way to and from the buffet.

Finally we received our table and from there it went okay. Again the quality of the breakfast buffet and how it had been treated by other diners, was a letdown.

After breakfast we went for a walk in the park opposite the hotel, it's called Santry Demesne. We do that always, when staying either at the Crowne Plaza or Holiday Inn Express, weather and time permitting.

Check out was done quickly and efficient.

Would we stay here again? Maybe if we need points or have a purpose driven stay before or after a flight.

Would we recommend this hotel to a friend? Maybe, only before or after a flight.
Would we stay again here in the future? Maybe, again, only before or after a flight.",4,2015,03,02
250,Great stay,"Very nice welcoming. Really compfortable and cleany room, a huge choice of good products for the irish breakfast (black and white pudding, omelette, eggs of your choice... crèpe, waffels...). The hotel is a little bit far from the city center, but the bus or a taxi is easy to find at 2 minuts.",4,2015,03,01
250,Great trendy hotel for an early flight out the next morning.,"Stayed here a few times...always the night before an early flight back to the States the next day. Nice comfortable restaurant / bar right off the lobby. Free airport shuttle!!
Located in a Business/Office park region. Quiet at night.
Only negative...No stores or other restaurants within reasonable walking distance.",4,2015,03,01
250,Not Cheap,"This has got to be the most expensive place in Dublin if not Ireland for having a drink. Granted I was there for a function but I don't think that justifies being charged nearly 6 Euro for a pint, and just over 3 euro for a soft drink and water. I felt very sorry for our server as I explained to him if it had been just under the 5 he would have been able to keep the change.
I can totally understand higher prices in good hotels but I am totally against being ripped off by the hotel industry.",3,2015,03,01
250,Rugby Weekend - Ire v Eng,"This is now the second time I have stayed in this wonderful Hotel. Worried that taking friends that the initial experience would not be the same  forget that!
Frrom the initiaal check in - despite a major party on going - the service from Franesco was exceptional.
Literally 2 miles from Dublin Airport - exceptinal Hotel Bus service direct to Hotel.- from the time you check in you will be greeted with exceptional service - in the Bar Area - the wonderful Aisling is outstanding.
Tomorrow we play England - 9Km from Lansdowne Road - why would I stay anywherre else (and my friends totally agree - thankfully.)
BUS at 2.30 EURO or a  £20 Taxi ride to Stephens Green.

I must mention some notable (exceptional staff);
Liam - Night Reception
Andre - reception
Yorgina - nothing is too much truble
but especially Kieron - young, enthusiastic but so customer friendly.

Come on Ireland - this Hotel is exceptional for all things Dublin",5,2015,02,28
250,Good Hotel for the Port,"Overnighted here before hitting the port, its 15 minutes in the car and close to the tunnel entrance so ideal as very unlikely to see any delay. About half an hour in taxi to the centre of town. Excellent checkin, decent car park at 6 euro a day. Breakfast was also very good with excellent cooked and full variety of fruit and cold cuts. Rooms as per the Crowne Plaza menyu, comfortable beds for a good sleep. This hotel also reasonably priced.",4,2015,02,21
250,Great Hotel for Dublin,"The hotel is very convenient for Dublin Airport so it suits the business traveller but as we were just holiday makers away for a city break we found it also good even if the likes of O'Connell Street was a 20 minute bus ride away.The bus stop is just at the bottom of the hotel drive both for going into Dublin and returning back to the hotel - a great way to meet the locals and listen to ""craic"".
We arrived at the hotel at 8.00am and were met by very friendly staff in a very nice and airy reception area.The reception staff who are extremely friendly and polite(as indeed are all the staff we met) allocated us a room staight away (check in not normally till 2.00pm!) and so our city break got off to a flying start.
The hotel is relatively new and modern with free wi-fi and spotlessly clean with large bedrooms and bathrooms(seperate shower and bath - no legover the bath to have a shower!)The bed was large(6 foot wide) and extremely comfortable and the complimentary drinks(tea & coffee etc) were excellent.
All in all a very good hotel with very good dining facilities and food for both dinner and breakfast.The wine list was OK but there again you do have Guiness on Draught!
It is an hotel I would visit again whether for business or pleasure.",4,2015,02,20
250,Great hotel and great service! ,"Olga at the front desk is wonderful! We had a bit ofa stressful time getting to the hotel since the cab who picked us up at the train station took us on an 'tour' of Dublin without asking us and we paid twice what we should have - but Olga made us welcome and was so helpful. 

This hotel it's beautiful and charming. It's new enough to have all the modern conveniences and retains Ireland's special charm.  Definitely will be rebooking here!",5,2015,02,19
250,Great hotel while on business,"Checked in for 2 nights while in Dublin on business. Short drive from the airport its ideal. First impressions were good. Nice large airy lobby, receptionist was very polite and helpful and quick with checking us in, ideal after coming off an early morning flight and full day at work. This hotel was well appreciated. Was very happy  with my room. Good size, smelled clean and fresh. Good size bed, lovely and comfortable. Bathroom was clean and loved the fact it had a separate shower cubicle to the bath. Stayed in the first night had dinner in the Cinnabar, quick service and food was good, no complaints. First morning i went for breakfast, the service was very slow and the restaurant was not overly busy. Once i sat down it took ages to get a cup of tea and had to ask twice id pretty much finished my breakfast. It was the same the next morning. If anything that would be the only negative i have, was the waiting around to be seated for breakfast. The staff once they served you were polite and  friendly. I would defo stay here again, its a lovely comfortable hotel with the air of luxury i like.",5,2015,02,18
250,I'd say it's the best hotel at Dublin Airport,"Had a night stop at the Crowne Plaza as I had business at the airport. I've stayed in most of the hotels around the airport and I have to say I think this is by far the best. It's modern, well managed and efficient. The Restaurant is worthy of its Rosettes and way better than you'd expect for an airport hotel. If you don't want a posh meal, the sports bar is perfect, serving the usual burgers and steaks in front of numerous TVs showing the football.
I stayed in an executive room. Use of the executive lounge is included. My only gripe is that there were no snacks available in the afternoon (a cup of tea and a cake would have been nice) and there was a distinct lack of choice (booze and nibbles) during cocktail hour. If you are offering this, then please do it properly. Look at overseas hotels or London establishments and learn what a cocktail hour should be like. If you need to increase charges, then do it. Don't scrimp on one choice of red wine, one choice of white and bottles of Heineken with tiny ham and cheese toast bites. Push the boat out! Those of us staying in executive rooms are on expenses and we like to fill up during the cocktail hour as part of the room rate! It makes expense claims so much easier!! Another £50 on the price of the room would enable you to offer a fabulous executive lounge experience.",4,2015,02,17
250,A bit too far from town for a weekend visit to Dublin. ,"Close to the airport but a little further from town. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. 
It was a shame that the hotel was so far from town. It's fairly easy to get to town by bus avoid the number 16 bus as it takes longer to get to town. If need a taxi walk to the road and flag one down, for some reason it was cheaper than using one that was waiting at the hotel. And taxi back from town taken from the 0' Connell St rank only cost €12! (Hotel quoted about €24)   
One down side was that you could hear the plane noise from the airport in the rooms especially in the early mornings.",4,2015,02,09
250,Top class hotel,"During our last stay in the Crowne Plaza, Northwood, we had a few issues with the Royal Suite, and as a goodwill gesture, we were invited to return for a complimentary stay ( in the same suite). This is an excellent example of management responding to the concerns of guests, and going the extra mile to restore satisfaction. 

I had not requested an early check and when we arrived just after 12 noon, we were informed that the room was not yet ready (due to the hotel being fully booked the previous night). However we were given room keys and invited to use the Club Lounge until then. This was a very nice gesture, and we enjoyed a relaxing hour with coffee, soft drinks and took advantage of the hotel’s complimentary internet access.

The Royal Suite is huge: almost three times the size of the hotel's normal rooms. Carpets, curtains and soft furnishings are dark red, with beige walls. Both rooms have televisions, and the bathroom a separate shower & Jacuzzi bath. There is even a separate toilet beside the living area. Very plush and inviting indeed.

A few minutes after we were in the room, a large platter of sliced fruit was delivered. Another lovely touch.

We ordered lunch from the room service menu: 

•	Rib Eye Steak: with sautee onions, pepper sauce, rocket & parmesan salad, served with fries.
•	Classic Club Sandwich: triple decker toasted sandwich with chicken, egg mayonnaise, tomato, bacon and lettuce, served with fries.

Portions were generous, well presented, and perfectly cooked. Very good value too, at under 40Euro (including tray charge). Over the several years we have stayed here, the food is always excellent.

Later that evening, we had to go out, and on our return visited the bar for a snack. We both chose the soup and sandwich special: a freshly made (to order) sandwich, large bowl of mushroom soup, brown bread, crisps, salad. Once again, high quality food at a reasonable price: 9.95euro represents excellent value.

The Club floor includes continental breakfast, and at weekends is served in the Touzai restaurant. For a mere 5euro, a cooked buffet is available, and is a veritable bargain.

Overall this was a very enjoyable stay. The food in the bar,
 restaurant, and room service was top class. The hotel is to be commended for maintaining this high quality and competitive price structure. Staff are friendly and very helpful.

There is a regular shuttle to Dublin airport, and a car park (shared with sister hotel Holiday Inn Express) which costs 6 euro for a 24 hour stay. 

A business centre is available for those who need to work.

We have stayed in the Crowne Plaza many times, and recommend the hotel.",5,2015,02,01
250,Lovely start to our trip,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed in this hotel for one night. It was the first day (night) out of our 6 day adventurous trip starting in Ireland. Since our flight was arriving quite late, after 10pm, the hotel had a very convenient location for us as it is very close to the airport. The hotel shuttle bus that was available even so late at night was amazing and made it much easier for us. We were welcomed by a lovely receptionist Olga, who was very kind and professional and made our entire stay a great experience. We met her also when leaving in the morning, and I must say it was a pleasure talking to her. Breakfast was delicious. The range of foods you can choose from is just great and the staff were very nice, neat and in a very good mood – and that can make your day in the morning! Thank you",5,2015,02,01
250,Very convenient for business stay,"I stayed here for two nights on a business trip to a nearby university. The location itself is rather out of the way but it is convenient for those who need to have a good, comfortable and well serviced hotel while on business at one of a number of adjacent offices, or the Santry Sports Surgery Clinic, or DCU.

I was very pleased at check-in when, after a late night check-in and finding that I had been given a room without a bath, the woman at reception (Olga, from South Africa) swiftly arranged a room change without any difficulty, despite the hotel being almost full.

In summary, the food, service, facilities, quality and cleanliness were all very good. I would happily return, and can recommend it highly.",4,2015,01,31
250,Great value,"Stayed here for one night in December prior to picking up a hire car at the airport next morning. Booked two rooms online with no problems. Arrived late due to weather delays and the greeting was warm and friendly, check in fast , rooms very clean, beds comfy and free wifi made the teenagers very happy. The hotel was very busy but rooms were quiet and breakfast was great. Quick check out free shuttle to the airport . The friendly professional staff are the stars of this hotel and I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to all.",5,2015,01,29
250,Business trip to Dublin,"Stopover for a business trip. Hotel, restaurant, staff and bedroom excellent. 5* - no complaints at all.
I'd also make a mention for the club lounge on the 4th floor. Great for a quiet drink and breakfast. Staff attention really good.",5,2015,01,23
250,Nice Hotel,"Very pleasant. At risk of falling into the 'inoffensively bland' scale of neutrality, but otherwise nothing to complain about. Service was pleasant, rooms were well-outfitted, spacious and tasteful. Breakfast disappointing, but that's a universal hotel truth.",4,2015,01,22
250,Accessible for work,"Having travelled to Dublin for work i needed a hotel that was close by yet relaxing. Check in was easy and the room was amazing two double beds all to myself. The additon of free wifi was god send. 

Though I did stay on the windiest day of the year and both the tv and the wifi cut out during the night. The other thing was the room was really hot, I tried to turn the aircon down but was not succesful. 

Travel to the various locations I needed to get to was by taxi which was acceptable. I had a drink in the bar in the evening but didn't eat so cannot comment on the evening food, however the breakfast was a plethora of lovely things, though no baked beans!

Over all he hotel is perfect for a business trip or a night before flying out somewhere, its clean, accesible and friendly I would stay again.",4,2015,01,19
250,fabulous,"Stayed here twice, spotless, friendly and very helpful. Great value for money. I will be definitely be going back again.staff accomodate to your every need, food is lovely and the riverside view is nice",5,2015,01,15
250,Average hotel close to airport,"if you are looking for a hotel close to the airport that is clean and functional this is a great place.  It is not too far from the major places to visit in Dublin via taxi. 
But if you prefer to walk this is not the place to choose. It is also not the typical quality of a Crowne Plaza, in my experience. To meet that standard The hotel is in need of facelift. 
Most of the staff were friendly and helpful except the one gentlemen who had come to the end of his shift and made clear he wouldn't stay a second longer to answer my query... Again not typical of my experiences at the Crowne Plaza...Maybe he had a bad day. ",3,2015,01,13
250,Great hotel,"We stayed for 1 night on saturday10 January 2015 the hotel is spotless ,had a small problem with some noise ,but was sorted out very quick .this is a 4 star hotel ,but with 5 star service.this is one hotel we will be staying at again very soon.",5,2015,01,11
250,Great service,"I went for a meal with my family and the overall service was great. One waitress stood out in particular, a young girl named Daniela. She was friendly and polite. The meal was of good quality and the prices were reasonable. I would recommend Crowne Plaza to everyone.",5,2015,01,10
250,Above average airport hotel,"Good airport hotel, nice rooms, nice bathrooms. Good bar and prices were ok.

Check in and out were very smooth and the free shuttle service was both quick and handy.

All in, a good choice and I would stay here again if needing an overnight before a flight.",3,2015,01,09
250,Great place to stay,Was at conference here in December and stayed. Conference rooms were great and meal in restaurant was a wonderful end to busy day. Hotel staff are helpful and pleasant to deal with. I've also been to a wedding reception in the past here and it was spectacular. Definitely know how to treat customers. Worth a visit. ,5,2015,01,08
250,Very comfy,"I use this hotel about 4-6 times per year before I travel on early morning flights. It's super comfortable, always clean and does an excellent breakfast. It would be nice if parking was included for those staying over night, it's not like it's a city center location where parking is at a premium.",5,2015,01,07
250,Best Hotel Iv Ever Stayed At Worldwide,"Flights were cancelled at Dublin airport and they put us in the crown plaza we were supposed to fly to New Zealand and we actually wish our flights could of been delayed for a week the hotel catered our every need. 

The food was amazing with great service..

The room was clean and so relaxing great sleep and a lovely shower. 

And the best of all the shuttle bus driver Shane got us in great spirits for our rescheduled flight. 

Would defiantly recommend the crown plaza hotel it was a fantastic experience 
",5,2015,01,05
250,Very nice,"Booked this hotel as part of a new year break package.

Breakfast was not included so we had to pay extra.

Hotel facilities are fab!

Breakfast was good.
Rooms perfect with everything you need.
Hotel immaculate.
Staff very friendly 

Not ideal location if you want to be near town we had to get taxis that cost approx €15-20 you can get a bus at the bottom of the road.

Will be visiting again next month.",5,2015,01,02
250,Very good breakfast buffet!,"The breakfast was excellent. It was better than a breakfast I had at Negresco hotel in Nice a few days earlier.
The room was spacious and clean, but a little chilly at the night.
It is American style room in Europe.
The shuttle bus came promptly even thought there was only our couple waiting.

I would recommend.",4,2015,01,02
250,Overnight stay for airport collection,"Rooms were spotless with everything you could want. From minibar to full bathroom with separate shower.temperature perfect. .staff were very helpful  . It was an extremely cold night when we were there so a little chilly in the bar/reception area for food and drinks.  Unfortunately the lovely restaurant was closed but there is a lovely little Chinese a 2 min walk down the road which the hotel called and booked for us. Overall a beautiful hotel. Great service. Great location. Will be back !,",5,2014,12,31

250,"Lovely, Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dublin","I stayed here one night before our early departure out of Dublin airport. This hotel is near the airport. Free (every 20 minutes) airport shuttle bus. The room was very comfortable and bathroom huge. Room was modern, clean with good sized bathroom.  A worthy recommendation.",5,2014,12,12
250,Modern efficiency laced with Irish charm...,"I had booked an executive room but was delighted to be upgraded to a junior suite for our three night stay.So a double size room with a lounge area as well as a bedroom and bathroom. And access to the executive lounge (although there are limited facilities at the weekend.) Although this hotel is near the airport, it is far enough away not to be bothered by noise. And being on the way into town, with easy access to bus routes and the free (every 20 minutes) airport shuttle bus, it works well as a base for sightseeing as well as for those needing an overnight pre or post flights.Being opposite a large park makes for a quiet and tranquil location (and with jogging trails for those who like such things!). The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful and the food was good (if not great), although we did think that the full ""Irish"" breakfast was very good. Even had Bircher muesli! We'd stay here again.(Tip - join the IHG scheme for benefits such as comlimentary wifi)",4,2014,12,11
250,Pleasure to deal with!,When Dealing with Judith Graham for my fundraiser event I found her to be very helpful and efficient !! She was more than kind and took everything into account that I requested! Would be happy to deal again with the management here!,5,2014,12,10
250,exceeded expectations - convenient to airport,"Wow, what a nice place to end our trip to Ireland on.  We stayed here one night before our early departure out of Dublin airport.  Service was excellent.  They were quick to provide a very comfortable roll out bed for my daughter.  The room was very comfortable and bathroom huge.  The lobby and main areas were large and well decorated for Christmas.  We had a nice dinner in the restaurant with excellent service, and kids ate for free.  The airport shuttle was great, right on time.  We returned our rental car the night before leaving, so that made our departure that much easier.  Plus we didn't have to pay for parking.  Would highly recommend if you need a place to stay near Dublin airport.",5,2014,12,08
250,Great service,"We went here for my brothers graduation and the food and service was excellent!  Katja was our waitress she was extremely friendly and made our meal a lot more enjoyable. I would definately come here again

250,Very nice hotel,We spend one night on the week end. We had a very nice room at the second floor .A ver  good breakfast. The only minor thing is the light noise of the plane in the morning but nothing to prevent you from sleeping. I will recommend.,4,2014,12,03
250,Excellent service,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza before a trip. It was wonderful everyone was very nice and extremely helpful. The room was clean the bar was nice and the breakfast was great.

The location is especially helpful to us as it was very close to the airport and extremely close to the bus service to take us into downtown Dublin.

The Wi-Fi worked wonderfully all throughout the hotels able to make Wi-Fi phone calls back to United States while at the hotel",5,2014,12,02

250,pretty good,stayed for one night with 2 kids. rooms small but clean. it would be nice if AC could be set lower than 19degs though! breakfast nice and good quality. One tip...it would be an idea to let guests know prior to arrival where to park...bit confusing since another hotel right next door and its not clear where to park! overall a positive experience and will most definitely stay again! Guy called Andrew who checked us out very friendly and professional as were all other staff members.. 10/10 for excellent staff!,4,2014,11,19

250,yet another show,recently did another trade show at this great hotel  the  staff are excellent and are very attentive its not fair to single any one member out as they are a great team   definately  well worth going to the hotel   we use this hotel on a regular basis to do our trade shows from   we will be getting ready to book 3 more for next year  and its only about 20 mins into the city,5,2014,11,18
250,Nice hotel,"The hotel is very near to the airport with a courtesy bus from airport to the hotel. Breakfast is good and room have plenty of space. The price is averaging
You can get to city center by BUS in 20 minutes with the price of 2,60 € and by taxi about 20 €. 

Carlos",4,2014,11,17
250,Crown Plaza quality 15 mins with complementary airport shuttle,"Great Crown Plaza quality property across from a large lake/pond and park and a block away from clean & reliable bus service to downtown Dublin.  The in-house restaurant serves full course breakfast, lunch and dinner with excellent food and good service.  Room was modern, clean with good sized bathroom.",5,2014,11,16
250,Good hotel but minor issues,"I stayed here on a business trip for 3 nights & generally was pleased but there are some minor issues that could do with attention. On the good side. Staff were very helpful & responded to my requests. Forgot my laptop in my room when I rushed to the office & they arranged a taxi for it to be delivered. Ate in both restaurant & bar and the food was very good; service in the restaurant was excellent. Room was large & very comfortable bed.

On the downside. You could only control the room temperature between 19 & 24 degrees & I like it cooler but my colleague (another room) wanted it hotter. The rooms did have a jaded feel, some stains, toilet continuously dripped. No toilet brush cleaner or face cloth. Fixed head shower was very inconvenient. Wifi speed in my room was excruciatingly slow. The mini-bar was completely empty. The hotel bar was popular with locals so it did take some time to get a drink when standing at the bar. These are most probably minor issues for most people but when you are staying in a 4 star hotel for 3 nights they can make a difference",4,2014,11,12
250,Disappointing,"In my opinion and I have stayed in this hotel many times the bedrooms are in need of updating they are tired looking. Last time I stayed the water tank above our ceiling made noise all night, this time it was the toilet cistern running water all the time.",3,2014,11,09

250,Charity event,Went to a pink tie charity event at the weekend. 2nd yr we've attended. Hotel was beautifully attended. Food and staff were so good . My friend had booked a room to stay. Room was a good size. Not huge but perfect for what you needed. Great night has d by all ,4,2014,11,05
250,Stop over,"Check in v. Quick & friendly staff. Rooms excellent. Had a meal in the bar, very nice & reasonably priced.Perfect for what we needed.  Early morning call & Courtesy bus to Airport. Will definately stay here again.",5,2014,11,04
250,The Best Airport Hotel,"This hotel is by far the nicest airport hotel to stay in. Very secure location, great food, friendly staff and lovely rooms. The reception area is gorgeous and there are even great gym facilities. If looking for a place to stay outside of the city, I would highly recommend it.",4,2014,11,02
250,Great hotel.,Lovely hotel.good food. Friendly staff. Had a fantastic weekend. Wonderful people. All Except taxi Albert f2544. Sat behind bus for 7miles.and deliberately missed all green lights to stay in left slow lane and red lights to bump up fare..        rip off cowboy. ,5,2014,11,01
250,Highly recommend,"I recently stayed in this hotel for a business trip, staff were very friendly, very good facilities and good value for money, didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the food, walls were a bit thin, I heard the next room get their wake up call at 6.30am, didn't bother me too much as I was getting up anyway but if I wasn't I would have been annoyed!  Great proximity to the airport and a regular shuttle bus which is good!",5,2014,10,30
250,Good sized room,"Stayed at this hotel on an overnight trip to Dublin. Convenient for airport and good bus transfer service. Staff and service were good. Room was very spacious and well presented, very clean. Breakfast was good, good selection and fresh. ",4,2014,10,21
250,Fantastic Hotel,"My husband and I stay in the Crowne Plaza on Friday 17 October 2014 for two nights.  Very professional and helpful staff.  We had a problem with our television and we got a new room straight away.  The breakfast was one of the finest I ever had.  Our room was just delightful, clean, tidy and very comfortable.  We had dinner in the bar on Saturday night and it was delicious.  Couldn't find fault with the hotel.  Would highly recommend this beautiful hotel and I'm really looking forward to going back for another visit.",5,2014,10,20
250,A wonderful experience!,"Our stay at the Crown Plaza in Dublin started with a short taxi ride from the airport after a long flight from Australia. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful lady at the front desk. Our room was comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathroom and hot shower were very welcome after the long flight. Slept like a log on the supremely comfortable bed. In the morning the same lady who was at the desk as we arrived was there again, helpful as always. The buffet breakfast is a memorable experience. There was a great variety and extremely enjoyable. Norbert, our waiter was wonderful. In the morning the hotel's shuttle bus took us to the airport to pick up our hire car. Our driver was efficient, courteous and highly entertaining, his story of the 'attack swan' at the local park was very funny. In short, just stay at this hotel we both loved it and I will be there again in a week and looking forward to the experience!",5,2014,10,19
250,"smart, professional and caring","Very professional staff, no problem was too small or big to assist with, food good, nice atmosphere in bar, executive rooms and club room a real bonus with refreshments, computer and television all available - a real bonus when you wanted a quiet area to sit and relax.
Lovely park opposite to get some fresh air.",4,2014,10,12
250,Customer Service,"The reason for my visit to the Crowne Plaza hotel was purely based on the recommendation of a friend who stayed overnight at your hotel. 
I arrived at the hotel with my family to have a meal. And was not sure whether
to eat in the restaurant, Bar or Lounging area. After having all my questions answered by your very well presented and knowledgable receptionist Olga. We decided to eat in the lobby/lounge, where it was less noisy than the bar and we could hear ourselves talking, unlike the bar which was very noisy. The food was great and so was the service in the lobby.
It was refreshing to experience such a high level of Customer Service from Olga.
A worthy recommendation.",5,2014,10,10
250,Travelling from Dublin Airport,"I have stayed in this place as i was flying early in the morning out from Dublin Airport, i do live in Dublin but i wanted to save some time in the morning. The whole experience was just brilliant from the moment i have checked to the moment i have left. I was checked in by the most friendly guy his name was Chrisitan (sorry for the spelling) he was most welcoming and had a great sense of humour, after that i was dealing with Olga to whom i reported that my minibar was not opening and she has sorted it out nearly straight away. I had my dinner in the restaurant which again exceeded my expectations. I suppose the only minor thing was that the shuttle bus that hotel provides for free was a bit delayed in the morning luckily enough it wasn't a big issue but i suppose this should be looked in to. Overall i will recommend this place to anyone just make sure that the shuttle bus is running on time.",5,2014,10,09
250,What a wonderful surprise!,"We were surprised to arrive at the Holiday Inn Express which is next door to the Crowne Plaza and discover that we had been upgraded from the Holiday Inn Express (they must have overbooked). The Crowne Plaza staff is so professional, the room was lovely with comfy beds, air conditioning, wash cloths, and an American electrical outlet! It was a very lovely stay that was culminated with the best breakfast buffet that I have ever experienced in a hotel and I travel a lot. I would stay there just for the breakfast buffet. Anything and everything you can imagine was on that buffet.",5,2014,10,08
250,Ideal hotel next to the airport,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza the night before our flight back home.  It is a good hotel, very clean, modern with awesome and very helpful staff.  They have a convenient shuttle bus to the airport.  We were traveling with our one and a half year old son and all the staff was very hepful and made out stay comfortable.  This is a great option for a hotel close to the Dublin airport.",4,2014,10,08
250,Brilliant Stay,The hotel was lovely and staff were brilliant. Olga who is the receptionist couldn't have done enough. The customer service she provided was outstanding. The hotel are very lucky to have her working for them.,5,2014,10,08
250,Great hotel near Dublin airport,"On the last day of our trip to Ireland, my wife and I decided to stay close to the Dublin airport since we had an early flight the next morning.  Our expectations for this hotel were low since none of the reviews on Dublin airport hotels were glowing.  What a pleasant surprise to walk into the bright, modern (I imagine recently renovated) lobby of the Crowne Plaza hotel.  After spending the previous night in a run-down B & B at about the same price, this was a welcome change.  The pub/restaurant at the Crowne Plaza was great!  Lots of TV screens, so no matter where you sat you had a good view.  Tasty and reasonably-priced food/drink options (roasted lamb shanks & mashed potatoes), a lively atmosphere, good service, and modern up to date furnishings.  Our room was clean, contemporary with good lighting, and a walk-in shower.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioning unit was a bit slow in cooling the room...however, no biggie. The hotel also offers a free shuttle to the airport every 20 minutes.  Our driver was cheerful and courteous. This definitely isn't a destination location hotel, but the price/value is excellent.",5,2014,10,03
250,very helpful staff,"Attended a conference at Crowne Plaza Dublin recently, Arrived at the hotel to discover due to error on our part a place was not reserved for me to stay. This unsettled me greatly and I feared the worse. Olga was extremely helpful. She went beyond what I am sure is the call of duty to reassure me and helped me to find accommodation.  She later checked to ensure I had settled in and was finding my way around all right. Her kind smile and reassuring words every time I passed by reception  made me feel perfectly at home. A great place for conference.",4,2014,09,30
250,Great hotel,"Ended up staying in the hotel by accident due to a delayed flight, but I am glad we did. 

We stayed on the 4th floor in one of the executive suites. The room was very large and spacious with nice touches like the Jacuzzi bath, separate sitting area, calming sleep spray left on the beds, etc. 

We checked in quite late and were not really told anything when we arrived besides breakfast time and did not know where to go or what facilities we could avail of, but we opted to just head to bed anyway- which was really comfy.

Breakfast was great. It was a buffet with good choice and everything was continuously topped up.

The hotel itself was very clean and modern.

I had a glance at the food menu before I left; although I did not try the food, I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the prices were.

All in all, I would recommend.",4,2014,09,27
250,Very Comfortable and friendly.,"couldnt be happier with our stay here (3rd time here). Andrew at reception was very friendly and helped with all our questions about the aminities and local nightlife in the area and city center. room was very spacious and had a nice view of the park across the road. Room could have been better lit but it was very comfortable and well kept. had an issue getting into our room but after a valiant attempt by a porter marton (sorry if thats not right)  the maintenance guy matt was called and was able to get in there in a few seconds, Matt was such a nice guy he even travelled down to reception to get us new keycards so we could unpack and relax, and after travelling for so long that was very much appreciated. bar food was nice so was the restaurant ,however service could have been a little faster. this hotel gives out a nice, warm and inviting feel. We will definitely be returning.",5,2014,09,27
250,Nice comfortable friendly hotel,"Had a lovely time in this hotel, everybody was nice from the moment we walked through the door. Olga on reception was very nice to us and helped with all our silly questions. We had a small issue with the locks on our suitcases but Matthew the maintenance guy was very helpful and got us into them without breaking the suitcases which was very much appreciated. Food wise the bar food was nice ,our room was very spacious and comfortable. Park across the road is beautiful and it's location was great. Will definitely be back :)",5,2014,09,26
250,Comfortable and clean,"Attended a conference at this hotel and had the pleasure of staying here too. room was spacious, clean and comfortable. had toiletries, hairdryer etc. beds were comfy. bit of a queue at the bar on occasion but what bar doesn't. 
Breakfast was really good. buffet style but had the option of omelettes and poached eggs cooked fresh to order.
Little bit out of the centre but taxis are on a meter and reasonable enough (there were 4 of us so worked out pretty cheap)
Would definitely go back. Free Shuttle bus to and from the airport which was great.",4,2014,09,25
250,Choose another,"While conveniently located close to the airport, this IHG hotel suffers from the worst food in all of my world travels. Hotels in Europe and the United Kingdom typically have good fare in their restaurants.  Not the case here.   Early evening, deciding to have a bottle of wine before dinner for the four of us, we ordered the only Pinot Gris on the list.  Nope.  Couldn't find any in stock.  The menu for dinner was so limited and unappealing we elected to return and eat in the bar.  By that time some bottles of the solitary Italian Pinot Gris were located, we were informed  Reasonably price at 24.50 Euros.  My wife ordered a brie and some mystery meat, and I ordered a club which came with the most godawful egg salad and measly, thin pieces of turkey that looked like they were sliced with a microtome for slides.  Never have I seen such inedible, bad tasting food in a restaurant.  Do not eat here. 
Our room was uncomfortably warm, as was that of our traveling companions, and the air would not adjust below 19C which should have been cool enough, but was not. While the room was clean, it was too warm to use the duvet and both rooms of us requested top sheets be delivered along with face cloths, which often are not provided, but seemingly always available.  After three calls and a visit to the front desk it was discovered that the sheets must have been delivered to the Holiday Express (same IHG of course).  When they finally arrived, they were found to be a sheet for a single bed not fitting our king naturally.  A folly of errors that seemed to go on and on.  The front desk was very apologetic, and finally at least our travel companions persevered and scored a king sheet while we gave up.  Transportation to the airport the next morning was confusing.  The hotel van was plainly marked and posted by the front door but nobody ever said a big bus would be coming in to fetch us until it pulled up and we asked the driver if he was there for that purpose.  Would have been good communication to have the front desk personnel trained to say, ""It won't be the hotel van parked at the door. Look for the big bus"".   The location of the hotel requires a taxi and known destination to go out for dinner so be aware of this.  Oh yes, the business center offered two computers.  I used one to print our boarding passes, but then found the printer was out of toner.  Found extra toner in a cabinet in the room but hesitated to install it and instead started the process over on the adjacent computer.  When I reported the need to the front desk they said nobody there was allowed to change it, only an outside company could do it in the next day or so.  Really?  I offered to do it for them, but was told nobody wanted to be responsible if something broke.  I mean, it is just a printer cartridge which my nine year old granddaughter can do.",2,2014,09,23
250,Excellent Dublin hotel,"You will struggle to find a hotel in Dublin with such lovely grounds on its doorstep.
Very central to access to all sights in Dublin and public trabsport.
Nice modern hotel,clean and with nice staff.
Food is standard hotel fare 
A nice base if you are a tourist.",5,2014,09,22
250,Friendly People,"I very much enjoyed staying at this hotel as they were very attentive and answered all ""ridiculous"" questions I had about my stay here.  I would like to make a special mention to our bar tender, Ciaran Greene, as he was the most attentive and exceptional bar tender I had yet to meet.",5,2014,09,19
250,"Comfortable, friendly and good value!","Our second stay, this time for 2 nights before flying home. Reception staff were very friedly and helpful, especially Olga! Bar food good and not overly expensive. Breakfast excellent - only hotel to offer real Canadian maple syrup with waffles and pancakes! Only drawback is that you can't walk to places.",5,2014,09,18
250,Very nice stay,A very nice surprise that I found this room on a travel website. We stayed for our evening before our flight out of the country and this hotel was very near to the airport. This hotel had an excellent fitness center that I used and was very happy with the stay as a whole. The pub was nice as well. I will stay there again of the need arises.,4,2014,09,15
250,Great Hotel!,"We stayed in this hotel from 05-07 September. On check in we were welcomed by extremely friendly receptionist (sorry can't remember her name!) who informed us about all the facilities in the hotel, gave us maps and directions to the city center. As we booked standard rooms we've got twin rooms but asked her if she could give us doubles as we were 2 couples - she changed them into 2 rooms with king size beds straight away! 
The rooms were just great! Modern, clean with really comfy beds. 
We had dinner in the bar both nights. The food was divine! and the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful (thanks to Iwona & Peter!!!). 

Overall we had an excellent stay! We'll definitely be back!!!",5,2014,09,14
250,Great place to stay,"I stayed here for 2 nights and felt that everything was very well organised. Furnishings and accesoories were good and very complete. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was very good. Had forgotten my comb after I had checked out and after I called them at the end of the morning they ensured that this was recovered by housekeeping and was left for my pick up at the reception. The shuttle bus service to and from the airport is also really convinient.
Olga helped at the reception and was very helpful both during checkout (printed my boarding pass) and at my luggage pickup.
Worth recommending to others.",5,2014,09,14
250,Awesome airport hotel,"Probably the best 'airport' hotel I've ever stayed. Service was friendly - from the front desk (Beth you were great) onward.  Had a minor issue with our room safe and was glad we did because it allowed us to meet Matt the maintenance guy. He was so charming and funny I almost broke something else just to make him come back.
Room was very well maintained and clean.  I assumed it was recently renovated but that was not the case apparently. Comfy bed and huge bathroom. 
Food wise, breakfast was great. 
Club Room 'wine and appetizers'...maybe caught a bad night because the appetizers were a little lame (some chicken ceasar wraps cut up into little pieces and that was it).  Dinner in the pub  - the food was maybe a 7 out of 10. 
Regardless, hotel and people were great so it was a solid 4.5 rating and if in the area would absolutely stay again.
Oh...and a great park across the street to stretch your legs",4,2014,09,06
250,"Very comfortable, well run hotel","I stayed here for three nights whilst on a business trip.  My room was very comfortable and had all the accessories that you would expect for a quality hotel of this standard. As I couldn't find any attractive restaurants within walking distance, I used the hotel restaurant.  The staff (hotel and restaurant) were very friendly and professional.",4,2014,09,05
250,A nice and decent place,"I stayed in this hotel from 04~08 August. As driving directly from Glasgow to Dublin for almost 6 hours, we were quite tired when we got there. A worse situation was that it was a bank holiday in Dublin so few restaurants were still open around 6:30 pm. Then I asked for help from Beth, one of the front desk employees and she gave me very detail direction and restaurant options about Malahide, the beach place with many gourmet choices. And with her help, we had a great French dinner that night at Malahide.

We scheduled 4 days in Dublin so we booked a railway tour to Galway and the Cliffs or Moher on the third day. However, the tour was cancelled by the Irish railway company due to ""insufficient demand"". I left my China mobile phone number which can be reached in Ireland while making the booking but still, the railway company called only my hotel when we were out in the downtown! However, it were Bobbi and Beth, the two kind ladies at the front desk who helped me to gather the calls and informed me at the first minute I walked into the lobby. The next day Bobbi also helped me to call the railway company to talk about the alternative plans and finally we were booked for another similar tour the day next. Honestly, that tour didn't cheer us up for we had to get to the railway station by 6:45 am that day. But what Beth and Bobbi did made our feeling easier and happier.

And it didn't end when we left Dublin: We needed to drive back to Edinburgh the day after the railway tour so we were in a hurry checking out. I didn't realized that I left my glasses and key pack in the room until we checked in the hotel in Edinburgh. Back to Shanghai on 10 Aug, I immediately wrote an email here to know if they got hold of my belongings and they replied quickly confirming it. Now the two items have travelled thousands of miles and returned to me safe and sound.

Apart from this, the hotel may look like a business place at the first glance but just take a look outside and you will find yourself in a very big green park with old trees and quite ponds. There are also two beautiful swans living in the pond. The Santry park is a nice place for strolling, jogging and they even have a playground for children so you don't need to worry about the entertainment of your kids here.

The interior of the hotel is also very decent and modern. Bathrooms are quite spacey and well illuminated. The internet access is quite easy and fast during my stay. Dinning in the hotel is not bad and you can also try the Asian fusion style restaurant just 5 mins walk away from the hotel.

After all, I can't say I am satisfied with the Ireland trip but Crowne Plaza Northwood is definitely a good choice during this trip.",4,2014,09,05
250,I needed a night here at the end of our 2-week vacation,"Honestly, after 2 weeks in ""cozy"" B&Bs and old hotels with questionable beds and minuscule showers that soak the bathroom floor, I needed a final night in well-designed, very modern and, admittedly, American-style hotel.

This is a very attractive hotel with a beautiful, contemporary lobby and modern, sparkling clean, new rooms. I could find not one fault with ours. After showering for 2 weeks in tubs with glass screens (which mean you have to reach into boiling hot or freezing water to adjust the temp before stepping in) or those tiny shower ""capsules"" which shower the bathroom floor when you open the door to step in or out, I was positively THRILLED with a standing shower with sliding doors.

And the counter space! Many of the bathrooms during the rest of our stay in Ireland were lovely, but not very practical and we tended to store our toiletries in our suitcase for lack of counter space. This bathroom had miles of counter space! 

The TV was huge, the wifi worked great, and there was even an American-style outlet in the room (which was nice because we'd misplaced a couple of our adapters and our family of four had a lot of devices which needed charging!) The breakfast was bountiful and delicious, too.

We took advantage of the hotel shuttle, which was very reliable. We dropped our rental car off at the airport the night before our flight and the shuttle comes around the airport at regular intervals -- I appreciated not having to call and request a pick up. The driver also honored our request to drop us off at the Italian restaurant down the street from the Crowne Plaza for dinner. 

If we ever need to spend a night near the Dublin Airport again, we will definitely reserve a spot at the Crowne Plaza - Northwood.",5,2014,08,29
250,Staff went above and beyond,"We stayed at the CP Dublin-Northwood recently and had a very pleasant experience. Room was great and clean. Beds were comfy. There is a great park across the street for a nice stroll after you have stuffed you face at the excellent restaurant ;). The staff was very friendly and efficient. We got all the info we required. On our last night before returning to Canada, I had a bit of an adventure with one of my hearing aids. Andrew from the Front desk and a young lady who's name I did not catch were more than helpful in helping me ""fish it out"" of the ""complicated"" location I had the misfortune of dropping it in (long story but no not the toilet... that would have been easy). They went above and beyond to help me and I was lucky enough to retrieve it undamaged! Thanks to both of them! I would return to the CP in a flash and would also recommend it to anyone!",5,2014,08,28
250,Cobh Anne - perfection!,I have stayed twice in this hotel over the summer period. I can highly recommend it in every way. From once we went in the door I felt looked after and therefore relaxed. The front desk staff were highly efficient and very pleasant. Our rooms were beautiful and top class. We had the most delicious food both in the bar and at breakfast in the dining room. The hotel is a little way out from the city center but in a lovely location with a park and lake just across the road. Even though we did not use it for proximity to the airport I believe that it would be perfect for this purpose. I saw a shuttle bus service in operation. The Crowne Plaza is a perfect example of our Irish hospitality and made me proud.,5,2014,08,26
250,Compare this to the Holiday Inn Express next door,"     We had an unexpected layover and needed a room so this was convenient.  It has a pleasant lobby and shares a shuttle with the Holiday Inn.  The room was clean, quiet, and the staff personable.  I remember eating in the bar a couple of years ago and liked that, but this time we were so tired we tried their fancier, rather expensive restaurant.  I ordered a sort of stew that implied it had been moist cooked over a long period of time.   The flavors were nice, but the meat was dry, tough and nearly inedible. my guess is the meat was frozen and then added later. My recommendation is to eat at the bar, or even better visit the little Italian restaurant close by. 

     I do recommend this hotel, but with warnings:  They charge for T.V - not movies, not special channels, but general access, which I find unbelievable.  The room is slightly better furnished than the Holiday Inn, but not by much.  We missed breakfast as we had to take the early shuttle to the airport, yet I wonder why a hotel that services the airport can't provide a breakfast for those who need to depart early? 

",3,2014,08,25
250,Perfect choice,"We spent one night here en route from England to Newfoundland. A perfect stop. Couldn't fault this hotel; the staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. It's about 8 minutes from the airport by taxi. We arrived late morning and decided to have breakfast. This was delicious, everything you could wish for English/Continental. Our very nice room was available early for no extra charge. Staff were all very helpful, efficient and friendly. It's just a short walk to the bus-stop from where we caught a bus into the city. Relaxing surroundings in the hotel for a pleasant evening meal. We opted for a simple meal but there seemed to be a good range on offer. After a good night's sleep an early morning mini-bus, courtesy of the hotel, dropped us at the airport. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,25
250,Convenient for Airport and city,"I have stayed here for the last five weeks on business at the airport. The hotel offered an excellent package with free car parking and wifi. The business lounge offers free drinks and nibbles each evening, but take the breakfast in the main resturant. Rooms on the fourth floor (business) are a good size and well equiped. Laundry was always same day return, and the gym on the first floor was good for its size. The menu got a bit stale after the third week, but there are a great many places to eat out, Swords being a nice place close by. The bus into the city is close to the hotel and is about 30-40 minutes depending on  traffic. Dublin city is excellent.",4,2014,08,21
250,Perfect location to airport,"We have only recently started using the Crowne Plaza for our holiday starting point.   The hotel is perfectly situated by the airport with a lovely bar area which serves nice food.   Breakfast is very comprehensive with lots to choose from and the staff are lovely and friendly.
Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,08,20
250,What's not to like?,"Great location. Quiet. Free shuttle bus to the airport with the most cheerful driver ever!
Extremely efficient yet friendly reception staff.
Comfortable bedrooms with really nice decor. Ironing board and everything that a business traveller would need.
Good rate obtained for the night at the last minute.
Would I stay here again? You bet.",5,2014,08,19
250,Facility is good but staff service is bad,"I stayed in crowne plaza on 4th Aug for business and booked 6 rooms. The location is very good; room is newly decorated and nice. I am not satisfied with the services: 1. staff did not inform us there are free shuttles between airport and hotel, so we spent a lot of money on taxis. 2. I booked six rooms from ihg.com and pre-paid full amount, but reception staff said I did not pay (if I did not check my credit card again, it will double charge me!) 3. During mid night (12 to 6am) there was no hot water 4. When we checked out, they reception staff said three of our rooms used mini bar and would charge us around 60 euro in total, later said they are wrong-oh my god!",4,2014,08,16
250,Nice hotel,"Stayed here recently for one night , great friendly helpful staff nothing too much trouble , room no 329 ok small enough & a little dark ,& we were kept awake that night with a constant tapping noise - breakfast really great variety & everything very fresh ,a small gripe I would have is the price of drink in the bar e 7.30 for a small glass of wine , which had already been opened  what a rip off ",4,2014,08,16
250,Lovely Stay,"Stayed at the Hotel for a Saturday Night in August to go to a match in Croke Park. The Hotel is in a perfect location for Croker, at only a short walk from the Hotel you're at the bus stop with numerous buses running past which will take you into right past the end of Jones's Road or directly into the City Centre if that's where you're headed. Receptionist was great & recommended either the 41b/41c or 16 bus, which would all take you into the city centre. 

Arrived early from Donegal at about 1pm and were able to check in straight away, which was fantastic. Grabbed a bite of lunch in the bar which was also nice. Got upgraded to an Executive Room, with complimentary offering of Continental Breakfast, which was really appreciated. The rooms are really nice with gorgeous big bathrooms. 

Would definitely recommend this Hotel for people who are happy to stay out on the North side of Dublin, great location for access to the M1, M50 and the airport. If you're also like me and happy to park the car up and get public transport into the City Centre then this is the perfect spot. Parking was great at only €6 for 24 hours. 

Can't wait for our return visit at the end of August, hopefully for two nights for the next big match!",5,2014,08,14
250,Excellent stay,We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Northwood on the last night of our trip to Ireland for a family wedding and would recommend it. We had a lovely time we were upgraded to an executive room with free continental breakfast and use of the club lounge. This was because of a small error in our booking which was nobody's fault but the staff couldn't have been more helpful and apologetic. the rest of our stay was wonderful. The room was fantastic and the meal we had in the hotel restaurant was lovely I would recommend the Nasi Goreng. I would definitely stay here again (with or without the upgrade). We also used the free shuttle service to and from the airport and found the drivers very courteous on both occasions.,5,2014,08,12
250,"Crowne Plaza Northwood, lovley hotel in nice area","Stayed here 1 night 25 July.  Hotel is out near the airport within Northwood gated community with a lovely park opposite. The hotel is situated besdie the Holiday Inn Express and shares the carpark. It was expensive for 1 night, 220 euro and this did not include breakfast but when we requested breakfast they included it plus the parking. The hotel was lovely inside but not that impressive outside althought the surrounding are was nice. Staff were very friendly and polite, advised us on checkin there was a cocktail hour in the club lounge but there were no cocktails available, beer, wine and soft drinks were available.  Dinner ordered at the bar and my order was mixed up. I had quite a long wait and all my group had finished eating by the time i got my food, they said this would not be charged but was when i checked the bill although it was removed on request.  Rooms were imaculately clean and very comforatable. The down side was outside the bar it was a lovely evening and there were stools and tables on the footpath, this area was quite narrow and not only for residents but locals, so going to and from the carpark you had to negotiate past gropus of people, who turned out to be friendly locals but some people may find this intimidating!",4,2014,08,11
250,Always good......,"We are regular visitors to this hotel in Dublin but have started using it more often now as the Blanchardstown Crowne Plaza's water tastes and smells terrible. I am a man who likes a good cuppa after a hard day or first thing in the morning and Blanchardstown just doesn't provide that for me, smells like a mouthwash.

Northwood works well for the Airport and Dublin Port, it is 2 mins of the M50 ring road and it makes a good base for seeing the City and surrounding sites. They have a secure multi storey car park for which there is a charge of 6 euro which is usually waived.

The hotel is what you expect for a Crowne Plaza, very smart and competent staff, clean, fresh and vibrant and the rooms are well presented with beds that are second to none. The television has plenty of channels to watch and the On Demand service has very up to date films which are well priced.

This is a well situated hotel with excellent facilities, great food and a well disciplined staff....i would recommend to anyone.",5,2014,08,10
250,Good choice and good value here,We stayed at this hotel on 3 different occasions during our 5 week European trip. This hotel was our favourite hands down. Front desk staff such as Olga are very friendly and helpful. The hotel provides an excellent shuttle service to the airport. The drivers are to be commended for their courtesy and good humour. Our room was clean and comfortable. The bed was super comfy and the decor of the room was tasteful and attractive. We haven't any complaints whatsoever and the value of this facility is excellent when compared to other 4 star hotels.,4,2014,08,10
250,"Lovely rooms, helpful staff","Thoroughly enjoyed staying in this airport hotel for two night en route to the US from the UK. The hotel offer a shuttle bus service from the airport which runs to a timetable, roughly every 20 mins from early in the morning to after midnight. Bus stop was only a short walk from the terminal and easy to find. Check in was straight forward as I'd prepaid - I made the mistake of offering my € currency card instead of my debit/credit card to be swiped for incidentals which blocked the funds I'd added to it for the day or so in Dublin. The concierge was very helpful when I needed them to fax something to the card issuer to release the funds onto the card again. 

I'd been given a twin room instead of the double I had booked, there had been a mix up because I'd booked through a third party. Reception tried to find something else for me but the hotel and it's sister hotel next door were both fully booked. I was offered sincere apologies and someone was sent to push the two singles together and make them up as a double, but the console between the beds was fixed to the wall so this wasn't possible. I was told to go to reception the next morning so I could be moved. Obviously this wasn't ideal, but I appreciate that they can't magically find an extra room. The next morning I reported to reception after breakfast and was upgraded to a room on the top floor.

The bar was lively both nights which surprised me, but I gather it is popular with locals who often eat in the hotel too (always a good sign if locals like it), despite the bar being busy I didn't feel uncomfortable as a single female sat at the bar for a mid evening drink, the clientèle were a nice bunch, a mixture of local couples in the 30-65 age range, and hotel guests. On my first night I followed a recommendation from one of the receptionists and ate in a nice bar/restaurant in the city centre, as Thursday is late night shopping, I felt quite at ease in the city centre and caught the bus back to the hotel around 2100. Catching a bus into the city centre is quick and easy, the correct change is required, I didn't have quite enough in coins but the driver didn't seem to mind that I was a few cents short (to compensate I paid extra on the return).

My new upgraded room came with access to the club lounge on the top floor. During the day it is stocked with newspapers, magazines, a selection of local history books and a few novels (I suspect left by previous guests) were also available on the shelves, as well as a TV. There is a fridge with a small selection of soft drinks and tea and coffee facilities. I understand that a continental breakfast is served each morning but as I moved rooms after breakfast and left early the next morning for the airport I didn't get a chance to try it out. Each evening complementary alcoholic drinks and canapés are served in the lounge by a member of staff, I enjoyed a couple of drinks while chatting to some other guests before going to the restaurant for dinner.

Both rooms had separate bath and shower which I always think is a bonus, the second room was larger and had extras such as premium toiletries, bathrobe etc. Both rooms were impeccably presented, bed linen was clean, of a good quality and had a 'new' feel to it. Both beds were comfortable, especially the one on the top floor.  

I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel. Breakfast wasn't included in my package but I opted for a full Irish. It was served buffet style, couldn't fault it, lots of variety and everything was replenished, even towards the end of the breakfast service. I had to ask for coffee from the waiter, but I had tucked myself away in a corner and I was on my own so I'm not surprised he didn't see me while doing his rounds. My lunch choice was soup and a sandwich from the lounge menu, which was much larger than I anticipated and very good value for money. For dinner I ate in the main restaurant and as I didn't have much of an appetite (probably due to being so well feed earlier in the day) I opted for just a starter, many other single diners and I felt the staff had the right level of attentiveness. I had the homemade ham hock terrine which I was really looking forward to, but was put off when I found a piece of bone in it. I didn't complain but mentioned it when asked if I enjoyed my meal when the waitress cleared. When I asked for my bill I found the food had been taken off it and I had only been charged for my drink. 

One thing I was very impressed with and left as feedback when I checked out; every single member of staff I can into contact with acknowledged every guest they saw, everyone from bar staff, cleaners, maintenance, waitresses etc. Very good customer services skills from everyone. Although I had an issue with my room and a small hiccup with one meal, staff did everything they could to put things right, going over and above, not just to remedy the problem but leave a positive impression and outcome. After enjoying the extra perks that came with my upgraded room, I will book into the top floor next time I visit.

I will certainly be staying here next time I pass through Dublin.",5,2014,08,10
250,A quick stay,Havering had to travel we decided to book this hotel and it was great from start to finish. Check in was nice and friendly as was check out. The shuttle bus services were all great to nice and helpful. Rooms are good and the location is nice for having a nice walk in the nice weather. Would recommend and would stay again.,5,2014,08,08
250,short but sweet stay,"one night, before leaving Dublin but an excellent experience!  from the parking, the front desk and valet staff, directions, amenities, bed etc...all awesome and a great way to say goodbye to amazing ireland!",5,2014,08,04
250,Great place for proximity to the airport,"I chose this hotel as the last night of a 3 day trip to Dublin with my return flight leaving very, very early in the morning.  In regards to the proximity to the airport it was quite good.  The shuttle driver was great, and a good asset to the property.  As the location was quite a distance from any other amenity or shops, I decided to upgrade to a room on the club floor since I've found it often worth the value for the food offerings and ability to access your own drinks, sodas, etc. - however in this particular situation I would not bother again as the offerings were very slim and disappointing.  All that being said, the room was quite comfortable and the bed quite good.  Despite its proximity to the airport there was not flight noise.  There is a lovely large park immediately across the street, but other than some adjacent apartment buildings there was nothing within walking distance.  The service and the food in the restaurant was quite good but, as with most hotels, not great value for money being quite pricey.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wanted to have the convenience of being close to the airport.",5,2014,08,01
250,Business Trip,"I stay for business recently for two nights, on arrival I was greeted as a member of the hotels rewards scheme. I was then upgraded to the club floor which was very good.
I have stayed at this hotel before, I chase it for its location close to the airport and knew that it has parking next to it also.
The room was clean and tidy and so was the bathroom so no compliant there, the only issue was the room had had the sun on it during the day was very stuffy. I mentioned this to the hotel staff and they arrange to leave the air con on whilst I was out of the room making it nicer when returning to the room.
I didn't make it down for dinner opting for room service on both nights and was not disappointed with my choice and the service was very good also.
I had breakfast in the restaurant and this again was very good for selection and the welcome you get on arrival to breakfast.
As overs have said you do need a car to get to this restaurant or pick up the shuttle bus from the airport which is only about 5 minutes from the airport to the hotel.

Well worth a stay and very friendly staff on hand to help you out.",4,2014,07,29
250,A One Night Stay,"This is definitely for a one night stay. It appears to be quite a long way to anywhere and is next to the busy main road. a car would be needed. It feels very impersonal
The staff were well trained and friendly. My room faced the main road but was not noisy and I slept well in a very comfortable bed.  The room had everything I needed and was unusually large for a single person. The dining area was attractive and the food was excellent, especially the breakfast. I would not hesitate to have another overnight stay here.",4,2014,07,28
250,Lovely hotel,"I had one night at the Crowned Plaza hotel on a work trip. The room was very modern clean and tidy, the staff were really friendly and the hotel bar areas were very lively.
We ate in the restaurant and the food was great, a bit on the pricey side but very tasty.  Would recommend.",5,2014,07,25
250,Didn't think this was so easy for airport,Last minute very early flight from Dublin. Hotel was lovely. Room maybe a little bit warm (couldn't get the aircon to do what we wanted). Lovely guy on early bus transfer to airport - v. chirpy at that hour of the morning - had to smile :)) Would go back,4,2014,07,23
250,fine--probably not good for a long stay,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Dubin-Northwood twice--once for one night at the start of the trip and once at the end.  We had slightly different experiences during both stays so I'll differentiate when necessary.

The short version:
*It's fine.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel near the airport that's clean and sleepable, this is fine.
*If you are staying in Dublin for a longer period, or your purpose is to visit Dublin, stay closer in.
*This hotel was a good value for the price.  It was not up to the standards of other Crowne Plazas we have stayed in, so if you come in expecting that you may be disappointed.

The long version:
Pros:
*Shuttle from the airport was regular and drivers were friendly
*Room was reasonably clean
*Beds were comfortable
*Some other reviews complained of noise but we had no issues
*There is a bar and restaurant on site; no vending but the Holiday Inn right next door had that
*luggage storage was easy
*big room by European standards, especially the bathroom, which had both a tub and seperate shower!

In the Middle:
*Staff:  On our first stay, the staff were indifferent/unfriendly.  My mom asked to make sure that she had received her Membership Points and was treated to a lecture about how she should have booked directly with the hotel (we had, in fact, booked directly with the hotel).  We asked about using the bus to get into the city--they handed us a piece of paper with some directions and a map (of the city center, not the local area) and sent us on our way.  I had to ask a series of pointed questions to get basic information. More on transport in a sec.  Overall, we were not impressed.  However, on the second stay, the staff was delightful.  We had a problem with our room (more on that later) and they handled it (different staff) quickly and efficiently. So I guess it's a shot in the dark
*Location/transport: So the bus stop is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel--not bad.  The confusing part, at least to us, was where to get off and where to get back on.  The buses we were on did not have the next stop marked anywhere and the announcements were illegible, so we had a heck of a time figuring out when to get off and where to catch it again (the stops were not always right across from each other to go different directions).  I travel frequently and have never had an issue using buses before, including time in Athens, Rome, etc.  This is NOT the hotel's fault, but I mention it here because it would be super helpful if the hotel had some sort of bus guide or if the staff had been more understanding and helpful about giving directions.  Since it seems like that doesn't happen consistently, don't believe, like we did, that you can just ""figure it out""--do some prep work, don't be slackers like we were.  We just figured between experience, common sense, and helpful people at the hotel we'd figure it out but it didn't work out so well for us. Location itself = great for airport, rougher but possible for visiting Dublin.  The hotel shuttle was regular but just fyi, it really does come every 20 minutes--not ""comes every 20 minutes but really every 10"" so plan accordingly.  We did have one morning where it totally filled up--we all had seats but if someone had just planned to walk on they would have had to wait, so allow enough time.

Cons:
*The rooms themselves were surface clean, but could use a deep cleaning.  We had to move a bed to accomodate my dad's sleep apnea machine, and it was kind of gross under there.  Shower and bathroom were again surface clean but needed grouting, etc. clean.
*At our second stay, we had requested and received a non-smoking room.  The room itself was musty and smelled like cigarettes.  We think what happened was that the window opened up onto a rooftop and there were a ton of cigarette butts out there, so either people were working on the roof and smoking OR people were smoking out the windows and dropping butts out there.  Either way, it was unacceptable.  That room also had big scuff marks on the walls, etc. but seemed surface clean.  We put a call in to the front desk and they moved us without a problem--we had to wait a half hour for another room to be ready so they comped us free drinks at the bar.  That room itself wasn't great but we were very pleased with how the hotel handled it.
*Before I say what I'm about to say, please understand that I'm a very flexible traveler.  I've stayed in everything from fabulous upscale hotels to tiny places with threadbare, mismatched towels and cold water and to be honest, as long as there aren't bugs, excessive dirt, and I can sleep at night I'm fine with it.  I'm fine with this hotel--see the pros for all of the good things, which, to be honest, are the things that really matter.  My issue with this hotel, however, is I went in expecting the same quality of Crowne Plaza that I've experienced in the past and this wasn't it.  If i had paid what I paid (I think it was 105 E for a triple) on an off-brand hotel, I still wouldn't have been happy with the unhelpful initial desk staff or the smelly room, but I would have cut it some slack and been like, whatever.  At a hotel chain of the quality of the Crowne Plaza, however, I wouldn't have expected the previous issues.  There were also some little things, like not having as many or brand name toiletries or enough pillows that seriously make me sound super whiny, so I don't want to fuss about them, but only to say that go into this hotel expecting a place near the airport that you can sleep in and you'll be fine--if you expect a Crowne Plaza like I did you may be disappointed.  

If I were to go to Dublin again, I think I would try another hotel, but if I needed to stay here again it would be fine.",3,2014,07,23
250,Passing through,Stayed in here for a single night recently. Well signposted and close to Dublin Airport and the noise of planes.  Its handy with good links to Dublin Ring or City Centre and is in a attractive setting.Car parking is in a multi story (6Euro) Quick check-in and off to our room - slightly on the small side and rather warm. Comfortable room with well appointed bathroom .Took a while for air con to work and cool the room - unfortunately it cut out during the night leaving us rather hot. Good choice of continental breakfast (extra) and then a quick checkout. Reception brushed off my complaint about the air-con. Pleasant property that meets my need for a single night stop though wish the air-con had worked properly,3,2014,07,22
250,"Good hotel, not sufficient bar personnel","Stayed at this hotel attending quite a big event held in the hotel.
Not sufficient personnel to serve bar food . Had waited for over half an hour, no waiter to ask what we wanted to have.My friends had been waiting for over half an hour before they got their sandwich served.  As the event was to be held within half an hour, I decided to go to the restaurant. There were sufficient waiters and luckily I could have a salad, just before the event started.
Other than that I can recommend this hotel.",3,2014,07,17
250,Great airport hotel,"Very nice hotel. Check in was fast and easy. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The beds were comfy and there was no noise which was great since the hotel is so close to the airport.There was a wait for a table at the main restaurant so we had dinner at the more casual bar. The food was great and the place had great atmosphere ,full of happy travelers. The shuttle bus to the airport runs every twenty minutes. They even held the bus for us as we checked out. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,07,16
250,Hard to fault.,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 9 nights last month whilst my husband had surgery at the Sports Surgery Clinic. I was there on a bed and breakfast basis.

Room was spacious and immaculate.

Breakfast was impressive. Continental breakfast and full Irish. As I was at the hospital from 11am until 9pm the breakfast kept me going all day.

The staff were friendly and nothing was too much.

Went for dinner in the restaurant one night-Singapore noodles were delicious. Another night I ate in the bar-salmon penne pasta-very tasty. I also had a burger one night and it was a huge portion.

Would definitely stay again and have no hesitation in recommending hotel.",5,2014,07,16
250,Two night stay in North Dublin ...,"The best thing about this hotel are the staff. When arrived to check in, on Saturday afternoon, there was a long queue and only one person behind the desk - well except for a rather sheepish looking concierge who wasn't busy at that time, but did offer to help with our luggage. 

When we finally got to the end of the line we were greeted with a very sincere apology and warm smile - so that was ok! And just as we were about to go to our room we were also offered a voucher for a drink from the bar - even though we hadn't complained. Great proactive customer service and this goes a long way ...

Good hotel if you need to be in North Dublin/close to airport. Can also recommend the breakfast - try the freshly made omelette to set you up for the day!
",4,2014,07,16
250,Modern and clean,"It was our first trip to Ireland and we were not sure when we reserved a hotel at Dublin airport area about the shuttle from the airport because on the hotels website we did not find any information about the shuttle. Yes, they have it , they share the same shuttle with the Holiday Inn which is just next door. The ride from the airport takes about 10 minutes which is very convenient for tired people after long flights from US. The hotel is clean and modern, people are friendly, there is a nice restaurant next to the front desk with very comfortable sets.",5,2014,07,16
250,Ideally located close to the airport,"The hotel is very close to Dublin airport about 10 minutes using the hotel shuttle bus service that is available from zone 14 at the airport.   There is nothing in the immediate vicinity but a short walk away is a small retail & fast food park. The main road is used as a thoroughfare to the apartments in the area and is quite busy.

Check in after 2pm at the main reception where you will get a very friendly & efficient service.
NOTE:  this hotel still has a number of smoking rooms which are typically on floor 1 so double check when you are booking that you haven't selected a smoking room if you are a non-smoker.

Adjacent to this area is the Cinnabar lounge area & bar which serves food until 10pm. There is also a coffee station serving free coffee for hotel guests.

Breakfast is served from 06:30 to 10:30 (Mon-Fri) and 07:00 - 11:00 (Sat & Sun). Dinner is from 5:50pm until 10pm (Sun-Thurs) and until 11pm (Fri & Sat). 

Room 331 (non-smoking) was on the front of the hotel with a view across a gated park.  Room facilities included: tea / coffee tray, hairdryer, satellite TV, iron & board and complimentary toiletries. Air conditioning was available but I could not alter the setting to get cooler air so had to open the windows. The road outside is quite noisy until around 11pm.

This hotel is ideally located for the airport and offers an efficient shuttle bus service that starts at 5am which is free if you are a hotel guest.",4,2014,07,13
250,Nicely appointed rooms - Free wifi - Across from Santry Park,Pleasant hotel across from Santry Community Park.  Great staff.  Rooms are well appointed with free Wifi and flat screen TV - large and comfortable.  Bathrooms have a full walk in shower along with separate bathtub.  Two very good restaurants with good service in the hotel.  There's a shuttle to/from the airport.  The community park is enormous with families and runners and dogs and swans.  Well worth staying here as its a good respite from the city.,4,2014,07,11
250,Great experience!,"Really doesn't have anything bad to say about this hotel! Modern and well decorated rooms, good sleep quality, excellent staff with two types of restaurant located inside the hotel to choose from. Shuttle to the airport every 20 minutes from 5AM unitl late in the evening.

If you need to stay near the airport in Dublin, look no further!",5,2014,07,10
250,Our new favourite Dublin Airport hotel,"Recently I have been wondering if the art of map reading has all but disappeared amongst TripAdvisor reviewers!  When choosing a hotel why not look on a map to see where is it is located precisely thus avoiding disappointment if amenities, city centre etc. aren't on the doorstep of the hotel.
The Crowne Plaza is approximately 10 minutes from the Airport Terminals at Dublin Airport.  It is situated next to a lovely green space/park.  There is minimal noise from the Road (hotel is set back a distance) or Airport plane noise.
We stayed there one night using IHG points and were delighted with our room - the decor suited us, the black out curtains meant a good nights sleep in comfortable beds.
We ate in the Bar area which serves what we'd class as Pub food.  It was good quality and not too pricey.
We left early so didn't sample the breakfast.
We have recently stayed in a few of the Dublin Airport hotels and thus far the Crowne Plaza is the best and our new favourite.",4,2014,07,10
250,ANOTHER TRADE SHOW,another stay at this hotel absolute perfection  staff excellent we have done numerous trade shows from this hotel their attention to detail is fantastic we are always treated very well all friendly and polite staff  so much so I have already booked my next trade show here  I cant praise them enough  food is very good  rooms clean bright and airy,5,2014,07,09
250,Good for a night,"All very good except for three things. One, very limited choices for dining and last minute shopping in the area.  It felt isolated.  Two, the a/c in our room did not work well. Although front desk was quick to send someone to adjust the thermostat, it did not cool our room down.  We opened a window instead, and dealt with some noise (but not terribly bad).  Three, the bottom tiles' grout could've used some scrubbing.  Our flight the next day was very early.  So, the free shuttle, which was prompt, was truly beneficial to us.  I would not mind staying here again.",4,2014,07,05
250,Best Hotel on our trip,We stayed here the night before we left Europe.   This hotel was amazing.   The staff greeted us and welcomed us as platinum members.   They helped us get our bags to the room.   They were extremely nice and welcoming.    Then we got to our room.  Wow..again I say wow.   There were two nice comfy beds....a refrigerator....two chairs and a table...a desk...a bathroom with a shower and a separate bath.       The room was brilliant.  The staff was amazing.   The shuttle was great to the airport.       And this was a FREE room we got with our points.       We had stayed at the Holiday Inn express next door upon arrival in Dublin.  I do not understand how the holiday inn express can have higher ratings than this hotel.  This hotel is one hundred times better than the Holiday Inn Express.   The room was HUGE for Europe.    I wished we had stayed here both times.   I do not understand why there are any negative reviews for this hotel.   The business center was free and we were able to print our boarding passes.   Internet is free.   We also had a room with a view of the great park across the street from the hotel.,5,2014,06,23
250,avoid like the plague,"Me and my wife are here in a city break. We stayed one night at the crown plaza northwood. We used our ihg points as we are platinum card holders. I travel extensively with my company and had accrued a lot of points. The room was good, very clean A/C which is a must for us. When we asked if we could stay another 3 nights we were met with an initial yes, you van arrange at the desk in the morning. Next morning after a dry horrible continental breakfast in the club lounge, which apparently is a special thing for using them a lot, we went to desk to be told that suddenly there were no rooms, they were absolutely full!  But if we paid using money instead of points they might be able to help us!!!!!  I have never heard anything like this in my life!  And frankly  I don't believe there rooms are worth anywhere near the 177 euros a night they charge.  There isn't even a pool. My poor wife had to go back up to the room and pack and go on internet to try an  find another room somewhere.  The hot water supply was minimal. Food in restaurant ok, especially if you like screaming kids running around, it was like a public bar! We were hoping for a romantic city break, sadly not the case.  20 euros for taxi into dublin city centre, so quite far away from action, pubs shopping. Please look for something in dublin centre. This hotel has no interest in looking after its guests. Reception staff rude, and felt it was  beneath them to help in any way.",2,2014,06,17
250,Amazing,"My husband an myself stayed in the crowns plaza on Friday 13th June 2014.We were guests of the blood and platelet awards.We decided to stay over,We were so happy we did,it was fantastic ..from the lovely welcome at the front desk to a beautiful room.Loads of hot water.We had a bath and a shower in our room.Tea and coffee and kettle,lovely toiletries. The bed was so comfy.The dinner was amazing..lovely soup followed by fab tender roast beef and delicious veg and to finish we had apple crumble with cream an ice cream..complements to the chief and the lovely friendly waiters and waitresses.The breakfast was so good too.The whole atmosphere was great.I would have no problem recommending this hotel and will definitely be back.Paul and Linda Dublin",5,2014,06,14
250,"Nice Hotel, Good Stay","This hotel is about 5-10 minutes from the Dublin Airport, we found the hotel to be very nice, clean, basics in bedding and  comfortable, rooms clean, staff friendly and helpful. 

Two restaurants on site, one being more a bar/restaurant which we ate at several times, good food, good service. Room service was fast, they offer a partial menu after hours.

Took us about 15 minutes to get to downtown Dublin, driving our rental car. 

Had no problems with this stay, if I went back would not hesitate to stay again.

A very nice park across the street, nice walk and had playground for kids.

No pool or spa at this hotel.",4,2014,06,12
250,"Gorgeous room, beautiful bathroom, amazing bed","3rd time back to a crowne plaza hotel! Fast easy check in, lovely staff! Short taxi to city centre. Favourite bed I've ever slept in! Bar men made us lovely strawberry daiquiri that wasn't even on the menu, even went to the kitchen to get fresh strawberries. Can't comment on food as only stayed for one night and did not eat. Perfect for anyone staying for concerts or matches or going to the airport.",5,2014,06,10
250,It was my second choice,I actually like to stay at the hotel in Blanchardstown but this hotel was second choice with reluctance as it was a lot cheaper. If you drive here the parking is multi-storey and closer to the Holiday Inn Express than it is this hotel. Dont opt for the Club Lounge as there are two main things wrong 1. the free drinks on an evening are limited with very dry canopies and  2. the staff that was on last week at breakfast was rude and abrupt and several people made the comment. The rooms themselves are very nice and the restaurant is OK but nothing special.,3,2014,06,07
250,Very disappointed ,Stayed for one night and found the motel very noisy especially from the room next door. For dinner we went to the bar area I ordered nachos which was lithe ordering a plate of chips it had a limited amount of meat spread on the top what a waist of money. We had to get up at 4am to catch our flight and as we had paid for a full breakfast they packed us a yogurt and muffin I think I would have rather of been refunded the breakfast. When we got up to get ready for our flight we had no hot water so I was unable to have a shower. I would not book this hotel again. ,3,2014,06,06
250,"""Great Service and Convenient Location""","Marie Kristel 

My mom and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of its convenient location to and from the city center as well as its close proximity to the airport. The bus stop is only about a 5 minute walk from the hotel which is especially helpful to those who doesn't like to walk very far. The Omni Shopping Center is also very close to the area. We found the free shuttle service to and from the airport to be very helpful for travelers who have never been to Dublin and are not too familiar and comfortable taking the public transit upon arrival (unless, of course, you don't mind catching a cab from the airport). Additionally, our room was clean and nicely decorated. The food and wonderful service was also superb! Kate, our server, was very welcoming and helpful as well as the front desk employees who continuously displayed great professionalism and friendliness towards us during our stay. Thank you for making our trip to Dublin a memorable one!",5,2014,06,05
250,Not impressed,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my husbands company, the room was amazing, very clean and the bed was really comfortable, we were staying in club class which meant cocktails and canapés every night which was a plus, on the down side the whole experience was ruined by incompetent staff! On check in we produced all the necessary info as we were full account to company, they took copies and also had the company credit card, when we had eaten and took ourselves off to bed the WAITRESS called our room and told us we had no credit, my husband had to get dressed and go down to sort it out yet again, next morning at breakfast the same embarrassing thing again, I spoke to the duty manager who promised it would not happen again, no compensation offered not even a bottle of wine!!! And again on the last morning breakfast was a disaster as we were told we could only have continental!! I was and still am absolutely appalled!!!!!!!!!!!

250,Your standard airport hotel,"My mom and I stayed here on our last night in Ireland, after spending 10 days traipsing about the country. We picked this hotel because of its proximity to the airport (and because they have a shuttle to the airport), so the fact that it's leagues away from the city center wasn't a big deal. However, if you're planning on spending time in Dublin doing anything near the city center, expect to pay €20-30 one-way either to or from the hotel. 

As far as the room, we had a twin room and it was tiny. The bathroom was small but clean, as was the shower. One thing I found weird was that even though the room was quite cramped already with two twin beds and a dresser, they chose to put a small round table and two pretty big arm chairs in the room. When we first entered, one of the chairs was pushed up against the bed... pretty weird. I ended up pushing the chairs back so I could get into the bed, but it seems like maybe they could have just left the table and chairs out completely. Or at least removed one of the chairs since there wasn't enough room for anyone but a hobbit to sit around the table.

The room we had was on the first floor and the roof of another building came right up to our window, which felt a bit odd. The room itself was dark and had fluorescent lighting, and I guess that combined with it being so cramped with all of the furniture I felt a tad claustrophobic while we were in there. But we were only staying one night and had an early flight, so it wasn't a huge deal. 

Bottom line: If you're looking for a hotel to stay in before an early flight, stay here. If you're wanting to spend any time at all in Dublin, get something closer to the city.",3,2014,06,03
250,Expected more from a Crowne Plaza,"This is probably going to be one of the hardest reviews I've ever written on TripAdvisor. One: on one hand because of the surreal events that took place during our stay and two: because on the other hand of the hotel's efforts to compensate.

This was our second stay in the Crowne Plaza Northwood, which is conveniently situated not far from the university where I am taking exams. 

The hotel offers a shuttle bus service from/to the airport. We did not mind that the bus arrived with a 15 minute delay. The driver was a bit absent-minded and when we got off the mini-bus, he almost drove away while we were busy unloading our luggage from the trunk and the bus's trunk door almost hit my husband on the head. 

Our first night in the hotel is worthy of a Fawlty towers scenario, or similar drama-comedy hotel series: We had dinner in the hotel's Touzai restaurant, which I would highly recommend, with plenty of options and huge portions of food and wine. When it was time to pay, we filled-in our room number next to the print ""Room No."" that was clearly written on the bill we got, signed it and left before the waitress collected the receipt. Then we went up to our room to sleep as we were very tired with jetlag. An hour and a half later, at 22.10 we were woken-up by the phone ringing: Someone from the restaurant was trying to explain that they did not accept charging the room and could they send somebody upstairs to collect the amount (!). We explained that we were sleeping and asked to settle the bill the next day. We then tried to go back to sleep. Alas, there was a bedroom party next door and the noise went on for a long time! There were people talking loud and drinking and when it was close to midnight we knocked on their door and asked them not to make noise. This was in vain. So we called the reception and reported this and they sent somebody up to tell them to be quiet. The rude guests continued to make noise and by 1 a.m. we called the reception again. Security personnel knocked on the next door room again, the noisy neighbours lowered their voices but a few minutes later they were at it again.  So we called the reception again complaining, and a third time and each time the guests would lower their voices, some of them would leave the room, banging the door loudly behind them and then they would return only to make more noise. By 1.30, an hour and a half since our initial complaint, it was clear that these people were not going to stop and with my university exams taking place the next day I was adamant to get them to stop so that I could get some sleep. So my husband and I got up and walked to the reception, found the Duty Manager and complained that if they did not manage to restrain their guests we would call the police. By now the next door party was in full swing, with cigarette smoke filling the corridor and creeping into our room from under the door and with lots of noise from laughing and singing and talking loud. The Duty Manager himself came up to witness this unbelievable situation. He offered to move us into another bedroom. So we found ourselves re-packing our luggage at 1.30 a.m. and moving into another room. With all the hassle and the fury of the moment, my husband forgot his wedding ring on the bedside table. When he remembered it the next morning, the ring was gone and nowhere to be found. Besides the night porter who helped us carry our luggage from one room to the other at 1.30 we are not in position to know who else accessed the room. The new room did not have a double bed like the previous one but at least it was quiet and we could get some much needed sleep.

The next day we had some serious issues to complain about to the polite Duty Manager on that day, Marek: 
1) The disturbance by the restaurant to pay the bill late in the evening;
2) The unbelievable experience with the noisy guests next door;
3) The disappearance of my husband's wedding ring;
4) Not having a double bed in the newly allocated room.

Marek went to great lengths to try and rectify these issues. This resulted in a complimentary dinner, an upgrade into a VIP room that had a double bed and where breakfast was included for the rest of our stay, a complimentary bottle of wine and a plate of fresh fruit. 

Unfortunately the wedding ring will forever be gone and that is something irreplaceable. 

Throughout the rest of our stay we experienced some other let-downs, such as slow service and dirty tables at breakfast, drunk people inside and outside the hotel at 4 a.m. after a party (on two occasions!), the front office's inability to provide information and assistance about renting a car and slow service in the hotel's bar.

A few words about the quality of food: As already mentioned the Touzai restaurant as well as the bar offer good dishes. However, the breakfast is not up to standard. The service is average, although some members of staff are very friendly and professional.

Although we wish to thank those people who tried to make our stay as comfortable as possible, such as Marek, the Duty Manager, Andrew at the Reception and Victor in the Touzai restaurant, I am afraid we will think twice before returning to this hotel, which can clearly not control its noisy guests and cannot guarantee a good night's sleep.",2,2014,06,02
250,Fine for the money.,"We booked this hotel because it was affordable and close to the airport for our flight out of Dublin.  The hotel was decent - it has updated rooms and a good restaurant.  Parking cost 6 euros for 24 hours.  A major downside was that our shower did not drain properly, so the shower floor would quickly start to fill up after the water ran for a few minutes.",3,2014,06,01
250,Not bad. Not Terrific. Close to Airport. Close to Bus line.,"If you find this review helpful At all, PLEASE indicate so, and thank you:

This is a great location for Business because it is very close to the airport and includes a free shuttle bus. 

Instructions to catch the Shuttle:
After you exit the Arrivals you will be on an upper level ask someone of 
official capacity how to find ""Shuttle Pod #14"". . . 
Or - 
Basically you go across/Over the main driveway to where the busses are waiting, 
except the shuttle waiting area is Off to the NORTH. So once you get down to the 
ground level where those tour bus operators are, turn north and follow the Glass Tunnels
for a long way around (off toward a Parking garage) to pod #14.. the Crowne Plaza shuttle will be there roughly every 10 to 15 minutes from 6am until pretty late (check with Hotel if you really need to know the times)

Otherwise a taxi ride shouldn't cost you more than 10 Euro it is really close by. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We found this Crown Plaza to be very clean. 
Our room had two twin sized beds and was a bit crowded. 

Our room had mostly UK style power connections although there was 
one US style 110v/60hz connection available. . It stopped working three days into our stay but the Electrical staff were kind enough to bring an adapter for the UK connections. 

NOTE: UK style AC power connections are NOT the same as Europe (I was misled on this before my trip and brought a EU adapter that did not work anywhere in Ireland).
If you want to bring an adapter, make sure it is UK to US. 

And . . also check your power supply's for 220v/50HZ compatibility because if they are
not you will need to bring a CONVERTING adapter (converts 220v to 110v).. If you plug in a non-compatible device into a plain adapter, it will melt. 
(My NMH AA battery charger was Not compatible with 220V/50Hz, but I had a good supply of them and didn't need to charge them anyway)

On our 2nd day we did not get room service even though we absolutely did not put the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door. Maybe you have to place the ""Please Clean room"" sign out, which we DID do from that day on. 

The ventilation system also stopped working on the third day (Error 26). 

The Hairdryer is not in the bathroom (with 220V AC I can imagine its quite a hazard  being in the bathroom) but you can find it inside a drawer underneath the Mirror in the room. 

Our view was an apartment building very close by. 
Note this is not a place for a vacation stay as the view isn't that great from any room. 

The restaurant has very fresh Guinness and the food is very good with a very nice variety.
I especially liked the Cinnabar Salad. 

All the staff are extra friendly, cheerful, helpful and knowledgeable.  
EXCEPT for one: When I checked in, I was not asked to present my credit card, 
so I didn't. . . the next day they completely turned EVERYTHING off in our room. 
While we were inside it. they never CAlled on the phone or knocked on the door beforehand.
and when we left because we thought there was a power outage, etc. we could not get back into our room and we were in night clothes. This place needs a little better protocol for handling 
patrons whom they THINK are not going to pay (umm, call them, knock on the door, etc.)
When we made it downstairs, luckily we had our wallets and  I was able to present my credit card.
Really this situation could have been handled WAY better than it was. 
The point to readers s - make sure you present your credit card when you check in, even if they don't ask for it. 

There is a Gym with treadmills and weight machines but I did not participate.

Breakfast was great each morning albeit a tad pricey. really nothing wrong with it though. 
The breakfast hostess is/was very pretty (an understatement), cheerful and attentive. 

Keep in mind when in Ireland that Service is sort of 'stand-offish'. (I was warned about this ahead of time) . . it is not comfortable for wait staff to check on you regularly, if you need something it is Very much ok to say ""excuse me"" or wave them down. So don't get upset if they 
don't stop at your table every few minutes (Like they do in the states.)
It is considered rude to pester patrons that are trying to enjoy their meal or drinks with friends/family. 

Overall: Good Hotel for business. Not so good for Vacationers. Present your CC. Bring UK to US Adapter. .Partake in breakfast.",3,2014,05,30
250,"Friendly, warm service at an okay hotel","It is a bit hard to get really enthusiastic about this hotel, but it has its good points.  The hotel which is about 15 minutes from the airport and provides a free shuttle, is located on a semi-private road across a large park, ideal for walking or running.  The hotel staff seem  to genuinely care about the guests.  Rooms are large, clean, and standardly equpped.  The bar is friendly, the restaurant's food is OK, but just that.  If you drive, the hotel's car park (shared with the neighbouring Holiday Inn Express) costs 6 euros a day.  Would I return?  Probably.  It is very convenient and the staff are lovely.",4,2014,05,30
250,Average hotel.,"I stayed here for one night with my elderly father and was woken by a phone call at 7am. It then rang 6 more times over the following hour and when I questioned this at the front desk, I was told it was beyond their control and was probably a guest. At 8.30am a cleaning lady tried to gain access to clean our room, even though we were only there for one night and so this was necessary. Rooms were very nice but the hotel generally lacks atmosphere. Would not return.",3,2014,05,30
250,"Nice rooms, close to the airport","I only stayed one night because it's close to the airport, and I flew in late. The room and bathroom were beautiful, and my husband and I were able to get a half decent sandwich from room service when we arrived in the middle of the night. ",4,2014,05,28
250,great stay,"the crowne plaza northwood is a great hotel. clean, stylish, lovely

we stayed on the club floor, the rooms were lovely and had everything you could need. the only negative thing I can say is that the walls are quite thin so if next door are loud you can hear what they are saying.

The check in was a bit poor. The man who checked us in wasn't very informative.  he basically just gave us our room key and that was it. he didnt tell us about the club lounge facilities we were entitled to, anything about breakfast or the restaurant,  he didn't even tell us where the lifts where up to the rooms or anything. it was only that we had asked members of staff twice that we found out about the club lounge and breakfast.

continental breakfast was included in our booking and was lovely, you can upgrade to full cooked breakfast which we did and I couldn't fault it. buffet style, everything you could want, one of the best breakfast ive had in a hotel.

parking is available at 6euro for 24hrs which is very reasonable. 

check out went very smoothly.  there was a different man on the desk this time and he was very pleasant and helpful.  it said we has used out of the mini bar which was a mistake and was taken off our bill with no problem.

it is a bit outside of the city centre and shops are quite far away from the hotel if you have to walk to them. we ordered food in on our first night and this was not a problem.

all in all I had a lovely stay in the crowne plaza and will definitely stay again. 
",4,2014,05,27
250,Convenient to airport....,"We picked this hotel for our last night in Ireland because I could drop off the rental car, catch a shuttle to airport and a second one back to hotel. It took about 90 minutes. The front staff were excellent, but we did not get the NON-SMOKING room we had prepaid. At 5 PM, no rental car, we had no choice but to stay. We opened the room windows, turned up the air and went to the bar. 

The bar was bright, open with a pleasant staff. We should have eaten at the bar because the hotel main restaurant was terrible....and expensive. Take your food at the bar. There are no other restaurants in the area, so be aware.

Breakfast the next morning was included in our rate and was acceptable. No more than what you get at a two star hotel along the road in the US. 

Great location, but execution needs improvement.

",3,2014,05,26
250,"The walls were shaking, the earth was quaking! Shook me all night long!","I've got a plane to catch in the morning folks. This is absolutely ridiculous!!!! You should not allow a DJ to play his loud thumping bass driven music late into the night. I lie awake in my bed disturbingly waiting for the NOISE to cease. I chose to stay at a hotel by the airport for a reason. And that reason was for a good night of rest.
 I just pray that my airline pilot is spending the night in a peaceful hotel. I would hate to think that he is staying here.",2,2014,05,24
250,Unbelievable Loud DJ Party at Hotel,"We had an early flight so we stayed at a hotel near the airport. We were on the 1st floor.  A LOUD party continued until 12:30am.  It was so loud the window in our room shook for hours with the music. If I was looking for loud music in my room, I would have stayed city center.  If you have an early flight, don't stay at this hotel expecting to sleep or relax.",2,2014,05,24
250,Close to Airport,"This hotel is very close to the airport so is great for early flights.  However, the parking garage is not attached to the hotel and you have to run through the rain to get your vehicle.  Not a problem if you use the hotel shuttle, but if you have a rental car, it is not very convenient.  Further there is a fee for parking (6 Euro a night, so not bad, but everywhere else we stayed on this trip included free parking).
The rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable.  However, we booked through hotels.com and were not given a choice of two twins or one double bed and ended up getting two twins; not comfortable for us.
Again, a great, clean hotel, but could have been better.",4,2014,05,24
250,Great property great stay. Overcharged by 3x my bill at checkout....,"We had a lovely stay, good dinner, room and amenities were terrific. Was staying on points so no charge except our dinner. Checked out and took free shuttle to airport. All around perfect until I got my credit card statement. Was charged over $140 for a checkout bill of $35. My itemized bill was correct but the charge slip wasn't. No signature was needed so when I checked out I just out final receipt with my things.  Have contacted IHG via phone call as well as hotel via email. Was guaranteed by IHG that I'd have email response within 48 hrs as does their website guaranteed. I'm going in over 4 days and have heard nothing. Next step will be to call credit card company and stop payment on charge. Feel like something is fraudulent here!!!!",3,2014,05,18

250,Excellent Stay,"After a slight ‘hiccup’ on check-in, I was looked after by the very pleasant and helpful Manager Pius, he solved my problem straight away. I do a lot of travelling on business and this why I always try to stay at a Crown Plaza for this type of service. The hotel does not feel like your normal Airport Hotel but more like a city centre one. 

Ate in the bar, where the food was really nice and the staff again very helpful. Transport to the airport was on time in the morning and again driver friendly and helpful.

Thanks Pius for a great stay, highly recommend staying if your looking for a top clase airport hotel.",5,2014,05,15
250,Great airport hotel,"This hotel wasn't very full on the one night we laid-over, so the concierge bumped us up to the Club Level room for free.  Thanks Crowne!  
The room was large and luxurious with plenty of amenities.  The main reason we picked this hotel was for their free shuttle service to the airport; which worked out well for us.",5,2014,05,11
250,Could be better,"Stayed one night after turning in rental car and before taking flight, free shuttle to airport arrived at station 14 after we stood for 40 minutes, the Hilton and others had been there several times.  The hotel is really not an airport hotel as it is at least 10 minutes drive to an industrial section to get there.

Once there the chick in was easy, they were having several events and the place was a mess, you couldn't get into the bar or restaurant, good for them I guess. The room was nice with good bedding and bath.  Overall would rate this hotel a plastic 3 star, not customer friendly, no coffee available in morning unless you buy buffet for 18 euros.  No menu service. Wow I just didn't like the place",3,2014,05,11
250,Great business hotel,"Perfect stay especially if you need to spend a night close to Dublin airport. 
After several visits for business reasons I really appreciate its nice location in front of the Northwood Park, the professional staff, the clean, comfortable and elegant rooms and the free shuttle bus to the airport terminals.
Two restaurants are available : one more formal (Touzai) serving oriental or european food and one (Cinnabar) more casual, quite busy and noisy but good for a burger, a quick snack and a beer.",4,2014,05,06
250,The kindness and courtesy made our stay so memorable.,"I arrived at the Crowne Plaza on the day after my operation at Santry Sports Clinic , tired and in post op pain. At the reception desk the General Manager - Pius noticed my distress and immediately allocated my husband and I to a suite overlooking the lovely parkland area at the front of the hotel on the top floor . I stayed there for five nights and was blessed by the comfort and space that the suite afforded me . It made so much difference to my well being and to my recovery . Throughout our stay we enjoyed the care of the housekeeping staff who made extra efforts to ensure I had all that I needed in terms of extra pillows and towels etc . The reception staff were cheerful and enquired daily as to how I was feeling as I went for my daily little walks across to the park . Extra cushions were supplied by the waitresses in the restaurant areas to help me sit comfortably and done with a smile . I would like to thank all of you so much for your kindness and compassion . It was appreciated at a time when my world was a little fragile . A special thank you to Pius for his care and concern at reception . ",4,2014,04,24
250,Great hotel close to the airport,"Large, spacious and nicely decorated room. Great breakfast and there is a free shuttle to the airport (although it's a bit of a wreck).

This hotel is spot on.",5,2014,04,16
250,Good hotel and conveniently located,Very good experience. Excellent receptionist but unfortunately cannot remember her name. Breakfast was excellent with a very good selection of both hot and cold dishes. Staff attentive and pleasant. Hotel is close to airport and there is a free shuttle bus. The public transport bus stop is literally across the road so it saves the hassle of parking in the city centre. parking in the hotel's multi storey park is reasonable. Well maintained. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Superb shower. Will most definitely use again and recommend to others. Grounds surrounding hotel are lovely.,5,2014,04,09
250,Good hotel - close to the airport,"The hotel is close to the airport (free shuttle bus).  Clean, comfortable & quiet.  Good sized room & bathroom.

I never make a comment about a hotel unless i stay in it several times.It has being a while since i stayed here but i enjoyed every minute.From when we checked into the hotel we were made feel very welcome and at home.. Staff were friendly and attentive and the hotel clean and inviting.Have to say for me this hotel ticks all the right boxes. The hotel isn't too expensive food is great and at a reasonable price and the staff are friendly.The room was clean and big enough with a very, very good bed.Very clean and a nice decor...I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again.",5,2014,04,04
250,Great stay when in Dublin,"It was my first time in Crowne Plaza Dublin Northwood with great experience ! 
I enjoyed my stay every moment, room was clean and big enough with very, very good bed. The person who checked me in was very helpful with my questions, not sure about her name but I think it was Veronika or similar. 
It was easy to arrive from airport with shuttle bus and also going back with the same bus, it is about 10 mins. drive and the bus timetable & pick-up point (Area14/Coach park) at airport can be found from hotel website. Shuttle bus runs every 20 mins.
Location seems to be nice (park opposite the hotel) even I didn't visit the area because of rainy weather. 
I had dinner at Cinnabar Pub, was quite surprised of reasonable price of my meal including main course, 2 beers and a dessert. 
There are bus stops near the hotel and at least bus number 16 runs between airport and Dublin City, also stops near the hotel.
This time I had room only, no breakfast but it is good to check the offers from hotel website before making reservations. 
And finally I had a complimetary water bottle waiting in my room. :)",5,2014,04,01
250,Much better experience this time around,We have stayed here before and this time was the best experience so far.  Staff were friendly and attentive and the hotel clean and inviting.  The staff in the bar area have changed which is a good thing.  We thought twice about returning due to the staff during our last stay.  Glad we returned.  Hotel is in a great location for the airport and makes returning a rental car very easy.  Much nicer area than the other airport hotels!  There is a park across the way which is very nice to take a walk in!  Lovely area all around!,4,2014,04,01
250,Brilliant once again!!!,"Stayed here in the last week of March with a friend. Have stayed here previously as well before flying out of Dublin Airport. Have to say for me this hotel ticks all the right boxes. The hotel isn't too expensive and it is in an ideal location for anyone that has a flight the next day like myself. Its located 10 minutes drive from the airport and a free shuttle bus runs from there from early in the morning every 20 minutes. The evening we arrived we had something to eat in the bar/ restaurant. Both of us had the open crab sandwich on Guinness brown bread. Delicious!!! That morning breakfast was fantastic. Fresh fruit, cereal, cured meat, cheeses, full irish, waffles, pancakes. Really great and perfect to get you set for the long day ahead of traveling. Rooms are really nice and spacious with all the facilities you would expect from a four star hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to go back here a third time when I fly from Dublin airport again.",5,2014,04,01

250,Superb,"LOCATION & ATTRACTIONS NEARBY *** Crowne Plaza is located in a quiet neighbourhood of Northwood, approx. 10 min drive from the airport. There is a free shuttle bus from the airport (bus station) to the hotel which also serves Holiday Inn Express. Shuttle bus runs frequently and I didn't have any issues finding it (well marked and described). Hotel is NOT within a walking distance from the airport or city centre (approx. 15 EUR by taxi or by local bus, stop is approx. 300 m from the hotel). Score: 4/5

HOTEL OVERVIEW *** This was the first time I was able actually to stay there. I've been there before (in their restaurant and bar) and I absolutely loved it. This is the standard other hotels should follow. Score: 4,5/5

PURPOSE OF THIS TRIP *** Late arrival to Dublin. Leisure.

RESERVATION *** Reservation was hassle-free and quick using my IHG Rewards account with my saved information - 3/4 steps and it's ready. Reservation available on my profile, e-mail and mobile application (and also Passbook) - perfect. Score: 5/5

LENGTH OF MY STAY *** 1 night.

CHECK-IN *** I arrived very late (around midnight). Check-in was very quick and efficient. Because I'm a Platinum IHG Rewards member (I was welcomed as per their internal procedure), all documentation was pre-arranged before and an envelope with my welcome letter, key cards and complimentary Internet access code were given to me. 3 min and I was ready to relax in my bed. Score: 5/5

LOBBY & RECEPTION *** Lobby is modern, clean and elegant. Even if this is a busy airport hotel, they keep it in a great condition and you can see that this hotel is definitely run by people, who really care about their guests. 

ROOM *** I was upgraded to King Bed Club Room (#453), which I was very happy. Maybe it wasn't the biggest room, but definitely very comfortable and well equipped. I really liked colours, materials and entire modern style - yes, this is ""the right way"" to have an upscale room. There was one King-size bed, large working space, flat screen TV, an armchair and definitely enough space for your clothes and luggage. Complimentary bottle of water was a life saver for me that evening, ha-ha. Also, there was a coffee/tea making kit and mini-bar with a good selection (as usual - prices for mini-bar stuff is always high and those sensors are very annoying - you're unable to put there any of your own things, ha-ha). Also, great thing, which I haven't seen in other hotels - you can close down your mirror. I know that some people don't like to sleep in front of a mirror; here you don't have this problem. The only one minus which I found was lack of electrical sockets near my bed. Score: 5/5

BATHROOM *** Perfect! Modern, spacious, fresh and spotless clean! Good quality toiletries and fluffy towels were provided. I think glass elements in the bathroom looks really cool and, which was very surprising, they were all cleaned properly (not many hotels can achieve that). Score: 5/5

BREAKFAST *** I didn't have too much time, but I went to the Club Lounge and I was able to have a coffee and some light breakfast. It was fresh and tasty. Score: 4/5

INTERNET ACCESS *** For IHG Rewards members Internet access is complimentary, so if you're going to this property don't forget to join. It's actually pretty good. As mentioned earlier, I was given my Internet access information and codes at check-in pro-actively, so I didn't have to waste any time to go back there etc. Connection was good and log-in wasn't complicated. Score: 5/5

CHECK-OUT EXPERIENCE *** Simply perfect. Welcoming smile of the receptionist is very good start of the day. My invoice was printed, packed and I was ready to go. Hassle-free - that's what we like it. Score: 5/5

STAFF *** I didn't have a chance to spend too much time, but my experience with all of them (reception, club lounge, shuttle bus) was very positive - they are great people, dedicated to their work. Well done! Score: 6/5 :)

OVERVIEW *** Great hotel if you need to stay somewhere close to the airport. They also have a parking attached, so you can leave your car for the night (6 EUR) or even few days. I did that before and the rates were very competitive to airport parking. 

Also, after this stay my IHG Rewards account was richer with a good amount of points due to some promotional codes distributed by IHG. As a benefit on this particular stay I’ve got: 50% Bonus Points, Complimentary Newspaper, Complimentary Late Check-out (didn’t use), Room Upgrade and Free Wi-Fi.

250,Nice hotel,"Lovely decor , great location for the airport fantastic breakfast & helpful staff
On the down side we checked in to a freezing cold room & having had maintenance check the heating etc we were moved to an equally cold room , we were given an electric heater & it took quite sometime for the room to warm up , we stay in this area from time to time but I can't stay somewhere that is cold . Parking 6 euro for 24 hours beside hotel . Breakfast was super best of any hotel we've stayed in all very fresh & great variety even for vegetarians",4,2014,03,27
250,Lovely stay,I chose this hotel because it is near the airport. It worked well for meetings and travel to other parts of Dublin and Ireland as it is close to the motorway. Food was good and the staff pleasant. The room I was given was well appointed. The only thing you miss is the atmosphere of being in Central Dublin.,5,2014,03,26
250,Very Accommodating,"We stayed one night in March 2014 in preparation for meeting up with a group tour of Ireland.  We arrived at the hotel very early (6am) after an overnight flight and were given a room quickly and graciously although 8 hours before normal check-in time.  The hotel room was spacious, pleasant, and clean.  Hotel staff was friendly and efficient.  Breakfast in the dining room was excellent, with wide variety and quality.  We ate lunch and dinner in the bar and were vey happy with food and service.  The hotel is located next to a very large park, which provided a nice setting and an opportunity for a nice walk in the afternoon.  Location is close to the airport and served our needs well, but would be a bit far from the Dublin city center for convenient touring.",5,2014,03,21
250,Great hotel business,"Good hotel, rooms very well appointed and check in and check out very fast.

Negative point is the hotel is very far from the city and you need to take a taxi to get there.

Food was fine and a lot compare to what you normally find in Dublin, if I ever agaib in Dublin I will stay here.

250,Amazing Hotel,"This was our first time staying in the Crowne Plaza in some time. As this mini break was a treat, I decided to book the Royal Suite. I had requested an early check in if available, and this was no problem at all.

Checking in was a pleasure. Beth explained the club floor facilities and meal options, and reminded us that should we need anything, reception was staffed on a 24 hour basis.

Despite not being an elite member of the Hotels loyalty programme, we were given complimentary internet access, which was a nice touch.

The Royal Suite is huge! The bedroom is the same as the hotel's normal rooms, the living area was almost twice that size. Carpets, curtains and soft furnishings are dark red, with beige walls. Both rooms have televisions, and the bathroom a separate shower & Jacuzzi bath. There is even a separate toilet beside the living area. Very plush and inviting indeed.

A welcome note from the General Manager with a bottle of wine and large plate of fruit  was on waiting for us. What a lovely touch.

The Club Lounge is open early morning to late night and offers tea, coffee and soft drinks all day. Weekday evenings, complimentary drinks and canapes are served, along with continental breakfast. The lounge is a very pleasant place to relax and unwind. Newspapers and magazines are available, along with work stations & PCs for those who need to work.

During the afternoon, a couple of maintenance issues became apparent. I spoke to the duty manager, Andrew, who immediately arranged for maintenance to call. Within minutes, a very friendly gentleman, Matthew, arrived and speedily rectified some issues. One he was unable to resolve was that the TV in the living area was unable to access Movies or hotel information services: the TV set didn’t have the hardware needed to access these services. 

One of the reasons I booked the Royal Suite was the expectation that we could relax in the living area, watch movies and eat dinner. Sadly this was not to be. However as the TV set was newly installed, I no doubt this will be .rectified shortly

Later we visited the Club lounge, and had a couple of drinks. The canapés on offer consisted of thinly sliced wraps, and were very tasty. The red wine served in the lounge was a very nice Syrah Cabernet. 

 Later, we ordered from the room service menu. The menu is reasonably priced by any standards: an 8oz sirloin steak with pepper sauce,onions, rocket & fries is 21euro.  The steaks were cooked to perfection. Desserts were equally good, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meals.

The Club floor includes continental breakfast, and at weekends is served in the Touzai restaurant. For a mere 5euro, a cooked buffet is available, and is a veritable bargain.

Overall this was a very enjoyable stay. The suite is superb, room service food excellent quality and value. The swift response to the issues raised with management is commendable, and  all staff we encountered were very pleasant indeed.",5,2014,03,04
250,Best service I've seen in a while,"Stayed for a night on a business trip in February. 

Staff were very welcoming during check in. Took their time to make sure I was happy, and she evern suggested a follow up wake up call to make sure I was awake, which was a great idea. 

My room was very cold, and after a couple of hours, I called reception to complain. The response was quick, and when they couldn't figure out why the heating in the room wasn't working, they offered me another room right away. I decided I didn't want to repack and unpack into another room, and was offered a portable heater instead. 

The next morning, after checking out, I was waiting to be picked up, and I was very kindly offered coffee in the lobby.

An excellent hotel, and I will probably be back here at some point in the future.",5,2014,03,01
250,Nice stay,"A group of 5 of us stayed in this hotel in February   I stayed in a twin room with a work mate. Room was very tight for space more suitable for 1 person rather than 2. However, the room was clean and tidy and was ample for our one night stay
We ate in the bar, food was fine but next time I think I would try one of the other nearby hotels ",4,2014,03,01
250,Unexpected Stay,"Last week I was caught out by the high winds and bad weather and had to stay an extra night in Dublin.
I stayed at Crowne Plaza with other stranded passengers the hotel laid on a meal for us late in the evening at fairly short notice.
The room was comfortable warm and well decorated I had a walk in shower which was good
Breakfast was a buffet but food was hot and of a good quality.
If I needed a hotel close to airport I would stay here again,also free transfer to airport",4,2014,02,18
250,Brilliant base for a city trip,"We had booked into the Holiday Inn Express next door, but we were upgraded to the Plaza. We had a lovely stay, the room was great, huge comfy bed, large bathroom. Everything spotlessly clean. Breakfast in the morning also first class. Staff were friendly and helpful all service was with a smile. Our room was not ready on arrival so we were offered complimentary coffee and breakfast while we waited. The bus into town was at the end of the road about 400 yards it was 2.60 euros each single but you need coins for this. The free shuttle bus to the airport that run every half hour was superb.",5,2014,02,14
250,Nice hotel,Nice hotel all be it a long way from the city centre. The rooms were a decent size and furnished well. The bar area was good with nice bar food. I was attending a function which was run particularly well and nothing was a problem.,4,2014,02,14
250,Above and Beyond!,"We had a really good experience, and some interesting circumstances and we really needed additional support. They staff went above and beyond, way above and beyond. Our rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Airport shuttle was a wonderful benefit.",5,2014,02,10
250,Fantastic Hotel.,"We had booked into the Express next door, but due to the rooms not being ready when promised were upgraded to the Plaza instead. Great room, huge comfy bed, large bathroom. Everything spotlessly clean. Breakfast in the morning also first class. Friendly helpful service with a smile. First class.",5,2014,02,10
250,Service standards,"We stayed here on 7th Feb, customer service skills lack here upon check in gent behind desk answered phone in the middle of checking a guest in and instead of asking the caller to hold for a moment while he completed the guest check in he countinued to talk on the phone leaving the guest standing there and didn't apologise to the guest. 
We ordered a bite to eat in the bar which was ok.
Attended a function that evening and were served a medallion of beef for main course which was extremely tuff! Other than that the service was very good.
We had breakfast the following morning and if breakfast is not included in your stay I wouldn't advice you to avail of this as it's over priced for €16.95 and I am still waiting on the coffee I ordered. Staff are extremely slow to clear off the tables after guests leave the restaurant but are quick to clear off the buffet at 11.
After we checked out we went to the bar and ordered a latte and 2 cokes the glasses were dirty and I had to ask for a clean glass and the gent serving us held the glass and the top rather than the bottom of glass and he also seemed put out when I asked for a clean glass.
Overall rooms are a high standard but maybe the staff need a refresher course on customer service.",3,2014,02,08
250,High quality hotel,"Stayed here while attending a industry dinner. Rooms of a vey good standard, staff helpful and food decent. It's an airport hotel so don't expect too much charm or atmosphere. Location is good for business meetings with easy access to M50 and about 5-10 mins from the airport.",4,2014,02,02
250,Verry good but......,"Our Initial impression of this hotel  was very good but location for the airport is not great especially when you are trying to locate it at night. If you want to fly from the airport park there and not off-site such as this hotel as it is just too far away despite having a shuttle bus. I know when we fly home all we want to do is get on our way as quickly as possible and not wait around for a transfer shuttle.
On arrival outside the hotel it was a little difficult to locate the car park as it is beside the adjacent hotel-and the car spaces are very tight –so watch your doors!!
The hotel reception and lobby areas very impressive as  are the bedrooms but the hotel was let down by the breakfast was far from impressive-all food was cold. We ended up eating just cereal & bread as the “hot food” was all cold.
It was a pity as the hotel itself was very nice inside and the staff were all helpful- apart from the breakfast staff who observed our full plates of uneaten  food and really should have enquired if there was a problem.

Plenty other hotels nearer airport with a better service-e.g. Radisson",3,2014,02,01
250,"""Lovely Stay""","I have Lovely stay in this Hotel Most Comfortable hotel near to airport. Room service was very good. If I get chance to go Dublin I will definitely stay here again. I was satisfied with the room, Cleanliness and staff.
Hotel interior design was nice",4,2014,01,29
250,Not a meeting place...,"I arrived to the Crowne Plaza yesterday with my mother. The cold as you came into the foyer was surprising and even more surprising as the cold continued into the bar. We were greeted by a relatively friendly waiter, when I asked about heating he turned on a small portable heater and told me that that was all they had and that it was cold across all the foyer and bar areas. My mother is quite elderly and needs heat, she did not take off her coat during our 90 minute stay. We ordered a club sandwich and soup. Our food came out promptly but the club sandwich was tepid at best. This sandwich was €12?? It was served with a finger bowl of fries. My mother did not enjoy the sandwich. My soup fared better but how hard is it to get tomato soup right? My two brothers joined us for coffee. The total bill came to €31. I was very disappointed with the food, especially as the prices were so exorbitant. I will not be back and would not recommend. ",2,2014,01,29
250,very comfortable airport hotel,"I have found this to be the most comfortable hotel near the airport that I have stayed at so far ( I think I've tried most of them).  For me, the interior design gives it the advantage over the others as it is much more welcoming.

I can think of no faults.  I was very satisfied with the room, cleanliness, food and staff.",5,2014,01,27
250,"Lovely Hotel, handy for the airport","This is a lovely hotel, with very comfortable rooms.  It's very handy for the airport, and a good price, though it isn't really handy to Dublin city centre.  I would definitely consider staying here again, if flying out very early in the morning.",5,2014,01,25
250,Felt ripped off,"I had an early flight out of Dublin airport and decided I would stay out at the airport so as not to have more time in bed.  I opted for a Club Room so I could relax in the evening (there is nothing around the hotel beyond a restaurant down the road) and use their Club Lounge.

What a surprise to find that it was closed and wouldn't re-open for several days.

Why would IHG/Crowne Plaza sell me something that they weren't going to deliver when they had closed the lounge?

When I checked out I was asked how my stay was.  So I mentioned about the lounge.  The person checking me out promised to take it up with the manager who was going to take over shortly.  Two weeks later and still nothing from the hotel/manager.

The hotel is perfectly nice, however, don't waste your money on a Club room.  They are the same as the rest of the rooms in terms of size and the real advantage (the lounge) wasn't available.  Very, very poor on this hotel to sell something that they then don't deliver.",3,2014,01,20
250,One Night Stay - close to airport,"Picked up hire car and drove all of the 10 minutes to get the hotel. Parking adjacent is €6 overnight.

Relaxed atmosphere. Traditional pub dining but reasonable value and a good choice of craft ales. I can recommend the clonmel pale ale.

Very friendly and helpful staff without exception.

I would stay again. Note that there is a shuttle between the airport and the hotel from the airport coach park. Out T2, walk across the road, through the carpark and then turn left.

",4,2014,01,19
250,"Nice hotel, close to IKEA and handy for airport.","Nice hotel and very good value, we booked for a family holiday flying out from Dublin Airport. The complimentary bus shuttle is excellent and runs every 30 minutes. The room was a family room, big and spacious (we were two adults and two children both 18) so it was a fantastic size for us. The bathroom was large, we joked that it was the size of a budget hotel bedroom! Parking was handy and for those on a smaller budget the Holiday Inn joined on is also very nice. The hotel is within walking distance to IKEA (15 minutes) so handy for shopping trips too. We didn't stay for breakfast as we had an early morning flight but if we were flying again we would 100% stay here!",4,2013,12,26
250,I’m expecting more from Crowne,"Fair business/travelling hotel if you need to be in the airport really early in the morning. Actually I found the room aspect below the average of other Crowne hotels in Europe, but it was clean and quiet. Breakfast starts at 6:30am and it’s a bit late for an airport hotel. Shuttle bus can connect to the terminal in few minutes and it’s suggested to book it the evening before. I cannot suggest it if you’re in Dublin for vacation as it’s quite far from city center.",2,2013,12,20
250,Top class hotel,"I was attending a conference recently at the hotel.  I stayed in the hotel the night before, had dinner and lunch then the following day.  The room was lovely and spotless.  Food was lovely too.  Top marks also on customer service.  Would stay here again.",5,2013,12,11
250,Decent CP - nothing noteworthy,"Stayed a few times. Latest was past week. Arrived on a Saturday to enjoy a loud late night party that went to wee AM hours.

My pluses :
Nearby park - walking trails
Breakfast
WiFi speed

Non-pluses:
Few dining choices nearby
A little dated
As gold member - thought I might warrant a mention of concierge lounge - nope.
Same for comped upgrade (Hilton=yes)
Same for drink / app voucher    (Hilton = yes)

Again, not bad but room to improve for all and for Priority members.",3,2013,12,09
250,Good Job.,"Besides the brand having a pretty good name, we were very pleased with the night's stay.  From check in (when we discovered that we had booked 2 rooms + paid in advance - how did we miss that ...) to check out.  Our mistake on the booking and fair play, they put the cost towards any hotel expenses we incurred - that sorted our food plans so we didn't have to go out.  If you did decide to wander, Omni shopping centre is a good 15 - 20 minute walk away and not sure what is available.
Food was good (large portions but surprisingly limited choice), service again in the bar was great and good value for drinks - there is a restaurant which has a pretty good early bird at 20e approx for 2 courses, maybe next time.  Mixed bag of patrons in the bar; families, lads night out, couples, girls night out and a Xmas function.  Even though our room was on the same side as the function room you could hardly make out the music; bearing in mind that this is a residential area the hotel really does well here.
Rooms very modern, love the bathroom with the bath and separate (extra large shower), only quibble here would be the floor tiles - very, very slippy, not your usual floor tile so be wary.
There is a business area which you can access through your room key card, very handy and we did use.
The surprising bit though, is the fact that overnight parking is €6!  There is also a shuttle bus to the airport.  So, you could stay in the hotel, leave the car and get the complimentary bus to the airport.  Imagine how much you would save on airport car parks if you had to leave your car there for a week, Crowne Plaza has it wrapped up, will definitely use again.",4,2013,12,09
250,comfy cloud!,"Excellent reception - so accommodating when I arrived. 
Superb gym - though they said it was small: it had 2 treadmills, 2 bikes, a full bank of mirrors with loads of weights along with a medicine ball....loads of towels too.
Lovely room along with a very nice restaurant.  Bus to the airport arrived on time along with driving back to the hotel it was timely.  The only drawback was the distance from the car park to the hotel and how dark it was: for a single lady it was a bit nerve wracking. (I would have it as excellent except for this point).  Superb breakfast too!!
Would definitely stay there again - in a heart beat!",4,2013,12,07
250,executive lounge. I mean really,"ok, maybe i'm a hotel snob but then when you pay it should be worth it.  The club lounge room was lovely, good wifi, water in the room etc, no complaints, but really the club lounge.  From 17.30 to 19.30 drinks reception but the girl must have thought it was her own personal supply.  As for the food, i think the homeless shelter could do better.",3,2013,12,05
250,"Lovely hotel, good value","Stayed here on the 30th November.We had our Christmas work party in the function room.
Great night. Rooms were very modern, clean, and spacious.
We only booked 1 week in advance but price was very good.Breakfast was included but unfortunately the previous nights partying took its toll and we were unable to get up in time.
Would definitely recommend this hotel !!",5,2013,12,05
250,Out of town location & unusual decor,"Stayed one night while a friend was in the Sports Surgery Clinic, very convenient for this purpose however rather out of the way otherwise. A car would be essential for those of limited mobility. The hotel is located in what was the Demesne estate of Santry House, consequently public transport is only available at around 1km away. However the hotel does provide a shuttle bus to Dublin airport. In addition, the Demesne grounds are a lovely place to stroll around. There are also a couple of local shops and fast food places in the estate. The hotel itself is nicely decorated in a modern style and breakfast is substantial. Quite a nice place to stay and staff were very friendly & helpful (many spoke German as the Luftansa crew lodge there). ",4,2013,12,03
250,Well presented comfortable hotel,The hotel has nice rooms with great beds. The bathroom had a good shower and a full size bath. Most of the staff were friendly & helpful. One lady on reception was too officious & bar lady ignored me at bar whilst photographing other customers. The hotel is located away from the town centre but the bar food selection is good.  Parking is in adjacent car park (€6 per night). Close to Dublin Airport and ideal for accessing the North.,3,2013,11,15
250,yet another stay,just returned from another trade show at the crowne plaza  northwood  firstly we are collected by courtesy bus   when we got to the hotel we are greeted by happy friendly staff  who recognise me and my colleagues  we are dealt with at once and given our rooms   we were asked on a regular basis if everything was  ok and did we need anything  the food and beverage manager paul was so good   you would of thought that we were famous  the way we were treated   over the 5 days we have been at the hotel doing our trade show  I would  say the service was definitely 5 star   even down to me coming down on the first morning and the waiter remembering from my last stay that I liked  a cappuccino  and poached eggs   all the other people that were with us doing the show have already told me that  they wouldn't consider doing a show anywhere else   so we will be returning next year to do another 3 shows    so all I can say is a big thanks to  all the staff and management   I also use this hotel  when I am travelling  around Ireland,5,2013,11,13
250,Concert weekend,"Stayed here Friday night.Arrived 3 ish,parking fine,easy check in.Nice room, very comfortable.Only 15 minutes from city,very handy.Excellent breakfast,a very pleasant stay all things considered.parking next door between it and holiday inn,plenty of room.",4,2013,11,13
250,Excellent weekend at the Crowne Plaza,"We stayed here for a weekend in November as a base to attend 2 concerts in the City. This is my 2nd stay in the Northwood Crowne Plaza - very impressed with our room on the Club floor - spacious, spotlessly clean, great shower & very comfortable. Club lounge was very pleasant to relax/read. Staff very friendly especially (Beth?) at reception who remembered our names and couldnt have been more helpful. Breakfast was excellent - all in our party were happy with the quality of what was on offer. Foyer area pleasant to relax in - we also ate as 2 couples in Touzai restaurant - had early bird - food was generally very good. Hotel located in a nice area beside park etc - hence quiet at night. Taxi was 15 mins to city centre and 20-25 Euro. All in all very good and would come back again.",5,2013,11,10
250,"""Good Hotel .... Very helpful staff""",Stayed for one night recently. Problem with my booking which was completely my fault was very quickly sorted out by the manager. Lovely spacious corner room with nice bathroom. Restaurant was fully booked that  evening so we dined in the bar and this worked out well. Breakfast was buffet style with a great selection of hot and cold food. Would certainly recommend this hotel !!!,5,2013,11,05
250,Good first experience,First time staying here-it was close to where I needed to be for business not sure if I would stay here if I wanted to be in the City but it is an option for the airport and its just off the M50-bar food was good-good service and the room was very nice so for me it's an option in Dublin I hadn't used before-Rebel Yell!,4,2013,11,05
250,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed one night as was in Dublin on business, and found the Crowne Plaza to be a fantastic place to stay.
The hotel was beautiful and about a 10 minute shuttle bus ride from the airport. A cab into the centre took about 15 minutes, so the hotel is in a great location.
The room was lovely, and the bed super comfortable!.
Breakfast was very nice indeed, and all staff were exceptionally helpful and polite.
All in all, would recommend and would happily stay there again next time I am in Dublin.",5,2013,11,05
250,Airport Hotel,"We chose this hotel for convenience in getting to the airport for an early international flight.  The front desk agent Beth was extremely gracious and helpful. She upgraded us to the concierge level but of course it was closed at that time of day. We ate in the bar and the food was average in quality.  No problems with the service there.  The rooms are extremely tight and decorated nicely.  Our big issue was the lack of sound proofing.  We could here the folks in the next room talking and moving around. All the doors to the rooms slammed very loudly if you did not close them carefully .Does not make for a good nights sleep. The shuttle bus was on time and the driver very helpful with our luggage.
If a hotel close to the Dublin airport to catch a flight is your mission this hotel delivers. We were glad only to be staying there for one night.",3,2013,11,03
250,Dublin crowne plaza,"I frequently use the crowne plaza in north wood, Dublin for business purposes and have yet to have had any major problems.  The rooms are clean, the staff has always been pleasant and helpful, and the food is good.  It's a short shuttle (free) from the airport and walking distance from the bus stop, which you can pretty much take anywhere around Dublin.",4,2013,11,03
250,Charity ball,Never stayed in the hotel but did go for the evening for a charity ball. Lovely champagne reception. The bar area is nice and big with doors into the left for dinner. After dinner the wall is opened up and the dinning area and bar become one. Lots of staff around serving the group. 3 course dinner. Soup with lovely varieties of bread. Tomato bread. Nom nom. Chicken for main serves on mash with veg and a lovely sauce. Main was white choc mouse. I was too full at this point to really enjoy it. Danced the night away! Great night,4,2013,11,03
250,Nice food if you can tolerate noise,"Never stayed in this hotel so can only comment on bar food and service. We have come to this hotel many times for food and a few drinks due to its location. The menu has a vast selection of good food that caters for all tastes. From Indian, Asian, Italian and your usual burgers and steaks. I have never been disappointed with my meals nor the service we received. My only complaint would be the deafening noise the staff, including management make when they are throwing or slamming glass bottles into the bin behind the bar. When you are trying to relax, enjoy your food and conversation, it is very annoying and frustrating. We tried different sections of the bar each time we arrived to avoid this noise that happens every few minutes but unfortunately there was no escape. The only place to avoid this is to sit out in the reception. The last few occasions we rushed our food just to get out and breath a sigh of relief. Such a shame as the food never disappointed us but the noise would be a huge factor for us to think twice about returning. If your nerves are willing  to put up with this and you just want to eat and go, you won't be disappointed. If it's a relaxing environment and conversation you are after...eat in the reception or avoid.",3,2013,11,01
250,Better Hotels around for cheaper,"This hotel tries too hard. My room was spacious but dark. My television didn't work- the last thing I need on a business trip!
Bar and Bar food was good but typical of Dublin Hotel Prices- a Rip off!
I didn't use the fitness facilities so I cannot comment.",3,2013,10,29
250,"Parked, Slept & Flew","We chose this hotel because it's close to Dublin airport and we had an early flight the next morning - they do a park and fly deal which was excellent value for money.

The room was nicely furnished, a comfortable bed and a good bathroom.  All mod cons were available, Wifi, tea/coffee, A/C etc and included in the price.

There is lively bar area although we didn't use it and we didn't have breakfast as we were leaving at 5am.

The staff were very courteous at every point - upon arrival, a pleasant wake up caller, an efficient checkout, a helping hand with our luggage onto the shuttle bus.

The shuttle bus takes only 5-10 minutes to get to the airport and drops off right outside the terminal.  Zone 14 is where you pick up the shuttle for the return journey, the hotel staff were quick to get my parking ticket validated when we were leaving.

Overall a very nice hotel that I would stay in again.",5,2013,10,28
250,Last Night in Dublin,"We selected this hotel due to its proximity to the airport.  Unfortunately, the airport shuttle was not available to us as we had to leave for the airport before 5 a.m.   It would have been good if this was listed on the hotel's web site.

The hotel is in a great location, the front desk staff provided excellent customer service, the rooms are clean and well-appointed and we had a good meal in the pub in the lobby.   All in all, it was a great end to a wonderful visit to Ireland.",4,2013,10,21
250,Good for Dublin airport; good for Dublin city,"We stayed overnight before flying from Dublin airport the next day. The rooms are comfortable with aircon, modern, with bathrooms (shower and bath) and a bed to get a good night's sleep in. There is room service; a mini bar and kettle with tea/coffee making facilities. Staff throughout were great. We ate in the restaurant. There's an early bird option, a dine for two with wine option and a la carte. A confusion is the price advertised in the lift for two dining. It is €10 less than the restaurant actually charges for it! The early bird meal was fine - reasonably priced, as was the wine. There is a shuttle to the airport if needed. There is also a multi storey car park at €6 per night for those wishing to leave their car. All in all very reasonable standard for everything one might expect from a Crowne Plaza. This was my second visit.",4,2013,10,18
250,Great stay at airport,"This hotel is only about a 10-15 min straight shot south of the airport, depending on traffic at the time. It would have been great to be within walking distance like the Clarion and Radisson but the reviews were so off-putting, I decided on comfort over convenience. And I'm glad I did that. 

The shuttle (from zone 14) runs every 30 mins and was right on time. We ate dinner in the bar the night before we left. The soup and salad (lettuce -- which one doesn't always get in a salad overseas) was exactly what we needed.  The bed was SUPER comfortable, the room was quiet, with thermostat control, and very clean. Good wifi. A tub and a separate shower were nice additions. Great offerings for breakfast. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. A good deal for the price, I feel. If I return, I will stay there.",5,2013,10,13
250,"Great Staff, Good location","We stayed here for 2 nights before we left Ireland for home.  The hotel was good, and the staff was very helpful.  The Vice manager went out of his way to make sure our stay was comfortable by upgrading my room. This hotel is a short bus or taxi ride to downtown Dublin.  Taxi cost was about $20 Euro.   We ate dinner here one night in the bar area.  The food was extremely good and the service was great.  Good shuttle to the airport.",5,2013,10,06
250,Convenience combined with Excellence,"Stayed in the Crowne Plaze after a days business related training in Dublin, was very convenient, near the airport, needed this the next days business related travel....

They offered a complementary shuttle bus service to the airport and there was an excellent flight and park deal, so I left my car there for the week.

I was greeted by very friendly reception staff, who to my delight informed me that I had been given a complimentary upgraded from a standard to an executive room including breakfast. The room was amazing, included, a fully stocked mini-bar, 

The food in the bar downstairs was delicious, would definitely recommend this hotel, if staying in Dublin before/after a flight.",5,2013,10,06
250,Bar Food: stay to the less expensive items.,"The low-end bar food (e.g., wraps, fish and chips) are decent.  Don't expect the higher-end food (e.g., rib eye steak) to be either good or a wait staff concerned if it is not.  We ordered 8 oz. two rib eye steaks, medium rare, on the assurance by the waiter that these were really good.  Both proved to be both tough and way overlook (well done).  The matter was called to the attention of the wait staff who admitted the steaks were over cooked.  The wait staff said they were sorry and offered complimentary coffee to compensate.  I suspect they would do the same for any of their menu items.  We paid the full bill and suggest that the less expensive items they offer may be better options, or take a taxi somewhere else.",2,2013,10,06
250,Excellent staff!,"I booked one of the suites here as part of our honeymoon celebrations and sadly did encounter a couple of issues which threatened to take the gloss off the occasion. However, the way in which this was dealt with by the staff has turned this review from a mediocre 2-3 star into a 5 star one.

Along with a couple of other things, we had an issue with the hot water. Despite the fact that there was no dedicated maintenance team on site at the time, the concierge and manager on duty did everything they could to fix the problem and gave it their full attention. When the problem proved to be beyond their area of expertise, they didn't just shy away and shrug their shoulders - another room was found so that we could adequately refresh ourselves the next morning. Although it wasn't really ideal having staff members coming in and out of the room on the first night of our honeymoon to test the water, we did appreciate the effort the staff put in to resolving the problem, and we found them to be polite, courteous and apologetic.

When we went down the next morning, we found that the issue had been properly passed on to the next shift and the new manager on duty was fully aware of the issues we had encountered, and was ready prepared with a meaningful apology and an offer of compensation, recognising the importance of the occasion to us. I hadn't requested this, nor was I expecting it so it was very welcome.
I fully understand that you do sometimes experience problems in hotels, but the way in which we were dealt with is what separates this team from many others. I left the hotel that morning feeling valued as a guest, instead of being disgruntled and never to return.

We returned the following weekend and were met with a very warm welcome, and thankfully didn't encounter any more issues during our visit. The room was lovely and very clean and comfortable, a lot of credit should go to the housekeeping staff. We stayed on the Club floor and the addition of the Club lounge, with it's complimentary drinks was a very nice little added bonus.

The restaurant, Touzai, was one of the best places we have eaten in for a long time. The food was very well prepared and presented and was delicious, and the service was absolutely fantastic. We also had breakfast here and did enjoy it, although I must be honest and say I wasn't too keen on the mushrooms (they had a funny taste), and I would have liked to have had some baked beans to go with the other items.

The front desk team were not just knowledgeable about the local area, they were enthusiastic and were happy to recommend ideas and places to visit. Their in-house produced local guide with information on bus numbers and fares was extremely useful and a nice little touch.

The free Wifi was of a good speed and easy to connect to. The free shuttle bus was very useful too, and one of the main reasons I booked this hotel.

Overall, this hotel is very well designed and has beautiful decor and surroundings (we especially liked the large fish tank in reception), but it is the service from the staff that really makes this a hotel worth staying at and we will definitely return.",5,2013,10,05
250,A Night to remember,"Myself and my girlfriend, along with many other members of our college had our academic ball in the Crowne Plaza and we thought it best to stay the night as well. The staff were very helpful and the place was kept in pristine condition. The location of it was ideal as it was secluded away from noisy traffic, and not too isolated from Omni shopping centre or the main bus route into town. Despite being located beside the airport there was little or no disturbance from air traffic (so long as the windows were kept shut), and even though it may have been a bit of a buzz kill, the hotel security were on top form after the ball ended to make sure noise and disruption were kept to a minimum. The food we sampled there was delicious and the hotel rooms were magnificent (despite a dysfunctional iron in my room which I was in dire need of to iron my shirt!). The only thing I would have to criticise is that the service at the bar, both on the night of the ball and the morning after was rather slow (Maybe it was due to the fact that we were students?!). Apart from that I left a satisfied customer with a definite intention of returning, be it for another academic ball (which I would highly recommend to anyone to book the Crowne Plaza), leisure, a romantic getaway (the surrounding area seemed beautiful) or a pit stop for overnight accommodation (especially if travelling to/from the airport - the hotel has its own shuttle bus service.

Just a note to travellers; this hotel does have access to the city centre but is located a distance out from it. There is a bus that goes to and from the city to quite near the hotel and you can also drive in. Walking really isn't an option. More suited to travellers of a more sedentary disposition with a lack of fondness for visiting the city centre. Ideal for those looking for an overnight stay before a long flight, not however for those wanting a quick walk into the city centre.",4,2013,10,04
250,Served its purpose,"Stayed here overnight before boarding our plane. There is a courtesy bus that goes to the airport but we did not use this. We did use parking facilities which were in a building past the Holiday Inn next door. This was the only hotel in Ireland we stayed in, where we had to pay for parking. The decor was very modern giving it the feel of a business hotel. Bathroom had shower and bath and was very clean. Also had room safe and good airconditioning. Did not try the breakfast as we left very early morning.",3,2013,10,04
250,Great Hotel with Great Staff,"A very quiet hotel even when busy, really great frendly staff which made the stay more enjoyable. Bedrooms are very comfortable and clean with nice big beds, althoiugh I did find the bed on the hard side, good size bathroom with hot shower. Ideal for a stay close to the airport with a free shuttle bus",4,2013,10,02
250,Extension Stay,"A one night stay for a wedding... The noise was so bad in the room because of a defective air conditioner the socket power had to be switched off completely.....This problem was reported at about 8pm. At 1am nothing had been done despite a promise from Reception staff. When reported AGAIN at 1am the duty manager took personal responsibility and did what he could. No alternate room was available per the staff so a string of extension leads were connected from the adjoining room to provide power..... 
The bar is expensive.
The staff in general are friendly and efficient.
The food was well presented and tasty.
The room was well supplied with soaps, repair kit, tea/coffee maker.
The hotel is quite isolated from any worthwhile local attractions but is well appointed and suitable for a quiet stay. The is a very spacious park directly in front of the hotel.
The is a multi-storey car park attached to the hotel.

No good will offer was made by the hotel in respect of their inability to provide a service paid for....",3,2013,10,01
250,STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE,"We booked on line and prepaid. For that we got NOTHING! No breakfast, no parking but we did get the opportunity to pay more! On line, when I first checked 8-2013 it was 92.5 Euros for a king bed, breakfast. Then the cookies kicked in and it went to 99.5 euros. I booked thinking the price was going up more. That was on 8-10-2013. On the 24th I went back to the site, rooms are now back to 92.5. They say if you find our rooms cheaper anywhere else, let us k now. I did. No email back but I took the printed sheet from the 24th with me. All I wanted from them was to comp the parking- 6Euros/day -but noooo... So when I asked for our breakfast tickets... Oh you don't get that with prepaid. OH??? not what the website had said. So now we are having a big discussion as in get me the manager with a guy who barely spoke English.  His decision was to give us the parking and a 'magnificent' room on the 4th floor which is the club floor and we can have drinks there and snack as well as breakfast. Well the wine and beer were ok. The snacks scant and pitiful. Breakfast was hardly existent. At 8:30 only 2 very small packaged type Danish and I croissant with some cereal and juice. This is how you treat your best customer????? Go next door to the H.I.E. They have a good breakfast, scales to weigh your luggage and people who wanted to help us. DO NOT PREPAY. IT GETS YOU NOTHING!
Our room was a King but we had more room in most of the B&B's we stayed in. Having a shower and tub was nice. But someone could have told us- hello desk clerk - we had to put one of the room keys into a slot if we wanted lights. It is short on space and amenities.",3,2013,10,01
250,Excellent Business Hotel,"We stayed here on vacation because we used PC points for the room. The location is a bit of a cab ride from the city center however I am glad we stayed here, The staff was highly professional and the rooms were extremely clean and well appointed. Great service, good food from room service and a very very comfortable bed. Close to the airport with a convenient shuttle.",5,2013,09,29
250,"Great location, close to airport.","Shuttle from and to airport. Park setting in front of hotel. Clean grounds. Clean hotel, except spots of mold in bathroom tiles. Bed was not that comfortable, no selection in pillows, stiff pillows. Food was average. Full bar. Overall Average",3,2013,09,29
250,For business travellers,"This hotel is well-located, not too far from airport and DCU, and opposite a green park. Although it does not have much character, it is a good place to stay for business travelers.  I enjoyed a comfortable room, well–equipped with coffee maker, iron, pants press etc., and fast Internet. The bed was good, bathroom fine, breakfast OK. A hotel that has everything, including ""musac"" and a TV that requires careful navigation not to end up in special  entertainment.",4,2013,09,23
250,"Great location for the weary, tired, jet lagged traveller - but give the restaurant a miss.","Ideal for the end of our 36 hour journey before moving on to friends in Waterford. Easy Internet booking, good reception staff, room adequate size and clean. But dinner in the restaurant was very poor. Drink ordered and didn't come, food either burnt or stodgy. We were dreading breakfast the next day but it was good. Try somewhere else if you want a decent evening meal. ",3,2013,09,22
250,Always Superb,"Every time I go to this hotel, all my worries are quickly demolished. The hotel is pure 5* class from start to finish. Not one bad thing to say about this hotel. Great friendly staff and beautiful rooms.",5,2013,09,22
250,Not so impressed this time round.,I have previously rated this hotel very highly but on my recent visit I was very disappointed. I had booked a double family room. The room was not as big as I expected. There were not enough towels in the bathroom. I would have expected more towels since it was a family room. I had requested late checkout and put a do not disturb sign on the door but none of their staff seemed to know this or took notice of the do not disturb sign as the knocks were constant. We left earlier than intended as it was difficult to get back to sleep after the repeated disturbances. The ice machine on the second floor was broken therefore we had to go to the first floor to get some ice. The beds and pillows were comfortable enough. Had to ask for extra pillows though as there was only one per person. Sorry to say I was not impressed this time round. Trying to find another nice hotel in Dublin as I spend most of my weekends in this city.,3,2013,09,22
250,Cinnabar food is dreadful and over-priced,"I had the misfortune of dining in Cinnabar on Saturday 14th September 2013 with my mother.  I ordered the chilli chicken wrap which was so plain and basic that I couldn't believe the main bar in a 4 star hotel had prepared it.  It was served with a ""salad"" which consisted of some dried out lettuce leaves surrounded by dried out cucumber with absolutely no dressing, and also some nacho chips.  To try and add some flavour myself I ordered garlic sauce and was shocked to be told by the waitress (who was actually quite rude about the whole thing) that this would be an additional €0.90 (I was actually charged €1.00 on the bill).  My mother ordered the 'fish & chips' item on the menu and this also left a lot to be desired from a 4 star hotel.  The price we paid for the misfortune of dining in Cinnabar was exhorbitant.  Our bill came to €45.25 which included 2 glasses of wine and one glass of orange juice.  The standards in food in this bar are dreadful if my experience is anything to go by, and I would urge caution to any other patrons who are considering dining there.",1,2013,09,16
250,"Great Staff, Very Comfortable Room, Excellent Food","This was a wonderful place to stay, very very comfortable, very lovely bathtub and all facilities were of the highest standard. The dining options were suitable for any taste, from traditional fare to everyday continental tastes, It was the only place I stayed where I could get Kippers for breakfast - delishious!
Highly recomend the fourth floor experience :)",5,2013,09,15
250,good business hotel,"It's a good hotel, way out of town, near to the airport but it is on the main bus route (€2.40) or a €18 taxi. Service was great and the bar is lively and serves good bar food. I was upgraded to the Club Floor which was nice. Everything you could want in the room and access to the Club Lounge",4,2013,09,13
250,Alwor-Dub,"We just stayed the one night,layover after a long flight. The bus airport shuttle was perfect.The beds are very comfortable, had a great nights sleep and no jet-lag. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only complaint was our air con did not work and was very uncomfortable in the morning, did not know until too late to change rooms. We had dinner in the bar , but had to wait quite awhile for food and service. The food was really good though. Would stay here again.

Very clean and nice decor.",4,2013,09,12
250,Good family city break hotel.,Very close to airport with half hourly shuttle bus.  Approximately a EUR20 taxi fare into downtown Dublin. Free WiFi through out hotel plus a cable ethernet in room as well.  Cinnabar food was very good and suitable for children.,4,2013,09,09
250,More than an airport hotel,"Another very good Crown Plaza Hotel experience. This hotel should not be used just as an airport hotel but a hotel for Dublin in its own right
Great parking, lovely rooms, vibrant bar, great restaurant serving Asian and Irish dishes, efficient and friendly staff and an excellent House Merlot by the glass
Free wifi everywhere which, when on business, is a must
Good value too",4,2013,09,05
250,Lovely location - Great Staff,"Arrived at the hotel in appalling weather, I was absolutely soaked and although it was too early to check into my room, the reception staff gave me an access key card to the gym & shower facilities which meant I could shower, dry out & change - I was really grateful to the staff who used their initiative & gave terrific service. The hotel is conveniently close to the airport & a free half hourly shuttle is offered, the restaurant & bar offers a good selection of fayre & the rooms are really well appointed. The city is a short bus ride away, with the nearest stop at the end of the road (100m). A good all round convenient quality hotel & location.",4,2013,09,05
250,A Crown Plaza - up to standards you'd expect,"We stayed here twice - beginning and ending our Irish 15 day drive trip.  We chose this CP because of its easy access to DUB airport with free shuttle (friendly and helpful drivers) to and from.  The trip to town, was a 15 minute public bus ride (2.4 euros each) and an $18 Euro taxi back after an evening in Temple Bar.
The Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and the in house food was good but a bit pricy.  Ask the staff, they pull out custom maps for bus service and other local sites in Dublin.  And they share favorites.",4,2013,09,05
250,Good Airport Hotel,"We drove back from Killarney and spent the night before flying back to the US.

Hotel is not spectacular but very nice and very clean. If you are driving there and dropping off rental car in the AM print out directions because it can be a little confusing.

We did not try the Asian restaurant but ate in he pub which was upbeat and had a good selection of pub food and draft beers as well as friendly attentive servers .

The staff were very nice. The shuttle in the AM was very efficient. They make a reservation (when you check in)to assure they have a large enough one and it left on time and takes about 10 minutes. If you tell the driver you are flying international he will drop you of at that terminal rather than taking you to the regular drop off in a designated area in parking which is closer to the domestic terminal and a bit of a walk to the international terminal. The pick up is from the area within parking by the domestic terminal - this is controlled by the airport rules.",4,2013,09,03
250,Hit and miss,Stayed here before on a number of occasions and it was good. Stayed last thursday nightand the aircon rattled during the night. Reported it at checkout but didn't get either an apology or a response. Avoid  room #251.,3,2013,09,03
250,Absolutely loved this location,"I was there overnight after a long-haul slog from Seattle to Dublin, via Chicago. I chose this particular location because it is directly across from a beautiful wild ""demesne,"" otherwise known as a rambling park, replete with swans, ducks, greensward, trees, and, most importantly, fresh air and walking paths. However, the hotel itself was absolutely great for the first night when you're suffering from jet lag. Comfortable big bed, spacious room, spacious shower/bathroom; air conditioning (crucial, since the weather is still quite warm); the biggest, most complete breakfast spread I think I've ever seen, wherein every food I could think of was available. A bonus is the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel (which Dublin airport has turned into a bit of a debacle, since the coaches are located a bit of a hike away from the airport doors, but you need the exercise and fresh air after the planes, right?). Then, I needed the shuttle again the next day to get back to the airport so I could catch the Citylink bus down to Galway, and that worked out beautifully. Efficient staff, room service from their excellent restaurant downstairs. I had a chicken and thyme salad large enough for two people. Food was very fresh. There's a Holiday Inn Express directly next door, but I noticed from the reviews that people who stay here use the restaurant of the Crowne Plaza, since you are about 10 minutes by bus away from the airport, and then further removed from any other locations, so it's a bit isolated down this street unless you have a car. However, I loved everything about this hotel and would most definitely stay there again; it is perfect in many ways, especially, from my perspective, to provide a buffer for a long day of travel.",5,2013,08,29
250,good quality hotel,"Stayed here in July this year for a business conference and was very pleasantly surprised at the standard  of the hotel. The rooms were very nicely decorated and comfortable. Food exceptional at the Asian restaurant in house. Staff very friendly and helpful. 

Location of hotel is outside of the city but a short taxi ride takes you into the center of Dublin. Taxi cost us around 15 euros one way. Opposite the hotel is a beautiful park with nice walking/running routes.",4,2013,08,27
250,Good airport hotel,"I had a fairly early flight home and didn't want the hassle of getting from downtown to the airport early in the morning.  This hotel was perfect for that.  Close to the airport with a shuttle.  Good breakfast.  Nice room.  Nice bar.  Friendly service.  If you're starting your vacation, get away from the airport.  If you're headed home, this is a great choice.",4,2013,08,22
250,"Fab hotel, if you're going to airport !!",Faultless. Spotless room. Quiet. Pretty park opposite if you want a walk. Didn't park car there but might be an issue ! Free courtesy bus to airport. Spectacular breakfast. Ate a lot every morning as food in Dublin so expensive. White pudding fab. Ditto waffles and pancakes. Staff helpful. One or two of the Eastern European waiters look like gangsters though!! Only drawback is location. Fine for airport .. Lousy for Dublin. 30 min bus ride. Bus stop 400m away. £2.40 fare. To o Connell st. Makes it difficult to enjoy Dublin as you can't walk to hotel. Find hotel in town centre eg jury's inn. Otherwise fully recommended. ,5,2013,08,19
250,to eat or not!!,"A typical 4 star hotel good but no more than one should expect from a 4 star. shuttle every 30 mins, reception good, rooms OK, however the small quilt kept slipping off due to its small size.
 The bar was great with lots of TV screens, the food for PUB food was good even though with extra protions of blue bottle fly which was delt with. The restaurant is pants, its a Asian - European type fusion. noodles like rubber, Wok cooked veg like mush. if you like Asian please avoid and stay in the bar. Again when its busy the service is wanting as there are not enough staff in the bar/ lounge areas.",3,2013,08,16
250,Outstanding. We'll stay again!,"We stopped over in Dublin for 2 nights before hopping on a cruise in Southhampton. It was our first visit to Ireland. My husband chose this hotel because we had an early flight out, the price was right, and it turned out to be an outstanding choice.

The hotel is situated in a park-like setting in a residential area. The good-sized, modern room & bath was great. Not your typical tiny European space. Didn't need converters for our American electronic devices.

The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. We ate dinner in the restaurant the first nite, excellent! The breakfast menu and buffet were also exactly what we wanted. Prices were very reasonable, and the staff was knowledgeable about gluten-free issues.

The decor of the hotel was high end; the bar looked like it was a happening place to hang out. But we had only 2 days for sightseeing, and the front desk staff helped us make the most of it. A pleasant 5 min walk to the bus stop, where the buses took 20-30 mins to get into the center of Dublin.

Though outside the city, this hotel is a real find. We will definitely stay there again on our next trip. If you want a restaurant option close by, there is a great Asian place called Mandalay just a block away.",5,2013,08,11
250,Very Good Hotel Outside the City,"The hotel is located only a short drive of around 10 minutes from the airport and adjacent to a business park making it very convenient for persons doing business in the area. Although it is a few kilometers outside of the city access into the city centre is extremely easy by the public bus service from a stop a few minutes walk from the hotel. Buses run frequently and the trip into the centre takes 20 to 30 minutes depending upon the route followed.

Immediately across the road from the hotel is a large park well maintained with very pleasant walkways which provides a pleasant relief after a day in the city.

The hotel is well appointed with a large lobby well furnished lobby. Checking in was smooth and efficient, the staff had all our details prepared, we received an upgrade and the room was available. The room itself was very nice with a good bathroom and comfortable bed.  We experienced no noise from outside the room either day or night. The cleaning staff were very prompt each day and maintained the room very well.

There is a pleasant restaurant and a separate bar each accessible off the lobby. The buffet breakfast was very good with a full range of both hot and cold dishes offered as well as fruit, pastries and juices. The bar has a very convivial atmosphere with a more than adequate menu was well patronized by the guests and is a great spot to relax at the end of the day.

The staff were very friendly and helpful whenever we needed assistance. The hotel provides a free airport shuttle bus service which runs to and from the airport on a regular schedule.

A very good hotel and conveniently located provided you don't mind staying outside of the city itself",4,2013,08,09
250,Fabulous Find - Loved It! Highly Recommend!,"5 stars for this wonderful one night stay! I chose this hotel mainly because of the positive reviews and the large park adjacent to the property. Shuttle service was comfortable and pleasant, check-in was friendly and efficient, the room was absolutely beautiful, and the buffet breakfast was amazing with so much to chose from. The staff was exceptionally professional and kind; the room wonderfully decorated and outfitted and included a luxurious bath with separate tub and shower. It was absolutely the cleanest room I have ever stayed in. The sumptuous breakfast had at least 10 hot foods to choose from, omelet station, cereals, meats, cheeses, baked goods, juices, fruit, yogurt, and many hot drink choice -- it was perfect. Cannot recommend the hotel enough and the park across the street is perfect for strolls which are needed after many hours on a plane or before a long plane flight. Cannot wait to stay here again!",5,2013,08,06
250,Delighted to be upgraded!,"We were booked into a family room at holiday inn next door, but due to over booking we were sent next door to crowne plaza. The bedding configuration was much better, with 2 huge queen beds (rather than a queen and a sofa bed at the HI). Much appreciated after a 24hr flight!  Check in was swift and friendly.  Pretty good shower by irish standards, room was very large great for a family with small children. Free shuttle bus is a great service.  We were impressed with breakfast, the choice of food was wide, and we didn't have any issue with temperature of presentation of food, it was quite delicious! Keeping in mind that we had only paid about 99eu for the room(for 4 people, inclusive of breakfast), I wasn't expecting the Ritz with a gourmet degustation breakfast menu!!!!!  What we got was a wonderful night's sleep and a satisfying, delicious start to the next day.",4,2013,08,04
250,Unfortunate Upgrade,"We booked in to the Holiday Inn beside Crown Plaza Northwood but we were ""upgraded"" to the Crown Plaza due to the Holiday Inn being overbooked.
While the hotel itself is clean and modern, our stay was spoiled by an awful breakfast.
While buffet breakfasts in hotels are seldom fine dining experiences, the breakfast put on by the Crown Plaza this morning was truly woeful.
Burnt sausages, leather rashers, rubber eggs and all stone cold. .. and this was at 7.30am !!!
Will definitely stay at the Holiday Inn again , but won't be taking any more alleged upgrades to it's pricier neighbour",3,2013,07,28
250,Touzai restaurant,"I was actually staying at the next door Holiday Inn Express and having just arrived wanted some great Irish food. I wandered into Touzai to be told it only served Asian fusion food ""what"" I said ""what about some Irish food as I live in Asia"". As it was too late to go down town I had a good look at the menu and did discover that in amongst their Asian fusion they did serve Irish smoked salmon and fillet steak which I ordered. The smoked salmon was excellent and not a bit like the spongy stuff we here get in Asia. The fillet steak which was served with green beans and watercress was cooked to perfection and washed down with a half bottle of Beaujolais Village 2011. All excellent but I cannot understand why this hotel which seemed to be catering mainly to tourists would have an Asian fusion restaurant when fresh Irish food is so great!",4,2013,07,28
250,Restaurant is a must,"I was taken to this hotel for dinner on a recent trip to Dublin.  The Touzai restauant is one of Dublins best kept secrets.  The east meets west style menu is refreshing and superbly balanced fresh food, and flavours blew me away.  I can't remeber the name for my starter-  beautifully cooked pork dumplings with a dipping sauce are a must.  In contrast, pudding was a fantastic perfectly cooked creme brulee.

Waitng staff were poite, and had that great art of being there when required, but leaving the diners in peace.  This is the art of a great waiter, and is sadly lost in many modern restaurants.

 On the way out I visited the Powder Room -  spotless, and fresh, and the best bit a seperate make up mirror and shelf so my bag did not get wet from balancing on the sink area.

All staff were friendly and made me feel special- will certainly be back.",5,2013,07,25
250,Outstanding hotel,We stayed here the night before we flew back to the U.S. the rooms we beautifully done and the first night we had had air conditioning in 4 days! We got a much needed rest before flying home. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast the next morning was incredibly tasty!,4,2013,07,20
250,Hotel - didn't use.......the bar food.......not worth the price or service,"Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door.  Was told by the front desk at the H.I.E that they had food at the Crowne Plaza.  Decided to try the bar foor as the menu at the other restaurant in the hotel wasn't to my liking.  
  I entered thebar and stood at the main door near the waitress station for about 5 minutes. No one paid any attention to me standing there. I eventually had to ask a waitress if i could see a menu.  Only then did she say that it was seat yourself! 
  I sat down at my table, looked at the menu and was ready to order.  I closed my menu and waited......... about 10-12 minutes later, the waitress finally came to the table. I ordered a steak panini sandwich (around 20-21 Euro..came with a small salad and a handful of fries). The sandwich came out and it was cooked perfectly (medium rare). I took my first bite, and it was good, really good.  But.....3 different times during the course of eating my sandwich, i had to take it out of my mouth, put it down on my plate, and cut with my knife.  It was that tough!! Probably one of the top 3 toughest steak sandwiches i've ever had in my life(i'm 46)!!  If i were older and had dentures, they would have pulled out of my mouth !!
  I finished my meal and was ready for desert. So i waited, and waited, and waited. No go......nothing.  A waiter happened to walk by me and could see i was waiting.  He asked if i needed anything.  I told him that i would like to see the desert menu.  He got me the menu and took my order.  The cake came out and it was great !  But, 15 minutes to go get a pc. of cake..........really??  
I was done and ready to pay.  Then.......can you guess ??  Waited and nothing.......I had to flag down the waitress and ask for my bill !  Total price was around 33 euro not including tip!!! 
Total time for this meal........about 1 hour and 15 minutes !!!!!!!",2,2013,07,17
250,A weekend trip spoiled by a poor welcome,"My husband & I travelled to Dublin for an informal university reunion & to visit relatives. We chose the Crowne Plaza Northwood due to its convenience for both these purposes & based on a previous visit by myself to this hotel for work last year.  We arrived at half seven in the evening after a three hour drive in very hot weather, only to be informed that no rooms were currently ready & it would be a 30 minute - 1 hour wait.  The attitude of reception staff was decidedly poor & a request to speak to the duty manager was side-stepped.  A room was eventually procured for us & we only just made our dinner reservation in a nearby restuarant.
The hotel room was clean & well maintained; breakfast offered a good variety of cereals, continental choices & hot food; we ate in the bar on our second evening - a tasty meal from a decent menu (cold mushy peas served with the fish excepted); staff in all other areas were pleasant & helpful.  A sincere apology was offered by the reception manager on check-out for how we greeted on check-in, which was appreciated but a little late.  A hotel that I had a reasonable regard for has regrettably dipped in my esteem & I doubt I would opt to stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",3,2013,07,17
250,Return visit,We have just returned from another trade show that we run at the crowne plaza we have been doing this show  at the crowne plaza for about 7years and never have any problems  the staff are very friendly and certainly do go out of their way to make us feel very much at home.  Nothing is too much trouble for the management and staff  this time we had other companies showing with us and they too were very impressed  so much so we have all booked our next show  great hotel and staff   Keep up the good work ,5,2013,07,13
250,Its time for rededication to excellence,"I have stayed at this hotel many times in the last ten years.  I have always enjoyed my stay, the restaurants are good.  The guest rooms have been very nice indeed, with a good quiet sleep. The location is excellent in my opinion, close to the Dublin International Airport with a free shuttle and yet a short bus ride from the Dublin City Center.  BUT, there has been a steady decrease in service, cleanness, and overall maintenance standards.  I think the management needs to pay more attention so that they can keep their status as an excellent place to stay while in Dublin.  Right now, they have some work to do.  The Club room is very nice indeed, but on the weekends there is NO service at all, disappointing.",3,2013,07,11
250,Pretty typical Airport Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights at the end of our recent trip to Ireland.  We had some last minute touring we wanted to do North of Dublin so this location worked out rather well.  We had an early flight out and the van service was right on time.  As noted below be sure to reserve space on the shuttle.  This is a busy, business hotel, and the staff is used to working at a fast pace, so don't expect the same level of friendliness you will find in the rest of Ireland.  
We did find it strange that the main hotel restaurant features Thai food.  I really have to wonder who thought that was the right idea for a hotel at the airport in Ireland (or any other city for that matter).  This means we found ourselves eating in the café/pub as their is nowhere to walk or really drive around the hotel.
Set your expectations to an airport hotel anywhere in the world and this will work.",3,2013,07,04
250,Great Airport Hotel!,"There is a shuttle that will pick you up from the airport.  It is a bit of a walk, go to #14, I think.  The shuttle is just for Crowne Plaza and runs every 30 mins.  The hotel is pretty with nice landscaping on the outside.  Check in was fast and the rooms were big, clean and quiet.  The bar area is really nice with a lounge that has a fish tank and couches, or the bar itself with Tv's everywhere showing sports.  There is also an asian fusion restaurant that is good with a few irish favorites on the menu as well.  The hotel will give you a wake up call.   They have air conditioning and free wi-fi ,also, ice buckets (which are rare in ireland) are in your room.  The bus that takes you to the airport in the morning is really large, so don't worry about them having room for you. They do still drop you off in between terminal 1 and 2 and there is a bit of a walk, 3 mins,  but it is not bad if your luggage has wheels or if you grab one of the luggage carts.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you need to stay near the airport.  We stayed here on our last night before we headed home.  We were able to return our rental car and then we grabbed the hotel shuttle van from the airport.    Worked out nice.",4,2013,07,04
250,Fine hotel,Along with its less glamorous cousin the Holiday Inn Express next door I have stayed in this hotel a number of times. It is more up market than the Holiday Inn and priced that way too. Rooms were fine. Large enough and well appointed. Staff were friendly and obliging. The office centre was a bit of a disappointment however. I have had a few meals in the bar here and they were all excellent. The serving staff were efficient and friendly. One member of staff even recognised me on my return and remembered what I drank. I was impressed. This hotel is well worth a visit. The shuttle bus for the airport is regular and free. Breakfast was good.,4,2013,07,04
250,I've upgraded our rating,"This is at least our fifth stay in this hotel and my fourth review.  Although many of the issues I have had with this hotel are still there, we were very pleased with our room this year.  We stayed for two nights, left for a night for a wedding reception elsewhere and then were able to come back to the same room for a third night.  Thank you to the staff for making this possible.  It was room 241 which is a corner room with three windows that open so one gets a nice cross breeze.  We had two very comfortable queen beds.  The room was huge and the bathroom had a separate tub and shower.  Breakfast was included and was fresh with lots of variety.  My complaints from other years still stand though.  There are not enough drawers or hangers.  I would rather have a dresser than two tub chairs that don't even face the TV.  The duvets are heavy and uncomfortable but the blankets that replace them are a bit tacky.  I am still looking for conditioner and lotion in the bathroom.",4,2013,07,03
250,Fine airport hotel,"We had a reservation at the Holiday Inn next door.  Upon check-in the Holiday Inn informed us that we had been upgraded to the Crowne Plaza next door.  We checked in around 6:30 p.m.  It was quite busy as there was an event nearby.
The Good:  Standard size rooms.  The hotel ""pub"" had good food-American style.  There is a free shuttle to the airport.  Rooms were clean.  They gave us 2 rooms which were basically next door to each other which proved essential since my son was ill.  Housekeeping was very helpful.  We needed a roll away and extra linens and towels.  They were very prompt.
The Bad:  It took awhile to check-in and be sure that we got comparable rooms to what we had reserved next door.  In fairness to the hotel, we didn't have our original reservation with this hotel.  The front desk personnel were not very friendly.  They were helpful if you asked the right questions but did not provide information.  For example, we asked about the free shuttle to the airport in the morning and they told us to just come downstairs at 6:30 a.m.  Later, after reading a review on TripAdvisor about the shuttles being full we went down again and asked if we should/could reserve a space and they said yes they would place our name on the reservation list to be sure they had enough vans.  I don't know why they didn't tell us to put our name on the list the first time we asked.  In the morning, the shuttles were indeed full and they had to call a Taxi to get everyone to the airport on time.  
Bottom Line:  Fine basic hotel near the Dublin airport.  Be sure to leave plenty of time for shuttle.",3,2013,06,29
250,very nice hotel,"its nice to see that the hotel chains are starting to get the internet thing - free wifi in the entire property.  Free airport shuttle - clean, friendly staff.  Food is outstanding.  Whats not to like about this place? its quiet even though its by the airport.  The windows open - this sounds like a minor point but in the US it seems that the hotels have windows which dont open and you have to run the noisy HVAC - I shut it off and enjoyed the nice cool weather - good sleeping weather.  My only minor point is that the check in process seems overly complex.  The hotels in Ireland tend to hire eastern Europe staff who have a hard time with english and staying focused. Once I convinced them I had a reservation and gave them the confirmation number  it was easy. if you stay here make sure you print out your confirmation info and give them your holiday inn priority club number and that makes the hassles and confusion go away.  Other than check in taking to long - especially since it took me 48 hours to get there due to travel delays - my happy factor for blustering about to locate my name and info was pretty low.  I dont know why hotels since they have your credit card info for guarantee cant just be like the rental car companies preferred  programs - show your ID and go... for some reason hotels have to have a ceremony before they can check you in.  In any case - this hotel once you get checked in everything to like nothing to not like.",5,2013,06,27
250,All wanted was to sleep peacefully?,"We stayed here on a Saturday night to fly out very early Sunday morning, as explained to the check in person and also after providing our ICH Platinum Ambassador card, the employee very nicely offered us a drink since there were no rooms currently prepared, so therefore we were asked to wait in a seating area of the hotel. Once the assigned room was ready we were given an automatic upgrade to a Club room. The location of the room was the problem here, there was a rather large event going on that evening in the hotel and it was not a very cleaver idea to put us in a room on the landing floor where the lifts are because around 3-4 am we had people letting off the lift alarms and also generally using the area next to the Club-room and lifts as a after party zone. 

Its a pity that the person arranging our room had not thought to put us down the end of the corridor away from one of the most expected areas of traffic after what we had explained in the beginning of our arrival that we would be leaving very early so a nights sleep is very important for us.",2,2013,06,24
250,Nice hotel close to airport,We stayed for 1 night before an early morning flight. The rooms were modern and clean and quiet. We had a light dinner in the bar which was fine. The airport shuttle ran regularly so there was no dramas getting to the airport on time. An excellent base when flying in or out.,5,2013,06,24
250,Good hotel near the airport,"This feels like a good four star hotel.  The staff was attentive and polite.  The rooms/lifts/restaurant was modern and clean.  The rooms were good quality.

The airport shuttle ran any time you want, like every 20 minutes.  Straight to the airport, not a bunch of stops in between like many shuttles.  Very convenient.

The location was good enough for an airport hotel.  Across the street is a great park with paths and ponds.  

The bus route was about a block away.  The bus was the standard city bus, not super fast.  There is also a shopping complex called the omni about 20 minute walk away.  You can buy all sorts of stuff you might want there.

Was not super amazing, but no real complaints.",5,2013,06,18
250,Very Handy Oasis For Airport,"Stayed here on a couple of occasions recently and like the hotel. It gets very busy with airport trade - both travellers (of the high altitude variety) and flight crew so it pays to book early.

The hotel has a busy bar and restaurant, both of which are a good size but generally busy. Food is good in the bar and recently I treated a family party to dinner in the restaurant and everyone agreed it was excellent - really good!

The rooms are fine - not too big but decent enough for the typical overnight stay. Club lounge is a pleasant oasis far from the madding crowds at the airport. They also offer subsidized car parking and free shuttle buses to and from the airport.

Not sure why it has taken me so long to write a review on this hotel as I use it fairly often - that in itself is a good recommendation and I intend using it as my hotel of choice when needing an overnight to match flights.",4,2013,06,17
250,Good Stay,"Had a one night stay recently after a concert and took advantage of their room + parking ( 3night ) rate of €119 as we were going away for the week-end.
Check in quick and friendly. 
Room was very modern and comfortable and the bed amazing. Decor is really nice.
We had an early start and used the Hotel shuttle to airport which is useful. You need to book this at check in.
We took the bus to the centre of town ( left out of hotel - 5 min walk - number of buses ) trip takes in traffic approx 20 mins . We also got this on return on the Thurs night from city centre , safe walk though the area there are a number of office type buildings and other hotels so not a problem.
I would stay again",4,2013,06,17
250,Our Trip to Ireland,"This a nice hotel close to the Airport and just 20 minutes drive from the city. They provide a shuttle service from/to the airport which was a major convenience. The staff was welcoming and very friendly. The room was clean and spacious. There is an electric convertor build into the wall which was great! AND best of all...free Wi-Fi !! Room service was quick ad very good food.  They give you change for the bus if needed and will call the taxi for you and it was there waiting when needed.
Only complaint was that the pillows were not good. Felt like flat foam rubber and only one/person. Also the soap was not replaced every day so by the last couple days we had none for the shower. But over all a nice stay.. Quiet and pleasant stay.",4,2013,06,16
250,Great staff - great rooms,"I arrived late, close to midnight and there's was a little mix up with my booking but Liam and Chihinga looked after me and solved that problem in no time! Great job! I was working in the hotel the next day and had superb support from all staff. Special thanks to Adrienne, Lisa, Sophie, Marlon, Jay and Marietta. I can highly recommend this place. I'll be back!",5,2013,06,11
250,Best thing about the hotel is its airport shuttle,The hotel is showing some age.  Intermittent mechanical noises in its HVAC system were irritating throughout the night.  The room was relatively small but comfortable.  We could not eat at the restaurant because reservations were required and they were fully booked.  The bar could not seat us until 10:00 p.m.but the food was good.  The hotel is convenient to the airport and the shuttle runs every thirty minutes.  It only takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. Average at best.,3,2013,06,09
250,A good hotel before a flight out,"This hotel is convenient to the Dublin Airport and that's why you stay there. It is minutes away from the airport by the hotel shuttle which works well. Interestingly, the hotel is buried pretty deep into a seemingly large residential apartment neighborhood. I didn't see anything that looked like a shopping or entertainment area on the way in. The hotel is (surprisingly) a modern, fairly upscale hotel with clean and inviting public areas and rooms which are comfortable with all that's necessary to get a really good shower and a good night's sleep after a tiring tour schedule. The hotel is nice. The restaurant/bar area can get a crowd, as you have to understand that it is the local neighborhood watering spot. So if you have a football game going you can expect a 'lively' crowd. The food is hotel food and is average, but filling. The service was accommodating. But, you don't stay here for the food. Cost-wise the hotel was quite reasonable. I'd stay there again.",4,2013,06,07
250,"Great hotel, but a little aged","I only stayed for one night and I wouldn't have minded to stay on for longer, but I was only traveling through Dublin.
The welcome at reception was warm, friendly and helpful. Same at check-out.
The room I had was clean and a very good size. A tiny bit of a disappointment was that I got allocated a room right at the end of the corridor, and I was on crutches due to an injury, so I could have done with a shorter walk. At any other time I would have been delighted with a room far away from the lifts, in that situation it was a bit of an inconvenience though and they could have possibly noticed a thing like that at check-in.
There was a good selection of food for breakfast.
The only other remark I have to make is that the carpets in the corridors leading up to the rooms and in the rooms are  aged, as well as the curtains (in the rooms). The curtain in my room was stained and looked very worn.
It would be a pitty if a lovely hotel like this should start looking run-down and tatty. I hope they give it a bit of a make-over soon.
Other than that, i would probably return there.",4,2013,06,07
250,Excellent all round VFM,"Stayed in the Crowne Plaza prior to morning flight to US check in was friendly and efficient.  Room was well set out, clean and comfortable.  A meal at the Bar was very tasty and well priced, Guinness was of excellent quality. I printed out my boarding cards in the hotel business centre, unfortunately the printer was broken however I reported this to the reception who printed the cards as requested without any hassle. The following morning the complimentry bus service to the Airport was on time, the coach was well equipped.  I also booked my car in fort the duration of my trip I booked through Parksmart which turned out to be very reasonable.  I initially tried to book into the Berkly Hotel at Dublin Airport which I would normally use however it waas fully booked due to the Hienekan Cup Rugby final the Crowne Plaza was an untried alternative.  As a result of this stay I will be using the Crowne Plaza for my future pre Airport travel needs.",5,2013,06,06
250,Great hotel for early morning flight,"We stayed here to catch the early morning flight. Booked a park and stay package.

Location was lovely as you could walk around the park or up to spar pass the apartments. The location remind me very much like Canada and Florida residential areas.

Room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable. Great to have a separate shower. Didn't like the black in the decor makes the room small and dark. Great air conditioning 

We ate in the restaurant. Felt not too much choices if you don't like Asian food. Staff friendly and very accommodating. Eating here is not cheap but very good quality .

Bar was very busy as it accommodates the two hotels . Not much difference between the food in the bar and restaurant menus. 

Parking in a multitude storey building beside the holiday inn hotel. 

Shuttle bus was good but the first one is at five in the morning plus have liked half four as there were big queues at terminal 2 which I didn't have time to browse through duty free or have breakfast before the flight

Certainly recommend the hotel but would like an earlier bus shuttle ",4,2013,06,04
250,Minutes from the air port -Excellent place,"Clean, well organized,comfortable will hit this place again no doubt.  The shuttle to and from where perfect despite the hours of arrival and departure. Even the restrung and bar where right there and just what you want.",5,2013,06,03
250,"Comfy Room with Free WIFI, great for overnight close to DUB airport.","Location
Around 10-15 minutes drive from Dublin Airport using the hotel bus service in which operates from the airport 15minutes and 45 minutes past every hour during the day. The hotel is in a business park that has a large green park opposite in which has good walking pathways. There is no shops or anything else nearby other than an italian restaurant near the entrance of the business park. 
Room
Hotel upgraded me to executive room on 1st floor as all other rooms were full. The room was very nice although a little small for executive room. It offered a desk with two chairs (say for a meeting) good amount of plugs and excellent lighting. There is also a comfortable chair with leg rest. The bed was very comfortable, high and up to US standards king size bed with very comfortable pillows. There is also a pull out large flat screen tv which offers a good variety of channels. Modern comfortable decor with some colours. The bathroom was large and included a shower, bath and modern decor with good amount of amenities and towels. Cannot fault the room overall as was very clean, modern and slept very well. 
Facilities
WIFI is free and one of the reasons I choose this hotel, it works well and is fast. There is a large bar downstairs near the lobby which offers a good selection of beverages with many beers on tap. There is also a restaurant but did not use. Had room service in which was a fairly quick and burger was nice. There is also a gym in the building but very small and limited equipment. 
Staff
Staff were nice and friendly, check-in and check-out was smooth. Bar staff and room service were also friendly and helpful.
Overall there is not much to fault with this hotel, although I did get a good deal as got upgraded but overall for a night close to the airport the hotel is decent.",5,2013,06,02
250,"Excellent location, clean rooms, large bathrooms, great service, and scones to die for!","My daughter and I ended up staying here quite by accident. We stayed at Clontarf Castle the first night of our visit in Dublin and ended up having an extra night after our tour, which we hadn't planned on. Since Clontarf didn't have room for us, they set us up with their sister hotel, Crowne Plaza Northwood. The rooms were clean, the bathrooms large (with both a tub and a shower), and they even offered us a complimentary bottle of mineral water, which we used to toast our last night in Dublin. The bus stop is a short walk from the hotel, which was very convenient, and the staff was very friendly. The only complaint I have was the concierge seemed to have problems giving directions regarding bus lines and train info to where we wanted to go, but we figured it out anyway.

The bar restaurant made an open faced caeser wrap to die for, but the highlight of the stay was on the morning we left when Marietta at the little pastry/breakfast area across from reception made us lattes and brought us the best scones and sweet cream we'd had the whole 12 days we'd been in Ireland.

A superb hotel, conveniently located (only 10 minutes from the airport), which also offers free shuttle service to and from the airport promptly on the half hour, has great food and excellent service...I can't think of anything bad to say about it.

250,Good airport option for an early flight,"We stayed here for 1 night over Easter (completely forgot to add my review at the time!) and before we went I had asked on the forums about the shuttle bus service. I got limited answers and so thought my review might make it clear for future guests.

If taking a bus from the airport there is a phone in arrivals - you call and let them know you are there and you should get a space on the next shuttle. They seem to have a variety of buses so I guess this helps them to send the correct sized bus.

We arrived at the hotel at about 8.30 in the evening and unfortunately had to leave really early the next day so we booked spaces on the 5am shuttle :(

We went to the bar for food and we had a nice meal - the main restaurant was Thai I think which was not quite what we wanted - the bar had a good selection.

After our meal we headed to bed. We got a good nights sleep and were up in time for our shuttle - we didn't investigate breakfast options...we got something when we got home!",4,2013,06,01
250,Suprisingly good food,"Didnt actually stay at this hotel but popped in for a bite to eat prior to a flight - I normally avoid Hotel Food but was very hungry and took teh chance. Ordered a Cheese Burger which was served promptly and I must confess it was excellent. Obviously home cooked and well presented. I am not a great fan of burgers but, in fariness to the hotel, this was of a high quality.",4,2013,05,29
250,Heineken Cup W/end stay,"We stayed for 2 nights and got a great deal for the Heineken Cup final weekend.
Room 144 was fine, no view at all & the corridor outside smelt of cigarettes, but the room itself did not. Spacious room, massive bed, good bathroom... Everything you would expect and nothing to complain about (free wifi too, which was great).. Oh, but the pillows were not great, a bit hard/lumpy.
Bar is pricey with limited choice (unless you want lager or Guinness) and the printer in the ""business centre"" was out of action, so a bit of a niggle or two there.
A bit of a trip into central Dublin, but buses are available at the end of the hotel access road and a taxi is c€25 each way - between 4 of us, well worth it! (The reception staff said it would be closer to €40, so ignore it if that's what you're told!) if you are using the bus, you MUST have the coins to pay - no notes, no change given.
Shuttle bus to/from airport is fantastic.
Would stay again if necessary, but equally might look for somewhere more central and take the hit on the airport transfers...",3,2013,05,27
250,Standards slipping,"Stayed many times but errors on check in slipping in such as after taking a Credit card guarantee the till at the bar is not notified.
Bad odour smell in room on club floor.
They tried to hide it with heavy spray.
Bar staff not over happy and slow service.
Club lounge breakfast costs cutting. No meat on buffet.
Business centre used 2 times. First time disgusting condition.
Second printers not working and management didn't change the ink cartridges but printed via a printer in another office???

These comments made over 4/5 weekly stays.",4,2013,05,26
250,Touzai restaurant at Crown Plaza,"Less then adequate food and abysmal service. We were seated at 7 pm for dinner, and the meal started promisingly when the waitress promptly took our order and brought our drinks. My wife's appetizer also arrived promptly. And then it all fell apart. We waited until 7:55 for our mains, and when they still hadn't arrived, and we hadn't seen our waitress since 7:15, I tracked down the only staff member I could spot in the restaurant, who happened to be the supervisor. He said he'd look into it right away, and our meal arrived less then a minute later. The explanation: the kitchen was very, very busy. If that was the case, why did our waitress disappear and why were our meals miraculously ready the minute we spoke to the manager?  He insisted that our food just happened to be ready when he went to investigate. But considering the restaurant was barely 20% full and our meals were dried out and tepid when they arrived, I'm inclined to believe we were simply forgotten about. In fact, I think our waitress served our appetizer and drinks and then clocked out. We never saw her again.

The supervisor offered us a free drink, but didn't offer to replace the overlooked, luke warm food. 

As for taste, the restaurant would be advised to drop the faux Asian theme. The food was a failure in every respect.",1,2013,05,25

Parking is extra though and i couldnt see a mention of this online",4,2013,05,24
250,A very good Airport hotel,"Great rooms, great breakfast, friendly staff and a late bar -- what more could you want?

250,Great for work weekends,"My employer put myself and a few coworkers up in this hotel for the weekend while we were in Dublin. The location was perfect, so convenient for the airport and the omni park centre. The staff were great, so helpful and welcoming. We ate in the bar the second night and the food was delicious, we all ate our fill! The waitress that was looking after us was perfect at knowing exactly when to approach us. Bar staff were brilliant too, treated us like their regulars. I would definitely recommend this hotel! ",5,2013,05,16
250,Good for what it is,"Stayed here again as it is close to work.  Good shuttle to and from the airport and quick check in. Our room was fine, big bed and spacious bathroom but still that terrible shower!!! Air conditioning unit rattled intermittently which meant we turned it off at night and the room became stuffy.  Asked for some biscuits to be sent up but nothing arrived and our back up wake up call never occurred meaning that we were up late. I was disappointed that the level of service was not good. The general manager makes the same general response to most of the reviews and the hotel feels like that - do what you need to do to get by.",3,2013,05,16
250,Best Airport Hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed here many times and it is by far the best standard hotel around Dublin airport. The rating should be 4.5* and it represents excellent value for money.

Highly recommended.",5,2013,05,13
250,Would stay again,"Overall an excellent experience.  Well furnished, exceptionally clean, very helpful staff.  Restaurant food (dinner) was not good.  Told server (bc he asked) the chicken was dry his response was he could do nothing about that, but wld tell the chef. We were not told there was a 6euro up charge for steak. Overall excellent.

250,Heavenly scrambled eggs.,"Not at all bad for business use, although reception was very slow. Outstanding 'full Irish' with magnificent, soft moist scrambled eggs. Room Ok if a bit bland, but convenient location for airport and city.",4,2013,05,07
250,Good choice near the airport,"My friend and I stayed here one night last week and had a good experience. The front desk staff was helpful, arranging our wake up call and making sure we reserved a seat on the airport shuttle bus, which departs from the hotel every 30 minutes. The room was very good - clean with interesting modern decor, comfortable beds, a huge bathroom, trouser press, etc. Our booking site claimed the room had a scale, but we never saw it. However, this is a minor issue in an otherwise good place. The hotel itself was nice and quiet. The Asian restaurant on the lobby level is decent, with very good service. My only complaint is that our shower drained slowly. If you're choosing a hotel that's near the ""action"" and tourist sites of Dublin, this is NOT the hotel for you. However, if you're choosing it to be close to the airport than this is perfect.",5,2013,04,24
250,An Excellent Stay,"i have stayed in this hotel now on a number of occassions and found the rooms to be of the highest standard and the staff to be very helpful
Breakfasts are excellent and the evening meald very enjoyable",5,2013,04,23
250,Offsite Airport convenience,"It is not the greatest nor the worst. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The shuttle is fairly painless and the proximity to the airport is great. They offer great deals and rates on parking there when you are away.
The food in the Cinnabar Red is good fast service and big portions reasonably priced.Be warned though it gets very loud when Manchester United are playing !!!",3,2013,04,21
250,Perfectly adequate,"Stayed here one night for a conference. Pick up with the hotel shuttle was painless; no real need to take a taxi unless you are stuck for time. 

Great staff at check in and out, food good and served quickly, staff friendly and responsive right through the stay - not that they needed to do much, they seemed to have their systems well sorted and everything I saw was run like clockwork. 

Clean room and bathroom, spotless in fact. A comfortable bed, great nights sleep and plenty of sockets for charging the laptop, mobiles etc. 

All in all, a well run place that I'd be happy to go back to. 

It's out at the airport, so I'd think this is a business or pre-flight hotel rather than for visiting Dublin and seeing the sights as a tourist.",4,2013,04,20
250,Great hotel for conferences,"This is the second year I've used the hotel for a 500 + conference event. My room was a suite on the 4th floor with access to the lub lounge which was ok but not a patch on the Hilton equivalent. There was free convenient car parking right next door and the rooms all had free wifi. Bar has great atmosphere with football on  pretty much all the time so great if you love it, not so great if you don't.

Top tip...... Ask the hotel to validate your car parking .. You might get it free",4,2013,04,19
250,Friendly staff,"I stayed here for business recently - staff were very helpful and the hotel etc was very clean.

However, there was a problem with the air con unit in my room and it rattled randomly and didn't work properly - the room was pretty roasting as a result.

Great location, parking was fine, breakfast as per other Crowne Plazas was tasty buffet.

Beds are a little harder than I would like but again the bathrooms were clean, spacious and well stocked with products.  

One fault I'd find with CP hotels is that the walls are pretty thin, I was woken by the guest next door sneezing early in the morning which is a bit of a turn off.  In other CP hotels I've been able to hear the TV in the room next door.",4,2013,04,17
250,Lovely clean hotel. Very comfortable. Friendly staff.,"This is a really nice hotel. The most comfortable beds I've slept in in any hotel. Staff are very courteous and the restaurant serves really nice food, even if the menu is a little limited. Overall an excellent 2 night stay. ",5,2013,04,15
250,Club room benefits cancelled during low occupancy ! Don't bother.,"As a Platinum Elite member of the IHG hotels group i do try and remain loyal to the brand . I ussually stay at the Crowne Plaza in Blanchardstown which is superb... however i was extremely disappointed at Northwood hotel. 
Booked two ""Club"" rooms for a business colleague and myself on 3rd April  . i had been warned that the bar was noisy with television sport and we wanted a business meeting so thought we would use the Club lounge and refreshments. On check in there was no recognition of loyalty Club membership , however we were told that breakfast would be served in the Club lounge and drinks were available now. 
The Club rooms are interesting in oriental concept , but the furniture looking tired. The Club lounge was in darkness .. and on returning to reception and speaking to Beth ,  a phone call was made to a Manager and i was told that the Club lounge was closed due to ""low occupancy"" this week and breakfast was in the main restaurant. This seems to be a regular occurence at this hotel ... so for the additional charge for Club rooms  (25 €  ) the likelyhood is that you will get nothing .... not even an apology from disinterested reception staff.",3,2013,04,13
250,Great from start to Finish,"There are no complaints. Checking in very professional.
The room was immaculate. All employees were very kind.
The early checkout provided hot coffee.
The shuttle driver to the hotel and back to the airport 
was the same person and could not have been nicer.",5,2013,04,09
250,Excellence when you least expect it,"I was not expecting much from a Crowne Plaza near an airport that I was forced to book for a conference. However this hotel impressed at every turn and shows what good management and an obvious commitment to service can accomplish. I stupidly left a bag in the taxi that dropped me. The front desk manager took it upon himself to track down the taxi company and driver by phone and have my bag delivered. A minor computer glitch at check in (which I hadn't even noticed!) netted me a drink coupon for the bar. What could have been the usual boring mass-produced conference meal was in fact a fantastic, fresh dinner. Etc. From A to Z, everything excelled. Next time I would not need to be forced to book here!",5,2013,04,08
250,"Very nice, relaxing Airport hotel. Superb staff!","My Lufthansa flight was cancelled, so they set me up in the Crone Plaza Hotel. From airport there is a shuttle bus to the hotel, which I believe runs every 20min. The great service starts from the driver taking care of your luggage, while you sit down into the bus. In 5min time you are in the Hotel, which is located next to a park and at the same time there are some businesses and apartments. The park is great for a refreshing walk during the day. The Hotel itself is located next to Holiday inn. Check in was quick and no problem. I stayed in this Hotel couple of times before and it still is a great hotel. Foyer has a quite big Bar and a restaurant area. Bar food is not bad. As I had dinner paid by Lufthansa as well, I got a taste of that and thought while not bad, but you may want to try other options too. The room was a Club Room on 2nd floor - loved it - from the way the table is placed, to the bed and TV (32"" I believe). Beds are very comfortable, Bathroom big and clean. Internet fast and low latency. Breakfast quite good too with hot food options made by a cook. Great Hotel if you need a sleep over or stay near the airport for couple of days. If you are going to the town it's a bit remote. You can however take a public bus, which is just about 300meter away. Ride takes about 1hour to city center (it's because Public transport in Dublin is bit slow due to traffic, not because it's soo far). Your better option to get to town would probably be to go with shuttle bus to airport and take the Aircoach bus to the center (15EUR return). In case you want to get some snack's or visit the mcDonals you can get out of the hotel to the right and walk about 500m to the nearest convenience store which is open quite late, McD etc. Definitely will stay there again. Loved the bed the well soundproofed rooms and especially the desk area which just invites you for productive work.",5,2013,04,04
250,Very helpful staff and great location,"The staff at this hotel was very helpful. When my husband asked about Wicklow mountains, the lady at the front desk was kind enough to print out top 10 from Trip Advisor for us to do at Wicklow! The room is very comfortable - large beds and spacious bathroom with a tub and shower.",4,2013,04,02
250,Excellent,"Stayed here to be close to the airport for a flight the next day. Warm reception on arrival. Room decent, nice bathroom. Free wifi was very welcome. Upgraded to the club rooms and lounge meaning there were complimentary drinks that evening for a couple of hours. Early bird menu was very reasonable and very tasty. Complimentary breakfast the next day was a lovely bonus. Parking for the week was convenient and good enough value, considering there was a bus laid on for a free drop off at the airport. Overall, a great experience, felt I got real value for money and the service was excellent. Will not hesitate to stay here again and recommend to others!",5,2013,04,02
250,"Great hotel, good value","Rooms are spacious with mini bar, plenty of towels big TV's, tea and coffee making facilities.  Bathroom was spacious with separate bath and a good shower with free toiletries, hair dryer and are well lit.

Rooms have good office facilities for the business traveler, and have lots of plug sockets, and the European plug sockets, so good if you've forgotten a travel adapter! Free wifi is a great plus.

Lots of parking fairly priced at 6€ per night.

Breakfast has a large choice of hot and cold food, toast, croissants, pastries, omelets, eggs how you like etc.

They have a club lounge for priority club members with free drinks and canapé's etc, all very good.

Good service to match.

It's about a 15minute drive to downtown Dublin, I normally stay here when in town on my own.   ",4,2013,03,31
250,Pretty nice,"Nice, modern hotel near the Dublin Airport.  There's a free shuttle to and from the airport, which was great.  Amenities were ok.  No vending machines, which was odd.  The Holiday Inn Express is literally adjacent to this hotel, so we walked over to the Holiday Inn to get beverages from the vending machine.
Walls are thin; my husband heard unpleasant noises from the occupants next door in the middle of the night.  Bed was comfy enough.  Front desk was nice enough to give us a room on an upper floor because they were having an event downstairs.",4,2013,03,30
250,Great Bar Staff,"Stayed in the hotel for the week of St. Patricks weekend, lovely hotel, rooms are very spacious and comfortable could improve room by adding a fridge, bar was not comfortable and looked to be very under staffed, but the staff who were working were great especially Andrew and Katherin, Andrew told us about events going on at the weekend and where to go and what is a must to do while in ireland, Katherin advised us about hotels deals and offers. Would defiantly stay here again just for the staff. Hotel could also improve greatly if it added a pool/spa area.",4,2013,03,27
250,Siob,"Stayed overnight on way home from Belfast for visit to Ikea. Location was perfect for our visit. was freezing cold but we were greeted by a lovely warm lobby and lounge.  Staff were all lovely. Breakfast was 5* plus and dining room was fab. Could,nt praise this hotel enough.",5,2013,03,26
250,Nice place with a good sportsbar,"Nice hotel were I stayed for 4 nights on a businesstrip, the staff at the reception was very friendly and they were helpful.
A good tip is the breakfast , this was very good with a large variety
If one a buisness trip or passing through Dublin for a few days this is a great hotel located in a nice park area and not to far from the city centre and close to the airport, but not so close that you can hear the airport",4,2013,03,23
250,"Nice, clean and very helpful staff","I recently organised a 60th birthday for a family member and booked three rooms (one being the Harmony suite) all on the 4th floor. I also booked a meal for a number of guests in the hotels restaurant. 

The staff were very helpful from initial contact, to arranging the rooms and to planning the meal for the event. The staff were all fantastic, from Mr Crosbie the event organizer to the restaurant manager and all waiting staff. The two standard rooms very impressive, comfortable, clean and modern with very comfortable beds. The Harmony suite was out of this world with four poster bed, sofas, dining table for 8 people, electronic massage chair, TV IN THE BATHROOM. It's nice to see how the rich and famous live for one night only!!! The perfect treat for a special occasion. 

As mentioned previously the restaurant staff were extremely helpful (the 60th was arrange for a person with limited mobility) with every thought gone in to make it as stress free and as comfortable as possible. The dinner (the early bird menu) was very tasty and got a thumbs up all round from everyone in the party. The restaurant manager sent over a glass of champagne for everyone within our group (more than 10 people) which was a fantastic gesture!

After a great night sleep down for breakfast. I've stayed in many hotels in the past but i'd struggle to think of anywhere with a bigger selection for breakfast than the crown plaza. Full buffet, hot or cold, waffles, pancakes.. hmmmm tasty...

Overall delighted with my stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying!",4,2013,03,23
250,Nice Hotel but missing the attention to detail!,"I stayed in this hotel over the St.PAtricks Day weekend with my Partner. We were on the 4th floor in a club room. The room was nice, what I have come to expect from Crowne Plaza's. The bathroom was large and we could have done with a few extra hangers in the wardrobe. The hotel staff were, in the majority very polite and helpful. The hotel Bus is a farce - simply just book a cab. The club lounge is nice, if a little small. Breakfast is not served here over the weekends, nor was it served on the Monday of our stay. 
The air-con in our room was noisy and as per another review the bed was uncomfortable. In the dead of the night 1:15am to be exact we were informed via out TV (we were asleep with the lights and TV switched off) that breakfast in the morning was on promotion. Needless to say this has dampened my view.
In summery if you need a airport hotel, I would recommend. If you want a hotel in Dublin, stay somewhere closer to the city centre.",3,2013,03,22
250,40th Wedding Anniversary,"My two sisters and I hosted a surprise 40th Wedding Anniversary for our parents in the Crowne Plaza, Northwood. The hotel staff were a pleasure to deal with and great ambassadors for the hotel. The night was a huge success and all of the guests commented on the fabulous food, including the breakfast for those who stayed over, the hotel itself and the wonderful staff on the night.",5,2013,03,21
250,Nice Room - Average Service,"The room here was extremely nice with a large bed. Bathroom had both tub and shower. Wifi is spotty at best, making video calling impossible.  That seemed strange to me for a hotel that caters to businessman clientele.  The staff do their job, but ONLY their job. They do not go out of their way for you or answer more than your question.  Location is good close to airport though he car park is a bit high at €6 per day when rooms run around €250/night.",4,2013,03,19
250,Perfect hotel in the Dublin,"I can recommend this hotel for family stay and for stay with friends as well. Very comfortable, modern and suitable. 
Breakfast is OK, all you can need for typical continental or Irish breakfast. 
The bar with life music is perfect .
Travelling to the Dublin downtown is no so complicated. You can use the bus (station is 5 minute walk) or taxis about 18,- EUR.
Staff in the hotel is very pleasant and friendly. 
The rooms are large and bathroom is perfect.",5,2013,03,18
250,Comfortable for conferences or airport transfer stays,"Comfortable hotel with a practical location close to the airport. Free airportshuttle if you reserve in advance.

The room itself was very nice, spacious and modern. Having been to many good hotels with tiny bathrooms, this bathroom was a dream with separate bath and shower and ample space around the facilities. The room is well equipped with a minibar, waterboiler and an iron. Very comfortable bed. Good desk and even a European socket. Free WiFi.

There are some things the management should look into though. First of all, it is a challenge to find the TV channels as the tv is set up in such a way that you must press too many buttons before even have access to the TV. Secondly, you are guided to pay TV first and in the 21st century I would expect a serious hotel like this to refrain from selling adult movies. 

As some have written earlier, the staff at the restaurant and bar are very slow, as if they are understaffed at all times. The breakfast is lovely, dinner ok.",4,2013,03,10
250,Nice hotel for business customers,"Stayed here while travelling on business. The hotel is modern and has a nice atmosphere in the evenings. 

I had dinner in the hotel bar. I arrived quite late so I was the only person that needed to be served food at the time. This didn't stop the waiting staff from being quite slow and inattentive to my needs. I had to go to the bar twice to request my order to be taken. He would not take my order himself. This lead to a 30 minute wait for food even though I was the only one being served!

The room was very comfortable and clean. The wifi didn't work very well in my room and I ended up tethering my phone to my laptop which wasn't ideal. Another thing which really irked me was the lack of sockets near the bed. I wanted to use my laptop while sitting in bed and also have my phone next to my bed as I use it as an alarm. However, the only plugs in the room were on the opposite wall from the bed. This meant leaving my phone charging on the room's desk and meant I couldn't charge my laptop while using it in bed.

The last thing was the parking. I felt it should be clearer that the mutli-story car park is for use by Crowne Plaza guests along as well as Holiday Inn users. When I drove past, the car park was joined only to Holiday Inn so I assumed I couldn't use it. As a result, I parked my car by an apartment block adjacent to the hotel. I went to check-in, asked where I should park (I was informed I should use the multi-story at this point) then went to move my car. When I returned 15 minutes later, I had been clamped by the NCPS. I understand this was my own fault but as I said, it could have been clearer that the multi-story was for use by Crowne Plaza guests too.",2,2013,03,09
250,"Very Good Hotel, but.......","The only 2 negatives I would have are uncomfortable beds. Very firm had to ask for extra duvet so could fold up and sleep on.
Bar very expensive for drinks.

Positives - Hotel is very close to Airport (5min taxi) free hotel shuttle. 
Nice location with lake across the road. 
Very clean Room
Suite very spacious
Great food
Club floor brilliant
short walk to road where local bus will take you right into center of Dublin -BUT TAKE THE RIGHT CHANGE. The bus drivers don't serve fares.
Bar very well stocked",4,2013,03,08
250,"Great hotel, poor restaurant","Stayed there for a week, and used mainly all their facilites. Room was big and very nice and clean, both a huge shower and bathtub. Very comfortable bed.

Close enough to the city, only 10-15 minutes by taxi. Close to the airport to.

Serviceminded staff, always smiling.

The pubstaff... Not that they werent serviceminded, its just that they was to slow. More than 10 people at the bar and you had to wait 5 minutes for a beer.

The gym was very basic, but gave you what you needed.

I had to eat all my lunches and dinners there... Probably not that bad a restaurant, but all those caserolls in that buffet was a huge let down. No flavours at all. And after 5 days in a row, that fruit salad for dessert was not that exciting.",4,2013,03,08
250,Great Hotel,"Nice hotel, close to the airport, Nice park across the road for a stroll, IKEA within walking distance. Food was great. I attended a conference there. Would recommend to families/couples/etc . I think there is a free shuttle bus to the airport but you would need to check this. Taxis outside the door at all times!",5,2013,03,07
250,Professional entourage and service,"I stayed in this hotel in October 2012, for second time. Business travel. It really is a business hotel but in the positive sense of the wording. Staff is professional and provides excellent services. I guess it is part of Irish culture, because I experienced good quality of service everywhere within my short stay in Dublin. The hotel has a pick-up service with a mini-van. The hop-on spot at the airport is somewhat difficult to find. It is where all mini vans stop so that is logical, but the place itself is hard to find. The ride takes about 12 minutes. The rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained, providing the little extra's that make's it a TOPhotel for me (Bottles of water provided, coffee and tea provided, various European TV channels). 
The hotel also has an inhouse restaurant and bar (with a good pub-menu as well), so that is convenient.
The lobby is a clean, quiet place to do some talkings or work.

I think this is one of the most convenient business hotels I've stayed in, in Europe.",5,2013,03,03
250,Very nice hotel,"I recently stayed here to attend a conference and was pleasantly suprised by the standard of the hotel. My room was modern and tastefully decorated and the bed extremely comfortable. The breakfast buffet is excellent with a great variety to choose from including reshly made bread, fresh fruit and an omellette counter as well as all the usual cooked breakfast options. The airport was easily accessible from the M1 and closely located to the airport with a regular shuttle bus service if required. The multi-story car park adjacent to the hotel is 6 euros/day and felt a very secure location to park. The hotel is quite a distance to the city centre (40mins bus, 20mins taxi) but for what I was there for was perfect. Opposite the hotel is a nice park area and lake and there are nearby shopping facilities if needed. The hotel staff to were very pleasant to deal with making it a very enjoyable few nights stay here.",5,2013,03,02
250,Vomit!!! Glorious vomit!!!,"Having checked into my room, put all clothes away and changed into my pyjamas, I switched off the light, tried to step into bed but was met with ""sludge"" oozing through my toes! I stupidly put my hand down to assess the sludge, smelt my hand, only to discover that it was vomit! 
Turning on the light, I discovered that both sides of the bed were covered in pools of vomit! 
For my trauma, I was offered 45Euro off the price of my vomit filled room!!",1,2013,02,25
250,bit out of the way,"First trip to dublin, didnt realise how isolated this hotel is! 
Hotel transport from airport is free but once at hotel its very much down to yourself to get about. Overall hotel not too bad but unless you intend spending a lot of time in your hotel room...find one a lot closer to Dublin centre!",3,2013,02,16
250,rooms good size but can smell people smoking,"The room and bathroom really good size.The towels are a bit small and very rough. The sheets were not as clean as I expected so I requested them to be changed the next morning.(they don't change unless you hang the note on door)
I was on the first floor and window looks out onto a wall,so I was better with curtains closed.I had a non smoking room but other rooms next to me were smoking rooms so corridor and vents into room smells of smoke. I think it would be better to split smoking by floors rather than mix.

hotel is close to my business trip location as well as airport,but there's not much else around.
Breakfast is ok,good variaty. Dinner was very nice.",3,2013,02,11
250,Response first rate!,"What a nite!!...I was moved here at 10 pm from the adjoining express after complaining about horrendous antics and noise of college students not only partying at a ball at the crowne plaza but within the hotel rooms and corridors. I don't know the college but it was local and quite simply they should be ashamed to endorse this event and the disgusting way their students behaved. Not like adults, more like infants. The hotel was overwhelmed with the amount of problems at both the express and crown plaza and I am sure they will reflect on how this ruined other guests stays? I have to complain about this to them for future guest but in the same sentence actually commend their reactions and customer service. Moved hotels, then put in one of better rooms on club floor. Despite this due to noise here and people running corridors I only slept 3 hours which is not good for an airport and Bussiness hotel!as a result the then cancelled all charges day after, apologies sincerely, even the duty manager came and did so. So a one rating is a three.

Seriously though crowne plaza...you have to stop these block bookings at these sort of juvenile unpolished events!",3,2013,02,10
250,Great rooms and fantastic bar/restaurant,"Second and third stays at the Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport and really love the place.
We stayed in November 2012 before flying out to Italy, and once again in December 2012 before flying to France for Christmas.
The free shuttle bus to and from the airport is just fantastic, and is ever so convenient (starts at 6am). The shuttle bus drivers are very polite and helpful; I have to give them credit for that.
The reception staff was very helpful and a pleasure to deal with.
The rooms are always very spacious and nicely decorated (asian theme is lovely). They feature all conveniences you would expect in a 4 star, and a great, spacious bathroom with a bathtub.
This time, we also had food at the bar, and it was truly delicious, while still quite reasonable. They offer classic dishes as well as dishes of Asian inspiration; worth a try if you are hungry.
This is the perfect hotel to stay at before flying out from Dublin airport. Can only recommend it!",4,2013,02,10
250,Lovely,"We were at an event in the Crowne Plaza so really we werent in the room that long but it was really lovely. Nice decorated, spotlessly clean, loads of space. The bathroom was huge and had a shower and separate bath. I had friends staying there as well and everyone agreed it was lovely.",5,2013,02,06
250,"Good hotel, great breakfast pity about the water pressure","Stayed in hotel for one night as was attending a function.  Reception staff were friendly courteous and efficient.  The room was medium in size but well equipped, but the wardrobe door was missing a panel so contents once hung were on view. reception took my cc details on arrival but didn't unlock minibar so can't comment on contents.  Bathroom was good size with separate bath and large walkin shower unit. However the water pressure in shower was no more than a dribble and very disappointing. Breakfast in bed was punctual and a triumph - Perfectly poached eggs delivered warm with generous thermos pot of coffee and a lovely fresh fruit salad complete with Sunday papers.  Beds comfortable and overall cleanliness  very good.",4,2013,01,30
250,Strange bedfellows.,"Me and my partner checked into this hotel for a 2 night stay. 
Check in was fine and had a nice chat with the lady on reception, who seemed genuinely interested in where we'd traveled from and our plans whilst there. 
The main issue wasn't discovered until we got into bed and realised that our king size bed was in fact 2 separate mattresses pushed together. This may not have been a problem, however the mattresses were slightly different in size, as one seemed higher than the other, so it was very noticeable. As it was the evening we left it until the next day to inform reception.
We also noticed, when we woke up, that there was a loud banging noise coming from the room above like someone was loudly dropping something very repetitively, which continued for ages and it was like they were filling up a store room of some sort. 
We were on the 1st floor.

They arranged a room change and said that they would phone us at 12.30 when one became available. We waited until 13.30 and no call, so we tried again and the lady informed us that one was now available. Had we not have phoned them then it's unknown how long they would've kept us waiting further. 
We had to call down again as no one had arrived to give us the new room key as promised. We eventually changed rooms to the 3rd floor, and to a proper king size mattress.
Because of an issue with not getting our hire car due to not having a credit card (thrifty car hire if anyone cares) we had a walk around the local area. The hotel is in the middle of a business/housing estate so there wasn't much to see or do. There is a frequent bus that traveled into the city centre so we were told, but we didn't use. There's a McDonald's and shop facilities about a 15 min walk away, which was good.

We had some lunch on the 2nd day and I had the club sandwich. The chips I received were very scrappy, for the want of a better word and had obviously been the bottom result of a deep fat fryer. My partners baguettes, which was meant to be prawn and salmon was correct...In one there was both the above but in the 2nd, there was only prawns. Perhaps they'd run out of the salmon ? There is a good varied selection on the menu as well as the drinks too, so can't fault that at all.

The towels, as other people have mentioned are very small and also very rough to use, especially on the face. So maybe they could invest in some new ones ?

Another investment that might be wise for the hotel to pursue is perhaps anti door slammers for all the rooms, as the amount of times we could hear other patrons doing this was very annoying,
especially in the morning when some people no doubt like to have a lay in etc.

All in all, despite the somewhat average comments, we did enjoy our stay. 
The staff were very nice and accomodating to our needs. The shuttle bus to the airport was very frequent, which was an added bonus.",3,2013,01,27
250,Great staff and excellent service,"Stayed there for two nights in December. Hotel itself is extremely well maintained the room was very big, well equipped and decorated very tastefully. The staff are great they cannot do enough for you. Nothing is too much to ask. 

A great hotel who know how to treat their guests!",5,2013,01,27
250,Definitely stay at this hotel,"Fantastic staff and service, rooms are high grade and clean, bed superb. Breakfast was excellent and coffee both at breakfast and at Inca coffee bar very good. It was also excellent value and I will definitely stay again.",5,2013,01,25
250,Great breakfast,"Was there on business for just one night ,we chose it since it was close to our office and the airport.Room was modern and pretty much immaculate. We never used the restaurant apart from breakfast in the morning , if you are looking for a great breakfast then this is the place to go , everything was cooked just right . Price wise , the hotel is good value , certainly much cheaper than it would be in the UK,I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2013,01,23
250,Great experience,"Was booked into crowne plaza with kerry group as i was attending a course nearby,location great,clean,friendly staff,good food,and rooms where very nice for the price.Due to this hotel being overbooked the week after we had to stay in a radisson blu and where very dissapointed after our great experience at crowne plaza,had to pay more for less than half the experience,made us miss crowne plaza more.",5,2013,01,17
250,Pre holiday stay,"We chose the stay and fly option which was ok value we upgraded to business exec floor but wasted our money as although we informed we would check in about 8-9pm no one told us the lounge would only have soft drinks at this stage and although there would be breakfast it was cont' so we wouldve been better staying bed and breakfast at least we couldve had a cooked breakfast for less money.
Overall the hotel is nice but not great we would probably save our cash and use somewhere else next time.",3,2013,01,16
250,disappointing,"Stayed here for one night in January. Wanted a decent night's sleep before attending a funeral.
Room and bathroom good. However, there are two inner concrete courtyards with rooms on all sides. Somewhere outside the rooms or on the roof the mechanical air/heating ducts emit a constant dull roar (as bad as heavy traffic would be). This noise was audible even with double glazed window shut and room air turned on. The windows only open slightly at the top. If you stay there take earplugs. I think the park facing rooms would have the same problem because the sound comes from the roof as well.",3,2013,01,11
250,weekendbreak,very central to airport also very good bus service to city center the staff were great very helpful full of great ideas of places to go and things to do. rooms are very comfortable breakfast is a bit pricey if it is not included in you booking,5,2013,01,11
250,Solid modern hotel,"One night stay before a meeting at Dublin airport the next day. Normally stay at the Carlton down the road, but was booked here as it was a bit last minute.

Lovely hotel in a quiet location, friendly and efficient reception and waiting staff.

The rooms are a good size, very nicely decorated and most importantly spotlessly clean. I slept very well in a comfortable bed and the contents of the hospitality tray in the room are excellent. 

Breakfast is well laid out and has plenty of options - you would have to be very fussy not to get something to eat.  I particularly liked the coffee machine near the breakfast entrance with takeaway cups.  It was lovely to be able to take a second cup of coffee with me after breakfast to enjoy as I got ready to check out.  It's a great added extra.

Only small negatives, typical hotel prices - very expensive food and drink - but no worse than the competition. Also I sat in the lobby area to eat my evening meal and the cold air coming through the doors was terrible - poor building design. 

Overall a very good business / airport hotel - I will be asking the company to book me here more often - it beats the Carlton hands down",4,2013,01,05
250,Our Family Gathering,"We held a family gathering of 20 people in this hotel on 28th Dec.and had a wonderful experience.The staff were so helpfull and accommodating when I was planning this event . On the night we recieved a warm welcome,the food was both delicious and ample and we had the most delightful waitress in ANA./...,,;The bedrooms were fabulous . Breakfast next morning had great variety and choice. Overall every aspect of this hotel we found to be of a very high standard and  the staff were friendly,helpfull and did everything possible to make our gathering the enjoyable event that it was.M H.",5,2013,01,04
250,Very mixed bag,"This is a hotel of strange contrasts. The property itself is really very nice, nice lobby, bar, communal areas, well furnished high quality rooms. Very nice looking (but closed) club lounge.

However they really let themselves down in other areas. We stayed here for one night prior to flying home, and entertained 3 elderly Irish family members to an early dinner.

The only food option was bar food, the restaurant was closed apparently because it was New Years Day or still Christmas or some excuse.

The bar had 3 giant screens of football, the lobby, where we would have preferred to sit, was full of muggles and their screaming kids and prams, and was also quite cold, so we ended up at a table  in the bar. Noisy football, more noisy kids, very poor acoustics so hard to hold a conversation, and quite cold too.

Hard to get served, they didn't have enough staff, or they were just badly organised, not sure which. There was a manager bloke walking around looking very pleased with himself for reasons presumably unrelated to what was going on around him, and not actually doing much managing or lifting a finger to help at all apart from fiddling with the curtains every now and again. 

The food, when it eventually came, was very poor. 4 of the 5 of us had fish and chips. The fish was encased in rubber, not batter, quite the worst I've had in years, and most of it went back uneaten.

Really, what in god's name is a sports bar doing in a Crowne Plaza? Why do they allow the locals and their screaming kids to take over the lobby and bar? Maybe their sister hotel, the HIX next door, but not at what should be a four-star hotel.  Guys you are not delivering a four-star experience. Appalling expensive food and a noisy, down-market bar. Not good for a CP, not what the brand should be delivering. Whilst it's conceivable we may stay there again for the room quality, we certainly wouldn't repeat the dining experience.",2,2013,01,01
250,"Great rates, excellent service","We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport & had reasonable rates for a family, but it has much more going for it, including very friendly, helpful & professional staff.
We took the free shuttle from the airport late at night & were checked in within minutes. Both the room & the bath were very spacious & clean. Beds were very comfortable. Since the restaurant had already closed for the night, we ordered room service of sandwiches. They were freshly made to order & arrived within 15 minutes. 
The breakfast buffet had everything you could ask for & all was tasty, even the kids went for seconds.",5,2013,01,01
250,Excellent Quality Hotel at Good Price,"Stayed at the hotel on business. There is a shuttle to and from the Airport (although there is sometimes a wait) - about 7 or 8 mins from Airport.

The staff were very professional at check-in, and i was upgraded to an executive room. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was also clean, and good quality supplies. Used room service which was good - little expensive as always in hotels. Also, ordered room service breakfast which was fantastic quality, although far too much to eat !

Would certainly stay here again.",5,2012,12,29
250,Worst nights sleep I've ever had & Worst Hotel food!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night before an early morning flight. We checked in late on a work evening and were both starving so after a quick trip to our room to leave our cases we headed for the restaurant on the ground floor, we had a starter and two burgers for main course. Starter was average. He had a beef burger which had almost set after a few minutes with the grease! And I had an over seasoned cajun chicken burger which I did not finish more than a few mouthfulls of as it was so salty! Neither of us are very fussy but had we not been so hungry we would have sent that food straight back and been very glad to miss breakfast! Staff were mainly friendly and helpful espically the woman at check in. Hotel room was clean and well furnished, except for a television from the dark ages, an uncomfortable bed and a disabled persons bathroom which I thought odd as neither of us needed those facilities. Park and stay option was excellent and good value but trying to find the shuttle bus back from the airport was difficult.",2,2012,12,28
250,Loved it!,"Very friendly, lovely staff.  Beautiful and modern. they sent us up complementary champagne to celebrate our honeymoon!! Free shuttle to airport. we had went to bewleys hotel first as it was cheaper but left as it was so depressing, awful!! So glad we changed hotels!!",5,2012,12,09
250,Very nice hotel airport with great conference facilities,"Stayed there for one night for a company conference. 
Free shuttle bus from the airport every half an hour - hotel is only 10 min away. 
Upon checkin I was given a voucher for the Wednesday evening managers' drinks - which I haven't had time to attend although it is always a nice attention. 
Room felt very fresh and new. Bathroom had a bath and a shower. Felt clean too although shower could have done with some in depth cleaning (lime scale etc). Water pressure wasn't great but acceptable. 
Free wifi and cabled Internet in bedroom. 
Dined at the bar - burger was good. Mini bar is reasonable : 3 euros for a can of coke. 
Room service  (5 euro charge) breakfast was 10 min early! Breakfast itself was good. 
Check out was quick. Only cheeky thing is that they charged me in British pounds directly (uk card - instead of charging me in euros) without asking me (I guess they get a commission from the credit card company).
All in all a great airport hotel.",4,2012,12,07
250,Disappointed,"In the past few years I spent a few weeks at this hotel for business and have returned after about 2 years. I have also been staying at another Crowne Plaza the last 4 months. 
I really used to like this hotel but I was disappointed by the hotel's policy regarding Platinum Priority Club members. As a member, I am eligible for upgrades into the 4th floor to executive rooms, and I realize that this is on a ""as available basis"" which in this case it was not. I am ok with that, however as a substitute for not getting an upgrade, I was given a voucher for 2 drinks in the bar (an estimated value of €10). At the other Crowne that I frequent, I get a voucher for the mini-bar or a bottle of local wine ALONG with the upgrade if available, so by offering me the 2-drink voucher, this hotel is saying my platinum status upgrade is (over the course of my 4-night stay) worth €10 or €2.50 per night. I would argue that the upgrade should be of higher value AND at other hotels of this chain, I receive much better benefits for my higher status.
Overall nothing has changed in the last 2 years since I have been here. The menu in the bar is the same, which is ok, but having had each main course at least once in my stays, it could use a revamping.",3,2012,12,02
250,Excellent on every level,"I literally couldn't fault this hotel. The room was comfortable and well equipped with lovely toiletries etc. huge bed and no external noise.
Great food- an exceptional choice of everything you could possibly think of!
Great service, plenty of staff and all happy to help.

Couldn't recommend enough and it will definitely be my first choice when in Dublin in the future. ",5,2012,12,01
250,EXCELLENT,"just stayed here on route to south america...booked king size exec room which was excellent, fantastastic access to the club lounge.....staff very welcoming and efficient. room service great and good value for money....if yopu want to de stress before a long journey this is you hotel. many thanks to all the stadd and happy christmas barbara holloway wits end crosshaven cork",5,2012,12,01
250,Great option,"We stayed here for a six nations match in town and unlike the rugby the hotel was very good. Good efficient bus transfer to and from airport, convenient local buses to get into town, though make sure you take an express bus or you’ll be stopping every 100 yards.

Comfortable executive rooms, acknowledged IHC priority club platinum status with upgrade which is always nice and the breakfasts were hearty and fresh.

Some confusion on bill upon check out and they could have really done with an extra hand on reception at night. Other than that a nice oasis at the end of the night away from the madness of town and perfect for the early morning flight home.",4,2012,11,29
250,Possibly best hotel in the area of Dublin Airport,"Stayed a number of times now and used it at other times for morning and lunch meetings. 

Very few negatives, if any really, about rooms, services, staff and food. In fact, buffet breakfast better than most similar grade hotels. 

If there's a downside it's that there is not much within walking distance in the evening.  However the hotel bar is well run and lively. 

During the day there are nearby shops and cafes. There's also a fine park opposite suitable for a run or walk. 

No hesitation in recommending. ",4,2012,11,26
250,Classy,"We only stayed here for our last night before returning to the states, because we wanted to be close to the airport for a morning flight.  We found it to be excellent.  (Not sure how well this would have worked if we'd wanted to go into Dublin a lot from there.)  It felt like a much more expensive place than it was.  They probably cater to business people, so weekday rates may be much higher.  Check-in and check-out were both quick and easy.  The room was very chic, the bathroom was modern and clean, and we could not have asked for more.  We also didn't notice any airport noise, which had been a concern.  This sounds like a small thing, but I tend to take the stairs, and their stairs were not antiseptic stairwells, but carpeted stair cases with nice artwork on the walls.  It felt classy.  Two tips: 1) If you have the choice, go ahead and include breakfast in your room rate.  There doesn't seem to be much else around and their breakfast buffet was extensive, including an omelet station.  2)  If you're getting a flight the next morning and have a rental car, return it the night before and get the hotel's free shuttle back to the Crowne Plaza.  Then take the free shuttle back to the airport in the morning.  You'll save yourself one night's parking fees and the next morning will be much more relaxed.",5,2012,11,23
250,"Clean, good service, checkout took significantly longer than normal","Stayed one night here on business.  Check-in was efficient and courteous.  The room was a bit cramped, but elegant.  Tried the hotel restaurant for dinner and breakfast, great service, the food was delicious.  Check-out took awhile, both as a result of waiting in line and slow service.  Nonetheless, I would stay here again for a short trip on business.",3,2012,11,17
250,Good choice if you do not want to stay in the city center,"If you want to stay in the city center of Dublin you can either stay in a stripped down, sometimes cold and mostly very small hotel room, or spend a fortune for the luxury hotels. If a 25 minute bus ride for € 1.80 one way is no problem however, this hotel is a very good choice. It features specious rooms, a so-so fitness center and all the other amenities you expect from a Crowne Plaza. Breakfast is quite expensive but definitely worth the money.",4,2012,11,17
250,"Crown Plaza Hotel, Northwood, Dublin","i have stayed here on 4 different occasions. Each time we were greeted with friendliness and the impression that the staff were eager to assist in any way possible. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. An executive room is plush and very comfortable.some rooms have lovely views over the nearby mature trees. a huge plus for my wife is the proximity of Ikea, only a few hundred  meters away.",5,2012,11,13
250,business stay,i have just returned from dublin where i stayed at the holiday inn crowne plaza santry this is probably the tenth time we have done a trade show from the hotel conferencing area and all i can say is the staff are  fantastic by far the most attentive staff i have ever been in contact with absolutely perfect    nothing is too much trouble for them   the hotel is in immaculate condition and spotless everything is so organised  even down to being collected at the airport by the courtesy bus   breakfast choice is very good i strongly reccommend this hotel to anyone wether its business or pleasure    i definately will use this hotel again even if it is a little out of my way because you are made to feel very much at home,5,2012,11,10
250,Somewhat above average for a UK hotel,"Close to airport, quiet location, contemporary design and comfortable beds. Bathrooms a little worn. Breakfast not recommendable however lunch and evening menue at the very inviting bar are very good. Gym is not worth mentioning",3,2012,11,08
250,"Great Hotel, Close to Airport","Had an early morning flight out of the Dublin Airport at the end of my trip, so I decided to book a hotel room at the Crowne Plaza since it was near the airport and had a complimentary shuttle.  

The shuttle runs about every half hour between 5am to 1am, which was perfect for for my 7:45am flight.  Finding the shuttle was a bit complicated as you had to go out of the terminal, through the parking garage, across the parking lot, and around a church.  There are directions on the website and a map, so as long as those are handy, finding the bus shouldn't be too much of a hassle.

Check in was very easy and the staff was courteous and helpful.  The room was spacious and clean.  I was happy to see some North American plugs for my gadgets (goodness knows converters are only good for so much).

The lights are turned on by placing the key card in a slot by the door.  The only bad thing is that they don't seem to want to stay on.  I spent a majority of my night running back and forth turning the lights back on.  I've never had this problem before, so maybe it was faulty?  Thankfully I was planning on spending the majority of my time sleeping, so it didn't put me out too much.

Overall, the hotel is nice, the staff is pleasant, and the rooms are clean and spacious.  If one needs a place to stay to catch as early flight, I would definitely recommend the Crown Plaza Northwood.",4,2012,11,05
250,An excellent hotel - and great restaurant,"I travel fairly frequently to Dublin for work and had stayed at other hotels before, without being impressed.  This hotel was pretty much faultless - a really nice surprise for an international brand hotel (brands often have quite varying standards).

I stayed mid-week, for just one night and 3 of us ate in the restaurant.  We only had main course and drinks but were given fresh, warm bread (really good) and complimentary soup.  The food was fresh, good sized portions and tasty, and the service was even better, with the waitress having just the right amount of familiarity/humour to make us feel welcomed and comfortable, without her intruding into our space.

My bedroom (303) was a good size, clean and comfortable, with a great walk-in shower.  

Free WiFi is a real bonus that gives hotels a competitive edge.

But why are hotels so poor at lighting bedrooms and bathrooms?????  Soooo annoying.  There was an iron, safe, independent heating/air con and even a window that opened (so many windows don't open in hotels).

Unfortunately, a resident tried to demolish the room next to mine (i think) in the middle of the night, in a drunken stupor, which disturbed my sleep and this continued for some time, until the management/Garda (?) dealt with him.  Clearly this isn't a regular 'feature' for the hotel and I was just unlucky (but not as unlucky as the man's girlfriend!).

The hotel price was reasonable and food, as always in Ireland, was a little expensive.

Check out was quick and by a courteous reception team.

I will definatley stay here again and would recommend it to others.",4,2012,11,02
250,Great for families,"Stayed at the hotel on Sunday night as it was convenient to city centre for marathon.We had our 2 children with us.Lovely hotel, great location and exceptional value.We had food in the bar which was excellent, great choice for breakfast. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.Highly recommend this hotel",5,2012,10,29
250,Excellent Stay,"Staff was friendly, rooms were excellent, and food was good.  I got sick in the room and staff quickly booked a local doctor for medicine.  Customer service was very helpful during this time.  The room was excellent with easy transporation to and from DUB.",5,2012,10,29
250,Airport hotel of choice,"Had an early flight to catch so stayed here. The airport shuttle runs on a timetable approx every 30 mins and I just missed the one I had planned on catching. The front desk called a cab which came quickly but did cost 10 euro to get to departures. 
Service in the hotel is pleasant with a multi national staff. Rooms are clean and well appointed and the internet seemed to work well on this occasion. Breakfast is buffet style and had several servers on hand for tea and coffee. Overall a good choice for an airport hotel or for those who are used to Crowne Plaza type properties and like access to the lounge etc. Note as with most European properties, lounge access does include free alcohol while the lounge is open.",4,2012,10,29
250,Good place to stay close to the airport,"This hotel is 5-10 minutes drive from the airport.  But it is a 20 minutes ride from city centre.  I stayed here only to be close to my meeting location.  That said, the hotel is very comfortable.  The rooms have comfortable beds, clean bathrooms, and good internet connection.  The food at the restaurant can be better, however.",4,2012,10,28
250,very close to the airport and nice interior,"Great hotel. Very close to the airport and they provide a complimentary shuttle bus from and to the airport. You couldn't guess that the airport is near, it's very quiet and there is a beautiful park next to the hotel.
There are different sockets in the room no matter which country you are from.

nice interior, very pleasant stay.

my only complain that there is no hair-dryers in the bathroom.",5,2012,10,23
250,Good Value,"Stayed in club room for one night prior to trip to Madrid.
Easily found and covered parking available for 6 euros a night.
Very nice room with all that you would expect from Crowne Plaza.
Club lounge small with reasonable drink selection, but very few nibbles.
However, quite adequate. No breakfast on Saturday morning....weekdays only.
Thanks to reviewers who recommended the Oriental restaurant close by. It was excellent.
It's a good airport hotel and free shuttle to airport is a bonus ( eg Heathrow is £4  per person per way )
A good choice if you can get a reasonable rate.",4,2012,10,20
250,In need of updating,"Walls in my room had been patched up resulting in old paint and a few brushes of new paint. Bathrooms, in contrast, are in great condition and clean.

TVs are old, fuzzy and non-flat screen and in need of replacing. 

Breakfast is good. Hotel staff are very friendly with the exception of the Bar where service is slow and unfriendly.",3,2012,10,19
250,Good place for a business traveller....,Great pick hardly  a distance from airport..... Rooms are beautifully done and equipped with all basic amenities. Breakfast is great except the nuts served with cereals. The nuts were old and smelly. The fresh made to order items were good. Staff is helpful and cooperative. The pro pert is nice and well maintained.,4,2012,10,19
250,Nice property just ten minutes away from airport,"Nice property just ten minutes away from airport. In case you are planning a long stay at Dublin then this hotel can be skipped as it takes twenty euros one way to the city centre Dublin, but fir business travelers on a short trip is a great pick. Rooms are spacious and chic. Breakfastspread is nice but they can check the quality of nuts they serve. They were old and smelled awful. Otherwise good spread of Irish breakfast.",4,2012,10,19
250,Nice room and great breakfast!,"Stayed one night before flying back to Canada after another great trip to Ireland, North and South.
Reception was friendly and professional after a pleasant shuttle bus from the airport - we had our bus drop us at the airport to access the shuttle rather than take a taxi from downtown.
Had lunch in the bar while waiting for our room - food and service excellent and not over-priced. Room very clean and comfortable.
We always seem to get good service where-ever we stay. This may be a reflection on our treatment of the hotel staff as much as their natural demeanor. You do usually get back what you dish out!!",4,2012,10,15
250,Amazing 1 night break,"My boyfriend surprised me with a say here in the Harmony suite for my birthday. The suite was amazing! Had everything you would expect and more. Loved the massage chair and jacuzzi tub. We ate in the restaurant and it was easily in the top 3 meals I've ever had. I would really recommend the lamb! Very fairly priced too. Dagmara our waitress was the best I have come across. It emerged that my boyfriend proposed while staying in the room! The hotel were amazing! I never suspected a thing and they made sure to keep everything a surprise. They even kept the fact that the room was a suite a secret. The manager also gave us champagne when he heard our happy news! Julia, Beth and another girl (name escapes me) were fabulous! They really helped make everything special. I would highly highly recommend this hotel. Crowne Plazas are always amazing.",5,2012,10,14
250,Convenient,"We decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel for one night as we had a flight home early the next morning.  Arriving at the hotel around 1 pm we were informed that rooms were not yet available for check in (obviously a busy weekend with the Donegal/Mayo football match).  We were able to label and store our luggage at reception while we drove to the airport to return our hire car. We were handed a rather poor map of where to find the ""regular"" hotel shuttle bus to return from the airport. 
At the airport it was disappointing to have to wait well over an hour in the cold (pick up was quite some distance from the terminals) for the hotel's courtesy bus in order to return to the hotel.  All the while we watched buses from other hotels pull up and depart.
Otherwise, the hotel staff were pleasant enough, and we were happy with our room.  The room was spotless, the bed very comfortable and it was convenient to have internet access actually in the room, rather than just public areas. Loved the gorgeous fish in the lobby!
We found food and drinks at the bar restaurant to be quite expensive (over 13 Euros for a chicken burger), with limited choices on the food menu. 
Departure on the 6 am courtesy bus was fine, and we were dropped right outside the terminal.
We would stay here again, mainly because it is so convenient to the airport, but next time would check out alternative places to spend the evening.",4,2012,10,11
250,A good choice to stay close to the airport,"Let me start with stating that I am a regular guest in this hotel.

Although the hotel is near the airport, the environment around it is green thanks to a park and several new appartment buildings. noise is thus not a factor.

I have never had to wait for my room, and although most reception staff is not Irish, they are very friendly, speak several languages and are well trained.

Breakfast is typical Anglosaxon, served buffet style. there is an exellent array hot dishes, including very good sausages and black and white pudding.  Omelettes and pancackes can be ordered.
Orange juice is unfortunately not fresh.

The rooms are standard sized and come with all amenities, and the windows can he opened. A real plus in my opinion.
Houskeeping always do a fine job. 
Another plus is the fact that internet is free and available in-room.

The downstaire hotel Pub serves standard pub food with some Asian dishes thrown in for a decent price. I do recommend the Singapore Noodles...

Points to improve:
# no fresh juices during breakfast
# no spa pool or sauna. The fitness facilities are basic.

All in all is this hotel a very sound choice for the business traveller. do remember that Dublin city center is a long bus ride away.",4,2012,10,09
250,Still not impressed,"We keep staying here every year because it is handy to the relatives and the airport and we know the area.  This time we upgraded to a Club room on the fourth floor.  The Club Lounge is useless on the weekends as they don't serve either breakfast or hors d'oeuvres then.  We did have the breakfast buffet in the regular restaurant.  At E11 for continental or E16 for full breakfast, it would have been pretty pricey if it wasn't offered as an alternative to the Lounge and the staff aren't too swift at refreshing the buffet.  The rooms are still small on the fourth floor, with way too much useless furniture in them.  No drawer space to speak of, two thin scratchy towels, cheap duvet and pillows.  Smokers are allowed right in front of the open doors into the hotel.  Now with airport renovations the free shuttle bus drops you off at a considerable distance from the terminal entrance.  Bottom line, we may be looking for another alternative for next year's visit!",3,2012,10,09
250,"Outstanding, Super service.","From the moment we arrived, to our departure we were treated like royalty, through the professionalism, and friendly helpful staff and especially from the hotels general manager Mr Pius Furlong.
We booked a park and fly stay , sadly only staying one night in this beautiful hotel and leaving our car in the hotels secure parking building beside the hotel, our dilemma was that the hotel courtesy bus did not operate until 5am on the morning of our departure and we needed to be there at check in for 4am, Pius took it upon himself to organise a taxi for us to the airport at that time and not only that but also had the hotel take care of the cost of our very short taxi journey to the airport.
This is an exceptionally close hotel to the airport and very convenient for flights and such, it also has a super business conference centre with huge wide open and spacious conference suites with beautiful decor and water features.
Our room was very spacious and everything one could ask for in a fabulous hotel like this and in my own opinion, excellent service and luxury for quiet normal run of the mill hotel rates.
we also dined there in the hotels bar that evening and had a very filling and beautifully presented delicious food for also very reasonable rates .
I would certainly stay here again in the Crowne Plaza Northwood Dublin and would not even consider looking elsewhere , and recommend it as a superior location for either business or pleasure. 
Well done Pius and your team and keep up the great work.",5,2012,10,09
250,Convenient,"This hotel was very convenient to downtown Dublin.  Whether taking a taxi, driving or going by bus...this hotel was located within minutes from downtown.  Our room was not bad...not the greatest...but not bad either.  The water pressure in our shower was a bit slow and we did have to notify the reception area of our broken shower door.  Nothing that they didn't take care of right away.  I found the staff to be very accommodating and the food very good...even for a breakfast bar!  Clean...everywhere I went it appeared all amenities had been updated and the environment very clean!  I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a convenient place to stay in Dublin!",4,2012,10,08
250,Fine if your flying but not great.,"It had been a very long time since we had stayed in this hotel. Recent years saw us using more central Dublin hotels when visiting the city but this one suited better for an early morning exit from Dublin airport the next morning. We booked 3 rooms for a family farewell before the trip.

The hotel is at that stage where the cleaners can only do so much and a refurb should be pencilled into the diary by now. It was a little bit tired and very slightly grubby. 
The room was fine apart from a slight smell when we first walked in. I couldnt quite decide if someone had been smoking in it (it was a non smoking room) or it wasnt quite totally clean but either way had to keep our window open during the stay.. 
Despite being Platinum Priority Card holders and asking for the upgrade that usually brings, we didnt get any so i cant say what the rooms on the ""Club Level"" 4th floor were like.
We had decided to eat and drink in the hotel that night. I didnt fancy the long expensive taxi rides in and out of the city and wanted to be as fresh as possible the next day.
This turned out to be a mistake. 
We eat at the restaurant and had the early bird set price menu.. The vegetarian in our party was very happy with her meal. Three of us opted to pay the 6Euro plus supplement charge for the so called ""rib-eye"" steak. Im not even sure they could have charged 6euro for the tiny slice of rump steak and six chips that we each got. Had this been any other occassion than a very special family event I would have got the manager down for a chat but had to let this one go to prevent the night turning sour.
The ladies wanted port and the hotel said they had run out of the standard stock and only had the 10 euro a glass stuff. I was starting to see how this ""out of town"" hotel was staying in profit.

Now the good bits.
The staff were all excellent. The night receptionist was particularly nice and helpful in allowing me to use the business facilities to print travel documents.
The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the airport which was punctual and seemed regular.

I may stay here again but only when using the airport and only if i got a good deal on it compared to the many other airport hotels in the area. 
Either way I won't eat here again and if staying in future will bring my own bottle of port.",3,2012,10,07
250,Really Nice! Convenient To Airport,"We stayed here for two nights in two rooms and had a pleasant time. It is located in a pretty setting with lovely wooded grounds across the road. Check-in was efficient, friendly, and helpful with information about the area. The lobby area is busy, modern and spacious, with restaurants and bar areas located off of it. Nearby is a secured business center with computers and printers, but wi-fi (good reception) is available in your room, too. 

The Crowne Plaza is located right next door to the Holiday Inn Express, but both hotels share the same parking garage (6 Euro/day). We had no trouble finding a parking spot in the multi-level garage and an elevator took us up to a shared area between the two hotels so we didn't have to go outside. Just a couple minutes away is the Dublin airport, and a block away is a city bus stop that will take you right into Dublin city center, about a 30 min ride for 2.15 Euro. This seemed like a very active hotel, as there were always taxis, shuttle buses, and private cars coming and going. 

Our room was clean, a little on the small side, but it was quite comfortable and had all the expected amenities of a nice hotel. We did find the bathroom lighting a little dim for our tastes, and the toilet did not flush well. We brought this to the front desk's attention, but have no idea if maintenance came by, since the problem persisted. 

Ate dinner in both of the restaurants. Our first night, we tried Cinnabar, which had a lively bar area plus another seating area. Food was ok, but service was a little slow as the place was quite busy. The next night we tried Touzai, which has an Asian influence, and it was much more peaceful. Delicious meal with very attentive service in pleasant surroundings. Breakfast is also served here--buffet, or you can order a full meal--and it was also very good, along with great service. 

Our stay in Dublin at this hotel was most enjoyable and we would definitely return!",5,2012,10,03
250,Good hotel close to the airport,We have stayed at the Crowne Plaza in the past and were disappointed with the service in the lounge area this time.  It seemed the staff were more concerned with the very small wedding reception serving them punch instead of caring for the customers that were there.  The food was ok but not as good as we have had in the past!  The rooms our comfortable and clean!  The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly. The breakfast is ok but nothing to brag about.  Coffee was very bitter.  I feel the next time we visit Ireland we will think very hard about making this our last stop prior to the airport due to the service in the lounge area!,4,2012,10,02
250,ticks all the boxes as business hotel,"Came here for 1 night to attend a conference. Normally airport hotels feel a bit grim but this one if nicely appointed with free wifi and a good choice of TV channels. Amazingly the bar food was really tasty and for 11 Euro the Thai chicken was probably the best meal I have eaten in a hotel bar.  
Not sure I'd stay here on a tourist trip but certainly come here for business again.",4,2012,10,01
250,Really nice hotel,Myself and my girlfriend stayed here and I have to say that this is a really nice hotel. We attended a show in town and it is only a short taxi ride into the city center. Staff are very friendly and the room was very comfortable and clean. Would highly recommend this to anyone.,4,2012,09,26
250,Good hotel,"I stayed here one night on a business trip. It's located a bit off, but there is a very good chinese restaurant next door. It's a business hotel and I stayed on the executive floor with lounge access. The lounge was a bt of a disapointment compared to wht it can be in some places, it also closed rather early. Breakfast was good. I would come back if I'm not staying for long, then I would prefer to be down-town.",3,2012,09,25
250,one of the best hotels i have stayed in,"this hotel is just a little way out of central dublin (about a 15 euro cab fare) but worth staying at. the rooms are fantastic, the staff friendly and can not do enough for you. the bar service is great as is the food",5,2012,09,25
250,"Neat and Clean rooms,Poor staff courtesy.","We stayed in this hotel during my holiday with wife for 2 nights, the hotel is well situated out of the city though very close to the airport. Honestly, we were expecting the overall staff courtesy and hospitality far above others, however the entire experience right from the courtesy pickup from the airport to check out left us disappointed. The driver who came in his minivan to pick us up was in a tearing hurry to dump the bags in the boot, there was no greeting, no smile - left us thinking if this complimentary service is more of an unpaid burden. We reported at 10:30am to the reception, we were told (yet again by a stiff faced receptionist lady), that rooms were being cleaned and thier standard check in time was 12pm, excuse me?? If your rooms were being cleaned and accepted, that we reported early - the least they could have done was to offer us some sort of comfort while we wait for the room. There were other disgruntled guests too with a similar fate, around an hour later we checked again with the reception - who simply handed over the keys to us and took my details, this time a different lady who seemed a little happy. We were left wondering if it was left to us to follow up for the rooms that we have paid for? 
At the breakfast hotel, we ordered for a Vegeterian omelette at the live counter where the chef made an unwelcome joke about how a Vegeterian Omellete is not really vegeterian and even joked about it with another guest in front of me- NOT DONE and uncalled for ! 
Location-wise the hotel is out of the city and takes 30mins by bus and 20 mins by Taxi - a big drawback, expecially if you want to enjoy Temple Bar and the likes. We felt unwelcome at this place except that the rooms were flawless, with a well equipped mini bar, clean sheets and nice new sets of tv. If you have to sleep for a night - go for it, but considering the experience that I had, even if its a one-off, take a look at hotels in the city !",3,2012,09,23
250,Busy 4 Star Hotel...,"I use this hotel Or it's 3 star sister next door when travelling to and from my overseas work in Africa. Which hotel I use is dependent on the web price offered, this time it was Crown Plaza had the better deal. I also get points for staying in either on my club card. I have read some of the reviews here on the Crown Plaza, the majority are good and of course some have constructive feedback for the management. Some reviews are over the top in criticism of the hotel and it's architectural design, which is totally out of the Managements control. A lot of people forget what they are renting when they check in to a hotel room. I seen one review complaining about the size of a bar of soap! The most important thing in a room is the bed! After that it's the food, and of course very important nowadays is wi-fi which is really an expected utility with water and electricity. However their are some people who you cannot please and I have met plenty in life. This hotel is up to standards. The king room is excellent, well appointed and very clean. The staff are attentive and friendly. The food I had no complaint. I would give this hotel a 9 out of ten on a four star. Their is a draft blows into the bar from the outer doors and you can feel it on your feet and legs. This will not stop me coming in, as it's a design flaw. Inner doors are required to stop this happening and the management can approach the owner for capital expenditure in the next budget. Overall the hotel is warm and has a great atmosphere for an airport hotel. My one single complaint actually is not about the hotel per say but the shuttle bus service from the airport. Today 21-09-12 I stood at the terminus for a good one hour watching every conceivable hotel shuttle come and go many many times in an hour. In the end I got the number from another guest and rang the hotel to complain. This was my first time experiencing this on my travels through DA. Another 20 minutes passed!!! As I was on the second call two buses arrived!!! For the Crowne Plaza.... The front office staff apologised on arrival and told me the bus goes on the hour every hour. Fair enough, however I have not seen this info anywhere on my reservation confirmation email, unless I missed it. This will not put me off staying here as all organisations have problems with staff be they big or small. However it's worthy of note that I was very unhappy losing one hour of rest time in my nice room, giving that I have to check out at 5am for my 6.30 flight to Frankfurt and onwards to Africa... This little hick up needs attention and fast as. Once per hour is not acceptable to be hanging around the airport bus terminus, when all the other big brand hotels are back and forth in quick succession. Come on Crowne plaza please get up their with Hilton, bewleys and clarion. They came by so many times for their guests. I look forward to my next visit and hope this will never repeat itself if cp are to retain my custom... Other than this a fantastic hotel.",5,2012,09,21
250,Crowne Plaza,"we stayed here for 2 nights, the hotel itself was lovely the decor and the layout was lovely. the receptionist was lovely and very helpful. the staff in the bar were extremely helpful, the only dissapointment was the shuttle bus back from honeymoon we waited over an hour and then a little bus arrived and people were still left standing beacuse the bus only carried 8 ppl which was so silly sending a 8 seater to the airport. i didnt even know there was a spa or a swimming pool or i would of been in it, it is not clearly stated or said.",3,2012,09,21
250,Perfect location,"If you are flying out, or just hanging out, this is an excellent location.  The rooms are very spacious, the service is spot on, and very friendly.  The Irish are so very friendly and they know how to make you feel welcome.  We were tired and a little jet lagged and room service was in order or us.  We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2012,09,20
250,Business trip 4 nights stay,"Stayed 4 nights in this hotel - it is a bit isolated but you can walk in the park across the road there is a small shopping area and a chemist 10 mins walk up the road. 

Used the Airport shuttle which was only a 10 minutes ride - very handy. Reception staff friendly no problems for directions, ordering taxis etc. Good food at the bar - great service with a smile and nice desserts. The room was spacious with a large comfortable bed - bathroom was also a good size but a bit dark. Housekeeping no complaints always had my refills of coffee and milk and towels. Nice working desk with a continental plug fitting and very good reliable internet connection which was essential on this trip. Never made it to breakfast so I can't judge it

Corridor noise was a bit of a nuisance - door sound proofing could probably could be improved. Room chairs were not the most inviting and should propably be re-newed 

Ideal for a business trip and I would stay here again.",4,2012,09,20
250,Eat at the Mandalay next door when you stay at this hotel,"We spent our last night in Ireland here before our flight to the West Coast of the USA. The hotel was fine and the room was great with very comfortable beds and excellent room amenities. We could not find anything that we liked on the menu at the hotel restaurant and asked the hotel for a restaurant recommendation. They told us about the Mandalay restaurant which is located 2 doors down from the hotel. Next door is the Holiday Inn Express and next to that is the Mandalay, which is a Chinese/Thai restauarant. It was the best meal that we had  during our Ireland vacation. We can highly recommend staying at the Crowne Plaza if you need an airport hotel. If you decide to stay the night there, have dinner at the Mandalay Restaurant nearby for a great meal.",5,2012,09,18
250,Great hotel but needs some love and attention to detail,"Overall a nice hotel, but was let down by the little things, for example, on check in no papers offered and only one key for a double room given. On check in had requested some bubbles but not there so had to go back down to reception. In the club lounge on only two small plates of canapés there however these had all gone before we arrived, on request for some the answer was we cannot get any more. On discussing further we were fetched some crisps. Then at dinner ordered a bottle of wine and they had run out, so picked another one and that too had all been sold, eventually went for third choice and,  yes you guessed it. However the head man was great and all was taken care of satisfactorily and the food was excellent. It seems the recession may be hitting places like this so manage it better.  The location was a way out of town but the busses were frequent and good into town but getting back meant that you could only find the one bus out, this was the slowest one (16). Would recommend you find the other bus stops as these did not go around the houses. The transfer to the airport was quick and as i said overall a great experience but let down by small things.
Please note the rooms were excellent butt again let down by noisy neighbours at 0500 but it was Dublin and the weekend. Be safe",3,2012,09,18
250,Nice hotel but little things let it down,"Stayed in a twin room, two nights.  Room was very small. Chairs had to be pushed between wall and bed to fit them in which ment they couldn't be used. Bar food was very good but bar was cold and we couldn't take our jackets off. Breakfast room was also very chilly and breakfast was very busy, staff running around, hectic atmosphere, not at all relaxing.",3,2012,09,17
250,Crowne Plaza Dublin - Close to Airport with Shuttle,Crowne Plaza -  I enjoyed the Crowne Plaza if only there for an over night stay.  It had shuttle service to the airport every 30 minutes or so.  Quick trip to the airport.  Also had a bar inside the hotel with comfortable eating places inside with a few Large screen televisions for viewing television while I surfed the web with the wifi.  The room was a bit of a tight squeeze but it was the least expensive.  There is inside separating the lobby from another cozy out of the way place to relax a beautiful aquarium that provided nice viewing while waiting for dinner to be served.,3,2012,09,14
250,"A little bit outside the city, but still a very good choice","In the Dublin city center good hotels are quite expensive but you are within walking distance of all sights. The Crowne Placa hotel is a little bit outside the center, close to the airport, but for a fair price you get excellent quality here. Due to the fact that there is a bus station nearby, this hotel is still worth a consideration when planning to see Dublin.",4,2012,09,13
250,"Great, contemporary hotel.","We stayed here for one night, August 26th as we had an early flight from Dublin airport next morning. We arrived mid afternoon and were able to check in straight away. Check in was swift and easy and before we knew it we were in our room. There were 4 of us, so there wasn't a lot of room, but seeing as it was only for one night, we didn't mind. 

The hotel was beautiful and within a great location, the beds were comfy, the halls were bright and the wifi was free. Another bonus was the free airport shuttle bus that the hotel provided, we used to get to the airport and Mum and Dad then took it back to the hotel after seeing us off, another nice touch. 

Although it was only a quick stay, the price was good and the location was brilliant for anyone going to the airport, I'd definitely stay again and recommend it to others. 

Steph.",4,2012,09,09
250,Unless your desperate stay somewhere else,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights. The room was too small for two adults. They bathroom appears fine until you attempt to take a shower or shave. The hot water in the sink is so weak that its hard to shave. The shower pressure is so weak that it takes time to actually get your entire body wet. My wife couldn't wash her hair because the water pressure wasn't strong enough to wash away the soap. They provide you with one ""Oreo cookie"" size bar of soap. Barely enough for one person. When we brought this to the attention of the hotel personnel we were told that the lack of pressure was because in the early morning most of the guests were showering. The water pressure didn't change during the numerous attempts throughout the day and night.",2,2012,09,08
250,Great Hotel,We were not sure about staying so far away from city center when we came here for the Navy vs Notre Dame football game BUT it was so easy to walk down to the corner and catch any of several buses to the center and back.  Rooms are American size as well as bathrooms which is so nice.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Beth checked us in and was very nice in giving us information and Orlando was great in being helpful with bags.  He even called me by name when I came back to the hotel and asked how my day was while out.  Breakfast was definitely a full one with an omelette bar.  Great big regular bar also.  Closeness to the airport is a plus when coming in and leaving.  Nice to get to a quiet area from the bar area after the game and then the Gaelic game the next day.,4,2012,09,02
250,Perfect for airport stay,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for one night in early August, our last night in a week-long tour of Ireland. We chose it for it's rating and convenient location near the airport. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and we found the room very cozy and warm. The bed was very comfortable, there were many pillows, and the room was a good size. We also had a bathtub, stand-up shower and very nice bathroom. The neighborhood also looked fairly nice, which you don't often find near the airport. 

The restaurant was good, I had a steak and my partner had a leg of lamb, we both really enjoyed our meal. The au gratin potatoes were especially a treat. I thought it was a nice touch that the staff also brought me a sorbet as a starter for free as I did not order one and my partner did. 

We have stayed at other Crowne Plaza hotels before, and this one was consistent with our experience of the hotel chain being a good one. 

My only small complaint is that there is no mini fridge, only a mini bar that has computerized sensors, therefore we could not refrigerate our juice. I did put it on ice, but unfortunately by morning it was warm (we had purchased our own breakfast as we were leaving very early for the airport). We found this to be the case in a lot of Irish hotels, although I'm not sure why.

Overall, good stay, met our needs perfectly.",4,2012,08,30
250,Friendly staff,"I stayed here with my husband and daughter for one night on Saturday 25 August as we were in Dublin to see the Tall Ships and of course, to shop. We were checked in efficiently by a lovely, friendly receptionist called Beth, who couldn't have been more welcoming. Our room was clean, spacious and modern with everything you could need.  Breakfast was a treat and again, the service was good.  The two gentlemen who welcomed and seated us at breakfast were again, friendly and professional.  I will be recommending this hotel to family and friends.  I look forward to staying here again in the not to distant future!",5,2012,08,27
250,Highly recommended,"We stayed here the first and last nights of our trip.  It's very convenient to the airport, yet far enough away to have some charm.  We didn't get a chance to explore the park across the street but I would have liked to.  The decor, save the elevators, is pleasant and clean.  The elevators were good for a laugh... for some reason they are the tackiest ever, which just added to the charm. 

I found the desk staff very friendly and efficient, much appreciated when you arrive super late and exhausted. Our first night there we were upgraded to an executive suite which was an amazing treat.  One of my sons slept in the massage chair and the other felt like a king while watching TV in the bathtub.  The hotel itself has all the amenities you need for convenient travel.   The breakfast staff was charming, and the breakfast buffet and tea hearty and delicious.

I did hear someone at the desk talking about their room being noisy.  The desk staff said some are noisier than others so this might be something to ask about.  We had no trouble in this regard.",4,2012,08,26
250,Really Nice,We waited here on the first night of our holidays and it was a great start. The staff here are really friendly and the Family room which we had was very clean. We ate in the hotel restaurant which serves really nice food and reasonably priced as well. The Rib eye was perfect and cooked as I requested it. The waiter was really nice to our daughter and brought her some colours and a colouring book. For desert she wanted really chocolate ice-cream and he gave her some chocolate ice cream with extra chocolate sauce!! Breakfast was typical of any of the Crowne Plazas plenty of everything and the areas were nice and clean. I'd liked the idea of the takeaway coffee machine which alot of guests seems to avail of (i didn't have any myself). The hotel its self is located in a residential complex area and there is also a holiday inn right next door. It is quite close to town and the botanic gardens are only about 6 mins from here. You can see Ikea accross the field from the entrance of the complex. Overall its a great hotel but not a place to wait if its a lively night you're after as its quite far away from that sort of stuff. I would definitely wait here again.,5,2012,08,25
250,friendly and efficient,"I arrived at this hotel on a Saturday evening and found the bar packed with a wedding group.
We were checked in quite efficiently  and went to our room. The room was bright and airy, nicely decorated, and very clean. we were situated at the rear of the hotel, and so did not have a decent view.
We went down to the lobby and decided to have some pub grub. Although the staff were quite busy with a wedding, we found the service and quality of food to be very good... and also very reasonable in price.
After a good nights rest, we headed down for breakfast. Breakfast was buffet style. again, the selection and quality of food was very good.
we had a late check out from the hotel, and were dealt with by a very friendly and efficient girl.
Overall, we had a very good experience here.",4,2012,08,24
250,"As a frequent Priority Club traveler, I was impressed...","We book-ended Dublin on our recent trip to Ireland and, after our initial two-night stay here, asked to change our final two nights to this property as well. The location is perfect for both the business traveler and the tourist. There is a beautiful, huge public park on the property perfect for evening walks or morning jogs. It has a very modern style, good-size rooms, wonderfully-appointed, very clean, and loaded with amenities. Curtains allow total blackout, which can be very helpful for the weary and exhausted... While the towels are, as another reviewer pointed out, admittedly less-than-desirable, they are adequate. The food (breakfast and dinner) is excellent -- breakfast buffet is plentiful and delicious, providing enough choices for even the pickiest eaters. Service in all dining areas is top-notch without being overly intrusive. Just the right touch. Pyotr and Michelle take great of their customers at the bar/restaurant, and the food is fantastic (highly recommend the curry!). Breakfast in the Club Lounge is well attended to by Kathleen. Front desk staff are highly courteous and professional, and extremely helpful - one young lady (whose name I regrettably didn't catch) broke down some bills for us and gave us a little plastic bag with just the right bus fare for four trips for both of us. We still had the little bag when we returned over a week later, and she once again counted out eight bus fares. Another front-desk staff member lent us her personal umbrella to go into town when an unexpected rain caught us unprepared. Little touches like these count for a lot, separating run-of-the-mill properties from those that rise above and that you actively seek out. Crowne Plaza Northwoods is definitely on that list for us. We look forward to our next stay!",5,2012,08,22
250,Ideal for Early morning flights,Booked a double room for an early flight from Dublin Airport - room was perfect and very clean.Only slight complaint was air con but that was minor enough. parking is very close by although for flight I booked the long term Red At Airport for 7.50 per day v 6.00 for Crowne - under the pretext that crowne shuttle is every 30 mins v every 10 mins for Red Car park. Overall can't fall Crowne - will stay there again.,4,2012,08,19
250,Nothing wrong that a complete change of staff wouldn't cure.,"This hotel facility is perfectly fine and located conveniently to the airport.  However, everything about the hotel was more difficult than it should have been.  It was difficult to park, the airport shuttle was hard to locate and ran infrequently.  The restaurant was noisy, the food was indifferent, and our waiter couldn't have cared less about our meal.  A different attitude from the entire staff could transform this place.  It reeks of bad management.",2,2012,08,18
250,It's an Inn - not an Hotel,"I could never understand why hotel chains like Crowne Plaza would never allow themselves to conduct such a neglected place in the middle of town but in the Air Port - it is ok. Why travellers who wish to spend a night near the air port should sleep in an inn! yes. Dirty place. No hot water !!! is it enough...?
Go sleep in town. Take a taxi in the morning. It will take you couple minutes more but it worth it.
By the way - the shuttle bus from the hotel takes longer than you expect...about 15-20 minutes d2d, because it stops in other places and last stop is 300-400 meters from the terminal entrance, so take it also in account.",1,2012,08,18
250,Will use again,"The hotel is very nice on appearance very clean the room was laid out nicely and the bathroom was spotless. 
Only a couple of minor faults but it could have just being one of those days. When we returned in the evening I went to the bar to get drinks for the children to take to bed but although the bar was not overtly busy there was a queue to be served and only one staff member to serve us all. I actually went to reception to ask for my drinks to bypass the queue. 
Also one other small thing in our bathroom we only recieved one shower gel and one shampoo and as there was 4 of us this was rather miserly.
Over all though it was a lovely hotel and the price was excellent. I would definately stay again",5,2012,08,09
250,Very Quiet and Very Comfy,"The bed was huge and really comfy, the room was spotless and quite modern, with a big screeen tv, and the ice machine was just in the hall.  The staff were really nice, I had a problem with the car park and they sorted it out very quickly. 

Its not in the city, but a 5 min walk to the bus stop, where many buses for town stop, so that no problem, and because its not in the city, you have no issues with traffic or people screaming outside your hotel window!

I would defintely stay here again.",5,2012,08,08
250,peaceful,A very comfortable hotel with good facilities. Conveniently close to Dublin Internaltional Airport and set in a quiet leafy green non-residential area close to an industrial park. Service was great and I had two very good nights comfortable and peaceful sleep.A good continental style buffet breakfast. Nice restaurant and bar and a fairly good choice of restaurants (chinese and italian) within a short walk from the hotel.,4,2012,08,06
250,This hotel sets the bar so high that you would never want to stay anywhere else!,"My first stay at this hotel was in 2008. Since then I am hardly impressed by any other hotels and so is my daughter. I have been on numerous bussiness trips around the world and had the priviledge of bringing my daughter with me on some of these trips and stayed at some of the finest hotels there is. I rate this hotel as one of the best I have ever stayed in up there with Jumeirah Beach in Dubai! The decor in the rooms is superb, selection of food at breakfast is wide. My daughter says she had the best omlette at this hotel in 2009! We had no time for breakfast this time around. The rooms are spotless. Friendly staff on check in on the 8th of June....a bit dissapointed on checkout  the next day as one the ladies at checkout totally ignored me as she called the gentlemen checking in on the other que to attend to him first even though i was next in line to be served on the que this lady was serving and I almost missed my flight. I will not let this ruin my experience with this hotel as it was an odd incident! I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,08,04
250,Bed Bug alert!,"Bed bug bites don't reveal themselves immediately, and to be honest I didn't even know what they looked like. They can take up to 9 days for symptoms to show, and I got them from this hotel. I saw 2 tiny little bugs a few hours apart crawling on the bed, but didn't freak out because bed bugs didn't even enter my mind! It's the Crowne Plaza! I just flicked them off the sheet and sort of forgot about it. (They were *tiny* and I had no idea what a bed bug looks like). Now I know they were, and I have several itchy bites on my arm, leg and back. It's a nice hotel, but bed bugs are unacceptable.",2,2012,08,03
250,Good place to stay before flying out of Dublin Airport,"This was our first time staying here and wont be our last. We used this hotel prior to flying out to the US recently. This is a hotel that is of a high standard that we were able to book at a very good rate online
It is located very near the Airport and provides regular shuttles to and from the airport.
We had a room that contained 2 double beds that was very comfortable for the 4 members of our family that stayed here
We ate in the bar that evening and really enjoyed a lovely meal that was reasonably priced
Unfortunatly we were unable eat breakfast as we were flying out early and the breakfast is not available until 7 on a Sunday morning but coffee and tea was available.
There as a shopping centre that contains a cinema on the other side of the park opposite the hotel that is about a 5-10 min walk that we went to on the evening we stayed",5,2012,07,31
250,Great food!,"When in Dublin we usually stay in the holiday inn express, next door to the crowne plaza.  We always eat t the crowne plaza and the food is great.  Great service, good food, reasonably priced and consistently good.  Would recommend the bar food in this hotel.  Have never stayed here so can't comment on the facilities but it looks very good.",5,2012,07,30
250,Great hotel - highly recommend,"Excellent hotel, clean, comfortable, spacious rooms, air con, mini bar etc. 
Ate dinner in the bar- food was very good (try the singapore noodles) staff were very attentive and helpful. 
Great location - could not fault the hotel in any way. 
Will definetly return soon.",5,2012,07,29
250,Avoid the Holiday Inn and Stay Here,"The rooms were quiet and AIR CONDITIONED! a first for our UK trip. There was a mini bar and the rooms were spacious. There was even a 110 voit outlet. Another first for our trip. The bar downstairs closed at 11pm but if you are a guest, you can sit on the lobby sofas and someone will continue to wait on you. The hotel was very upscale for Dublin",5,2012,07,26
250,GREAT HOTEL,"I have stayed here numerous times and I would never stay anywhere else whilst I am in Dublin.

It is a convenient location for the airport with a free shuttle bus. 

I have never eaten in the restaurant but the room service food is a food standard. 

Will be back soon! :)",5,2012,07,26
250,what you expect from a Crowne Plaza,"I love the Crowne Plaza, and this one was excellent too.  The restaurant was fantastic, the location was just minutes away from the airport, and the free shuttle comes by often.  We were moved over from the Holiday Inn Express next door and the staff was extremely helpful.  They even took our bags up to the room for us so we could get to the restaurant before it closed.  Great service!",5,2012,07,22
250,Crowne Plaza ticks all the boxes for Dublin Airport and beyond,"Ok, so Crowne Plaza is in the middle of a large business/appartment area called Northwood Park. Not the most scenic of locations I would have thought UNTIL - I found the very pleasant Santry Demesne right across the road from the hotel with it's lovely running tracks, lots of green space, trees, miniature lake and even a great playground for the kids. Without this very nice park Nortwood Park would be a very soulless place. The park is home to the Morton Athletics Stadium, so lots of fit people running around the place making me look positively obese !! 
Finding the CP by car from the M50 was very easy.  Just follow the directions which are on the hotel website and you won't have a problem.

The Crowne Plaza itself is an excellent hotel, very well appointed and stylish.  As it was the day before our flight out of Ireland on our annual holiday, we treated ourself to an upgrade so I got to watch 'Flushed Away' on TV while having a soak in the bath. (too much information there I suppose).  I would recommend it if the rate suits your pocket.  

The room has everything that a 4* should have.   It had a spacious bathroom with bath AND power shower, although this may only be an option in the upgraded rooms.  Our room on 5th floor, faced the front (main road) but great sound proofed windows meant we had a lovely quiet sleep.
One strange thing about the TV in the bedroom is that it faced sideways to the bed meaning to get a good view, you had to lie sideways on the bed to see it.   Ah well, I suppose there is always the flat screen in the bathroom !
 
Staff are good and we had bar food there last night which was good if a tad expensive. €34 for one sandwich, one noodles and 2 x pints Heineken (Pint Heineken €5.20 at the bar. The very stressed waitress soon chilled out and was very attentive, but it was touch and go there for a minute or two.   The bar was buzzing with incoming and outgoing airline passengers.

There is free wi fi all over the hotel - and no faffing about with secret codes or usernames or passwords or penalties of death if you over use it.   Well done CP on that alone, and that's how it should be.
 
The shuttle bus leaves every half hour and journey time is ony 10 minutes with a 5 minute walk from the stop to Terminal 1 and probably a little longer to Terminal 2.
Lots of space in the bus for luggage and the drivers will assist you with luggage if you need that.   A little tip would not go astray for them as they are very obliging.

The multistorey car park is just a short walk (1 minute) from the hotel reception and the 24 hour rate for your car is €6 which we initially thought was good value but found subsequently that the long term car park at Dublin airport is better value if you book online.

If you do get to stay at the CP don't forget a stroll at the nearby Santry Demesne, it will definitely add value to your stay there.",5,2012,07,17
250,Ideal location for Dublin Airport,"Perfectly acceptable hotel in a good location for late night or early morning arrival/departures.
Offers everything that one would expect from a Crowne Plaza. Very nice private business park type setting, secure car parking, small-ish gym, decent bar with very pleasant Polish barman, functional rooms, good internet connectivity.",4,2012,07,15
250,Very good,"Overall a good hotel and i enjoyed my stay. The service at reception was prompt and courteous and the room was excellent. The only issue i had with the room was the noise from the road however if you get a room to the rear of the hotel you should be ok. The business rooms were good although a little stuffy but overall quite good. The food was very tasty and over my five day stay i didn't get bored of the menu which is a good thing.
The only downfall and the reason i didn't give 5stars was down to the barstaff-all of them, who were the worst i have seen in years. They were unable to serve multiple customers, strolled around in no rush and due to the management there was quite often 4/5 staff who weren't serving customers, standing around idle and one person actually working (slowly)",4,2012,07,11
250,Nice hotel great location for travelers,This hotel is convienently located near airport. Shuttle bus to and from airport every 15 min. The rooms are nicely decorated and very comfortable. The restaurant in hotel is lovely with great food and a early bird special in the evening unheard of in Ireland. Great buffet breakfast and very lively bar in the evening. Many conference rooms for business. Good experience.,5,2012,07,10
250,Excellent hotel,"stayed here for a weekend recently. We really liked this hotel.  beautiful rooms, really comfortable king size bed and hotel was in a great location. Breakfast was definitely four star quality. The only negative i have about this hotel is the fact that you have to pay for parking. i would understand this if i was parking and flying but not for mini breaks.",5,2012,07,08
250,Great stay near the airport,"We stayed here on our last night in Ireland and found the location to be ideal for that.  We dropped our rental car off in the evening, so that we wouldn't have to take the time in the morning before our flight. The shuttle service from the hotel to the airport is quick and easy, just a few minutes drive.

The hotel itself is quite large, but despite the fact that it was fully booked, our room was completely quiet.  The rooms are modern and nicely decorated, everything is very clean.

We had dinner in the restaurant which was very good, and received excellent service from Piotr, our server.

Definitely recommend this hotel as an excellent jumping off point for your vacation in Ireland, or as a last stop before heading for home.",5,2012,07,06
250,Near Airport,We stayed here on our first night in Ireland and found the check in very good.  Room was large and very clean with opening windows.   Beds were comfortable but doonas were to heavy I found this to be the case both in England and Ireland.   Pillows were good.   Breakfast was good with a good choice of food and eggs were cooked as required.This hotel is close to the airport but didn't have any trouble with aircraft noise.    There is a small shopping centre in the same area but about 3kms away there is a Tesco's  supermarket.   We had a car so it was only a short drive into Dublin City.   We had free wifi as part of our room rate and had no trouble with it.   You get the first 2 hours free in the carpark but the staff will validate your carpark ticket so you can come and go over the 24hour period.,4,2012,07,04
250,One night near the airport,"We stayed here on our last night in Ireland since it was so close to the airport and we had an early flight out the next morning. The shuttle service was very good. We reserved our spots in advance, but the shuttle wasn't full that morning. The shuttle was pretty much on time and we had no problems. The shuttle driver was very nice.
The room had a modern look to it, and was rather clean overall. The shower pan had some stains in it, but the bathroom was the largest I have seen in a hotel in the British Isles. It had both a full sized shower and bathtub. 
The hotel has free wifi, and the desk area in the room even has electrical outlets for not only british plugs, but also american and european plugs which I thought was a nice touch.
I found the bed too hard and uncomfortable, but I experienced this at every hotel we stayed at in Ireland. My biggest complaint was the tea kettle. It was disgusting with stains and green mold growing inside. The tea kettle was definitely out of place in an otherwise nice hotel. 
We also experienced trouble with the mini bar during our stay and a certain item inside. When my husband reported it, the night manager said he would take care of it that night, but nothing was ever done about it. When we told the manager about it in the morning, he was apologetic and very good about taking care of the issue. 
I wasn't really fond of the north side of Dublin, so I wouldn't choose to stay here during an entire holiday, but for being close to the airport, it served its purpose, and was nice for the one night.",3,2012,07,02
250,Used to be one of my favourites.......,"I'm a little shocked and very disappointed with my recent stay, s o much so that this has gone from being one of my favourite CP's, and now i debate if I will stay here again.

The plus sides - very close to the airport, with a frequent courtesy bus service. Staff are great here, always welcoming and friendly.

I had a beer in reception last night, and noted the layer of dust on everything. Going to my club room, I noticed no difference from a standard room. They do not give the SleepAdvantage sets, and have stopped giving the Butlers chocolates, which was a really nice touch. Bathroom was nice but the towels were tiny - certainly not bath sheets, and like sandpaper.

The room was clean but small. Again, nothing to differentiate with a standard room other than better toiletries. 

There are better hotels here in Dublin, and I just don't know if Northwoods is worth the money any more. 

Sad.",3,2012,07,02
250,Excellent value. Perfect for business.,"Located very near the airport.  I got a huge room with everything I could expect for a business traveler, like free internet, iron in the room, etc.

Friendly staff.",5,2012,06,25
250,Business Trip,"The hotel just about makes a very good rating. I stayed in a CLUB room for 2 nights and the room was very well presented and very clean. However there was a fault with the lights on the first night and this did not create a good start, especially as the fault was apparent earlier in the day before I arrived according to one of the staff. The CLUB lounge is a welcome touch and does give a sense of welcome that the foyer and bar area did not. The biggest failing in the hotel is the lack of strong supervision and organisation in the foyer and bar area, once an order is eventually taken paying for it at the end of the meal is an even more fraught process through avoiadable delays. This is not a new problem as I have met many people there over the years and the Bar/Foyer area is the weak point. However why I scored the hotel down was the general feeling of apathy towards the customer which is surprising given the quality of the facilities and accommodation and the poor strength of the wifi. Never can understand why establishments do not focus on this when it is offered as doing it right is an easy job. I would say 7.5/10 is an accurate assessment of the hotel. Two other issues than happen in any establishment are worth mentioning, firstly the teapot and cup served to me in the bar were dirty with stains from previous use that day and the fries were re-heated/cooked having been cooked originally for some time, a heinous offence in my book. Must say has everything it needs to be great but management and supervision is weak.",4,2012,06,22
250,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel on a few occasions, on buissness and am only now writing a review in relation to my recent stay.  This is a great hotel in close proximity to a park and is a quiet location.  I am a light sleeper and asked to change my room near the elevator.  This was no problem at all.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  The bed is very comfortable also and the rooms quiet, ensuring a good night’s sleep.  The bathroom is big containing a separate shower and bath.  The television is old but has the usual collection of Irish and British channels available with one in German.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is one of the best I have experienced, with a choice ranging from full Irish to continental.  There is also a selection of pastries and muffins as well as yoghurt and fresh fruit.  On Saturdays and Sundays, breakfast is served until about 10.30 meaning it can be a leisurely affair.  While the hotel is located a distance from town, the city centre is easily accessible via bus.  No. 41c will take you into O’Connell’s Street, Dublin’s main street.  You can pick it up again at Lower Abbey Street near the Irish Life building.  Be careful at night since there is a limited service.  The journey takes about 20 minutes.  Food is good in the hotel restraint and bar but there is also a Malaysian/Chinese restraint nearby called the Mandalay, which is very good.  The bar in the hotel is always lively.  I have always enjoyed my stay here and will return.",5,2012,06,17
250,Great Hotel & Restaurant,"I had the pleasure to stay at the CP in Northwood each week over a period of some 18 months whilst working on a project at Dublin Airport. It is a modern hotel with a excellent restaurant that specialises in Asian fusion food. There is also an excellent bar, which serves excellent bar meals.
The rooms are spacious and well furnished, those of the 5th floor are the best and its well worth joining Priority Club to get the points and potentially being upgraded.
The staff are all very polite and the service is excellent.
A regular bus service runs between the hotel and the terminal buildings. The hotel is a couple of miles from the airport and so you don't get much noise, but you do have to factor in the short [10 min] bus ride.
This is a highly recommended hotel to stay at.",4,2012,06,13
250,Fabulous,All i can say is WOW what a beautiful hotel...very reasonable hotel hotelcomparison.com i got the room for 60euro and all i can say is wow i would reccomend to anybody:)),5,2012,06,10
250,Very good,Have stayed here a few times over the past couple of months. This is a nice hotel close to the airport. Rooms a big and modern. Service is good.,4,2012,06,09
250,"Excellent Service, Useful Location","I have stayed in this hotel very frequently over the past three years and am still impressed with the standard of hotel rooms,service and the friendliness of staff and management.
Excellent restaurant and bar and good business facilities. The park across the road is a gem for a walk to clear your head in the evening. Top hotel if you need to stay by the airport (free shuttle). Bus ride is approx. 20-30 mins to city centre (depending on time of day, €2.15), Taxi approx.€14.  A four star with five star service levels.",5,2012,06,06
250,"Close to airport, with shuttle service","We stayed here mainly for the airport shuttle service, but were pleasantly surprised.  Very nice hotel.  On the outskirts of town, but nice for what we needed.",5,2012,06,04
250,Great location if u want a shopping trip to ikea.,"I stayed in this hotel for a function recently. I was appointed a room which I had to move. There was a bad smell in it. At first reception weren't overly keen to help, but after I insisted. I was moved.
After that everything was fine. The rooms are lovely. Good bar service, I ate in the bar & again, foor & service was fine.Breakfast is excellent & has a varied variety. I would have no problem in recommending this hotel. It is close to the airport & runs a shuttle service. Car parking is €6.00 per day. It is also very close to Ikea, if anyone was travelling up their for a shopping spree & wanted a hotel close by.",4,2012,06,03
250,Good service,"I booked at the last minute (a meeting had over run and I missed the last flight back to London).  So I arrived late (23:00) and left early (06:30), but overall service and accommodation was good, and the airport location was what I needed.

I was flying back Saturday morning, and when I came downstairs breakfast was not yet open.  However rather than being turned away (which would happen in many places), the lady setting up the breakfast service got me some fresh orange juice and croissants so I wouldn't leave hungry!  To me this was a very positive sign that service and customer satisfaction was a priority here, rather than the rigid work to rule that you get in a lot of European hotels.",4,2012,06,02
250,Hard to find faults,"This was my eleventh or twelfth stay this year at the Crowne. Having left it too late to get in the week before, and being stuck in the Radisson, I was pleased to be be back for four nights this week.

Checkin or out never too long. Nice clean room on the Club Floor. Large comfortable bed. Club lounge a great, chill-out amenity.....usually much quieter than the reception or the bar (occasional hen nights with orange women etc), and perfect for catching up on emails etc.

Ate most nights in the Cinnabar, which was fine.....nice to get a ""welcome back"" from the staff that recognised me. Food was great, even when my order included a re-working of the ingredients of one of the dishes!!! When I get bored of the menu, theres the Mandalay Chinese just a minute away, or the Venice Italian about five minutes walk. Breakfast in the morning for me is quick, which I usually manage with the help of the attentive staff, always ready with tea and coffee. Splenda sweetener on the table would be nice rather than just white or brown sugar. Grapefruit segments are obviously cut up by hand rather than poured out of a tin. 

Now its light in the evenings, theres the park opposite, which I am still to fully explore, but looks large. Hotel a bit stuck in the middle of nowhere if you dont have a car......the shops are a bit too far to walk. Taxis in the rank usually there, but if not the reception will call one for you, but I generally stand by the road and one comes along in a minute.....usually quicker than a called for taxi.

Negatives......well there arent many at all. Dont know why they put a fat old style telly in the rooms rather than an LED on the wall.....would have made a bit more space. Changing the menu in the restaurant and the bar more often would be great. Ahhhh - a real negative......the towels.....the clean towels have a nasty chemical smell, obviously from the dry cleaners.....shake them out first rather than put them straight on the shelf. And theyre a bit small. Finally, its a shame they put more meeting and function rooms in rather than a swimming pool. But still closer to five stars than four. Back next week :O)",5,2012,06,02
250,Great airport location,"Excellent hotel, near airport.  Modern rooms, very comfortable and the food was very good.  Parking was good and it was only 5 minutes down the road to the airport.  You wouldn't know there was an airport so close as there was no noise.",4,2012,06,01
250,one of the best,"Nice hotels have a nice smell, bad hotels have a bad smell, and only the best hotels do not have any smell at all. This is one of them. The staff are not only friendly and helpful, but professional in all aspects - they appear at the moment you need them, and are very polite and friendly without being obtrusive.The food was very good as well.
There are some problems with getting to the hotel in the evening by bus from the city centre, but you can do what my father-in-law did - take an express from the city center to the airport and then shuttle to the hotel. Ideal if you want to have proper rest-beautiful park around,very quiet at night. We stayed in summer 2011 but still cherish our memories. thank you.",5,2012,06,01
250,"Just fine, for an airport hotel","I stayed at this place at the beginning and end of my trip because of it's proximity to the airport and their claim that they have an airport shuttle.  The shuttle came fairly quickly when I first got to Dublin and the hotel served its purpose, as a site to lay my head after a long flight.  The rooms are nice enough ... most of the front desk staff could stand a lesson in courtesy, including smiling once in a while.  Despite requesting to have the shuttle at a specific time for my flight home, it pulled away without us as we were checking out and we were told we'd have to wait.  They showed no concern and we unapologetic when they couldn't reach the driver to have him come back.  We had to pay for a cab, which defeated the purpose of staying in a hotel with an airport shuttle.  To get to and from Dublin center, the hotel is ideally located.  A short walk leaves you on the main road and the bus stop; Dublin center is a quick ride and less expensive than having to take a cab.",3,2012,05,29
250,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here twice, friends birthday & boyfriends. Lil mini break  as we are from Dublin. Lovely hotel. Near to airport and 20 minutes on bus to city centre. Nice park across road from it. Near shops etc too. Rooms are fab & very spacious too. Very clean. Bar food is also good value, sometimes come here for bite to eat. Highly recommended",2,2012,05,21
250,"Nice hotel, very friendly staff","My family of three stayed here and really enjoyed the hotel and the very friendly staff. The room was modern, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. Our room was very quiet and we all slept well. There is also a breakfast buffet provided each morning that was very good. We rented a car so we didn't use any of the public transportation or taxis. The hotel was a good fit for us, but we didn't spend much time at the hotel. Much of the sites to see are about 20-30 minutes away from the hotel",4,2012,05,20
250,Good but nothing special,"My husband and I stayed here on a business trip. It is close to the airport and there is a shuttle bus that runs every half hour to and from the airport which is convenient.  Reception staff are very efficient and helpful but they always seem to be doing three things at once so are very busy. The rooms are nice with a king size bed and two chairs. The bathroom is well equipped but the shower is terrible - the shower is one of the things I rate a hotel on. It is too high up on the wall and the water comes out in a fine mist or a dribble.  We stayed in two different rooms and both showers were the same.  Breakfast was fine. Bar was busy and the staff were pretty slow. Buses run from up the street into Dublin regularly and the trip takes about 30 minutes. Return bus stop is tricky to find but fine once you have located it.  I notice that with other reviews, the hotel general manager writes the same thing each time as a thank you.  This Crowne Plaza feels a bit like that - running to a formula but nothing out of the ordinary.",3,2012,05,17
250,"Lovely Hotel, with a convenient free shuttle service to the airport!","My husband and I stayed at the hotel the night before flying out to Glasgow, Scotland.
We were greeted very warmly at reception despite our late arrival. Actually all staff were lovely, from the shuttle bus driver (who helped with our luggage) to the porters, so I can't fault anyone there!
We were booked on a room-only stay and were given a room on the 3rd floor, which was very spacious. It was beautifully decorated, in keeping with the general japanese theme of the hotel, very sleek, and it had a great bed (which is important since it is kinda the reason why you go to the hotel! lol)! Completely random, but the room had a feature I really loved, it had a set of international plugs, just like an adaptor for any kind of plug you may have, may they be UK/Irish, European or American; given than most hotels charge for the adaptor or make you buy them from them, I really thought this was a great touch!
The room also had all the different conveniences one would expect in Ireland: flat screen TV, ample closet space, tea/coffee making facility, room service (with meal served to your room up to 10-11pm :-)) and lovely big towels!
We had a great night' sleep; the hotel is located in a very quiet part of Dublin, and though close to the airport (10-15 minutes' drive), you don't hear any bit of the air traffic - as a rule in Dublin anyway, staying that little bit further from the airport ensures a better night's sleep and better value!
On arrival, we also had dinner in the bar. The food was really good and priced sensibly. The bar is split in 2: bar proper and more comfortable/intimate sofas with table, which we really enjoyed!
Overall we had a great stay and we would recommend this hotel!",4,2012,05,09
250,"Nice hotel, good location for airport","Stayed for 1 night on business.  Customers were a short distance away so it was excellently located for me.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Room was of usual CP high standard.
Gym was a good size with a view over the park but could do with more CV equipment (only 1 running machine).  Breakfast buffet had everything I wanted and more with an Irish influence.  Had lunch there which was very good as well, service excellent.",4,2012,05,03
250,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza on the 28th April.  The hotel itself is lovely, quite modern with excellent rooms.  The staff at reception and in the restaurant were very helpful.  Breakfast was of a high standard, with good variety and well presented.

We will definitely stay here again……..",5,2012,05,01
250,Lovely hotel to stay in when flying from Dublin Airport,"We stayed in this hotel before flying out to get married and upgraded to an Executive Room. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable if not much bigger than a normal room.
We ate in the restaurant that night and found the food and service really nice.
We had to get up really early for our flight so didn't get to try the breakfast but we would definitely consider staying here again. 
I found the hotels that bit further from the airport are of better quality than the ones on the airport ground.",4,2012,04,30
250,Great business airport hotel,"Very nice hotel if you don't need to stay downtown. It has a few places to eat (recommend the Chicken Cajun Burger!), and a nice big park across the street to go for a run. Executive floor has a nice lounge where you can get drinks and water 24h. Too bad there is only very few snacks and only during happy hour, this could be a possible improvement. The hotel is nice and quiet, close to the airport and about 20-25min from downtown by car/taxi with no traffic, so unless you need to be only in the downtown area, for me is a great option.",4,2012,04,28
250,"Great staff, great stay",Another stay at the Crowne Plaza for work purposes. Excellent staff made this a great stay. Great location on a really quiet site. ,5,2012,04,27

250,4 Star Hotel in a beautiful area,I spent last week-end Friday 21st to Sunday 23rd in this Hotel.  Beautiful surroundings - comfortable rooms - very friendly staff - great choice for breakfast but I was disappointed with the food choice in Touzai restaurant on Friday night,5,2012,04,23

250,Excellent Hotel and Location,"This is a great hotel both for business and leisure. Stayed with my husband from 11-15 April.  Staff are very attentive and food both in the restaurant and bar were excellent. Had a club room on the fourth floor which was spacious and very clean.  We use the IHG a lot for both business and travel and can say that this Crowne Plaza puts many of the Intercontinental Hotels to shame.  Keep up the good work.  

Would highly recommend to family and friends and look forward to returning very soon.",5,2012,04,16
250,couldn't fault it,"Great hotel. Very spacious room, 2 queen beds, very comfy. Great sized bathroom.
Staff friendly and helpful. Great breakfast.

250,Loved the Service in the bar!,"Had a very nice stay with the exception of the waiters in the upstairs restaurante.  One in particular was unfriendly and not helpful at all.  He was not Irish, but was from an Eastern European country, I believe.  My husband and I left the restaurante because of the indifferent attitude and service.  We went to the bar and were treated wonderfully, the Irish barkeeper/waiter was extremely helpful and friendly.  I hope he gets a raise, he deserves it.",4,2012,04,02

250,Lovely modern hotel,"A very nice comfortable modern hotel with amazing breakfasts. Quite far from the city centre but easily able to catch a bus from the end of the road. One night a singer came to the bar which was good entertainment, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms spotless with all mod cons! A very relaxing hub to explore the city!",5,2012,03,23
250,Nice hotel close to the airport and rental car returns!,"We have stayed here the last 2 trips to Ireland the night prior to leaving for the states to go home! Great location close to the airport with great service and food!  The rooms and bathrooms are clean and very modern.   Service is wonderful and they actally have steam irons and ironing boards in the room which is rare in Ireland!  Recommend this hotel for anyone who has a rental car to return or early flight. Dwayne in the Cinnabar is very pleasant and provides wonderful service and good friendly chat (craic)!  Thank you for a wonderful stay again!  Everyone at the hotel is friendly and helpful.  There is a nice park across from the hotel which provides a great walk to unwind after a fabulous trip!

250,This will be my first choice every time in Dublin.,"I stayed here after returning from a trip to England. The buses from the airport only run every hour and we would have had a 45 min wait so we had to get a cab across. Check in was fast and friendly. My room was large and clean and very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and I got a good nights sleep.
At breakfast there was a large selection and it was lovely but what really made my stay was the general mgr who looked after us at breakfast, he was so friendly and had a chat with everyone in the restaurant. He went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed and I can't praise him enough!",5,2012,03,22
250,boring airport hotels? not the Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin-Northwood!,"free shuttle service from airport, large, comfy and very clean rooms with ALL the amenities, extremely friendly and attentive staff and excellent food. can t get much better for an airport hotel.",5,2012,03,22
250,Wont be back,"I booked this hotel on their website as i was attending a function there. I booked a king room for 2 people, & the price was €97 in total ncluding breakfast, so i continued. When i printed off my confirmation there was a extra charge of €15 added for another person. I though i had clicked something by mistake so i went back threw the booking again and the same thing happened again. When i arrived to check in i explained this to the reception & they said thats the way the website is, take it or leave it!!! I thought ok its only €15 & i dont want this hassle, so i left it. The bed was extremely uncomforable & the hitting system started banging at 3am!!
 We had dinner in the bar. Rip off prices, €18 for a steak sandwitch that a burgar in mc donalds was thicker & 5 chips. Breakfast was not wow as all the pastrys & bread were not fresh. 
We Definitely wont be staying here again.",3,2012,02,29
250,Tastiest Breakfast I've had in a long time!,"I was attending a function there and firstly need to say that the function room /area is top notch, the food was great and the service excellent.

The location, while handy for the airport and Dublin is very built up with literally hundreds or apartment blocks and office blocks around. There is a park across the road from the hotel but it's hard to get away from the fact that it's on something akin to an industrial estate. Having said that you come here for great functions, on business or en route to the airport and it's a great choice for either.

The rooms were well maintained and I liked the style which was modern with black surrounds and wood.

The breakfast the next morning was buffet style and plentiful. The potatoes cooked with onions were gorgeous and overall it was in my top 2 or 3 hotel breakfasts, and I've done a lot of breakfast as part of travelling for my job!

250,Great place to stay,I have attended meetings/conferences in this hotel and the facilties were always excellent but this was a social stay.  Check-in was very attentative. Even though we were attending a social function elsewhere there was still a good atmosphere around the lobby at 2 a.m. when we returned. A quite room was requested and this is what we got. The bedroom had a relaxing decor and was very clean. The bathroom was great as it had a very decent size seperate shower (not quite a wet room) and bath. It also had good environmental controls as the window needs to be kept shut unless you like the sound of early morning flights to wake you up.  Good choice at breakfast and for those that need to have a constant coffee/tea intake there is the option of takeways. Will return again in the future.,5,2012,02,21
250,Lovely Hotel & Excellent Staff,"The hotel was lovely - room was excellent, large well equipped.Lunch Bar food was very nice and staff were so helpful. Lovely park just opposite to go for a walk. Really well located close to everything.Attended a function at the hotel the night we stayed - function room &  food was just wonderful. Buffet Breakfast was very good.",5,2012,02,20
250,All expectations met,"The hotel is clean and comfortable. It has an excellent shuttle service to and from the airport.

So pleased to see that the management have responded to our previous comments regarding the menus, these are much improved.",5,2012,02,18
250,Top notch!,"Delighted we decided to book another stay at Crowne Plaza Northwood. Check in was great, very pleasant & helpful staff. The reception area was just as immaculate & stunning as our last stay. The room carries through in the same style as the reception, really beautiful.

The bar is open & spacious, great spot for a relaxing drink. There was also live music the night we stayed but we didn't attend as we had small children. We have stayed here a couple of times & never witnessed any children in the bar as we passed. The reception & bar area are as you would expect of a quality hotel.

 I think the highlight of the stay simply had to be breakfast. My hubby went out to the car to get the baby's pram so I went to the restaurant with the children to wait for him. We sat at our table, as I had the baby on my knee I couldn't get the childrens breakfast till my hubby returned. Seeing our little ones there the Chef (in full white uniform including perfectly puffed sparkling white chefs hat) came over to them & asked would they like a pancake for breakfast. 

My 5 year old twins were delighted to talk to him & told him pancakes were their favourite. It was so lovely of him to come over & really made my girls feel special. The coffee machine at the door of the restaurant & take away cups really are invaluable to those who simply don't have the time for breakfast. There is a car park onsite & the airport is only a stones throw away. We hope to return again during the summer.",5,2012,02,17
250,Pleasant Stay,"Have visited many times over several months when in Dublin on business.  Rooms comfortable and clean, service good.  Food pretty bland, tend to walk to the Mandalay for a Thai rather than eat in the hotel.  Would recommend if you are in Dublin on business.",4,2012,02,11
250,Recent Family stay in North Dublin,"Stayed here as we are attending an event in the hotel conference center. 

Got a great deal on the family room. Found the room to be modern and clean. 
We ate in the Bar, food and Service was excellent, they where also able to catered for my daughters special dietary needs. Very good value as they where running a special offer once you buy two main course the kids meal where free. 

Only negatives:

Gym could with some more equipment and the need to clear out the membership box.

The Breakfast was a bit over priced and as we were up early,  the kids ate very little. Was very pleased on check out then they waived the kids breakfast. 

Overall was good value for money and excellent service from the staff.",5,2012,02,11
250,Forget it,"9.25 pm and hundreds of kids running around the lobby and bar area screaming shouting even with a sign stating well behaved children are ok until 9 pm
Abusive parents couldn't careless
Bar staff couldn't care less
Management not to be seen and when requested didn't seem over keen to sort
And me a Royal ambassador for IHG
Duty manager didn't know what one was???",2,2012,02,10
250,Good airport hotel,"Stayed overnight on a late return from a business trip. Poor start as the shuttle bus was 15 minutes late vs the published schedule which  meant a number of guests were standing around in the cold and rain for 20 minutes. I pointed this out and received profuse apologies, an upgrade and a discount on my car park fee the next morning when I checked out. Rooms are comfortable but no Priority club benefits outside of a bottle of water. The car park is located next to the hotel and has fine wide spaces reducing the chance of accidental damage from swinging car doors.",4,2012,02,05
250,Great hotel.,"We've stayed here on numerous occassions.  It's one of the few hotels that constantly offers upgrades to the executive floor to Platinum Priority Club members.  Rooms aren't huge, but are well appointed with seperate bathtub and shower.  Room service food is good and they executive lounge is a lovely place to relax.  The only slight niggle is toiletries, there is no conditioner.  Overall a great hotel for Dublin airport.",5,2012,02,01
250,lovely,"a lovely hotel , rooms very nice , a great bar and lovely breakfast, the only downside is its not in the city centre.",4,2012,01,26
250,Disappointed between Christmas & New Year,"I'm a frequent flyer and user of hotels including those in Dublin. Thought I'd try The Crowne Plaza as I prefer Club Rooms, Lounge access etc. Online booking was simple and the Club Room rate was very reasonable. But there was a catch!
Firstly the airport transfer bus parking area isn't sign posted, or if it I missed it. It was lashing down, not unusual for Ireland, I'd been travelling all day so I jumped in a taxi. No problem a short ride to the hotel. At the check-in I was advised that due to between Christmas & New Year being 'a bit quiet' the Club Lounge was closed. ""Oh and by the way none of the restaurants are open but you can get something to eat in the bar"".
Now I don't generally object if due to unforeseen circumstances hotels have to change the facilities that they are offering, but clearly the Crowne Plaza had no intention of supplying these services when it took my booking. If I had been advised prior to my arrival that these facilities were not available I may have made alternative arrangements. I have written an email of complaint via their website, so far no response.",2,2012,01,18
250,Ok for business,"Nice hotel situated around 2k from Dublin airport, free shuttle bus excellent when its on time. Rooms clean and tidy. Don't bother paying for a 4th floor executive room they are exactly the same as rooms on other floors except more cramped due to inclusion of desk chair, though you do get daily biscuits. Main gripe is with breakfast, great spread but should start earlier being an airport hotel, supposed to open at 6.30 but never seems to be ready. If you can get a good rate worth a stay as long as your not expecting to see the sights of Dublin which is a good 20 mins away by bus or taxi. Be warned, Dublin is very expensive take plenty euro :-)",4,2012,01,18
250,Quality lodgings,"Really good experience. Helpful and polite staff, great rooms and pleasant atmosphere throughout the hotel",5,2012,01,17
250,Nice Hotel but mind the food prices in the bar,"Stayed here recently, check in really friendly (I think the girl's name was Devi (?)) she was ultra friendly and efficient, even offered me a free newspaper. Nice room, very modern.

Only downside was €16.00 for a burger and FROZEN chips (not even hand cut chips) in the bar. Not exactly good value in this day and age.

Nice stay but just be aware of the bar food prices.",4,2012,01,14
250,Great Airport Hotel,Located in a Residential area on the edge of a park this hotel is only 5 minutes from Dublin Airport (free shuttle). Rooms are spacious  and nicely furnished with a big comfortable bed. Most bathrooms have a large bath and a seperate walk in shower. Food served in the friendly bar until 9 pm and the restaurant is open even later. Friendly and efficient recption staff,4,2012,01,10
250,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here for one night. Got upgraded due to PCR platinum status to a Club room. Brilliant, except the club lounge was shut for 2 weeks over the Christmas period. If I'd booked and paid for a club room I'd have been furious. The room was really very good, hard to find fault, the only strange thing was it had a large CRT screen TV, for a fairly new hotel I thought that very odd.

As the club lounge was shut we went down to the bar. Annoyingly it was packed as 4 large screen TVs were showing a Man Utd game. The noise was incredible, and even sitting in the lobby we could not get away from it. Not what I would expect in a 4 star hotel, though it was undeniably popular.

The next day we were having family guests there for lunch. We were allowed to keep our room till 3pm with no fuss, the staff were very accommodating. Lunch was good, reasonably priced.

Free shuttle to the airport, though the drop off point wasn't particularly great for either terminal!

Would certainly return there.",4,2012,01,08
250,Still nice but not on a Xmas party night!,"I've stayed here on numerous times over the years and have written a previous review.

I still think it's a good hotel for the price but had more than a few niggles this time. Had a room with double beds this time as I had my two children with me , good sized room in good order. The mini bar was locked when I got in and when I rang down to reception they said I needed to leave a credit card in order to access it, I explained I had but it still wouldn't open so they needed someone to come to the room to do it, this took two hours!!!

We ate in the restaurant the first night and it was decent food at not a bad price but there is no atmosphere in the restaurant, we got a table in the back and they had closed one half of the restaurant off so it felt very quiet and dark.

My problems started at about 1.30 am that morning, the hotel holds Xmas party nights throughout December on a Friday & Saturday night and it became obvious I was on a floor with party guests, it wasn't just people returning to their rooms, they were running up & down the corridor shouting and screeching, I did at one time ask them to keep it down but was told in no uncertain terms where to go. I rang reception and to be fair they sent security up quickly who then proceeded to talk really loudly on their walkie talkies making it impossible to sleep.

They got everyone into their rooms but had to come back another 2 times, if I didn't have a 3 & a 6 year old with me I would have demanded a room change but we eventually got to sleep about 6 am! I complained the next morning and to be fair I did get a partial refund but why oh why did they put me on the same floor with all the people attending the party, they really need to re-think their policy at this time of the year to ensure people to get a good nights sleep.

We had breakfast both morning's and it was really good, the staff were excellent bringing hot chocolate for the children and pancakes etc. The bar food is also nice and again nice staff.

I parked in the multi story, I really do think the car park charge should be waived, it's not like it's in the middle of the city!

There is nothing around the hotel but you are not far from Dublin or Swords so it is a very good base. I would stay here again as it's handy and a good price when I go back home but not if there are any Xmas parties on!",3,2012,01,06
250,The best airport hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel many times, often before or after catching flights and in general I'm usually very happy with my stay. The free shuttle bus is convenient and often competitive rates for a nights stay with a few days of parking are offered which are ideal. A taxi fare to the city will cost no more than €20 or there's a bus stop nearby.

On the most recent occasion I booked a rate (directly on the hotel groups website) which includes parking and breakfast for €79 which is good value for this location. Upon arrival I had the usual friendly welcome albeit without any recognition of my Priority Club status or the usual upgrade which was a surprise as the hotel wasn't busy. PC recognition here seems a bit hit or miss but the standard rooms are to a very high standard anyway so not something that'd bother me much. Always had a good nights sleep here and every room I've been in are quiet and pleasant to be in.

Breakfast is fresh and everything you could want is probably in the buffet.

Checking out wasn't to the usual standard on this occasion though; I booked a rate which included parking and upon checkout I found myself arguing about getting my parking ticket validated. The lady claimed that there was nothing on the system that mentioned the parking and that a B&B rate with parking of €79 was impossible. She also said something about staying at the HI Express next door (don't know what this implication was about??). I was forced to go through all my emails and find the booking confirmation which said inclusive parking before the lady believed me. Upon showing her the email she said 'Oh it'd say that in a different screen on the system'. Why she didn't check this and seemed to prefer to debate the issue with me I don't know. 

In my opinion parking should be included as standard here anyway; the other newer Crowne Plaza in Dublin which I have also stayed in several times has free parking and is only 10 minutes away.",4,2011,12,24
250,A month in Crowne Plaza - Northwood,"Let me start off by saying its a business hotel so facilities have to be judged and reviewed accordingly. The staff is very friendly and from different parts of the world so don't be surprised if you find one from your own country :)

The rooms are very comfortable with technical side of it very modern (Phone, Internet etc.), but the wireless accessibility is not guaranteed in the rooms as it is meant for public areas like reception, lobby, meeting room etc. Even the television lefts lot to be desired, it was a plain old CRT and showed only Irish free channels, no sky sports as you might expect.

The GYM is not worth mentioning at all and they seriously need to work on that, Food has limited choice but the quality is very very good.

Like i said its purely a business hotel so the facilities needed for business are top notch, loads of meeting rooms, conference halls all with great facilities and sound system, parking is quiet cheap as well in fact you can park your car here for just 6 Euros / day which is really good if you want to fly out of Dublin somewhere. Drive to the crowne park here and take the free shuttle bus to airport (to and fro).

Overall i would recommend this Hotel for business travellers as its  efficient but not for Leisure travellers as its not in the city and lacks fun facilities.

P.S: There is a lovely park opposite to Hotel named Santry Demense",4,2011,12,23
250,1 night on business,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night on a recent business trip.  The hotel is very close to the airport so was in an ideal location for a quick dash meeting.  

The hotel was very modern and had an upmarket feel.  The tropical fish tanks in reception were particularly spectacular.  The check in experience was quick and efficient, and also allowed me to be charged in sterling rather than euros, which was great for me as it saved the hassle of converting the bills when doing my expenses.

The room was clean and well of a decent size.  The bed was very comfortable and really aided a great night sleep.  The room had a safe and complementary sparkling water, which is a shame for me, as I can't stand the stuff.

The breakfast was a buffet  style arrangement, and was very nice.  I would have liked to have been able to order a freshly cooked breakfast, but this was not available. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.  I can not offer any advice on the evening meal, as was dragged into Dublin by work colleagues and forced to indulge the Irish hospitality.",4,2011,12,21
250,Great!,"Stayed here in Sept prior to airplane departure.  Excellent bar, restaurant, and very good rooms ---very quiet.  Great park across street to walk off jet-lag.  Would stay here again without hesitation.  ",4,2011,12,10
250,Surprising Service in Airport Hotel,"Stayed here for several nights while on a business trip to Dublin City University. As others have noted, the service was really top notch. Friendly reception, restaurant and pub staff.  The rooms were very neat and clean while the lobby has a euro-tech look.  Huge Irish Breakfast buffet each morning, I could only handle it twice, then back to my usually coffee and toast.  Quick cab ride to airport and a free shuttle. One location issue is the distance to Dublin Center, during traffic definitely a 30 minute more commute.",5,2011,12,10
250,good airport hotel,Good clean rooms. Quiet. Near but not on the airport. Helpful staff. Reasonable restaurant. Good value for money,4,2011,11,23
250,Very friendly hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights (Friday and Saturday 28 & 29 October 2011).  We were travelling back from the US to Bristol with Aer Lingus (excellent airline) and decided to see Dublin.   The hotel were great, the greeting when we arrived was very friendly and our room was ready even though it was only 11am.  The room was very comfortable and had all that we needed.  Bed was comfortable and lovely and clean.  Great sized bathroom with bath and shower separate.  Our only complaint would be that on the Saturday night there was live entertainment which did not stop until 1am.  We did pick this hotel because it said it was very quiet, which mostly it was.  If I were to stay here again I would definately ask for a much higher room overlooking the fantastic park.  I would definately stay here again.  The bus is a short walk from the hotel and you can get into Dublin quite easily but get your ""all in"" bus ticket online before you go, it makes life easier.",5,2011,11,22
250,Surprisingly Stunning,"I stayed here for a night while attending a Gala Ball in the Hotel. I wasn't expecting much as from past experiences, hotels near airports tend to be quite basic, but i was pleasantly surprised. I loved everything about this hotel. The service was excellent. The rooms were basic but stylishly decorated with lots of mirrors, which was ideal for is getting ready for the ball.",4,2011,11,14
250,Top notch Crowne Plaza,"Really good CP. I was upgraded to a suite and it was perfect. 
good parking, lovely looking hotel, great service. No complaints.",5,2011,11,13
250,Pleasant Surprise,"We hadn't originally picked this hotel but unexpectedly the in town Holiday Inn suddenly stopped being part of the chain so a quick change was required. I appreciated that the hotel was closer to the Airport than the City but perhaps I didn't realise quite how far out. However, this did not spoil our visit.

Good first point is the airport pick up bus - excellent service and very quick.

We found our room excellent - very clean and kept that way for a four day stay. We found the staff helpful whenever we asked anything of them. Reception was very efficient. Breakfast was good in its class and the hot food was impressively hot on every breakfast.

We used the hotel as a base and had bought a Dublin Freedom Bus ticket for the duration (from the airport) and the hotels position was no problem as there are plenty buses EXCEPT in the evening and later at night. BEWARE you will see far more out of service buses than those on route.

I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.",4,2011,11,09
250,Great hotel,"I stayed now in both hotels, the Crowne Plaza and the Holiday Inn.

Crowne Plaza room had the fittings of a hotel with complimentary toiletries and the room was more ""luxurious"".  It has a restaurant and bar downstairs which is great.  But the breakfast is not complimentary and is expensive.

Since I have stayed in the Holiday Inn express which is connected, it is best to stay there.  More basic but as new as Crowne Plaza and the Inn has a complimentary breakfast.  Though point to note, no loyalty points are received from the Inn!",4,2011,11,07
250,Disappointment,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in September. It was the first night of our honeymoon before we left for Dublin airport the next morning. My husband is really into motor bikes, especially racing bikes so I was delighted when I booked the Ducati suite for him as a surprise. When we arrived at the hotel to chek in I was the told the suite I had booked was not available. (I had booked way in advance!) They gave us a standard suite, which to be honest wasn't that great, with not much apology. Later that evening I rang reception to see if there was anything they could do (i expalined it had been a surprise for mu new husband) and I was told the manager would be in contact with us. We heard nothing, got charged full price and got no apology.",1,2011,10,20
250,delighted.com,"We returned to this hotel (having stayed in April 2011, and been disappointed) for one night's stay this month, and were quite frankly delighted. We were warmly greeted at reception, and given an upgrade to a club room. (This gives you access to a club lounge and would probably be more geared to business travellers, but on a Saturday morning, it was a quiet space with squashy sofas, tea and coffee and chilled soft drinks.  Monday to Friday there is a breakfast club, plus there were optics there under lock and key, perhaps for the weary executive to partake of a quiet dram in the evening, away from the chaos of the bar). The bedroom was very clean and warm, and beautifully appointed, with a work space, free wifi, tea and coffee facilities, a mini-bar, bath robe, and had a large spacious bathroom. In here there was an array of toiletries, a bath and separate large shower, with a contemporary sink on a glass-topped shelf. Very nice. 
There is a shuttle bus to the airport, which we did not use this time, but appears to be regular and timely. It's just a few minutes on the bus and is very convenient to both terminals.
We chose to take the bus into Dublin city centre, E1.85 each way, and there is a stop just outside the entrance to Northwood Park. Even on a beautiful sunny Saturday with plenty of traffic and travellers, the journey took just 15 minutes to O'Connell Street  - which is right in the centre of things. 
We asked for information at reception about buses, and were given clear concise information, and the lady who dealt with us even broke a 10euro note, as the bus takes only the exact change. She was very helpful, gave us the correct bus numbers to take, and advised us which stop to go to in order to get the bus back. Everyone was very friendly, with even the cleaning staff bidding us good morning, or good evening.
We ate in the hotel bar that evening, and this was the only time we were slightly disappointed. As before it was a little over-cooled, and we had to seat ourselves at a table for food. We also had to go to the bar to bring back a drink to the table, rather than someone serve us. Not crucial, but just a little niggle. There were a couple of other small issues, but are happy to  discuss only the overnight stay in this forum. We retired to bed, had a peaceful night's sleep, with no interruption from lifts or other unusual noises, and awoke refreshed and feeling great.
The breakfast was excellent, with the staff being very friendly, and even the chef engaging us in some chit-chat. Never have encountered this before at breakfast time, and it was refreshing! He was cooking beautiful pancakes and omelettes to order, and was more than happy to do so. We chose to have the full breakfast, and tried everything. The choice of food was excellent, freshly topped-up and of very good quality. A family asked for fresh strawberries with their pancakes, and there was a large plate of fruit delivered pronto to their table.
Overall, we were really happy with our short stay, and would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay pre-flight, and also wishing to visit Dublin for a few days. Pleasant, helpful staff and a clean well-appointed bedroom. Club rooms are extra nice. Do try it.",5,2011,10,18
250,Lovely hotel shame about some staff,"At check in I was not told where the restaurant was nor times for breakfast. (breakfast was included in our stay) I found the staff not particularly welcoming. The reception area of the hotel is beautiful all black with a large fish tank. I have young children who loved watching the fish! 

The room is a bit on the small side but spotless & tastefuly decorated. The bathroom was again spotless & very large with a seperate shower unit & bath. There is air con in the rooms but I found it a bit noisy during the night. 

Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of fresh fruit, cheese, pasteries and a hot breakfast. I found it rather nice that a staff member brings around fresh tea & coffee every 10 minutes or so. They also have a very nice touch of a coffee machine on your way out complete with take out cups so you can bring a coffee with you This is something I have not seen in other hotels.

You have to pay for parking & there is a pay station in reception or you can pay the staff mamber on reception. On the first morning my hubby did not have cash on him so he put the parking charge on the room. On the second morning as I checked out my hubby went to get the car to bring it around the front of the hotel. He paid for the parking in the pay station.

At check out I was told I had to pay for both days parking & I told the lady that my hubby had already paid for that day as he had gone to get the car. She told me he didnt pay anything & insisted on charging both days. So I paid as it was not worth standing there arguing. I went to the front door to find my husband parked there having already paid the parking charge & getting the car. I returned to reception to advise the lady again that my hubby had already paid as he was already out of the car park. At this stage a man came out from the back room at reception & spoke very loudly ""your husband did not pay"". How embarrassing standing there with the two of them arguing with me over the parking charge. The lady eventually conceded that my husband had in fact already paid as he had the car out of the car park. 

She refunded me the one days parking with a disgraceful attitude, without even apologising & the male staff member simply walked away without saying anything further. I left very upset as I was 7 months pregnant at the time & very emotional.

Well I have since decided as the hotel was lovely & so was the breakfast that I'd give them one more chance. Hopefully the staff have amended their attitude as it was only those two. I found the rest of the staff I encountered very friendly. I have already booked in for another stay in December, hopefully I leave in a better state of mind than last time.",3,2011,10,15
250,Convenient and Functional,"We stayed here for one night prior to a flight to the USA the following day. The room was very satisfactory, the bathroom was fabulous and very clean. We booked under the park and fly deal so as we were able to leave our car in the hotel's car park and get the shuttle bus to the airport. This worked really well for us and we had no problems at all with either the hotel or shuttle service.",4,2011,10,13
250,Overnight stay,"Attended a wedding reception here so stayed overnight. Comfortable room, efficient front of house staff (efficient as opposed to welcoming), the function room staff were very friendly and accommodating. Didn't stay for breakfast, it was better value to go elsewhere,",3,2011,10,06
250,Good Product. Poor Service,"Stayed for one night prior a long weekend away.

Rooms and public areas were of a good standard, but the service lacked somewhat.

Hardly a typical Irish welcome at reception with them ticking half the boxes but nothing more. Arriving into the restaurant 10 minutes before they closed our request for a table was met by the manager puffing his cheeks out, checking his watch to see whether they were closed already and saying it would be ten/fifteen minutes for a table, but at least you have a table. Didn't offer us a drink in the bar whilst we had to wait, but told us to come back in 10/15 - luckily we found our own way there...

Ordered Heineken in the bar, and whilst poured from a Heineken tap, it tasted nothing like many of the previous pints I've enjoyed.

Breakfast was fine, although ordered 2 coffees and got one tea, one coffee, and when serving myself milk noticed the milk jug hadn't been cleaned properly from the night before as it had several green marks on the inside. 

Shuttle service worked efficiently but on the whole wouldn't return.",2,2011,10,04
250,Nice setting if you don't want to be in the thick of things.,"I'd never been to Dublin before, so wasn't sure where to stay but this hotel had some good reviews and I needed somewhere I could drive to, park cheaply and from where I would be able to get in and out of the town easily.
The room was a good size with a nice ensuite. I didn't eat there, so can't comment on the food; but service when ordering drinks was slow and the nights I stayed were very busy with lots of people crowded into the bar. I can definitely recommend Mandalay the Thai restaurant a few doors down (though a tad pricey) and if you need to get in and out of the town without having the drive, there is a very regular bus service 5 mins walk away which will take you there in 20-25 mins for €1.85 or taxis are approx €15.
The hotel is set in a nice parkland area on a private road with security, so it felt very safe (unlike some other parts of the city).
I'd happily stay again, but now I'm more familiar with Dublin and where everything is it might not be my first choice if I could get something closer to the centre for the same price.",4,2011,09,23
250,An Overall Positive Experience...With a Single Exception,"My wife and I were ending our self-drive tour of Ireland, and as we usually do, we wished to stay at an airport hotel on the final night, thus allowing minimal chance for added stress on that final day of departure.  We perused the various options, and per the reviews at Trip Advisor, decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza.

We unloaded our luggage and checked in at the hotel prior to returning the car.  The check-in process was efficient, being asked about desired time for wake up call, dinner reservations.  The directions to the room were OK, though we missed the part about having to take the elevator up one floor!

Returning the car at the airport was a challenge, seems Ireland signage is consistently less than transparent...we finally found the rental car return sign at the parking deck opposite Terminal 2.  It was then a lengthy process to find the spot where the airport hotels dropped off and picked up passengers.  And the bus, scheduled to be at the airport every half hour on the quarter hour, was about 15 minutes late, so we ended up waiting about 40 minutes.

We reached the room, noted it was handicapped access (not our request), but that was OK.  The room was pretty small, but the bed was comfortable, and room temperature controls good.  There was minimal shelf surface in the bathroom, and the sink was low, again probably reflecting the fact that this was a handicapped access room.

We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant.  We were seated promptly, but after fifteen minutes, I had to go to the front desk and inquire as to whether any wait staff had been assigned to our table.  The subsequent service was slow, and we were advised it reflected the fact that there had been a wake at the bar, and their staff as such was stretched.  The food itself was good, I had tuna, my wife had a nice vegetable soup and chicken for the main course, and we had one final caloric splurge with an Irish Bailey's Cream cheesecake, which was quite tasty.

Now the trouble began.  After my wife showered and went to bed, I took my shower, but could not turn off the water in the shower.  After calling the front desk, after fifteen minutes the first of a parade of three separate staff members came to the room, and confirmed that the shower control had broken.  We were offered the option of moving to a different room, but my wife was fast asleep, so the arrangement was to leave the shower running all night.  At least with the door to the bathroom closed, there was no resultant noise.

Our wake up call was on time.  We took the 6 a.m. hotel shuttle bus to the airport.  A quick ten minute ride.  Warning...the hotel shuttle bus drop off is a fair distance from Terminal 2, so be prepared for a ten minute walk, at least under a covered walkway.

The Dublin airport does provide American travellers with the advantage of having customs and immigration handled there, so once you land in the US, you can proceed as if it was a domestic flight.

So, our stay at the Crowne Plaza would have been more highly rated had we not been assigned to a handicapped room (note that this was NOT a last minute reservation, it had been made 9 months earlier), and had our shower not broken, with really very little in the way of an apology offered by the otherwise reasonably pleasant staff.",4,2011,09,23
250,Great room with very helpfull staff,"As ever, my use of this hotel was for business. In this respect it's in a great location, with a free shuttle service to the local business park. It is a little far outside the city if your visit is pure pleasure, but the quality and service more than make up for this slight drawback.

Excellent room, large, spacious and spotless.

There are two good places to eat within the hotel, I used the bar, and here the food was good and reasonably priced.",5,2011,09,22
250,Good hotel but far from the city Center,"Good hotel but it is too far from the city Center. I stayed in this hotel for a congress so I was forced to stay here. But if you go to Dublin for a vacation it is not a good choose. It is also very expensive but the quality is very high, actually I was surprised to know that Internet connection was not free and I had to pay for that. Good breakfast and large rooms. I would recommend to stay her for any meeting (congresses, working meetings, conferences and workshops) but not for a vacation.

250,"Short, but perfect stay","An excellent hotel with great staff, superb brakfast and rooms!",5,2011,09,12
250,One night stay before morning flight,Hotel is very nice and have a shuttle service to and from the airport. Room was excellent very clean and comfortable. Great bar in the lobby level and staff were also nice.,5,2011,09,11
250,"Friendly hotel, nice Pub","Close to the airport with a free hourly shuttle. Good rooms, free WiFi and friendly staff",4,2011,09,08
250,"Enjoyable stay, great breakfast","Stayed here last Saturday, we got a good rate of €78 for bed and breakfast. There was a wedding on but I asked for a quiet room and I didn't hear anything. The breakfast next day was great, good choice. This is a great hotel if you are using the airport. This was my third stay in this hotel.",4,2011,09,06
250,Fine for the price,"We have stayed at this hotel several times now and this time we stayed twice for three nights each.  The main reason we stay here is that it is close to the relatives and the airport.  We had a bigger room this stay (325) with a comfortable bed and free internet.  We were not disturbed by the weddings, even though we were here on weekends both times.  We rated this hotel only average because of the following: no conditioner or body lotion supplies, only two drawers, a scarcity of hangers, no light on the magnifying mirror.  We asked for a blanket to replace our king duvet and were given a ratty, scratchy wool blanket that might have been a queen size.  The full breakfast is hotel pricey - we had good coffee and pastries in the cafe and if we had a car we would have gone to one of the local McDonalds.",3,2011,08,30
250,Far better than I expected from previous reviews,"Stayed 4 nights.  Arrived late and didn't bother with courtesy bus - and got ripped off by taxi - shouldn't cost more than 8-10 euros.  Yes it is on outskirts but buses are frequent - numbers 41, a/b/c and 16 all go into town approx 10 mins (except sundays) for E1.85.  You can get the other way and go to airport for coaches to various other destinations in Ireland.  We were upgraded and got a free continental breakfast which was great and the cooked breakfast looked good with chef frying eggs to order.  Despite being at the weekend the only noise I heard at night was a child running to a room - remarkably quite for the number of people staying - maybe we were lucky in the type of clientelle but there was a birthday party and a football team staying!  Staff very friendly - courtesy bus driver very efficient.  Had room service club sandwich on arrival as was late so full menu not available which arrived promptly  and wasn't too expensive",4,2011,08,29
250,If you have to be near the airport in Dublin  - this is better than the rest,"I've stayed here a few times now when I've had early flights and needed to be at the airport. They have complimentary shuttle to and from the airport which takes about 15 minutes max and is reliable. The rooms are good, quiet and spacious and the internet free. Its opposite a park which is nice for jogging / walking in the summer and there is a Thai restaurant about 2 minutes walk down the road, but otherwise its in the middle of nowhere unless you have a car. If you have to stay at the airport then this is a good choice, else I would probably stay in town and pay for a taxi. (see reviews on the Gibson hotel).",4,2011,08,28
250,Avoid on weekends!,"Despite of being clean, modern and well connected to the airport, this hotel has a huge defect - it is a wedding lodge. So, if you want to stay on Friday or Saturday, prepare for a long night without sleep (up to 2am): the music plays until 00.30 and then bunches of drunk guests wander through the corridors. ",3,2011,08,27
250,American Suburban Corporate Office Park Hotel,"I needed one night at a hotel somewhere near the airport, and this Crowne Plaza had low rates for Saturday night, so I took it. I wondered why the rate was much lower than downtown hotels. It wasn't about room quality - it was about location. This hotel is in a suburban corporate office and apartment park, next to a public park. Outside the hotel, there is very little to do in walking distance. There's one other place to eat within 0.5 km, and the park, and that's it. City buses are quite infrequent on weekends, too. 
The airport shuttle is free, which is good, but only runs once an hour in the middle of the day. That's not good. The pickup is marked pretty clearly, at station 14 if I recall - follow the signs to hotel pickup.

Isolation could have become disastrous, but the hotel is acceptable. As a Platinum, I was upgraded to the club floor and got free continental breakfast. This isn't required by Priority Club, so it was a substantial plus. On the other hand, I wasn't told that newspapers cost money, so I paid 2.60 euros for my Independent. This should be disclosed, because I thought it was a Platinum benefit.
I had dinner in the bar, which was ordinary and a bit pricey, but not unfair. Rooms were of fair size and have wired Internet for free. In Ireland, Internet is often not free. One problem is that the TV promised a message center and fancy features, but they don't work - it's a plain box, as far as I could tell. 

One substantial problem is that I clearly heard my next door neighbor's conversation, both at night and in the morning, and I don't think they were shouting. I can be picky on this, I know, but this falls under basic expectations of lodging - not hearing neighbors.

Overall, if I had a car, this would be a much better place and I'd give it another dot. Parking is 6 euros per day, quite good for Dublin. Without a car, as a tourist, I would spend a bit more to get a better location.",3,2011,08,26
250,Handy Place While Visiting Dublin City Ireland,"If you don't want to stay in the city center, Temple Bar area or St. Stepehns Green location due to cost or crowds, this Crowne Plaza Hotel is the answer.  It is close to the airport and on the bus line into the city and less expensive than hotels or B&B's in town.   The breakfast in not included in the cost of the room (more like America than european hotels), however, you'll be better of going into Dublin city and having a nice Irish breakfast anyway.  There is also a Hilday Inn Express now located right next door to the Crowne Plaza, so you should be able to find a room at one of these locations.  You won't be sorry if you are comfortable taking local transportation into the city centre.  Parking is not good in the city anyway.",3,2011,08,25
250,convienient,"nice enough hotel, breakfast was ok but what is it with the Crown Plaza hotels and EGGS. second C.P. hotel that cant cook eggs properly!!!!!",3,2011,08,23
250,Very nice hotel and close to airport,"We stayed here the last night of our trip to be close to the airport for our morning flight.  The hotel has a courtesy shuttle that runs every 30 minutes.  There are also computer monitors in the lobby that keep you updated on flights.

The rooms were very nice and modern as well as clean.  The breakfast buffett was outstanding - huge selection!  It set me up well for the day.

Advice:  We got in late & I was hungry.  Due to the late hour, the restaurant was no longer serving food & room service choices are limited.  In addition, the menu is expensive.  There is also not a lot in the area, so if you need to eat, do it before you get to the hotel.  This is a business or travel in/out sort of hotel - not the place you would stay to be close to all the sights and restaurants, etc..  With that said, the hotel was beautiful and comfortable & fit our need - to be accessible to the airport on the night before our travels home.",4,2011,08,14
250,Nice rooms but very hot,"We stayed here for 1 night in a family room before an early morning flight.The location is very convenient for Dublin airport.We had booked a family room and check-in was very pleasant and swift.However,when we got to our room,there was an overwhelming smell of fresh paint.I returned to the check-in desk,and told them.They were not aware that that floor had been painted,even though all along the corrider there were signs up to that effect.It was very difficult to change rooms as all their family rooms were booked.After some searching though,we were allocated another family room on a different floor.We were very grateful! The room was very nice ,modern and clean with 2 double beds.Unfortunately we found it very hot and even when we turned the airconditioning to its lowest setting, it did not cool the room suffciently for us.None of us slept particularly well,but as we were getting up very early to catch a flight we were just glad to get the night over with.We were not able to use the shuttle service to the airport as the first coach leaves at 5am and we had to be at the airport earlier.",3,2011,08,12
250,"Nice, we loved it",Nice friendly staff. Room is immaculately clean. The interior décor was very nice ( a touch of class). The Menu option and the meal could be improved on. We will visit again.,4,2011,08,12
250,Great choice,"Our last day in Ireland and we've got an early flight out in the morning we've taken the car back early so there's no stress in the morning we taken a club executive room which allows you to use the club lounge on the 4th floor the service here is great roome service was reasonable we paid more in some bed and breakfast places in Ireland we wouldn't hesitate to 
come back here on our next trip ",4,2011,08,11
250,Lovely rooms,"Only stayed one night, but seems like a very good hotel. The overall look of the hotel is very modern, unfortunately I didn't get a chance to use much of their facilities. However, it is very close to a park, which is a lovely walk. Rooms were very comfortable, good size and very clean.  Staff were nice enough- professional and efficient- but lacking the the human touch.",4,2011,08,09
250,re: Loved it great place to stay by the airport,Great hotel to stay at if you need somewhere around the airport.  Free shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  Holiday Inn Express next door.  Free internet in room through cord.  Free wi-fi in the lobby.  Great bar with limited menu.  Nothing really in the area.  Cost about 30 euro to get downtown Dublin via taxi.,5,2011,08,08
250,Decent choice.,"Stayed here for three nights recently while working close to the airport.

The hotel is a relatively modern, standard Crown Plaza.

Staff were friendly and efficient at check in. My king bedded room was of a fair size with a seperate work area and clean bathroom with a bath and shower above. View from window was of an adjoinging wing of rooms.To my taste the duvet was bit thin, not really a luxury product. This maybe due to the fluxuating temperatures in the room, with AC set to 22deg the room was freezing, turn it off and it got very hot.

A nice suprise was that wired internet was free in the room. No wireless in the rooms, may have been in lobby area but didn't check this out.

Didn't use the restaurant but ate in the bar one night. Fair selection of food which was nothing to write home about but did the job. Quite busy but service was quick. Was there on a Wednesday evening and there was live but subtle live music. Price point seemed quite fair to me for food and drink.

Gym is small but adequately equiped - no pool. Park area surrounding was nice for a run.

There is a shuttle bus to/from airport but I found this hard to locate so just took a 10Euro taxi.",3,2011,08,05
250,Great Hotel - perfect location,This hotel is in a perfect location for Dublin airport. Very efficient staff. Room was spacious and very comfortable. There was an excellent choice for breakfast and all food was fresh and appealing. A shuttle bus is available for easy transport to the airport. We will definately use this hotel again.,5,2011,07,29
250,Airport Sleepover but Could Be More,"I first stayed here flying out of Dublin on business and returned with my wife using a reward night from Priority Club points. We had a great time - just as long as we stayed in our well appointed suite. You park in an adjacent multistory carpark (charge) and then run the gauntlet (every time we went outside) of a crowd of often drunk people smoking. In fact the smoke haze at the door of the hotel is very 2 star - really surprising that they let this be the first experience guests have of the hotel. It is joined to a sister hotel and conference centre so there are big crowds around. The bar was so packed we couldn't get in to eat and we sat for 35 minutes on the lobby sofas before a waitress took a drinks order. No pool, but nice park opposite for walks. This is the ideal spot if flying out - lots of pilots and crew staying here, it is in a great spot but needs to do more to be a viable Dublin weekend hotel. I guess they have decided that one off airport/conference is their core business.",3,2011,07,28
250,Great value for money,"We stayed for one night at the Crowne Plaza Northwood before an early morning flight.  We took advantage of the hotel's parking package and found it excellent value.  I booked directly via the hotel website.  The hotel is clean.  Check-in was friendly and efficient and the arrangements regarding the parking well explained.  Our room was comfortable and quiet.  There was a safe, iron and ironing board, tv, lots of towels in the bathroom and most importantly a comfortable bed.  We ate in the bar which was very busy but we enjoyed our bar food.  There is a regular hotel shuttle which runs directly between the hotel and airport.  This is an excellent airport hotel.  A good start to our holiday!",4,2011,07,27
250,Good Hotel,"We booked the Crown Plaza on a trip to Dublin. it was in a quiet location with good bus links to the city centre, the 16A and other buses ran regularly and only cost 1.85 euro each way. We booked a Family room with 2 double beds. Room was well equiped with tea and coffee making facilities. Good sized bathroom with a seperate shower cubicle. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Bar was comfortable with a good range of bar food. Hotel was convienient for the airport and were quick to pick us up from the airport using the courtesy bus.",4,2011,07,20
250,super,"tops on all departments 
pity there is no proper leisure facilities , all great hotels should have some sort of pool I think",5,2011,07,18
250,THIEFS,"this is a hotel is which you usually spent only one night. They know this and take profit of this by charging your credit card for everything. As it is far away from the city centre, everything is expensive. breakfast 15 € per person, the only asiatic restaurant 20 euros per person... the worst thing is the minibar: there are some sensors inside the minibar, so when you lift a can, it is automatically charged on your credit card (5 euros each can at least).
besides, it is very bad conneced to the city centre, becouse the only way to get there is by taxi (20 euros) or by bus, which is not bad, but doesn't have good frequency.
this is my expirience and what i think.  saludos.",2,2011,07,11
250,Loved this hotel,Great hotel. Beds were comfortable. The room was clean.  You must walk to the Holiday Inn next door if you want a soda from a vending machine.  We ordered room service and it was wonderful.  I was very pleased with this hotel and highly recommend it.,5,2011,07,06
250,Outstanding Hotel close to the airport,"Due to a meeting I had to stay in the hotel for 1 night. There is a complimentary bus service from and to the airport. Furthermore, the hotel is located in a quiet beautiful garden. The rooms were very spacious and offered a quite, really good relaxing sleep. Finally, the restaurant and the related breakfast were also really good. In general a great place to stay, for businessmen and tourists.",5,2011,07,01
250,A decent choice for an airport hotel,"For starters, I came into Terminal 2 in Dublin, which was still a work in progress.  It was impossible to find the area for hotel shuttles, so I gave up and took a cab.  About €10.  

The hotel is fairly spiffy new, and the staff were well trained and accomodating.  

The room was your average business class room, though the decor wasn't quite my thing (odd art, etc. - the elevator was a bizarre mirrored mess).  Upon entered the room, the stank of cigarettes was overwhelming, but the window opened wide and the room quickly aired out.  Mind you, I smoke and requested a smoking room.  I just find it annoying when newer hotels don't have adequate ventilation or suffiently clean/air out rooms.  I've stayed above pubs that smelled fresher.  

Speaking of the window, the view (and I would assume this is true for at least half the rooms in the place, looked down on the lobby rooftop.  What genius thought this up?  The one that thought ""hey, we can have twice as many rooms if half of them have a view into each other and the roof?"".  I would also assume that the front facing rooms have a view of the remains of the parkland this modern megalith (and adjoing recent hotels/office buildings) that acquired space here have.  The parkland isn't anything to write home about - an big expanse of lawn and a hump or two of the remains of the former estate there.  Neither is the nearby shopping mall.  Not worth the somewhat long walk.

All in all, I don't think I'd stay here again.  It was okay, but just not my sort of place.  

Oh, and on the return trip to the airport, the staff was a bit confused about the schedule, but the driver on a pick up run for airline staff took me along for the ride.  It was a long - and I mean LONG - walk to the terminal.  Eh, but the new Terminal 2 requires a lot of walking as well.  Nothing gained there.",3,2011,06,29
250,"Lovely hotel, staff tremendous, great location near airport","We had a fantastic stay at the hotel when we travelled from Scotland to attend a wedding in the hotel. The wedding and hotel experience was excellent from pick up on courtesy bus, to leaving .  
My wife lost her passport on the June bank holiday creating major panic. Staff at hotel contacted police, airline, passport control and sorted situation completely. Would have been totally lost without their help
I would recommend this hotel to anyone cosidering visiting the area",5,2011,06,23
250,Enjoyed our stay most of the time,"We stayed 5 days whilst I judged Boxer Dogs at National Show Centre, We found the rooms comfortable, clean , spacious. & quiet. The Breakfast was well cooked & plenty of choice it catered for early & late risers,  Most of the staff were friendly & helpful. If you are going to use courtesy bus from airport take Hotel Tele No with you to call them. If you are Disabled and need wheelchair assistance upon returning to airport the number to call is in the coach car park where the bus drops you. Also check bus times in the Hotel. Have Coins with you if catching ordinary busses i.e. Dublin as they only take the right ammount of coins not paper money & no change. Evening meals in the Hotel restaraunt have limited selection but what is there its well cooked and prepaired. If you like hamburgers (we dont) eat in the bar.",4,2011,06,22
250,Just right for the Airport.....,"We needed a hotel for three nights. One that was not too far from the airport but one which enabled us to have a day in Dublin and catch an early flight out on Sunday morning. The hotel reviews seemed good so we booked direct with the hotel (internet booking prices all seemed the same for the dates we wanted). 

It's just right for the airport - slightly off the beaten track, far enough away so you don't hear the planes and traffic but only 5 minutes away from the airport via the hotel's shuttle bus. Not so convenient for the city centre though. You'd need to take a taxi (pricy) or a bus ( 1 Euro 85 and you must have the right money!) from close to the hotel. We took the bus and spent the day in the city.

Good rooms, clean, quiet, comfortable bed, excellent bathroom, tv was bit ancient but air conditioning worked well and we had a tea and coffee maker in the room. There was a good selection of food for breakfast and staff were all very helpful. There's also a large park and gardens opposite. 

The only drawback was that on two out of three evenings there were large functions which took up most of the bar and ground floor area so it was difficult to find a space to sit down and relax with a  drink, but, once we'd got our bearings we were ok and, generally speaking,  were happy with our stay.",4,2011,06,17
250,Great stay,"I stayed here for 2 nights as part of a conference group. I stayed in a club room (4th floor), so the room itself was very well equipped. A small touch I thought was great was the different plug sockets at the working desk… US and EU plug sockets in addition to the normal Irish ones… Nice touch!

Being a club room, the room décor , etc. was very good, with a full working desk and very comfortable working chair. Robes and slippers, etc. provided as well. Another club level advantage was the lounge which seemed to be under used by guests, but is a great refuge at the end of the day.

Breakfast was very good, with a good selection of hot and cold foods. Didn’t’ eat dinner, so can’t comment on that, but bar was good – as hotel bars goes.

Only negative... paid car parking. I object to paying for parking when a hotel guest!

The staff were friendly, polite and helpful. Definitely recommend!",5,2011,06,14
250,Airport hotel or function venue?,"This is one of my favourite airport hotels. It is close enough to the airport to be practical, yet far enough to be away from the hustle and bustle. Normally.
I was given an upgrade to the Club floor and the room was excellent - wonderful comfortable bed, good layout for working, great bathroom. `It was so quiet I wondered if I were the only guest.
Downstairs, however, was a different story. There appeared to be some kind of fancy dress party going on, as there were strangely dressed people in various stages of inebriation falling out of lifts and shouting in the reception area. This was at 6 pm.......
A quiet drink in the bar was simply not an option.
I appreciate that hotels have to make money, and therefore have to rent out their function rooms. However, I think that someone in a room close to the noise, with an early flight next morning, might not have been so happy. Talking to other people who have used hotels around Dublin airport, this seems to be a fairly common occurrence in most of the hotels.
Perhaps hotels like this need to make a choice. Either you provide facilities for airline passengers who really just want to sleep before their flight, or you target the party-goers.",4,2011,06,14
250,Good airport hotel with great location,"A good standard airport hotel. Far enough from the airport not to feel like you are in the terminal. Only a 5 minute bus trip away with regular shuttle buses. There is a great park in front of the hotel. 

Restaurant was excellent... for a hotel. The one drawback is that there is not much else around the hotel. It is a long way away from the city.",4,2011,06,05
250,Quality Accommodations Close to Airport,"If you've got a morning flight and want to minimize your commute, this is a great option. Or if you're looking for a good spot to enjoy Dublin and explore the surrounding areas, this is a good home base.  We had an international flight and chose to stay close to the airport the night before and take advantage of the hotel's airport shuttle.  Had a great night's sleep in a comfortable, well-appointed hotel and minimized the stress before the big flight.  The hotel's breakfast buffet was quite ample...wonderful selections of hot and cold items, fruit, pastries and much more.",4,2011,05,21
250,Still The Best!,"Due to unexpected Airline Changes, I found myself Held - Over in Dublin, Ireland.
Thankfully, I rembered a Previous Visit and after a brief phone call, got a Truly Fantastic
Reservation / Quote and imedately took myself off from Dublin Airport.
Despite the lateness, 11.30pm, I was given an excellent room  on the Club Floor and in
less than 15mins was excepted into the restaurant  and had an brief but thoughtful exchange with the Young Very Knowledgeable Duty Manager.
I was Guided towards a Delightful Supper Choice from the Main Menu and in only a few
mins was enjoying my selected food.
After A LATE LATE Night - Cap I went to my room, had a Short Shower and duly dropped into a Fantastic Nights Sleep.
After a sumptous breakfast, I was offered a Shuttle Bus to the Airport and Holding A pipeing hot, freshly brewed coffee got onboard and in five mins was duly dropped off and
wished a Happy and Enjoyable continuation off my journey.
As Ever this experiance has to be an edited account, save to say, Crowne Plaza Hotel's Service, Excellent Value and Very Attentive and Professional  Staff  was All I Expected and yet again was not let down.  I recomend them and this Excellent Airport Hotel to Anyone travelling in Ireland, Especially  withen the Capitol City.",5,2011,05,21
250,Just as nice the second time around....,"My husband and I booked a one night stay here so we could be near the airport to take a flight back to Florida after our vacation in France and Italy. We stayed here for several nights in 2008 and really enjoyed it - the great breakfast buffet, the friendly and efficient concierge staff, and the quality of the rooms. Nothing has changed! It is such a relief to get off a crowded airplane and step into a place with such accomodating people and go directly to a relaxing and luxurious room. My husband thinks the generous breakfast is the best in Europe. We went into Dublin for the evening and the staff booked a reservation at our favorite restaurant at our request. The free airport shuttle is great!Thanks to all.",5,2011,05,17
250,Disappointed.com,"We stayed here awaiting our departure to Dublin airport (we booked the parking online - much cheaper than booking direct) the next day. Not great TBH. Arrived to find that we had (not really, having checked our booking online) booked a twin room instead of a double room. The receptionist made a big deal about getting us a double SUITE, which we thought - WOW - thanks very much. When we went in we thought - nice, but on checking the bathroom and under the bed - which I do in every room we stay in - it turned out to be an accessible room -which we have no problem with, except for the fact that the sink in the bathroom was quite low to the ground  My husband being 6'4"" found this  very inconvenient to shave at as he has back problems. Both the bathroom and bedroom looked as though they hadn't been used in a while - the shelves were very dusty, and there was an empty water bottle under the bed - inexcusable for any hotel. The mini-bar fridge did not function - the contents were warm.  There was a conference on at the hotel - which obviously got very rowdy on a Friday night - and since we were on the first floor - right above the noise, the racket was awful. Not happy about that since we were getting up early for a flight the next morning, as was made known to the receptionist, having booked the airport shuttle for the next morning (during check-in). The lift noise was extremely audible, and there was a squeak in the room next to us, which sounded like someone was sitting on a very inadequate sofa-bed at regular 5 minute intervals. It continued all night. The drunken revellers partied until 4am and made sleep or rest impossible. I asked the next morning to what degree was the hotel booked (as if the hotel had been fully-booked I maybe could have understood why we were placed that double suite) and was told that it was about 60% - I did ask why we were put into that room, close to the noise and in an accessible room when the receptionist knew we were up early for a flight (and easily saw the height of my husband), and to be fair, the receptionist on duty apologised, as she could not understand why - I told her I was disappointed, and would be reluctant to stay again. We use Dublin airport at least  dozen times a year. The breakfast was fine - despite the fact we were up bright and early   surprising, given our sleep ration) there were empty hot food service bins - mushrooms and fried eggs - and we ate plenty. The transfer to the airport was on time, and pleasant. Our transport last night was not however. The woman in the mini-bus was unfriendly and left before the advertised time of 0015. We raced through T1 to get to the shuttle bus, and had we arrived at 0013 we would have found the bus departed. I don't think I would stay here again.",2,2011,04,13
250,Convenient and Nice,The Crown Plaza hotel is located just 10 minutes from Dublin Airport. This somewhat upscale hotel has spacious rooms and most conveniences. Room rates during our stay were very reasonable.,4,2011,04,04
250,An unexpected gem,"Had a presentation in All Hallows College in Dublin and The Crown Plaza was the closest to my location during the busy St. Patricks weekend.  The hotel was of very high quality being an excellent four star, even compared to many other four star hotels I have stayed in.
The location was right in front of Santry Demesne, which is a good sized park ideal to walk around. Parking is very handy with a free multi store car park right beside the hotel.
On arrival we had a snack from the coffee shop and sat down in the reception area, which was peaceful with a large fish tank which separated the lounge area of the lobby from the reception desk.
The room I was located was large, spotless and very comfortable, with separate a bath and shower. 
We had dinner in the restaurant that night, the menu is an unusual mix of Asian and traditional dishes, while not a large menu there was a good choice. Both my parents and I really enjoyed the food and found the portions idea. 
Breakfast the next morning was impressive with a good selection of cold meats, cereals, breads, cooked fry and there was a chief present who cooked omelets and pancakes.
We found all the staff to be friendly and courteous, even saluting you in the corridors. They consistently checked if everything was okay and were extremely helpful. Overall we were really impressed with our stay",5,2011,03,21
250,Very Good Hotel,"I have stayed here several times on business and this hotel is modern, clean, and welcoming. Food was good and the service excellent as were the friendly staff.
Rooms are adequete and bathrooms very large and modern. This hotel is approx 2.5km from the airport but the shuttle bus runs every 30mins to and from the hotel/airport and vice versa. The hotel is used by many tourists as well as business people. You will not be disappointed while staying here.",4,2011,03,21
250,"very modern hotel, close airport loacation","I spent 7 days in this hotel, the hotel is very modern, very clean and very friendly. It has a nice close to the airport, but not to close to where you hear or see any airplanes. The hotel as I mentioned is very modern, the roms were very clean, and the beds were comfortable. The strange thing to me about this hotel, is with all of the modernization, they still had small tube style televisions. It was strange to see in a hotel in this day and age. But the staff was extremely friendly, the meetings rooms very clean and nice. I highly recommend this hotel for casual or business purposes. To get into town from this hotel takes about 14 euro via cab. Supposedly there are city buses that can take you in but I never used them.",5,2011,03,14
250,top hotel,"Stayed here before leaving for Dublin airport, very convenient, parking at hotel not expensive, rooms were stylish, we ate in the Bar which was a little expensive but food was very good.
Have stayed in nearby Premier Inn and Hilton and I would think this just about edges both of them.
The bus to the airport was frequent and comfortable, shop around for the best deal, got room only on quickrooms for about 50 euros and booked again for bnb for about 70 euros on travelsupermarket.com - excellent value for this standard",5,2011,03,11
250,Very good business hotel,"I have lived in this hotel for quite a few days in the last few months.  I booked by calling up the hotel and was able to get the dates.

I had three other alternatives to this hotel.  But i have stayed in Crowne Plazas before and have preferred that.

One concern i have with this hotel is that they get full because of conferences.  It is difficult to block dates for longer durations. 

The rooms usually have little space to keep luggage but the beds are very big.  The bathrooms are very good.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  Wireless and internet facilities are also good.

Breakfast that comes with the room has very nice options.  The coffee at breakfast is better than most hotels.",4,2011,02,27
250,VIP CLUB PACKAGE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS,"Stayed here for one night at the weekend for friends 30th Birthday solely to go the Wright Venue.  The hotel itself is fine, rooms are clean and breakfast is ok.  Walls are paper thin, you can hear the conversations of people in the next room.
We booked the rooms under their VIP CLUB PACKAGE DEAL which is meant to entitle you to VIP ACCESS into the Wright Venue Club with transport to and from the venue.  On check in we received wrist bands to access the club.  We did not take the transport offered to the club as it was not scheduled to leave until 11.30 p.m. We informed the hotel receptionist that we would make our own way to the club but would be coming back to the hotel on the hotels shuttle bus.  We were assured that this was ok.
When we arrived at the club there was a huge que, so I approached the doorman thinking we would bypass the club as we supposedly had VIP ACCESS.  The doorman did not know of any such arrangment with the Crowne Plaza and we were told to join the que!  Fair enough these things happen, however at the end of the night when we went looking for the bus to bring us back to the hotel, the stewards directing people to buses said they had never heard of any such bus to the Crowne Plaza.  We got a taxi back.  The next morning I inquired as to why they falsly advertise these perks and was met with a shrug and a half hearted apology.  Not good enough...we solely picked this hotel because of the package on offer to the club.  What should have been a stress free night without queing and taxi fares ended up like any other night out in Dublin!  So if you are booking this hotel because of the package on offer....you do get access to the club but thats it....so stick to booking a normal room (preferably somewhere else)and pay at the door....",2,2011,02,14
250,Very very very nice...,"Lovely hotel. I am usually very critical and picky, but i was so pleased and satisfaid with this hotel. It gave us luxury feeling. We had two double bed room and babay cot. Rooms are not big, but very nice, cosy and luxury... Close to airport, that we wanted as we had early flight. Also close to city centrum, with bus like 20 min. Bus station 5 min away from hotel. Also close to big shopping centrum, like 5 min with bus. Very nice green area with park across the road. Children loved that there were many birds in water like ducks and swans. Many nice details in hotel, like big fish aquarium, area with nature sounds. Ahhh I loved this hotel. Staff was friendly and transfer bus nice and big, driver very helpful with bags.",5,2011,01,14
250,"clean,tidy,comfortable and modern!","i arrived at the crown plaza hotel and was very happy with what i saw.it was very modern and the staff were very helpful.the food was gorgeous and children under 12 stayed and ate free,witch was very handy for my daughter.We had a room witch overlooked the motorway,which surprisingly was very quite and got a good nights sleep.the rooms were very spacious and which had self controlled heating.and two very comfortabe queen sized beds.i have stayed at this hotel 3 times and hope to be staying a fourth in the future.there is a shopping centre across the road with a bus stop and takes only 15 mins to dublin city centre.this is a very comforable and relaxing hotel and would reccomend it to all my friends!!",4,2011,01,09
250,Gone downhill,"Stayed here on way to airport and I have to say it was way below previous standards
1. Car park. 
Flooded - not their fault I Know but badly signed and poor lay out.
2. Check In
Very slow with a long Queue. Took 20 Minutes at least and other guests were complaining
3. Rooms
There was a smell in the room and it had a past 'sell by date' feel with it's other fittings.
Other than that the bus was great and helpfull but will look elsewhere in future.",2,2011,01,05
250,Impressive Hotel,"If you are looking for a nice hotel near the Dublin Airport, then I would highly recommend this hotel. Within a few minutes you can travel with their own shuttle service every 30 minutes to the nearby hotel location. The hotel is very clean and very modern. The rooms are really nice, spacious, and modern. There is free wireless internet everywhere in the hotel and the nice bar are is even busy until they close. The dining area was also impressive and they offer a buffet style evening course, so choose what you like. I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I am in Dublin, Ireland.",5,2010,12,18
250,Convenient and comfortable airport hotel,"We stayed for one night before catching an early flight home, and this hotel was more than comfortable...great rooms (spacious, clean), great food, quick and helpful staff, complimentary internet and a free airport shuttle. You can't ask for much more out of a quick stay. Pretty upscale decor for an airport hotel, too -- and I don't know what was happening in town the night we were there, but the lobby bar was PACKED with people. Pretty lively downstairs, but quiet and relaxing in our room -- no spillover noise. We'd definitely come back.",4,2010,12,03
250,A good stopover near the airport,"If you need a night or two in a clean and modern hotel, with no frills and luxury this is the place for you. We needed a stopover night near the airport and this was perfect. The room was clean and spacious enough with a huge bathroom. It is in the middle of what feels like nowhere, with not much around. We chose not to eat in the hotel, and went to the Mandelay which is 2 minutes walk away - lovely food and good service, at prices very similar to the hotel restaurant. We booked on the same day via the hotel website and found it to be reasonable value, and they apparently do complimentary transfers to the airport.",4,2010,11,30
250,A better standard of airport hotel-not much else going for it,"My partner and I stayed here for 1 night as we were shopping in Kildare and wanted to be on the outskirts of Dublin. 
The room was lovely and comfortable as well as clean. We had to pay for parking which I would have expected in a city hotel or a park and fly, but not for 1 night.
The breakfast was abysmal; it looked and tasted like it had been sitting around a long time. 
If I were travelling from Dublin airport I would stay in this hotel again and skip breakfast.",3,2010,11,01
250,"Crown Plaza, Never a let down","Just went to a wedding in this Hotel. The food was great. The room was beautiful. The waiters were very good. I often have a huge problem which is that they almost announce it from the head table, who ordered vegetarian, but the very young waiter that was on our table was more than professional about everything. The parking is very reasonable at 6 euro. I would highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2010,10,31
250,"""Loved It""",This hotel was awesome! I loved the room and the staff was very helpful.,5,2010,10,25
250,Ideal for airport and great value!,"I chose this hotel (first visit) because I had a very early start and needed to be at the airport by 07.30. The hotel provide a complimentary shuttle to airport and the journey takes 7 minutes approx. I arrived at 7pm and was warmly greeted by receptionist. My double room was very good and comfortable. Lovely big bathroom with complimentary toiletries. The remote for the TV did not work but was replaced in an instant. The internet was not available during my stay and that was my only disappointment. I had a meal at the busy bar and it was good value for money. I was able to get toothbrush and paste from reception as I had left mine at the previous hotel (nice touch). In summary, a very nice hotel, close to the airport with free transport and extremely good value via alpharooms. I'm sure I will stay here again, next time I'm in Dublin.",4,2010,10,23
250,Great Stay,"I attended a wedding here for the weekend.  The rooms are beautiful.  Breakfast was good, however depending on the time you arrived, it could be abit cold.  I ate in the bar and it was great, and a great menu also.  Seems so central to people traveling to and from the airport.  Lots of Air crew staying her and very corporate also.  
Staff lovely.  
Just across the road from IKEA.. 
really no down side but its a very corporate hotel.  great price great hotel",4,2010,10,08
250,perfect for purpose,"We stayed here before a flight to USA we had stayed before courtesy of american airlines  when are flight got cancelled. This is a very nice hotel courtesy bus was waiting for us on our return at 545am  which was great . We booked the hotel and the parking separate as it was cheaper , the rooms are clean and comfortable and the bar food is good. We plan to stay again in december before flying to USA the best price we got was on Alpha rooms with breakfast, for  comfort value for money and close to the airport its the best we have stayed in.",5,2010,09,28
250,A BUSINESS HAVEN,"This Four Star Hotel's Perfectly Positioned for either an An Overnight Business Stay
or for any Family Celebration.
The Business Floor has Fantastically Appointed Rooms that will satisify your every need
they are ' Fully Loaded' have I believe the Biggest & Most Comfortable Beds of any Airport Hotel.The Members Only Use Lounge has excellent facilities for making Hot Drinks, Snacks  Etc and whose staff will accomadate your needs.
The Bar and Restaurant Areas are Bright Modern and Thoughtfully Laid - Out, whose
Staff Team Members are Polite, Dedicated and Friendly, yet Profssional.
Its certainly Great Value positioned so closely to Dublin Airport, 5mins via Their Shuttle
Service.
For Weddings or Weekend Stays its Park  Like Location & Surroundings are hard to beat.",5,2010,09,23
250,Super conference facility,"I have just returned from a 2-day conference at the Crowne Plaza. The conference facilities are really good, located in their own wing. There is a separate entrance to the conference facility, and it has its own reception desk (which wasn't open for this small conference). There was sufficient space for a large desk for the organising team to use. The main conference room can be divided into three sections. The conference exhibition was split between one of these sections and an area just outside the remaining two sections. I think there are also break-out rooms situated on the first floor of the conference facility, but break-out rooms in the main hotel were used for this event. 
The lunches on both days were really good. Staff supporting the conference, those at the main reception desk and the waiting staff were all very pleasant to deal with. The hotel is smartly decorated - I liked the glass panels in the main foyer and the ""fish pond"" projected on to the floor of the passage connecting that foyer with the conference facility! 
Two criticisms - (1) the conference venue was very cold on day 1, and (2) it's not obvious from the road where the carpark is, as the entrance is closer to a neighbouring hotel. Not insurmountable, though. 
As an inhabitant of Dublin with a car, it wasn't difficult to get there (I came through Phibsborough and Ballymun and turned right at the R104 (Santry Ave). I heard visitors to Ireland say the hotel was close to the airport, but not close to the city centre.  The bus route that the visitors were using is the 16A, which goes to the city centre, but it is not a quick route or an especially frequent service!",4,2010,09,18
250,Not Bad,"If only the rooms were larger or not so crowded with furniture, I think I could be completely happy with this hotel.  This is our second stay here.  It is handy to the relatives, with comfortable beds, a large walk-in shower in addition to a separate tub, good free internet and it's quiet.  However I wish they would lose the fridge and replace it with a dresser or drawers to put your clothes in.  Also the table and chairs next to the bed are totally useless as they take up the entire space between the bed and the wall.  I was surprised as well by how little attention we received from any of the staff.  Not a single good morning, how's your stay, etc.  Is it so hard to make eye contact with your guests?",4,2010,09,14
250,Good hotel close by the Dublin Airport,"I booked this hotel because I was attending a conference happening at the same property the next day. The hotel is located 5 min away from the airport with a courtesy shuttle between the hotel and the Dublin Airport.
The check-in was quick but was surprised to hear from the reception that I had to prepay my room because I only have a Debit Card. In the evening, I ordered a room service and I was asked t pay cash for the same reasons .So basically everything extra will have to be paid cash now instead of paying at the checkout. This is the first time I have this problem besides using my Debit Card in more than 50 hotels before.
The room seems quite new with a very comfy double bed. The bathroom is simple but it's not as chic as the room. The bathroom needs more warmth and color (feel like you are in a hospital). Bathroom amenities are of mediocre quality.
The good news is that you have free speed wired Internet connection. This is really handy if you like working at the desk during your stay. 
The TV is not a flat screen but I guess it would be costly to replace all these cube TVs.
The room also have courtesy coffee by Bewleys and a kettle. The tap water is terrible though so probably better if you use mineral water.
My room service was really good. I had a Sirloin steak with fries and a rhubarb tart. This was delivered to my room within 15 min. 
In a nutshell, it is a good business hotel minutes away from the airport.",4,2010,09,14
250,"A Quiet, Luxurious Airport Hotel--Really!""","My wife and I arranged to meet at Dublin Airport for tour of southeast Ireland, and I got into Dublin from Bordeaux the night before her arrival.  Following the recommendations of this site I chose the Crown Plaza and could not have been more pleased by my experience.  On arrival I rented a car and drove to the Crown Plaza where I spent a very quiet night in a very comfortable bed in a very well-decorated, well-appointed room.  The bathroom and shower were first-rate.  The next morning I took the shuttle bus to the airport to meet my wife's plane and then took the shuttle back with her to the Crown Plaza.  This was a Tuesday morning, and perhaps because it wasn't a weekend I had none of the problems reported by others with the shuttle.  I will say, though, that the airport is undergoing a good bit of construction, and signage is nearly non-existent (blame it on the town council's antipathy to signs, said the guy behind the Hertz counter) which turns an unavoidable inconvenience into unnecessary maddening frustration.  Calling the hotel to get precise up-to-date directions and pick-up times might not be a bad idea.

The hotel uses at least two types of vehicles for the shuttle--a huge coach that must hold 40-50 and a smaller van that holds perhaps a dozen or so.  Both use the ""Coaches"" lot, and once you pick your way to the lot, finding either vehicle is easy.

Also, there is a company called ""Aircoach"" that provides amazing service between the Dublin Airport and many hotels in center city and beyond.  When we spent three nights in Dublin at the end of our trip we used it in both directions and were very impressed by the frequency and comfort of the service.  With this service you could, theoretically, use a combination of the shuttle and Aircoach to use an airport hotel as a base for visiting Dublin, but I'd find a hotel in town if I planned on spending more than one day touring Dublin.

Breakfast was not included in my room rate, and although it was a good and complete buffet with a manned station for omelets, you might want to be certain you're comfortable with the price at the outset in order to avoid any unpleasant surprises.

If you're like me and sensitive to noise at night, you'll really appreciate it that despite this hotel's convenient location near a busy airport it is dead quiet.

The high-speed internet was reliable and strong in my room, and I clocked download speeds averaging 3 mB/sec.

The hotel charges for parking.  Ask when booking.",5,2010,08,04
250,Fantastic!,All I can say is that it was so good that we are returning again next week! Great customer service!,5,2010,08,03
250,My worst hotel experience in 30 years of business travel !!!,"I've been staying at hotels for more than 30 years, mostly for business purposes and the experience I had at Crowne Plaza this week has been my worst hotel experience by far and this is only the second time I've ever had to complain to a hotel ! 
I deliberately did not speak to anyone at the hotel about this is because I would probably have ended up being arrested !!!
I arrived at the airport and made my way to the Hotel Bus area around 12:15pm, this had three parking bays marked HOTEL and the CROWNE PLAZA included in a list of hotels on the sign next to these bays. After standing for 40 minutes, during which time I witnessed busses from other hotels come and go, 2 or 3 from most of the hotel chains, I rang my hotel to ask about their shuttle service. ""They only travel once an hour and the next one is at 13:15pm"" !!!!
I decided to wait as I know how much taxi drivers hate short journeys from airports. At 13:15pm still no shuttle but I noticed a large coach, with ""Crowne Plaza"" on the side, and no-one in it, leaving the coach park from behind a row of tourist coaches parked away from the HOTEL bays.
NO information that this would happen.
NO guidance from hotel staff on telephone.
NO sineage.
NO attempt from the driver to see if anyone was waiting at the HOTEL BUS area (remember, that's the one next to the CROWNE PLAZA sign !)
I'm left with two choices. Wait another hour or get a taxi. I went for a taxi and of course the driver was spitting feathers, he's been in his queue for two hours. Although the journey was only €8 I gave him €25 for his trouble and when we arrived at the hotel there were THREE busses parked outside ( doing nothing ) and two of them were the smaller type which can fit into the HOTEL BUS bays at the airport.
What a joke ! How to make your guests feel really valued. Imagine if I'd been a little old lady and the weather had been much worse, she could have been left standing at the airport for at least two hours. I can't believe that this hotel can be so blind and make such a massive mistake. I've no intentions of ever returning and I'm encouraging my collegues to avoid Crowne Plaza. We have plenty of other hotels to chose from, including many (all others) who would chose not to abandon their guests at an airport. Just FYI, HILTON, CARLTON, BEWLEYS and others all had at least two busses come and go while I was waiting, some had three and I think BEWLEYS had four !",1,2010,07,17
250,Beautiful Hotel,"I was recommended to stay in this Hotel by a friend, and I must say I was unsure at first as we would usually go outside Dublin for our breaks away. However, I can now say I would stay here again in a flash. The guy checking me in was extremely friendly and our room was fabulous. We had a gorgeous dinner that evening and then relaxed in the bar afterwards. The hotel is gorgeous and I would definitely keep it in mind for any upcoming events.
Well Done - I will definitely be back.",5,2010,07,14
250,"Super convenient to airport, not to town","Very nice hotel, and super easy to from airport.  Fortunately the bus quickly gets you to the heart of Dublin.  Clean, nice American style in Europe.",4,2010,07,10
250,Best airport hotel I've ever stayed in,"Found this hotel to be significantly better than expectations. We had an awful experience in the Herbert Park Hotel, Ballsbridge the previous night and were not expecting much here. Staff were excellent, rooms were very clean and had all the facilities we needed. Excellent value compared to other Dublin hotels.",5,2010,07,05
250,"Excellent for business travel, but advertised airport ""shuttle"" service is misleading","I stayed at this hotel on a business trip with colleagues and would recommend it to others also traveling for business. The rooms are large, comfortable and well appointed, with high end linens, towels, and modern marble bathrooms.  There is free wireless internet in the rooms, good lighting and a good desk.  Downstairs there is also a business center with pc's, and you can print your boarding passes (or anything else) for free there.  The food services at this hotel are outstanding.  They have an extensive breakfast buffet (which was included with my room), and their own restaurant, Irish pub, and room service.  The food quality and food service were both exceptional compared to other hotels.  The hotel is located across the street from a beautiful estate turned park, but don't expect an early morning run -- the park gates don't open until 10am.  I had only one truly unpleasant experience at this hotel -  the same problem reported by other reviewers.  Although they widely advertise an airport shuttle service, they don't have one.  It's really a scheduled bus service that only operates hourly on the weekends.  I arrived at Dublin airport on a Sunday afternoon after an overnight flight and when I used the Crowne Plaza phone in the Arrivals Hall, I was told it would be another 50 minutes before a bus would be at the airport. We took a cab instead, and the driver complained bitterly because the hotel was so close that the trip was hardly worth his time. The experience left us with negative feelings about the Crowne Plaza that were never quite overcome.  On an overnight return trip a week later, I stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel precisely because I didn't want to hassle with transportation to the Crowne Plaza - and Radisson did not disappoint.  So I'd recommend the Crowne Plaza Northwood for several days stay if you're doing business in their neighborhood - but don't expect an airport shuttle to pick you up at the airport.",4,2010,07,03
250,Great Hotel near Dublin Airport,"We stayed here the final 2 days of our 25 day trip. Preferred to be near the airport so we could use the shuttle service they provideI expected a good clean hotel as anyone would expect from a Crowne Plaza. They didn't disappoint. The room was really large with 2 huge beds.They were so comfy and needed after such a long trip.
The park like surrounding was wonderful. We didn't go anywhere at this point in our holiday. We had a nice meal at the hotel and an incredible meal at The Mandalay just down the street.
I can't imagine any hotel that would have been  better near the airport. The lady even loaded our bags for us on the bus.We had 4 bags...
We especially enjoyed a stroll thru the park and all those ducks and swans.This, I think, is a hidden gem of a hotel and I will ALWAYS choose this hotel when in Dublin airport area..
Only 1 complaint...no internet on top floors..so I had to take my Notebook to the lobby which was very nice anyway..",5,2010,06,21
250,"Beautiful hotel, atrocious shuttle service","We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night before heading to Italy early the next morning. We had also booked car parking for 15 nights.
Our room was beautiful - we got an upgrade to the business floor and were truly impressed. Normally, I really don't care what an airport hotel room for one night looks like as long as I can get a good night's sleep and get to the airport in time the next morning. However, the business rooms on the 4th floor are truly stunning - all Japanese design in red with lots of metal and black wood.
The receptionist was friendly (and even kept a top I had forgotten in the wardrobe for me on our return). Car parking was fine and we were booked on the 5.30 am shuttle to the airport the next morning (that was a bit early but the 6 am shuttle was allegedly already full).
The problem arose on our return. We arrived at the hotel shuttle point at 1. 17 pm on a busy Saturday lunchtime in June with lots of travellers arriving and leaving Dublin airport and using the hotel shuttles. The Crowne Plaza/Holiday Inn shuttle had departed two minutes earlier and we settled in for what we assumed would be a 20 min/half hour wait. There were plenty of shuttles from every other hotel but none from the Crowne. When I called Crowne reception after about 45 minutes I was informed that their shuttles only run every hour (!) during the day and we would have to wait another 20 minutes (which turned out to be closer to 30 minutes...) 
I'm sorry Crowne, but an hourly shuttle service on a busy June Saturday lunchtime is simply not good enough! Every other hotel ran at least two shuttles within the hour and 10 minutes we were waiting - Bewley's, in fact, ran four! Like I said, the Crowne shuttle caters for both the Crowne Plaza and the Holiday Inn Express - surely they could lay on a half-hourly service like every other hotel for guests of the two hotels. The receptionist I talked to didn't even have the courtesy to point out that there were a number of public busses which pass close by the hotel and which we surely would have taken if we had known about the length of the wait. We had had a long trip behind us and were still facing a two-hour road trip back to Belfast so we could have surely done without the additional hour's extra wait.
So in summary - lovely rooms, fine parking but the lack of shuttle service would certainly prevent us from ever staying at the Crowne again.",3,2010,06,18

250,The Best Hotel for Dublin Airport,"The Crowne Plaza @ Santry. 

This great hotel is only 5 mins from the Airport whose shuttle bus driver made me feel
that I was special....Greeted me with a  friendly smile.....and chatted away with  sincere warmth and sense of humour  that made me instantly feel ata ease and welcome.
The hotel reception team were welcoming, good humoured yet professional and made the whole Checking In Process a breeze.
The accomadations are some of the finest anywhere in ireland....let alone at the centre of a major capitols citys airport.
The furnishings were 4star, bright, modern and pleaseing and the layout of everything
you could tell were well thought out and very practical.
The facilities of the Club Floor were xceptionally good and despite the fact that it was
late sunday evening....everything was easily to hand....includeing an extensive array of
lovely snacks, drinks and a considerable array of Today's NewsPapers and uptodate
reading materials.
The Bar was modern, and warm, with welcomeing, friendly, considerate and yes, very
knowledgeable staff.
The Breakfast Room ( next day ) although very busy, was a pleasure to use, where yet
again, the Staff Members were considerate, well manered and provided a First Class
Early Morning Dinning Experiance, that Truly set me up for another long day of travels.
In  conclusion I have to say my short stay at The Crowne Plaza, Dublin Airport was of
the highest quality, exceptional value and one that I happliy reccomend to everyone visiting Dublin, Ireland.",5,2010,01,27
250,Get it at the right price!,"My wife and I ended up staying here on 9-10/01/2010. I say ended up as we had actually booked into an other hotel, the Holiday Inn Express, which I assume is part of the same hotel group and is located beside the Crowne Plaza in the same lovely secluded grounds, about 1 mile from Dublin airport. For some reason, possibly because business was slow, the Holiday Inn hotel had been closed down and we received a free up-grade to stay in the Crowne Plaza. So what went from a stay of necessity in an average 2-3* hotel, due to an early next day flight, became a great start to our holiday to Las Vegas with a luxury stop in a 4* quality hotel. Everything about this hotel was indeed quality- the service, the bedrooms, the food and the building. I could not fault it in any way. If it was not for the fact that I spent most of our stay worrying if our flight would be snow bound the next morning(!) I would ave ad the perfect overnight stay. Not sure if I could or would have paid the normal rates that would be asked for this hotel but for €49, it was the best hotel bargain I have had in a long time.",4,2010,01,20
250,Lovely hotel and great for events.,"I recently had my 21st birthday in this hotel, the staff were fantastic, the events coordinator, showed my the room available for my 21st, ""The FahrenHeit Bar"" the room was incredibly modern and very unusual, it was perfect, they offered special room rates for guest from my party staying in the hotel at a very resonable price which also included breakfast the following morning.
On the day of the party the manager on duty freed up some of his staff to help to rearrange the room in the way that I wanted, all were very pleasent and helpful.
Party was a great success, food was amazing plenty of food although none was left over and everyone left with full stomachs, bar staff were incredible, very friendly and took great care of everyone, I got great feedback from all my guests regarding the staff also.
Residents bar was fantastic, very lively, nice atmosphere.
The rooms were immaculate very nice, modern, gorgeous views of the park.
Breakfast was delicious great selection, would definitely go for the breakfast alone.
The only thing thats missing is a leisure center and it would be perfect.
Lovely hotel.",4,2010,01,14
250,Gorgeous airport hotel,"We attended a function here but would not recomend this as a holiday hotel. Its really close to the airport in a very industrial area, not touristy. to get to city centre would take absolute least 30 mins. 

Rooms were spotless, modern, luxurious. only drawback was our king bed was two doubles!! Not comfy in the gap!!  

Staff really helpful and friendly. Even at 4am after our function!! 

beautiful luxurious hotel and excellent value if u need to stay by airport.

Oh and amazing huge shower!!!!",4,2010,01,08
250,"A bit far from the city center, but will good enough if you are short on the green","I stayed at this hotel with a group of four hundred people for 6 days/5 nights. The hotel is big enough to accommodate large groups and has respectable conference space. It is located about 10 minutes away from the Dublin airport and provide shuttle service.

The Crowne Plaza is a bit far from the City Center but is located near the 16/16A and 27B bus lines. It's approximately 30 minutes from the hotel to downtown Dublin. 

Otherwise, the rooms were lovely and clean. There was an iron and a hair dryer in the room. In addition, they had a variety of different plugs to accommodate international travelers, including Americans. Breakfast at the hotel was a bit expensive (9 Euros for cereal and tea) but you don't have much of a choice.

The staff members were nice and gave good advice even despite that they were not native from Ireland.",4,2010,01,05
250,Impressed by the Crowne Plaza,"My wife and I stayed here on Sunday 20th December 2009 when our flight was suddenly cancelled as Dusseldorf Airport was shut down due to heavy snow storms across Europe.  We managed to get seats on another flight leaving the following morning and our only option was to choose one of the hotels close to Dublin Airport.  To be honest we just picked the Crowne Plaza off the advertisement board in the arrivals hall of Dublin Airport and used the free telephone to make a reservation using the flat rate of 79 euro per room per night with no breakfast.

The hotel has a free shuttle bus between the airport and the hotel which runs every fifteen minutes and we found this to be fine both going to the hotel and returning to the airport.  The reception staff were friendly and helpful both when we made our reservation, when we arrived and then again when we checked out.  Tatiana deserves a special mention for being particularly helpful and friendly.  Our room was modern and spotlessly clean and the bed was most comfortable.  We were only in the room for a total of about 6 hours and it met our needs perfectly.  We didn’t choose breakfast but did take advantage of the complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby which was much appreciated at 4:30am!

We ate in the Cinnabar lobby bar rather than the more exclusive restaurants (Fahrenheit and Touzai) and whilst the choice on the menu wasn’t huge, it was perfectly satisfactory and was served quickly.

If we were in the situation where we needed to stay near Dublin Airport, then it is very likely that we would return to the Crowne Plaza.",4,2009,12,29
250,"great value hotel, in a pleasant location","I have just returned from a stay at this hotel with my wife. We stayed here as the wife was going to the cross country championships in the park next to the hotel. The location would not be great if you want to visit central dublin, but if you want something near the airport its a good option. We paid €89 for the room, when we got there we got a free upgrade to a better room on their business floor. We also got free parking (although i think its meant to be €6 a day). 

The room was very clean with decent amenities. Normally i avoid hotel food like the plague, but for convience we had lunch in the hotel bar, and it was suprisingly good. We did not have breakfast as i think its overpriced at €15. There is some shops and cafes about a 10mins walk away if you want provisions. The hotel is no good if you want excitment, as there are no bars or decent restaurants nearby, but if you want a quiet relaxing stay this is the spot.

Overall we had a great time, I would recommend this hotel.",5,2009,12,13
250,Perfect (ly overpriced) and far out.,"Clean, well run, staff is generally friendly (can be hassled and a little short with large influxes of conferees and groups going to the nearby sporting events). Otherwise a mixed bag of the good and not quite so good: modern appointments (after four nights I still didn't know all the features on the room's telephone) but no flat-screen tv; temperature control on shower; quite and responsive wall thermostat; separate bathtub from shower stall. Good wifi and free; but then the place can be strangely penny-pinching: $4.75 for a can of Coke from the mini-bars (with no vending machines in the hotel) --also be careful, sensor controlled, you might be mistakenly charged, I was, plus the mini-fridge is set up so as to be unusable for your own items); 2 euro access charge for an outside line even if you are calling a toll-free number.  No ATM machine. Rooms are quite expensive considering the hotel is too far from downtown to be considered by tourists (15 to 20 euro one-way taxi fare; 35 or more minutes one way by bus).  Place seems gear just for business conferences and group outings to the sports events, with close proximity (2km) to the airport and free shuttle service.  The sister Holiday Inn Express is attached via a conference center, i.e., exactly in the same location.  Can't comment on the Holiday Inn side, didn't stay there.  But with the famous stadium in the neighborhood, the dual hotel setup gives fans an option on price.

Just a fine, almost elegant, hotel for business purposes, events, or overnighting by Dublin Airport.  But too expensive to recommend and out of the loop for visiting Dublin city.",4,2009,12,12
250,great place to rest before the long trip home,"We stayed here the night before our morning flight back to the States - the room was very comfortable and immaculate - we could really stretch out and relax - there is a beautiful park just across the road where you can walk - the restaurants are very good - service is great, food is tasty - and we got a great night's sleep because the place is quite quiet - it was just a great way to prepare for the long journey home.",5,2009,11,30
250,Breakfast very poor and much too expensive,"I have just stayed at The Crowne Plaza for 2 nights, the bedroom was comfortable but a bit crowded with furniture. The breakfast was €30 for 2 people. The containers were mostly empty and the bacon/sausage/egg that was there was cold. The toast is self service but there was no bread, the waitress went to get some and by the time she got back the food was even more cold. No Native Irish serving in any part of the hotel which seems a pity.  There is a recession on and even though I thought the rate of €79 euros for the room very good value the breakfast and the bar prices are exhorbitantwhich rather spoiled my experience.  Management please take note......",3,2009,11,16
250,do not stay here if you expect good customer service,"This was easily the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. The room was 99euro for the night, and then you are being charged for EVERYTHING else on top of that, even to listen to music on the tv. We had to jam a piece of cardboard into the electricity slot, as it keept switching off, we asked three times for something to be sent to our room, and each time it was the wrong thing, Then they just gave up and never responded to us, we had to go down to reception and get it ourselves. The next morning, they only brought one breakfast, which had nothing that we asked for on it. Then they brought two more, with no cutlery, which meant that it was cold by the time they got back to us. Lots of stuff like this happened, and we were only there for one night .However, my main issue was that when i contacted the hotel to inform them of this, the people who deals with complaints, Karen Wragg and Hayley Collins, tried to offer me a $30, (€20) voucher. I pointed out that this wouldn't even cover the breakfast that we had to go buy when we left, they said that they felt that they had done enough to try and fix the problem. I was absolutely disgusted, as I work in a hotel myself ,and if ANYONE had a complaint similar to ours, the hotel would try a lot harder to make up for it. Don't stay here, you are basically a number to these people, nothing more.",1,2009,11,13
250,Cancellation Policy - Beware of booking via www,"10/19/09 - Planning a trip to Ireland in May 2010, yes 7 months in advance.  Made online reservations but didn't read the ""fine print"" about cancellation.  As a result in the change of our financial situation, I had to cancel our reservation on 11/02/09.  Rec'd email stating that the hotel had charged my credit card and that they had a ""no cancellation policy"".  I will not stay at ANY of Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn or any of the associated hotels.  I lost 90 Euros when I could least afford it.",1,2009,11,04
250,convenient location,"close to airport and nice stay--rooms comfortable and good size.  I wouldn't stay here as a primary location to see Dublin unless you have a car, but great place to stay when you land and/or exit the city.",4,2009,11,03
250,"An upgrade from Holiday Inn, which I should have turned down.","We were ""upgraded"" from the sister property, the Holiday Inn Express, and we were told it was due to me being a member.  Regarding the holiday inn, which I had researched on Trip Advisor, and knew was perfect for our needs.  We were a party of two that just needed a quiet place to crash near the airport for our early flight back to Los Angeles the next morning.  Let me tell you, the Holiday Inn Express is 100 times better, and if they offer you an upgrade to Crowne Plaza, please do try to decline.

Lobby/Atmosphere:  3 loud parties in all restaurants, spilling out into the lobby on the night of Saturday, October 10.  We were placed on the second (first floor) #147.  We had booked a non-smoking   It had ash trays in the room and reeked of smoke.  I called down that I had allergies and would get sick from staying there, but they said there was nothing that could be done.  The floors were stained in the hallway, although the room was relatively clean.  The elevators reeked like a perfume store.

Dining/Food: Went to scout out a vending machine to just get some chips and water to hold over for the morning but couldn't find any.  We went to ask at the front desk, but no one was there.  We were told there was no availability at the restaurants due to the parties and crowds.  We looked for a room service menu in our room, just to see the options, but although we could find a page in the ""info"" book telling us it was available, we didn't have a menu.  We tried to use our phone by pressing 0 to talk to the front desk, but no one answered.  
We gave up at this point and walked across to the Holiday Inn and availed ourselves of their vending machines.  Their lobby was stone quiet.  The clientele was older and relaxed.  I wished every moment that we hadn't been ""upgraded"" 

The people, cleanliness, and pricing at the Crowne Plaza is sub par to the cheaper location of the holiday inn express next door.  I would never stay here again, and in honesty it has soured my opinion of the Crowne Plaza brand in general.",2,2009,10,13
250,"Great hotel, but way out of town","We stayed here on our recent trip to Dublin.  The hotel is very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that goes back and forth if you don't have a car.  If you are driving, it's just a short drive from the airport, with the added bonus of not driving into the center of Dublin to get to the hotel.  This is a benefit and a detriment to staying here.  The downside being that getting into downtown Dublin requires driving (not recommended), a taxi ride, or a local bus (tricky if you don't know the schedule and routes).

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The Restaurant is very good, but quite expensive.  The bar is a bit more affordable, but can be noisy.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable.  In my opinion, the only problem with this hotel is the difficulty of getting to and from downtown Dublin, but other than that, you can't go wrong here.",4,2009,10,12
250,Excellent Hotel,"I had an overnight layover traveling from Burgas, Bulgaria to the US. The hotel was fantastic. Everything was fine. The breakfast was good. The only drawback I could claim was the service at the bar. I just spent the day traveling and I looked rather scruffy. I wanted to grab a quick beer, relax, and turn-in for the night. I sat around in the bar and was not attended to. Then again, I don't know if I necessarily blame the waiter.

The hot pot in the room did not work. I called the front desk and an employee came to my room very quickly and replaced it.

One note - the bus does not run after 11:45pm to the Crowne. When I tried to catch a taxi at the airport, the taxi driver told me to go catch the bus. I was about 11:50PM and I told her I wouldn't be able to catch it. She said sure I could. She seemed rather peturbed that I needed a ride to the Crowne since it was so close - maybe she wanted a larger fare? If you arrive late, be insistent on taking a cab. I wasted over an hour waiting in line for a taxi, being turned down, walking to the bus, waiting for the never arriving bus, then walking back to the taxi line, and ultimately catching a taxi. The next taxi driver was extremely friendly and helpful.",5,2009,10,01
250,great for on the way to the airport.,"We stayed here for one night before a flight.  I would have to say that was a great decision because it took a long time to check in and enter security.  Probably the longest one ever for me and Dublin traffic is pretty rough.  The hotel was very friendly and accomadation.  The restaurants were good.  Also there is an excellent, and very large park across the street.  The location is not really suitable for city center tourist activities, unless you were going to drive there every day...but I couldn't event imagine that.  It is great for business, airport travel,  and otherwise needing a location in far north dublin.",4,2009,09,19
250,Nice Hotel,Stayed here for a Wedding and have to save the staff and Hotel itself where spot on. The staff were very friendly and the food in the hotel couldn't be faulted.  The rooms where nicely decorated and would recommend.,5,2009,09,17
250,One of the best hotels I've ever visited!,"From the friendly staff to the large and comfortable rooms, the Crowne Plaza Northwood is brilliant. I got an incredible deal on Priceline that makes this value so much more amazing. On the night I checked in, the free bus to and from the airport wasn't running, so they told me to take a cab and then reimbursed me! Check in was smooth and the guy at the front desk was so helpful in assisting me with booking a bus back to the airport.

The room itself was immense as far as most European hotels go. The TV, phone, and other appliances were up to date; the bed was huge and super comfortable; and the entire place was spotless. I was able to order delicious room service at midnight, and it shockingly wasn't very expensive. There are a good amount of movies to choose from if you're going to be spending some time in the room, and the internet connection is both fast and free.

Some may complain about the distance to and from the city center of Dublin, but buses run regularly. It's the perfect hotel if you need something close to the airport, however. My experience was great and I'd book with them again in the future without a doubt!",5,2009,09,16
250,Fantastic hotel and friendly staff,"We have had the pleasure of staying here a number of times and have really enjoyed each stay. The rooms are fantastic, up to date, well furnished and spacious. We were upgraded last time for a special occasion and the room was beautiful. Breakfast is fantastic with a large choice. The bar is also very welcoming, with all the staff we came across making us feel welcome and at home. The hotel has a regular shuttle bus to the airport, whcih is great even if getting buses into the city or to other areas. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,09,07
250,spot on,"I had a meeting in this hotel last wednesday so I decided to stay over on the tuesday night,  It was not the first time I stayed here and I was glad to return as my first experience had been positive. Free wi-fi, good clean room, well appointed bathroom; cannot find fault.  Dinner in the main restaurant was a bit hit and miss to be honest. A restaurant that has asian influnences but as a result doesn't know what it is.  A bit of a mess to be honest and I would not eat there again.

The best bits, the rooms, the location, close to the airport and close to motorway. The rate was also really competitive Eur90 room only is excellent value for Dublin 4 star.

Only down side, the restaurant......my advice, eat in the bar.",4,2009,08,31
250,"Hotel is great, only downside is the location","Stayed here last night and it was a great hotel. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. Bathroom is indeed nice with a bath and separate shower. The beds are really comfortable and the room got double glazed windows, and you won't hear any noise from outside. The staff is all very friendly and helpful. There is free wifi in the lobby and depending on where your room is, you might be able to pick it up there as well. The downside is that the hotel is in a industrial estate with very little to do.",4,2009,08,20
250,"A little out of the way, but a really nice hotel.",We stayed here our last night in Ireland before our flight home...it wasn't near the city center but the staff advised us of a quick and easy bus route into the city which took about 20 minutes. The rooms were average sized but the bathroom was wonderful. Full bath and seperate shower. The staff were great at check in and they offer a free shuttle to the airport.,4,2009,08,08
250,Friendly and comfortable,"I would like to add my praise to all the others who have posted their reviews. 
The most outstanding thing about this hotel is the friendliness and willingness of the staff - almost without exception. By the end of my 3 days I felt that some were long-lost friends.
On top of that the rooms are reasonably spacious, nicely furtnished and clean and I found the bed to be extremely comfortable.
I have only 2 negative comments. I did not like having to pay 6 euro a day to park (which is the same as a non-resident also pays). I found the breakfasts rather disappointing, especially the lack of fresh fruit in the height of summer and the service was nowhere near the high standard of all other parts of the hotel.
The food in the Cinabar bar was very good and, again, service was excellent and very friendly.
I was worried that being so close to the airport there would be disturbance from noise but that is definitely not a problem and it is a simple, straightforward bus ride to the centre of the city - although you do need to flag the bus down or it won't stop!
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, will definitely return and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2009,08,07
250,A delight,On our last leg of our European trip we stayed at the Crown Plaza Dublin Northwood. to be near the Dublin airport. This hotel is awesome.The lobby is chic and swanky.Our room was fantastic it had corner windows it was modern large and just beautiful.  The staff is friendly. The hotel is in a very nice wooded area. Across from a emerald green park.Our room looked out to that park. The hotel had free shuttle to the airport. I would stay there again.,5,2009,08,06
250,Great hotel,"I'm more of a B&B person, but needed a place close to the Dublin airport for a flight out the next day and the Crowne Plaza fit the bill perfectly.

The free shuttle at the airport was on time and an easy 15-20 minutes' drive to the hotel. The public areas are snazzy and modern, with a full restaurant, a bar/restaurant, and a separate coffee bar (though I never saw the latter open). Check-in was easy, though there was only one person at the desk, which bogged things down unnecessarily.

My room was large, clean, very comfortable with two single beds, two chairs, and a table. There was a medium-sized TV on a swivel (though difficult to see or use from anywhere but the bed), a large armoire and a pants press. The bathroom was enormous, with separate tub and shower. Very modern features and plenty of space to spread toiletries out. They even had washcloths, which many or most European hotels do not have. :)

Best yet is an amenity that they have no control over, but you can take advantage of: there's a gigantic city park across the street with a duck and swan-filled stream, running paths, and great swaths of grass. This was a great place to walk off a dinner and then, in the morning, stretch my legs before the dreaded 7 hour flight back to the States. It really made my day to be able to checkout, have them hold my bags, then stroll across a street to all that green (be warned though that the main park does not open until 10 am., but is open late. For a morning stroll, just follow the gate by the stream, it's still peaceful).

For dinner, I demurred on a high-priced hotel meal and instead asked about local restaurants. There're only two options, as the Crowne Plaza is in a business park: Mandalay, an over-priced Thai restaurant 100 yards away, and Little Venice, 200 yards away. Little Venice appears to be the better choice: it's half the price of Mandalay, service was fast (if a bit harried), and the food generous.

Perhaps my only complaint is that I opted for ""internet in my room"" i.e., through the TV. It was 3.95 Euro for 24 hours, but the provided keyboard was tiny, the web applications weren't up to date (so I couldn't use web-based chat to contact my wife), and someone hasn't done their user testing: the screen resolution doesn't match the TV size, so you have to scroll using an antiquated touch pad on the keyboard to see various parts of the screen. Really inept for a place calling itself a business hotel, though I supposed most biz travelers would just have their own laptops.

The shuttle back to the airport was fast, efficient, and possibly 2 minutes late.

All in all, a great airport convenience and lovely surroundings.

Pros
- Great airport location and shuttle service
- Amazing nearby park and greenspace
- Friendly staff
- Large, comfortable rooms

Cons
- Internet service is lousy (don't know about WiFi).",4,2009,08,06
250,Disapointing,"I am a Priority Club member and naturally book at participating hotel (ichotels group) .I`ve booked an Business Class accommodation for one night at Club Floor level . The hotel is welll decorated but am farid that`s all we`ll keep in mind : we had to carry our own heavy luggages , none had attended including employees watching at us @ the reception ! If you are beer drinker , no problem , the rest including a bite ( nothing from 6.30 pm ) just forget it .   Poor service and noisy place .

250,a nice stay,"Stayed here for one night back in april  with friends, as i was attending a party in the hotel,  hotel is located in beautiful woodland area, shop's also located close to the hotel,  reception area is very large open space, very modern but comfortable.  the lounge had a small bar  with lots seating area's, no music playing thou :( staff were friendly and welcoming. stayed in a twin room a  little small but cosy!  rooms are quite and relaxing..
ice machines are located on all floors and are very handy, breakfast was plentyful.  very nice stay.",4,2009,07,13
250,Best hotel I ever stayed at!,"WOW this hotel was great. The room was very clean and comfortable, I had a hard time geting out of bed it was so comforting. The staff for the most part were helpful and freindly. Free Internet, and it was centally located. Minutes from the airport and about 5 miles from the City Center of Dublin. Leave your car at the hotel and take Public Transportation. A bus stop is one block from the front door. I feel this hotel was a great value.",5,2009,07,11
250,"Wonderful rooms, but service could use improvement","Chose for its proximity to the airport, but the shuttle only ran once an hour during the day, and we just missed it. This was not explained on the website when booking. When hotel was contacted they offered no suggestions but to wait the 50 minutes for the next shuttle. Our reservations were mysteriously switched to a day later than our confirmation stated. Luckily, rooms were available and they were able to fix the mistake. Complimentary coffee was worse than instant.  Our card didn't work when we tried to get back into our room. 

Rooms were beautiful and extremely comfortable. Excellent king bed with a lovely decor. Bathroom was large no issues. Price was good for the room quality. Would recommend with the above hesitations.",3,2009,07,05
250,Reassuringly familiar,"Very clean public areas, almost spotless. The room was very well equipped and again very clean, in addition to being sound-proofed extremely well. The restaurant is good, but expensive if you're on a budget. Don't be afraid to haggle on the price with the hotel direct, not central reservations. I also got a room upgrade and whilst this probably cost the hotel very little, the gesture means I'll return.
Worthy of special note is the breakfast - a huge choice of cooked food, a very fresh buffet and the coffee was served at the table, which saves carrying a cup!
The car parking is charged at €6 / night, but is secure.",4,2009,06,15
250,nice stay close to the airport,"My second stay at this hotel, chosen both times for its proximity to the Dublin airport and the hotel's dependable shuttle service.  Room was clean and comfortable albeit just a tiny bit cramped (two beds in room often make it that way).  We arrived  late and hastened to the bar area for a late evening supper only to find that it had just closed.  The kitchen staff was kind enough to let us choose from a half-dozen light entrees knowing that we'd just arrived.  We'd booked an Internet rate in advance and felt that the stay offered good value for the money.  Only one drawback (and it could have been major had we not had a cell phone) - the front desk forgot to place our requested wake-up call  the morning of our departure.   I admit that I didn't listen to their excuse for the missed call . .I was still a bit miffed.  All was well in the end and I'd stay there again . . . .next time armed with a trusty alarm clock.",4,2009,06,13
250,Superb hotel,"My Wife & I recently stayed at this hotel for the first time & are hooked!

   Reaching the hotel couldn't have been easier,they have their own shuttle bus to/from the airport,transfer is about 15 minutes.
    Even though we arrived at 0730hrs the room was already available,the room was spacious,well equipped & spotless,in fact all of the public rooms we saw looked brand new,it certainly is well looked after.
    The location is superb,directly accross from the hotel is Northwood Park,a beautiful place,weather permitting.
    Leaving the best till last,we ate two nights in the hotels'  Touzai restaurant,the menu has a superb vatiety,the food was delicious & the service was first class,we were supposed to eat there all 4 nights of our stay but the bar(Cinnabar) was even better,great food & so many wonderful members of staff,we made some great friends there.
   The hotel is also close to the Omni Shopping Centre & handy for a wide number of bus services,thoroughly recomended.",5,2009,05,19
250,modern,"Very nice hotel but a bit far from town center. Almost half an hour by public bus.
Close from the airport and free shuttle very useful!

Rooms are clean and spacious and the king bed is so confortable !

The Touzai restaurant is very good and the breakfast is very varied also.",5,2009,04,15
250,As expected for a Crowne Plaza,"Nice, clean, modern.  Like a US hotel.  No free breakfast or free parking.  Close to the airport (around 10 minutes away).  The only downside was noise from the hallway in the early morning that interupted our sleep.",5,2009,03,31
250,Nice setting for hotel,"Stayed here in Feb 2009, it is a good hotel about 2 miles from Dublin airport, set in nice grounds, it appears to be a sister-hotel to the neighbouring Holiday Inn. Pay parking is available on site, a shuttle bus to/from the airport runs every 20 minutes. The hotel has an arts and crafts theme, the bedrooms were good with a huge bathroom suite in my room. Reasonable value, the bar-food was good, staff were good to deal with. 

There us very little to do within walking distance of the hotel - the only restaurant nearly was quite expensive.

Fine if you are flying from Dublin airport and want to stay off the airport grounds.",4,2009,03,05
250,We have stayed twice!,"So Folks we have stayed at two occasions in the Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin-Northwood ( this hotel was earlier known as the Crowne Plaza Dublin-Airport ) in July and in August 2008. Our two rooms have been nearly identical, only the picture behind the bed had been different. Our rooms no. 249 and no. 315 on the second time. Here it goes, Folks! They offer a free shuttle bus from Dublin Airport normally but at our second stay the usual driver was sick so we had to take a taxi for around 11 Euro and was paid by the hotel. ( it was deducted from the room bill! ) but must be paid to the driver in cash first! The driver was grumpy because he couldn' t understand that the free hotel shuttle bus wasn' t on offer! Why he was that way? That is anyones guess! The hotel is a four storey brick building in the Northwood estate around 5 min. drive from the Airport in Dublin-Santry. The lobby is medium, however the check-in desk is large. On both occasion the check-in was fast and friendly. The Lobby offers also to the other side a fish tank and the Lobby Lounge and Cinnabar. After the Lobbydesk come straight the elevators to the floors! OK, both rooms have been identical which incl. black furniture, mini-bar, medium sized TV with only local channels, NO CNN! Being at the airport you would think they have at least CNN! However they have a reasonable priced Pay per view offer for 9.99Euro 24h movies and music which also includes Internet through the TV! The views from the rooms had been first to the neighbour Holiday Inn Express Hotel and on our second stay to the other side directly on the apartment buildings! The bed was big and comfortable, two chairs have been always provided with coffee table near the window plus a executive writing desk plus executive chair for business travelers. Free water was also provided on both occasions. Which we found nice. Moving on to the bathroom now! The Bathroom was medium in size with bathtub and shower combination, but there was no handheld shower! Which one of us found odd! The amenities have been all Crowne Plaza branded. On both occasions we had room service after checking in and both occasions it was fine incl. our chicken quessadilla to share and north african carrot soup. One of the things which have been not nice was that the Club Lounge is only open during the week, so do not book a club room here during the weekends! On each evening on both our stays we have had Dinner at the Hotel' s Touzai Restaurant and it was always full! Our Dinner was very nice and big incl. Steak, Singapore noodles, big fruit salad, which was our largest fruit salad ever in the world so far! Can anybody deliver a bigger portion, Folks? We had always South African red wine by the glass! Delicious! When you should stay longer however the menu can be somewhat small in the Restaurant and it can get boring! On both occasions we had the same menu! Around one month was between the two stays! The breakfast was both times very very weak and not recommended from one of us! Some items have been out and had only been restocked after asking someone to restock! Service? NO! The bread was basic and the food in itself was not what you would expect from an international hotel chain! Clearly Crowne Plaza is somewhere stuck in the middle because it just can' t decide will it be a Holiday Inn which is cheaper or an Intercontinental which is more expensive! This same situation can be found in the Crowne Plaza Birmingham. All in all the hotel has its plus points in terms of modern space and rooms but it has also minus points with only basic breakfast and weak TV NO CNN again! For one night we would however recommend this hotel! But only when you must! Btw. opposite the hotel is the beautiful Santry Demesne Estate which offers a lot of greenland with many very good walkways and byways. Enjoy. The Airline buffs shoud note that the Aer Arann HQ is also in the Northwood estate around 10 min. walking distance from the Crowne Plaza near the entrance to the estate. Then it was back to the airport with the free shuttle bus! ( Read also our Shelbourne, A Renaissance Hotel Dublin review ).",4,2009,01,15
250,Wow!,"This is one of the nicest hotels my husband and I have ever stayed in. We only stayed overnight, but we were very pleased with the service and amenities offered at this hotel. The atmosphere is very chic and modern. There are several bars and restaraunts to choose from, though pricey. 

The first room we had was very nice, with a plush king bed, large marble bath (with soaking tub AND glass-enclosed shower) and contemporary furnishings. Our tv didn't work, and as we were tired and staying in for the night, we really wanted to watch a movie. After the front desk staff couldn't fix it, they switched us to another room, free of charge...

The second room was AMAZING. Located on the club level, it was a suite with a sitting area and an even bigger bathroom. We had free use of the club lounge with drinks, snacks and a computer. 

We didn't have any food from the restaraunt or the cafe, so we can't say how good they were. The staff was helpful, although a bit stiff. That's my picky nature talking, though. 

GREAT HOTEL!",5,2008,12,25
250,lovely anniversary treat,"Some time ago, I mentioned to the Mary Buckley (general manager) that our Silver Anniversary and that of the Priority Club coincided. I was offered a stay at a greatly reduced rate to mark the occasion. Such a nice thought, and very rare in today's world of multi national corporations.

As usual, there was a warm welcome at check in, and very quickly had room keys in my  hand.  We had been allocated a room on the excellent club floor. The room was pristine, and we were met with a chilled bottle of wine: very unexpected and much appreciated.

Room service was very good: two perfectly cooked steaks and reasonably priced too.

The Club lounge is very useful for getting a late night coffee or soft drink, and nice to relax in. In the morning a continental breakfast is served, and is a nice way to start the day ( and better for the waistline than a fry-up!).

My wife and I regularly stay here and appreciate location and service in the hotel.",5,2008,11,21
250,Beautiful surroundings,"Stayed one night in a king bed room at the club level.  At the club level, the rooms are quieter, free internet with your own laptop, complimentary morning buffet and beverages in the club lounge.
Room was beautifully decorated, modern looking.  Nicely laid-out.  I stayed in room 430 and it was directly across the club lounge.  Can be noisy due to people going in/out of club lounge.
Hotel is in a great location, close to the airport (~10mins.) and shopping center with grocery store and bank about a 15 min. walk.  Directly across the street from the hotel is a beautiful large park.  Dublin city center is about 20 min cab ride and hotel has shuttle to airport.  Room service was great as was the food.  The coffee bar ""Inca"" was never open during my stay, but was able to get expresso from the bar lounge.  I was late for the airport so I was not able to sample the complementary morning buffet.  Would definitely stay at this hotel again, specifically at the club level.",4,2008,10,21
250,"Lovely hotel, just don't leave anything behind","We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and i honest can't fault the hotel itself, lovely rooms, good breakfast, very close to the airport, heplful staff etc.  The only prob we had is that we accidently left our house keys behind us. The hotel located them for us which was very helpful, but then the girl we were speaking to asked us did we want to organise someone to collect them or have them posted to us. We only live in sourthern ireland so posting them was ideal.  But the girl then asked us for our  credit card details???? When we enquired as to why she would want out credit card details, she told us that they were going to charge us, the cost of the postage.  Now we would have had no probs in paying it if it was a large bunch of keys and they would have had to be posted abroad, but it was only 3 keys (on a tiny keyring) and the cost of posting it to our home would have been no more than 55cent for the stamp.  Even when we told them that we had just spent around 800 euro in their hotel and they were going to charge us 55cent.  This apparently is hotel policy. Hotel cheek i think.  So just make sure you leave nothing behind as they will charge for a basic postage stamp.",4,2008,10,21
250,Great Hotel,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza with work and I was very impressed.  The hotel itself is a little out of Dublin city, but only about 15 minutes or so and is very close to the airport.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus (every 1/2 hr or so) to take you to and from the airport.  
When I got to the hotel, I was instantly impressed.  It was clean and well presented and the staff on reception were very polite and helpful (I realised, when I got home - d'oh - I had left my phone charger in my room and they located it and send it back to me free of charge).  The rooms were spacious and well presented and the bathroom was modern and clean.  
Breakfast was good, lots to choose from and again, service staff were quick and attentitive, without seeming like they were trying to get you in and out.  Overall, the hotel and its staff were outstanding and I cannot fault anything.",5,2008,10,13
250,Nice place to Stay,"We stayed 2 nights and used the hotel as a base to explore Dublin - we could have stayed closer to the city, but wanted to have a short trip back to the airport. The airport pick-up bus leaves once an hour, so, if you've just missed one you might want to consider a taxi rather than wait 55 minutes! Quiet location, which can be a blessing after a hectic day in Dublin. Bus stops about 10 mins walk away -frequent service to City centre for a few Euro, or taxi for around 15 euro to the near end of O'Connell Street. (Tip: If you're taking a cab back to the hotel from Dublin city - walk across to the North side of the bridge to get one otherwise -if you hail a cab on the South side of the river, you enter a one-way system which will add time & a few extra Euro to your journey). Dublin was just one big 'party city' when we were there....we enjoyed the Temple Bar area during the day, but fled at dusk as the crowds descended for the night! Expensive city - pint of Guinness (best in the world) almost 5 Euro!",4,2008,08,24
250,Loved the Crowne!,"I must admit I was quite surprised by The Crown Plaza at the Dublin Airport.  The room was very well decorated with all the modern conveniences, the bathroom was huge with both a good size shower as well as soaking tub, it was clean clean clean, the staff was extremely helpful, there was a choice of restaurants or room service, and it was conveniently located near the airport with a free shuttle service.
I would most definitely recommend this location to anyone traveling into or out of Dublin.",5,2008,08,12
250,Satisfactory value.,Took this hotel for proximity to the airport. Stayed there previously. Shuttle to airport. Room good. Food pricey for what it delivers. Would still do it again for the location.,4,2008,08,05
250,Loved it!,"We booked one night at the Crowne Plaza Airport Hotel through Hotwire for $136. We were very pleased with our stay. Our room was clean, very spacious and also had a very large bathroom with a slate floor and an excellent shower. The lobby was very nice as well and the receptionist was friendly and helpful. We would come back to this hotel any time—especially for what we paid.",5,2008,08,04
250,FANTASTIC Hotel!,"I needed a hotel for the night before my flight home to the states close to the airport.  I decided to try Hotwire since I knew I'd be getting in late and leaving early - my only needs were a bed and a shuttle to the airport.

For $130 (US) I was given the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport.  The last time I was in a Crowne Plaza was for a business trip a few years ago and I low expectations... however this hotel was AMAZING.  It must have either been just built for recently renovated.  The hotel lobby was beautiful and the room was superb.  

The shuttle was free and left exactly ontime for the airport.

I truely have NO complaints about this hotel.",5,2008,07,31
250,Clean and friendly,Attended a family function at the hotel that was catered for very well. Very clean rooms which are modern and tastefully decorated. Can be a bit noisy: woken by the next rooms morning wake up call!! Good breakfast hours (up to 11am on Saturday and Sunday) but pre book with the room as 27Euro if not included in your room rate. Bar in the hotel is very expensive. About 20Euro for a taxi into Dublin city centre.,4,2008,07,29
250,All round a great hotel.,"Great hotel, great location. 

Really friendly and welcoming staff, helpful and courteous. 

Rooms are nice if a little small. 30 euro extra gets you on the club floor, nicer rooms, really nice club lounge with a wonderful chatty irish lady serving breakfast. 

The lobby and bar area are great, starbucks coffee, a bar and restaurant with good upbeat feel, great staff and for the standard, location and purpose of the hotel actually pretty good food. 

Would absolutely recommend it for airport/business in Dublin and it's not that far to town in a taxi. About 20 euro.",4,2008,06,05
250,Not much to fault...,"Stayed here after a late-night arrival into Dublin Airport.

Shuttle bus from the airport was an actual bus (not a mini-van), which was a bonus. It's shared with the neighbouring Express by Holiday Inn and runs quite frequently.

Check in was fast and efficient, and the room was large and cosy (including the bathroom) with all the extras and facilities one might expect of a hotel of this class.

The downsides - it's not exactly an ""airport"" hotel in the sense that it is on-site or next to the airport. It's not an overly long journey on the shuttle, but it is worth factoring in that extra 10-15 minutes journey time.

Views - some rooms will have nice views over the adjoining parkland. Mine, alas, had a view of a brick wall.

The decor - well it won't be to everyone's taste. My room had lots of dark wood and black tones which seemed a little 1980's. If you don't mind that though, it most certainly was comfortable.

Room service - as I arrived in quite late I was hungry. I tried to contact room service, but they hung up when they eventually answered! Not quite what one expected. Luckily I had some snacks in my bag (dried fruit and muesli bars) but it's probably something the hotel should be concious about!

Still - I'm willing to write this off as a one-off negative and not a regular occurance. I'd definitely recommend this hotel as one option for those needing to stay at Dublin Airport, and it's one I'll most likely use again.",4,2008,05,13
250,Good for Large Groups,"Room:  large and comfortable, as was to be expected.  Climate control very good.  Internet not free as normal with larger hotels (it should be free.)  Bed small but comfortable.  Considering the size of the rooms, it was surprising to find twin beds instead of two double or queen size beds.  Bathroom spacious and modern.  Needed more drawer space to put away clothing.  Overall a great room.

Restaurant.   You are a bit of their prisoner for food if you are on foot.  The main restaurant is a modern oriental place that is great for adults, but having too many surprises for children.  They would have to be adventurous to survive there.  Bar food average and predictably typical, but in a very crowded atmosphere (and only available to children until 20:00).  The one time we ate in the bar, the table service was terrible.  The waitress spent 15 minutes chatting with another table after we placed out order.  I had to approach the bar man and ask what I had to do to get a drink and food.  I made a ""mini-scene"" and it was resolved immediately, but no apologies.  The waitress only tried to justify why I had to wait.  In fairness, it appeared to be an isolated case.  The bar food?  Overpriced and plain.  There is an outside oriental restaurant near the ""Old Airport Road"" – the Mandalay.  Looked great for me, but I didn't think the children would like it.  The only other alternative was ""Little Venice"" on Old Airport Road.  We ate there, but it was more fuel more than food.

The hotel is very near the airport with a shuttle every 30 minutes (except once an hour during parts of the afternoon).  It worked well.  We took taxis to and from the city centre.  About 15-20 euros each way.  Lots of congestion and traffic.

The things I didn't like:

1.	The hotel seems to cater more to groups rather than individuals.  Yes, they were responsive to some problems we had, but were overwhelmed at times by large groups moving through the day as a unit.  It could be very loud at times as well as difficult to have access to the bar.

2.	No place to leave your car when you arrived.

3.	The telephone system wasn't working well and received four calls intended for another room one morning – including two wake-up calls before 7:00am.  Finally I took the handset off the hook and put it under a pillow.  After mentioning it in reception, they removed one of the phones and it seemed to work after that.  The staff was very apologetic about it and apologized profusely (unlike the waitress who was happier justifying why the service was bad).

All-in-all, a very comfortable place near the airport.  I'd go again.",4,2008,04,07
250,B+,"Husband and I stayed at this hotel for the big St. Patrick's Day weekend and all our vacation objectives where the typical tourist stops in Dublin. 

We called the hotel from the Dublin airport for the free shuttle and it arrived in a reasonable time. It's a large bus that was clean and comfortable. Drive time from the airport to hotel is about 10 minutes. Hotel looks brand new inside and out. Rooms are extremely clean and modern! We bid on Priceline and booked the room for $103.00 USD. I think the hotel is a steal for that price. 

We only had two ""issues"" at this hotel. I had read in a previous post that this hotel has not honored the non smoking room requests in the past and that smoking rooms smell really bad. I emailed AND called the hotel directly weeks in advance to make sure we were booked in non smoking (king bed) room. At 10:00AM on check in day (several hours before “check in”) the clerk told us that we were booked for smoking and that non smoking rooms were all taken. I told her that I had called and emailed to make sure we were in non smoking because I had read online the hotel has issues with honoring guests’ requests. She ended up finding a non smoking with 2 twin beds. We took it. 

Second issue that was only slightly annoying but not really a deal breaker was the travel time to downtown Dublin from this hotel. We purchased a 3 day hop-on-hop-off bus pass that included city buses at the Dublin tourism office in the airport. The walk from the hotel to the main street to catch the city bus is about 3 blocks. Seems like a long walk on cold days! Once you get on the city bus it's about 20-30 minutes to downtown Dublin. Stops are not announced on city buses and you'll need to figure out where you are and when to get off. Waiting for a bus after 7pm and getting back to the hotel took us an hour a couple nights. Overall the hotel is great for the price, but be prepared for a longish commute to the tourist areas.",4,2008,03,23
250,Business trip,"To start of, I did not choose this hotel my self, it was pre-booked through the company's travel agent, so I had no choice. It is located between the airport and the city, closer to the airport actually. I took a taxi one day, approximately 25 min in traffic for €25 and then the bus going back, which was €2 and took 45 min and stopped right outside the business park where the hotel is located. Either way, it makes you stay more in the hotel then you want to, and for this purpose, the hotel is not up to my standards when you want to stay more in it.

This is a good hotel. Nothing extraordinary, but ok if you do not plan to stay in the room. We were booked on the executive floor. The room were spacious with a big bed and a big bathroom with both shower and bathtub. The rooms are nice and fill its purpose, but nothing extra. A plus for the free wireless internet. The bathroom was big and it was nice. A minus here, is that the washbasin is big and cool, but the tap is so small, that when you are rinsing your hands in the water, you have to have your hands on the side of the washbasins edge. Why do not more hotels have a tap that goes further towards the center of the basin? Anyway, thats just something I have notice recently, since I have travelled a lot.

The business floor executive lounge is good. Newspapers, wireless internet and other machines to conduct business, if you need to. We had breakfast here, which was sufficient. It filled its purpose as well and I rather dine here, cause it was right outside my door and I do not eat that much for breakfast. Free water, drinks and fruits all day and they had a happy hour in the afternoon with free drinks.

I went to the fitness center every day. It is a big room, with almost nothing in it. One machine that have several functions, but not enough, a few free weights and some cardiovascular machines. Not good for a hotel fitness center, way below standard.

The lobby area with its two restaurants are nice. I tried to bar, don't remember the name, but directly to the right when you enter the hotel. Their bar menu is quite good, with a good selection. I had a steak, which was really good and big, and some of my colleagues had the hamburger plate with fries, which was huge! This was also the only place where you could see English football on TV, so it was packed almost every night that week.

Another plus is the free airport shuttle that departs every 30 minutes. You just have to be careful not to miss it! 

Overall, a comfortable stay, but nothing extra or something special.",3,2008,02,13
250,Always a nice place to stay.,"I've stayed in the Crowne Plaza several times by now and I'm always very happy with it.  The room this time was a bit over-the-top in the decor - and if you don't like the colour blue you'll hate it - but it is quiet and has everything you need.
One complaint would be the price of breakfast.  If I remember correctly it was somewhere in the region of €20/person.  This would be fine if I hadn't been planning lunch that day, but it was so near Christmas time that a large Christmas meal was inevitable so I skipped the breakfast. You are probably better making sure it is included in your room rate.  The hotel itself doesn't have a great location but is convenient to the airport and next to the Express by Holiday Inn.  They share a shuttle and a carpark.",5,2008,01,18
250,Great Place..No faults,"This hotel still looks brand new, They have a bigger 53 seater shuttle now which they use even if there is two of you!!

Quick and pleasent check in as with all CP and HI.

Breakfast bit expensive if not included in your package 20.95 euro.

Italian restaurant at the end of the road is very nice, it is also next to the bus stop, ideal if it is raining when you get off the bus!!!

All in all excellent hotel, very easy to find and will be returning",5,2008,01,14
250,Nice hotel away from the crowds.,"I stayed here for one night. Luckily I was upgrade to Club room which was smallish but very nice and spotless. Same goes for the bathroom. There is a coffee maker but very few TV channels to choose from. Overall the hotel and especially its staff made a very good impression on me. The location is good if you want to take a breath and relax from terribly busy Dublin, or if like me, you have a very early flight to catch. On the other hand it takes you ages to get to Dublin through the horrible traffic. 
The first shuttle to the airport leaves at 5 in the morning. But I had to leave at 20 to 5 at the latest so I had to take a taxi.
Breakfast is free with the Club room but it only starts at 6. You can't convert your breakfast into some sort room service. Not even a coffee and croissant or something alike. In fact you can't get anything to eat at the hotel before six.  As I had been upgraded, for me it was a win some lose some situation. But if you pay for the Club room it is something to consider. Also the Club lounge is nothing special. You get all sorts of free drinks in the evening, but the snacks as well as the atmosphere are somewhat depressing. 
Still as a business hotel close to the airport the crowne plaza is a very good deal!",4,2008,01,11
250,Best place we stayed,"By far the nicest place we stayed in Ireland, and also the most reasonable.  Every comfort that you could want in the rooms, including an adapter for American appliances.  Nice shower, beds were the most comfortable we stayed in in all of Ireland.  Temperature controls in room actually worked, and quite well, although it was in Celcius.  Restaurant had exceptional food, though a little different.  Everything was clean and new, and the room was quiet.  If I go to Ireland again, I most definitely will stay here.",5,2008,01,06
250,Top Class hotel,"This is a top class hotel and while near Dublin Airport, is far enough away not to have your sleep interupted late at night or early in the morning. The staff are very friendly and will do what they can to make your stay more enjoyable. The food in both the main restaraunt, the front bar or the snack bar is top class. The front desk staff are very accomodating with early check-ins or late check-outs.

There is a sister hotel located next door, ""Express by Holiday Inn"". It too is a fine hotel and offers B&B as standard.

Either of these two hotels are highly recommended for your stay at Dublin airport. These hotels also provide Airport Transfers.",5,2008,01,05
250,An Airport Hotel where you pay for a taxi to the Airport!,"Dont believe a word you read in the hotel brochure or in the in room guest information folder regarding the 24 hour courtsey airport coach.  At check in we were informed that we were departing ""too early"" for the hotel coach and we would have to pay for our own taxi.  It cost us E12 for the taxi, so much for the courtsey coach!  In addition, we were allocated a smoking room which smelt very heavily of cigarette smoke.  We returned to reception immediately only to be informed that we had booked a smoking room which we obviously had not.  The receptionist was unable to re allocate us to a non smoking room as the hotel was ""almost full"".  The hotel in fact looked no more than half full judging from the amount of cars in the car park and the number of people in the public areas of the hotel.  We slept in a stinking room with the window wide open all night, not recommended on an Irish December evening.  Next time we are using Dublin Airport we will stay in a proper airport hotel.",1,2008,01,03
250,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights, including New Years Eve 2007/8.  The Hotel is very nicely decorated, with a pretty lobby and gorgeous rooms.  The Club Lounge on the 4th Floor is a very nice touch with a business center and flat screen TV, books, and free sodas.  The only downfalls were the staff at the breakfast (a little rude) and the fact that it is 7 euros an hour for internet access.  The busses, 16A and 41, run right downtown less than a block from the hotel on Swords Rd., and the airport shuttle was great with wonderful drivers and prompt service.",4,2008,01,02
250,"Nice decor, lacking in other areas","Stayed here for 1 night on business.  Other reviews are bang on about the noise.  The location of this hotel must mean it gets mainly business people or people going to the airport the next morning so you would assume a good nights sleep would be high on the agenda.  The AC was very noisy and hard to get the right temp, also could hear the plumbing every time a toilet was flushed or a tap ran nearby.  I could hear my neighbour snoring all night and a lot of noise from the corridors also.  I was shattered when i arrived at the hotel so should have been asleep the minute i hit the pillow but i was still awake at 4am!  Also so much noise down at reception i had to ask the girl to repeat herself 3 times when i was checking in.

Had a snack in the bar on arrival - steer clear of the chicken wings, they are covered in a horrible batter of some sort, breakfast was also below average.

The room itself was nice, great to see hotel decor using colours other than white, beige, brown as is the case in most hotels these days.

I wouldnt recommend the hotel.  I have stayed in the Carlton up the road and its of a much higher standard on all accounts with breakfast in bed at no extra charge!",2,2007,12,28
250,Perfect airport hotel,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night on a quick mileage run this month.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.  Easy 5 minute shuttle from the airport.  Best thing was that they let me check in at 9 in the morning to go up and sleep.  Very friendly staff.  The hotel was very nice, not huge, but well equipped.  A quick bus ride to the main area of Dublin.  Only costs 1.60 and the pickup is down the block.  

This is not where I would stay for a sightseeing visit to Dublin (go to the Westin!), but for an easy airport stay it was right on the money.",4,2007,12,19
250,Great Hotel,"I spent two nights here while in Swords on business.  It was a very nice hotel with a large, clean, quiet room.  Everything was exceptionally clean.  Food in the Asian/American restaurant was good and priced well given the exchange rates.  Service was excellent with a very friendly staff at the front desk and in the restaurant.  The room is one of the most comfortable I have ever stayed in and I really felt at home.  The free shuttle from the airport is a nice rarity in Europe.",5,2007,12,14
250,Magnificent!,"What a great hotel!  Everything's brand new, clean and beautifully appointed.  Bed/pillows are very comfortable and linens of top quality.  Bathroom is spotless, towels are plush,  and toilettries are good.

Staff is very pleasant and accomodating.  They made sure that we got to the airport in plenty of time to catch our flight.  The free shuttle service was greatly appreciated. 

We did not eat at the restaurant there so can't provide any comments.   

This a great hotel  and I would highly recommend it.  If it were not so far from City Centre this is where I would always stay when in Dublin.",5,2007,10,26
250,"Generally excellent ... reception desk disorganised, lights too low in room","A generally excellent experience - lovely location across from a park. good location from the airport - and terrific to have a shuttle to and from the airport.

my quibbles:

1. at the reception desk it's hard to figure out where you are supposed to Q up to check in or out. it also seemed like the reception people took forever to process people.

2. the room was most excellent BUT the lighting was to muted for me. there wasn't anywhere in the room to swith to a very bright light.. even the reading light only went up to like 40 watts. 

because of electricity restrictions imposed in  europe, you can't plug in the hairdryer in the bathroom. the logical place to plug it in is near the mirror in the room - but the lighting was so low that you couldn't even see what you're doing. 

other then that i enjoyed my stay very much.",4,2007,10,24
250,Great hotel if you dont like to sleep,"I spent 3 nights at this property. It is a clean and attractive proerty. I travel very often internationally, and can tell you this property has many serious faults. 1. You will be repeatedly awakened by room doors slamming. They are built in such a way that they ALL slam when closed. The walls are truly like paper. I was moved 3 times
because of noise....without improvement. You can literally hear FULL conversations next door-NOT ACCEPTABLE>

They are also aware of defective room ventalation systems. Every room
I went to had a loud rattle from the AC. I suppose it would simply be
to costly for them to replace all AC systems in all rooms. So the guest pays the price. You stay at a hotel primarily to sleep! You will not be able to do this properly at this hotel. In speaking with other guests at the hotel they all agreed.

On the surface it is a nice property, however just below the surface its not pretty at all.",2,2007,10,22
250,Good location and not a bad ride into town on Bus.,"Got it for a deal in late September on priceline for $96/night as Ireland is WAY expensive and Dublin even more so.

We went for it as we didn't want to deal with the pain of getting to the airport when we left.  We did the rental car touring Ireland but then turned it in when we hit Dublin.

They have a shuttle bus that brings you in and takes you to the airport that runs typically on the half hour.  Takes about 15 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel.

Room:  
A little smaller than a typical U.S. hotel of the same quality, but nothing too painful.  The rooms (and overall hotel) have modern furnishings, which isn't my style, but for what it was, it looks nice, new and clean.  
They have a minifridge with a sensor that adds the price to your bill when you remove anything... so don't.  And you can't really store anything in the fridge so it's not really worth it unless you can charge it to your company.
They have a hairdryer, but it's not in the bathroom and it's connected to the drawer so my wife didn't love it, but it was there.
Other things:  Pants press, Iron, robes
Bathroom was good size and had a seperate shower and tub.  There was also an outlet for European plugs as well as American plugs, but for things that are low wattage (listed on wall as 'for shavers').  But I charged my iPod on one.

Facility:
Well kept, next to a large park across the street.  The restaurant served Asian fusion cuisine at high prices, so we didn't eat there, but it looked like a nice place.  There's also a Cafe for coffee and breakfast croissants.  It's not a massive place, with only 4 floors, but I think they earned their stars.

Additional:
Not much in the area, but we did eat at a nearby Italian restaurant.  Overpriced, but food was decent.
To get into town was no problem, they provide info on how to take the bus into town (1.60 Euro each way) and which busses to take, included in a map the helpful concierge gave us.  The busses come about every 15 minutes and only took about 20 minutes to make it into downtown.
Walking around Dublin was easy as it's very compact.  But boy is it busy.  You'd think you were in Tokyo or something.

Overall:
I was a bit worried that it would be a pain to get into town to do the tourist thing, but was pleasantly surpised at how easy it was.  Rooms were nice as was the overall facility and it was easy to use the shuttle service to get to and from the airport.  For someone interested in a quick/easy airport connection, I'd recommend this hotel.",4,2007,09,27
250,"Excellent Hotel, Would Recommend!","Having stayed at this hotel 3 times this year and booking my 4th stay in November, I would 100% recommend staying at this hotel.

On my last stay we arrived at the hotel at 8am (just arrived on boat from Wales), extremely tired, the check in staff were wonderful and managed to get us a room straight away.

All the rooms i've stayed in have all been beautiful decorated, with huge beds and even bigger bathrooms! All kept to a very high standard.

Breakfast is lovely, i'm looking forward to their pancakes already! I've had dinner there twice and food was delicious and excellent service.

The hotel bar is ideal for a drink in the evening and the staff are very friendly.

The car-park is great and very safe. Only downside is i found it quite expensive (i think it's €7 a day) which i think is alot for a hotel outside of the city.

Room service is great and very quick, i would recommend the Cottage Pie!!

Overall, it's a great hotel, friendly staff, delicious food and great value for money.",5,2007,09,26
250,Nice Hotel--Poor Check-in Staff,"This very modern hotel is conveniently located near Dublin airport.  The rooms are of average size but very nicely decorated in an ultra modern style.  The mattress and linens were of high quality.  The bathroom was large and very-well equipped.  The public areas are also very upscale.

My major complaint about the Crowne Plaza was our terrible arrival experience.  We arrived from the US about 2 hours before the stated check-in time on a Monday morning in late June.  As it is largely a business hotel, the hotel appeared to be quite empty with very few people in the lobby, breakfast cafe and restaurant.  We inquired about early check-in as requested on our booking, (knowing that such requests aren't always honored.) The clerk at reception said she would look into it, and advised us to wait in the cafe.  After coffee and a roll and a 45-minute wait, I asked about our check-in status, as we alternatively could check our bags and take a bus into Dublin.  After two vague answers from the rather officious clerk over the next hour or so, I asked to speak to a supervisor who ""miraculously"" found us a room in what had to be a near-empty hotel.  Such shamefully poor service should never happen--just be honest in the first place.

We had dinner and drinks in the restaurant and bar that night, an overall very good experience.  The bus to the airport the next morning was punctual, and fast, though the drop-off point at overloaded Dublin airport was a bit far from the terminal.

250,Dublin airport areas best!!,"This hotel was a pleasant surprise!  Very modern. Complimentary water bottles.  The staff was exceptional and efficient.  Shuttle back and forth to airport was convenient and ran on time.  Wonderful service to get out the door and to the airport on time, even in the early morning hours.  Double wake-up calls to make sure you are really awake.  We only stayed for 12 hours or so, but wish we had stayed here longer.  Convenient money exchange at reception desk, wonderful bar/restaurant area with modern meal choices at reasonable prices.  The only hotel we saw in three weeks and four countries with an ice-machine!!
",5,2007,07,31
250,"Loved this hotel, pure luxury","After the Clontarf Castle transferred us here due to overbooking, we were disappointed since I had always had a preconception of the crowne plaza being just an upmarket travelodge. Boy was I wrong! As soon as we arrived, we were dealt with by efficient, friendly, helpful staff who ensured our stay was perfect. The room was simply magnificent, so large and spacious with a bed that was bigger than any i have ever seen (and ever so comfortable!) the complimentary biscuits and mineral water and toiletries were also nice touches, breakfast was amazing, best breakfast I've ever had- its worth the extra few euros to have the waffles and american pancakes! plus the pastries, full irish breakfast and cereals all looked delicious. the free airport shuttle bus was very convenient and all in all i would love to stay at this hotel again.
",5,2007,07,19
250,Very convenient for stopovers!,"We only stayed for one night but for a quick stopover between flights this is ideal! Really appreciated the free airport shuttle and the second wakeup call. Our room was comfy, spacious and clean. The only minor complaint was that our room smelled very, very strongly of cleaning fluid - it went away after awhile but at first it was a bit hard on the sinuses. Otherwise, terrific hotel, good service and very convenient to Dublin Airport.
",5,2007,07,15
250,Short but sweet,"We stayed here for one night but would definitely stay again.  We had asked for early check in for four of us.  They only had one room ready but we were welcome to put our things there.  The room was very nice and very clean.  It had complimentary water bottles and 110 outlets for our appliances.  We had no trouble getting the hotel bus although it is a little bit of a trek through the airport parking lot in the rain.  We had dinner downstairs in the hotel restaurant, which was a buffet and very good food.  We had a very early flight the next morning to Barcelona and since there was not going to be any food available we just bought some pastries at the coffee shop for the next morning.  Directly across the street is a beautiful public park that we took a stroll through after dinner, very nice, even in the rain.  A very pleasant stay.
",5,2007,07,11
250,Hotel near Dublin Airport,"A nice choice for an airport hotel if you are flying out early from Dublin. Very modern, high tech, appears to be recently renovated. Located in a very nice park area about 10 minutes to airport. Has continuous free bus to/from airport.
",4,2007,06,21
250,Brilliant!!!,"Stayed at this hotel for one night before heading on honeymoon. our experience was one of pure luxury and definitely a good start to our honeymoon.

we stayed in one of the club suites and the service was second to none. the club room was fully stocked with drinks, snacks, newspapers and magazines and was spotlessly clean.

the room was amazing - the decor was contemporary and the room was equipped with everyting you would need. the bathroom was marble - beautiful.

we ate in the restaurant and the food was delicious. the service was good and the wait time was more than acceptable.  there was definitely a good atmosphere in the hotel.

we recived our morning call on time, had newspapers, fresh coffee and juice waiting for us in the club room. just what we needed before we boarded a 10 hour plane journey to Atlanta!

checkout was simple and the staff were pleasant. finally to top off a great stay the shuttle to the airport arrived on time.

i would definitely recommend staying at this hotel if flying from Dublin airport. i can't wait to go back!
",5,2007,06,12
250,Hard to find - but very comfortable - keep trying if no-one answers the phone,"My wife and I stayed one night here as an overnight for an early morning departure next day  The Hotel was hard to find from the motorways near the airport and we would advise careful planning and a good map to get there, especially in rush hour traffic.  The rooms are of a high standard and worthy of a 5 star property.  We were disappointed with the choice of food at dinner, one very upmarket restaurant and the other alternative bar style food in the bar.  On the other hand the upmarket restaurant was the site of a sumptuous breakfast buffet in the morning.  Service throughout was  excellent and friendly, although 4 phone calls to the hotel from the airport about the airport transfer bus went unanswered and rang out at 7pm until on the 5th attempt it was answered.  That area needs attention by the hotel management. Overnight parking is Euros 7 and the Internet service is chargeable.
",4,2007,06,02
250,Amazing!!!,"I have stayed at this Crowne Plaza 3 times, and would return again when in Ireland.  The location is great if you're just arriving from the airport or have an early flight the next morning... there is a free shuttle to/from the airport.  Although the hotel is located a bit 'off the beaten path' if you were looking to see the city centre of Dublin, it is a great location if you are enroute to/from the airport.  The hotel is very luxurious and well-appointed.  The staff were quite pleasant and professional.  I would say this is one of the most luxurious hotels I've ever stayed at... excellent for business travellers, executives, or individuals who want high-class.  The dining options are reasonably priced and great quality.  I cannot say enough good about this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone!  A+
",5,2007,05,15
250,A very nice hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel approx ten times, the latest visit being this week and have sampled all rooms from a standard to the Royal Suite.

It is only ten minutes from Dublin airport and they have a very clean and reliable shuttle bus that picks you up from the airport. The hotel is set in some nice grounds(although at the moment there is a lot of building work going on so some not so nice views).

It is a couple of years old but is still in very good condition, the lobby/reception is decorated in a modern style and there is ample space to sit and have a drink and some food, the bar is fairly large and doesn't feel like a typical hotel bar, there is a nice atmosphere in it. The food in the restuarant is excellent and makes for an enjoyable meal.

The rooms are always spotless and well looked after although the standard rooms are fairly compact, there is a well stocked  mini bar, I'm not sure the club floor is worth the extra money as I don't feel the club area provides a lot of extras, you can always get a soft drink, tea, coffee etc but most time there is no food there except for breakfast.

The staff are all pleasent but as is common with most Irish hotels today you can't be sure that you are in Ireland as you won't find many Irish staff in the hotel!!

A couple of niggles, car parking is 7 euros a day which I don't feel is justified, the hotel is in the suburbs and there is nothing else around, i would expect to pay a charge for a city centre hotel but not one outside of the city. As there is not much within walking distance from the hotel it would be helpful it they had a small shop area that sold magazines, confectionery etc

It is very handy for the airport, I usually stay here with a car as a base to travel around County Dublin, it may be a touch too far if you want to visit the city every day.

However it is a lovely hotel that always manages to maintain standards at a reasonable price and it certainly beats the other hotels on the airport site hands down.

We will be back!
",4,2007,05,10
250,excellent!,"i have stayed in this hotel on two occasions now and i wouldn't stay anywhere else in dublin if i could help it! i was travelling on my own and a bit wary of what to expect but i needn't have worried. the staff are brilliant: warm, friendly and efficient. they made me instantly welcome and promptly upgraded me to a club room with free breakfast, all day tea, coffee and soft drinks and free cocktail hour in the executive lounge. this alone was worth the priority club platinum membership fee i pay every year! 
rooms are wonderful - clean, comfortable and spacious. bathrooms are well stocked and have fluffy towels and robes.
breakfast in the executive lounge was described as 'continental' but was better than that - meats, cheeses, fruit, yoghurts, cereals, breads, pastries - and the best almond croissants i have tasted outside of france. 
it's worth mentioning that the executive lounge also doubles as a business centre (2 computers and free internet access) and  a library - newspapers and magazines, a widescreen tv and very comfy chairs.
eating in the hotel is excellent - if a bit pricey. drinks are also quite expensive.
an excellent location for the airport but a bit out of the way for the city centre - you need to catch a bus outside the main gates but these are frequent.
personally i would recommend it - i can't fault the place.
",5,2007,02,25
250,Always consistent,"Stayed here for one night on arrival back from city break.  Flight delayed until 2.30 a.m. Rang shuttle bus from arrivals hall, arrived there in ten minutes as promised.  Check in completed in minutes with upgrade to Club level room (as Priority Club plantinium member).  Room was fantastic, so spacious as well as huge bathroom with separate bath and shower.  Club floor lounge facilities not available at weekend but enjoyed very good breakfast in dining room.  Stayed here before and as usual, excellent choice.",5,2007,01,21
250,Nice place to stay,"We stayed here this last weekend and had a nice time.  

First of all, if you call them from the airport, they will come and pick you up in the shuttle.  It comes every 30 minutes, and the hotel is approx 10 minutes away, maybe less.

Everyone that we came into contact with at reception was incredibly friendly and more than willing to help.

The rooms were a good size, came with a mini bar, iron, robes, hair dryer, safe, and the bathroom has both a shower and bathtub.  Our room was also very clean and tidy.

In order to get into Dublin city center by bus, you need to catch one just down the drive that leads up to the hotel, and there are several that will take you for €1.60 each way.  We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a bus, and there are several spots in the city center to catch a bus back to the hotel.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel, especially if you arrive late at night or have an early flight out the next morning.
",4,2007,01,09
250,"If you're flying away, this will be a good starting point!","Stayed here for one night (Christmas party).... Rooms were excellent. Have rarely had as nice a room. Clean, bright and cheerful, with all the amenities. The bathroom had both a bath and separate shower.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful. I think there's going to be a leisure centre built....the gym itself was sparse, with not very hi-tech equipment. Downside of the hotel is you have to pay for overnight parking (€7). Overall though, it is well worth the stay (We got the room at €110 per room)
",4,2006,12,21
250,Perfect !,"Stayed here for just one night on a Christmas Party night (9th December)

This is a very nice hotel indeed. We didn't really have the time to check out all the facilities with only staying overnight, but the hotel is tastefull decorated in a modern style, and all the staff were helpful & friendly. 
The Christmas Party night i have to say was a triumph, if a little ""crowded"".
Over 600 people packed into a very large room, and a five course meal ahead, I was a little sceptical, but I was totally surprised - the meal was absolutely spot on, and the band that was there to entertain did just that and more.
Bar prices were a little hefty, but hey it's a hotel so I wasn't surprised at that.
The following morning, Breakfast was gorgeous, buffet style, and then we checked out swiftly. We then got a lift to the airport on one of their regular free shuttle buses!

I would stay here again, without hesitation!
",5,2006,12,10
250,Outstanding!,"Wow! What a luxurious looking place. All the fixtures, fittings, design all have a very upmarket feel and style.

Room was a standard double. Spacious and with the most comfortable bed I have slept in for a hotel for a long time!

Food was very good, but needs to be served on hot plates. The detail stuff is what seperates the very good from the excellent. Check in was a breeze and so too it proved on check out this morning.

Check out the aquarium in the foyer and marvel at the black laquer finish / Asian feel to the place.

Make the €119 room rate all the more pleasing. No wireless internet, though there is an internet connection by cable in the rooms

250,superb but little pricey on dinner and breakfast,"Hotel superb layout superb rooms spotless staff very helpful, the only bad things for my wife and I it was our wedding aniversary so I decided to book the hotel as it looked superb and it was if you are doing alot of sight seeing taxis can be very pricey going backwards and forwards tho we did catches buses in the daytime from outside the hotel on the main road no problem the staff were very happy to help. I ordered a paper for sunday morning it never came I had to question why at reception and they told me the chap who picks up the papers did not have my particular paper. To be fair they offered me an alternative free of charge and sent an apology letter. The breakfast are pricey and i would recomend venturing into the city for breakfasts. The bar service was excellent. All in all a top hotel and if i was looking to stop in a class hotel in Dublin again this would def be my choice again so I will be there again next anniverary!!!! lol!!!!!!. Do it if its special occasion and you value servivce and to made feel special, and the beds are lovely and so are the bathrooms!!!!!. All spotless!!!!.

250,A bad nights sleep,"We stayed at the Dublin Airport Crowne Plaza during September. The hotel is nicely decorated and everything appears to work and the room was lovely. I have two criticisms:

1) There was a buzzing noise (like an air fan) outside our room that kept going all night - it was loud enough to give us a bad nights sleep and sour our opinion of the hotel. And no it wasn't the room air-con that was making the noise as we switched this off!

2) Then we were charged twice for our stay: I booked the stay through an accommodation website and understood that I was charged by them. When it came to checking out, the front desk asked for my card. When I told them that I'd booked through a general accommodation website, they told me that this merely reserved the room for me. I was happy enough with this explanation until I got my credit card bill and noticed I was charged twice, once by the website and once by the hotel. In fairness the hotel refunded me when I made them aware of the problem, but this was all unnecessary hassle for me.

250,Fantastic Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights in early April.  We had a wonderful room with a king bed, separate bath and shower.  It was gorgeous, quiet, clean and the staff throughout the hotel went above and beyond for us.  We ate ate both restaurants and the coffee bar, all were good.  The pub does get a bit crowded, so be patient with the service there.
Free airport shuttle was on time and comfortable.  All in all if we are in Dublin again we would stay there in a second.
",4,2006,08,31
250,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel at the end of our Ireland vacation, and were heading on to London, so we needed to be close to the airport. They have a free shuttle which is very convenient and about a 5 or 10 minute ride to the airport depending on traffic. It is a large hotel that seems to cater to business, hence all the modern perks such as 110 outlets as well as the standard European. That was great because I could charge up my cell phone, and both sets of my camera batteries before we left for London.( I had forgotten my adapter at home) The room has a mini bar, tea and coffee service, and complimentary bottles of both still and sparkling water. The bathrroms were large and had separate shower and tub. The beds were very comfortable. We had a light dinner in the bar and it was very good. Overrall it is a great hotel, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.
",5,2006,07,23
250,Great for Our Final Night in Dublin,"We also stayed here on our last night in Ireland.  There were six of us two adult and four children in two rooms.  It was a welcomed and comfortable evening after a 12 hour tour that ended with a four hour train ride.  The bathrooms were luxurious and the service excellent.  It would have been nice to have free internet access.  We ordered room service.  The food was deliverd promptly, presented well, but was not very good.  However, the nice accomodations outweighed the internet and food.  Good to be so close to the airport.  They provide a shuttle to the airport.
",5,2006,07,06
250,Great Airport Hotel,"As others have said, this is a very pretty and well-appointed hotel near the Dublin airport. We stayed there on our last night of an Irish vacation and were glad to have such a comfortable end to our trip. The room and bathroom had enough space and the bed was very comfortable. Service was efficient and friendly. It seems to be a little Americanized: It's one of the few European hotels I've seen that supplies wash cloths in the bathroom. 

The only negative part of the stay was that the coffee shop didn't open until 9 a.m.
",5,2006,06,04
250,Decent but remotely located,"Stayed twice within 2 weeks in early and mid-May for its close proximity to DUB. For that purpose, it is perfectly adequate and is fairly typical for a business hotel. Rooms and baths were well sized and the restaurant serves decent up-scale fare. If you want or need to go downtown, it's a half-hour bus ride through occaisionally heavy traffic. Staff is helpful and very courteous. The shuttle pickup at DUB can take awhile, so be patient. Recommend for the close proximity to DUB, but otherwise, there's little reason to choose to stay here.

250,Beautiful Hotel,"We booked this hotel because it was close to the airport and had a free shuttle.  We had no idea it was so swanky and new.  The service was excellent and the rooms were spotless and came with tons of perks.  One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at.  The food at the restaurants was unique and the dining area was beautiful.  It would have been nice if they had a few more affordable menu options.  Overall, I highly recommend this hotel if you need something convenient to the airport -- it's not close to the downtown sites.  Excellent!!
",5,2006,05,25
250,Excellent airport accomodations,"After traveling through Ireland, my 3 freinds and I needed a hotel close to the airport for the night right before our flight home.  The Crowne Plaza was an excellent choice.  I found a great rate on the internet (116 euro per room), and it was only about a mile to the airport.  They have a free shuttle, although we were in a rental car (and gas was available on the road to the airport).  The rooms were really clean and comfortable, and the staff was really friendly.  When we arrived, we still had time to go back into Dublin for shopping and dinner, and caught a bus for about $2 each way right to the city center and back, which only took about 20 minutes.
",5,2006,05,25
250,I left my camera in the room!!!!!!!,"We spent 1 night at this hotel, and as everyone else has said, it was a great place to spend our last night in Ireland.....proximity to the airport.
Checkin was fast, room was very nice....walked down the street  to the Chinese Restaurant...food was GREAT. 
   Took the van to the airport in the morning and just as we were about to exit the van, the driver received a call from the hotel asking if our party was in the van still? We said yes! when we heard the name....My digital camera had been left in the room (unknown to me!) and they already had reported it to management, who then had the van driver notified! In the short ride to the airport! They asked which airline we were flying and said that the other van driver would be right there and would bring my camera! <phew!> He was there very quickly and my camera and all my Irish pictures safely flew home to Boston with me!
   If you are looking for a hotel that is convenient, clean and has HONEST people working for them, this is the place to stay!

250,Great airport hotel for our family,"Very nice final nights in Ireland at the Crowne Plaza. Quiet location, tasty food in both restaurants, close to bus stop, very helpful conceiarge. We got a great rate (about $95/night) on Hotwire. Very friendly staff. We had the hotel van lead us to return our rental car, and then drive us back to the hotel. Super convenient.
",5,2006,04,07
250,For Families Too,"I won't repeat the other reviews. The style is male businessman, but I like it too. We go with our children, beginning when we had a two year old. They do not seem to mind when we show up with children, even though they were not booked. The website does not allow more than two people in a room, so I just put two adults since our children sleep with us anyway. We got upgraded once to a Club room, I think, although they didn't say anything. It was after a VERY bad start to our trip, so it was great. There is a room with the news on and newspapers and breakfast on Club floors. I was asked my room number but was not charged. I don't think children are supposed to be on that floor. The last time we went, the hotel was getting full and we were put in a handicap suite, which was even bigger. The girl at the desk figured we could use the room. I love the big bathrooms in this hotel. It feels good to have a nice shower and the bathtubs are good for the kids. It is quiet - no noise from the hall or airplanes and no early ""Housekeeping!"" knocking. There is a big aquarium in the lobby that keeps kids fascinated while the parents are checking in. There's a park with a path across the street to run off extra energy and get some fresh air, although I'll admit I haven't been in it.
",5,2006,04,03
250,Completely overrated,"To read some of the reviews here one would think one was about to enter an above par 4+ star hotel. In reality the Crowne Plaza is a nice, relatively new (but already depreciated)standard 4star'ish' hotel. My wife and I have had the pleasure of staying at the Crowne Plaza on anumber of times since it opened, most recently in Feb. 2006. 

The hotel is a short ride from the airport, we had to wait a full 25 minute for a pick-up - but it was mid-morning. Return shuttles are every 30 min and they sometimes wait to collect at the airport after having done a hotel-airport drop.

Check-in is always quick. As priorityclub elites we used to get upgrades to the 4th floor, in the last 16 months we have not. The 4th floor rooms are very nice - large with an excellent lounge.

Standards rooms (level 1-3) are much smaller, really small by US standards and compact compared to hilton dublin airport and great southern dublin airport. Walls are a really cold blue. Free water (x2) which is great. Bathrooms are excellent - almost too big for such a small room.

The big problem at the moment is construction along the west facing side of the hotel. They are building a large conference center/re and holiday inn express literally feet away from the current hotel. On the last visit my room overlooked construction 10 feet from my window. 

My other problem with this hotel is that, although it had a great start, service and room quality are going downhil fast. On my two visits in 2006 both my rooms had paint problems (ie the blue wall had been repaired and pained white in spots - not what one would expect from a high quality hotel).

On a Sunday night in feb. I waited 22 minutes to get served in the bar (and it was not crowded). I eventually gave up and walked up the road to the (overpriced) chinese restaurant that others have talked about.

Location, of course, is poor unless you are just over-nighting in advance of a flight. 20-30 minutes into town by bus. On our next visits requiring an airport hotel we will stay at the Hilton - also in the middle of no where, but cleaner better maintained rooms and easy access to a large Tesco shop for snacks.
",2,2006,03,04
250,Great Hotel,"Booked this hotel for one night for myself and my girlfriend who was returning from a year travelling abroad. Unfortunately her flight got in very late to DUB so we didn't get to sample any of the facilities.

Having said that it is easily the best hotel I've stayed at. The decor is very nice, very contempory. Overall appearance of the hotel is excellent. 

We were picked up from airport by courtesy bus which was very prompt in arriving. Quick and friendly check in. 

We stayed in room 440 (Standard King Room). Room was spotlessly clean and well presented (See pics). Mini bar was well stocked, good range of TV channels including movie channels (not free). Tea, Coffee and water facilities. Internet available in room. AC with controls. Bathrobes, slippers, room safe, etc.  

Bathroom was large with separate shower and bath. Pressure and temperature of shower was perfect. Again the bathroom was spotless, not a stray hair in sight. Towels were very large and fluffy! 

All in all not a bad thing to say about this hotel. My only regret was not being able to sample the bar or restaurant. I'd love to return for a weekend break at some stage.

250,Highly Recommended,"Stayed for one night before flying out from dublin airport the next morning.  Staff were very friendly, food fantastic and rooms were very modern and comfortable.

Would deliberatley fly out in the early morning again just to spend a night here!

250,first class airport hotel,"No-one expects too much from an airport hotel but the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport exceeded all of our expectations.

As a previous reviewer points out, it looks rather bland from the outside, but more than makes up for this indoors.

The staff are absolutely first class and among the best we've come across recently. We were given a smoking room despite asking for non smoking, but were swiftly moved even though the hotel was almost full.

The rooms are bright, clean, well equipped and very comfortable. Room service breakfast was very good - fresh and well presented. The staff helped us with car parking and made sure we were transferred promptly to the airport the following morning.

If only Dublin Airport itself was as efficient.....!

250,Best Dublin Airport Hotel,"This hotel is easily the best hotel near dublin airport... Ive stayed at the new Hilton but still prefer this hotel. On arrival i was upgraded to a club room which was large by european standards with modern neutral decor. Furishings were clean and everything looked fairly new (this hotel is only few years old). The bed was large with white eygptian cotton sheets for a cosy sleep. The bathroom was large with a seperate shower and bathtub. Amenities were good quality and plentiful, towels were over-sized. All in all a great hotel and for an $82 priceline bid its worth every penny! Only downside was executive lounge doesnt serve breakfast/evening drinks at weekends so not worth paying the upgrade fee 30euro if your offered it.

250,handy for the airport.,"we stayed in the crowne plaza dublin airport two years ago on our way to amsterdam, we needed to get an early flight but transport wouldnt of got us there in time so we decided to stay there as it was right beside the airport. we had a great time staff were really friendly and helpful. food was excellent and service was also excellent. we only stayed 1 night but it was a great start to a great holiday. also the free bus to the airport was very handy we made our flight with loads of time to spare. because we had such a good time before we our staying again in june this year.
",5,2006,01,30
250,Lovely Hotel,"My Friend and I stayed at this hotel for new years 05/06, lovely hotel set in a quiet location.

We found hotel lovely, really modern rooms and friendly staff, shuttle bus to and from the airport a phonecall away, you do not need to get a taxi into town there is a bustop just at the end of the road which will take you into o'connell street for 1euro 65, i dont think taxis were that dear, even after 12 the most we spend on  a taxi was about £11.00, which is pretty standard for a night out i think.

I highly reccommend this hotel and would defo visit again in the future.
",5,2006,01,07
250,"lovely, modern hotel","My fiance and I stayed at this hotel after reading the recommendations on the site. We caught a very early flight to London in the morning, and the airport shuttle proved to be very handy!
Great money for value...the room was modern, nice big bath-tub, comfy bed. All you could ask for! We ate in the bar, and the food was delicious, and the service was great too! Will be going back next time I fly out of Dublin.
",5,2006,01,06
250,Royal Treatment - Affordable Prices,"This hotel has received many (well-deserved) ""thumbs up"" from previous reviewers (indeed these were instrumental in our choice); I do not want to be repetetive - but did want to add some further details that might be helpful. My family and I were all delighted with our recent stay. 
Overall impression of the hotel: Restful and elegant. Color schemes were either ""cool"" or ""warm"" - pastels and deeper hues - with an Asian/Art Deco feel. Lighting is well done also!
Rooms: Even the ""standard"" rooms are large by European standards, with sizeable bathrooms, separate tub and shower, plush bathrobes and slippers, coffee/tea makers and snacks, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, hi-tech phones/internet access, and more. The ""twin"" beds were much larger than anticipated - and very comfortable.
The Club Level rooms have additional amenities, jaccuzzi jets in the bathtubs, and some bathrooms also have TVs! Suites have such features as a top-of-the-line massage chair, plasma TV, and living room/dining room area! A lavish Continental breakfast is served in the Club Lounge on weekdays; coffee, tea, fruit and beverages were available at other times. The lounge has fabulous views of the Santry park, a plasma TV, a wide selection of books on Irish culture and history, daily newspapers, rest rooms, and a computer/printer station. 
Cleanliness: The standards of cleanliness are impeccable (as a former hotel housekeeper from the ""white glove test"" era - I found nothing awry).
Internet: Internet is available through the TV system (did not try it), as well as other technology features which were ""over our heads"". PC Wireless access is available in public areas and each room has an ethernet broadband connection available on the telephone. There are power outlets for Irish/UK, US/Japanese, and European pin-style plugs in the rooms, so you do not have to pack a bag of bulky accessories! Internet fees are 7 euros/hour or 15 euros/day. For the wireless access you need to obtain an authorization number from the front desk.   
Food: We tried all 3 of the hotel restaurants and also had room service. Prices were reasonable; food was fresh, tasty and well-presented. The Breakfast buffet was lovely - both Continental and Full buffets are available. Full buffet was 21 euros/person and includes a great variety of hot and cold dishes. Consider a breakfast plan when reserving a room.
Service: The staff at this hotel were amazing - multi-cultural, multi-lingual, polished, professional and totally service-oriented! From our first encounter with the staff (phone call from the airport), we were treated exceptionally well. Transport from and to the airport was prompt and efficient (there is even a little shuttle from the parking lot to the hotel entrance - parking is free). When a problem with internet access in an assigned room was found, an upgrade to another room was promptly offered.  Every question and request that we had was responded to promptly. It was apparent that customer service is the focus of this establishment's culture - and it is truly appreciated.
Other: For those who do not drive, be reassured that public transportation is available nearby - numerous city bus lines will transport you downtown in about 20 minutes for a fee of 1.50 euros (exact change). 
The park across from the hotel is a lovely and peaceful place to take a stroll! The lush foliage along the walking paths gives the impression of being in the countryside...
At present there is construction in the area - a Holiday Inn Express is being built on one side, and luxury apartment buildings on the other - so views are not ""perfect"" from some rooms at the moment (the HI should be opening in a few months). Soundproof windows can be opened - but if closed you will not hear aircraft noise, etc.
Conclusions: If you are seeking a rustic, traditional, Irish cottage-type accommodation, or are mainly interested in the downtown nightclub scene - this hotel will not be your first choice. For countless others - this will prove the perfect haven - close enough to the airport and downtown, yet far enough away to provide some real rest and relaxation! I don't think you will find better accommodation in the Dublin area for the price.

250,Outstanding service and surprising luxury touches,"We arrived late on a flight from California and had planned in advance to stay close to the airport before moving in to the city the next day.

I called for the shuttle bus and it arrived within 5 minutes.  The reception was friendly and efficient and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite!  
This hotel is state of the art, with a built-in tv at one end of the bathtub, drop screen projection tv's in the bedroom and living room area. I was really surprised to find all of these luxury touches in a 
Crown Plaza.  

We went to the bar for our first pint of Guinness and there was a nice 'local' athmosphere, and again the staff were friendly.  We were too late to order food at the bar but it was available via room service.

The next morning we enjoyed the extensive breakfast buffet and again felt that the attentive staff were well trained.  I have stayed at all types of hotels, from Motel 6 to Four Seasons depending on the occassion and I know good service when I see it. The management here obviously instill their employees with enthusiasm for service, and it is delivered warmly and sincerely. Great Job Crowne Plaza!
",5,2005,10,07
250,hard to find but worth it when you get there,"We arrived at the hotel we got there about 3pm check in was at 2pm but the room stil wasnt ready, we waited another hour!

We finnaly got our room which i might add was lovely very modern, turquoise and brown and cream is the decor, a massive bed and a nice large painting on the wall.

Bathroom a good size and nicely decorated.

Good selection of room service compared to other hotels.

Nice coffe bar and resturant in the premises.

Only problem we made a quick 3 minute phone call to the North of Ireland and it cost us in total 17 euros, so that put a dampner on it!

Apart from that the overall clenliness of the hotel is above average and i would def go again.
",4,2005,09,11
250,Great Hotel,"I have recently stayed at Crowne Plaza – Dublin – although not much to look at from the outside – it’s the best around once inside.

The staff are friendly, rooms of high quality and if you book on line & get a deal – good value. Even better value if you are a Priority club member & get upgraded to a Club Room. This gives access to a private lounge with complimentary drinks, breakfast & canapés in addition to a much more comfortable room.

All the rooms are well appointed and well equipped.

The restaurants are good and the breakfasts superb.

Very modern and would definitely use again.

Little difficult to find by car – but worth it.",5,2005,08,12
250,"Very Nice, But...","Beautiful hotel right next to the airport. We booked two non smoking rooms. Room one was ready on our arrival 1400hrs but it smelled of cigarette smoke so they gave us another room. We were told that room two wasn't quite ready yet. Two hours later the room was finally ready. I called the front desk a couple of times to see what the problem was, they seemed annoyed on my second call after an hour and a half. At check out time I requested that the bill be ajusted since we had to wait two hours after check in time. The desk person said that there was nothing they could do rather abruptly and said that they might be able to take off a couple of the phone calls off the bill. All and all it was a nice place but their people skills need some work.  JV

250,Excellent!,"Wonderful.  Good value.  Best room after 10 days in Ireland.  Great staff.
Modern appointments - including US compatible outlets, broadband (for 15 euros), wonderful modern bathroom.  Staff was helpful.  Shuttle to and from airport.
",5,2005,07,13
250,"Lovely Hotel, Great Value..","Having checked out of the Jurys Inn Parnell Street due to noisy neighbours, it was a pleasure to stay at the Crowne Plaza Airport.

We were offered a great rate of 109 euros per night, and we were picked up at the Airport by the complimentary hotel shuttle bus.

The hotel is less than 10 minutes from the airport.  The complimentary hotel shuttle bus runs to the airport every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day.

The hotel is just over a year old, however looks brand new.  The rooms are very well appointed (mini bar, hairdryers, robes, tea/coffee, toiletries etc).

We departed for the airport at 5.30am, and the hotel had thoughtfully provided croissants and coffee (free of charge) for guests to snack on!

The staff are very friendly.  We did not eat at the hotel, however the Cinnabar is a great spot for a drink (and food).

I would definetly stay at the Crowne Plaza Airport, when returning to Dublin. Excellent hotel at excellent prices.

Less than a minutes walk from the hotel, there is also a lovely chinese/thai restaurant called ""Mandalay"".  Upmarket chinese/thai food - very delicious.  Try the deep friend scallops for entree!
",5,2005,05,23
250,"Unfortunately, too brief a visit","We just stayed at this hotel for one night in May, 2005 before we left very early the next morning for home.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, although I noticed that not all of the bathrooms are equal in all same priced rooms.  Ours was small, our friends was large with both a large shower and a tub.  The transfer service to the airport was excellent, as was our dinner the night before in the bar.  We used both the phone wake-up service and the wake-up service on the TV.  In addition a second call was made by the desk clerk to ensure that we did get our 3am wake-up call.

250,Wonderful Staff,"After first booking a room in the Temple Bar area in downtown Dublin at the Royal Dublin (awful place), The Crowe Plaza was such a refreshing delight. The staf was friendly and helpful. The resturant was lovely with wonderful food. The room, was comfortable and spotless....with a large lovely bathroom. The complimentary cookies and water left in the room was a delighful treat after a day of sight seeing. I would say in the quiet, super clean haven again and again. It was wonderful/
",5,2005,05,16
250,"Spot-on, well-above average Airport Hotel","This hotel looks so new and clean, it could have been opened last week! It is well situated, 10 mins from the airport by courtesy bus (please remember to tell reception when you check-in that you would like a return transfer to the airport - the bus only has 10 seats and at peak times if you aren't booked, you won't get on), in a lovely setting.

Check-in staff attentive, rooms were superb, Restaurant Food was excellent. Bar snacks were a bit fancy for my liking. If you are staying for a few days and fancy a change of food, there is a nice-looking Chinese restaurant 2 minutes down the road.

I used to stay in the other 2 airport hotels and was disappointed every single time I stayed there - expensive, noisy, food not up to scratch.

The Crowne Plaze Dublin Airport is a breath of fresh air and a must-stay for all transit passengers!",5,2005,04,26
250,Top Class Airport Hotel,"My wife and I stayed in the Crowne Plaza Hotel last weekend as part of a small group. Upon check-in we were upgraded to an executive room. The room was lovely and the shower was fantastic. We had lunch in the bar and, later that night, had a few drinks. The food was nice and the only slight problem was that the service in the bar was quite slow. 

Having been in the other hotels at Dublin Airport, the Crowne Plaza raises the bar a little bit as, apart from being a really good hotel in it's own right, the fact that it is a few minutes from the airport (by courtesy coach that you call from the Arrivals Hall), means that there is no aircraft noise. It is in it's own grounds so there is no traffic noise either.
",5,2005,04,11
250,good hotel but......,"The facilities in this hotel were quite nice and the service was attentive but not outstanding.  The service to and from the airport is exceptional and the parking is free.  I like to spend the night after a transatlanic flight near the airport to give me a day to get over jet lag.  The hotel is located very close to the airport but you do not feel close and ther is a lovely park across the street to take walks in.  A few quirks...
---We made our reservation through travelocity and the hotel assigned us a room that did not fit our party.  We ended up having to take a smoking room.
---The concierge was also a bell boy.  I think I am spoiled by concierges who make reservations, etc.  
---The food at the restaurant is excellent but the service is spotty.
---They missed making a wake-up call and were deeply apolgetic about this. 

I cannot put my finger on the break down in service though the staff was friendly and attentive.
",4,2005,03,28
250,Crowne Plaza Airport Dublin: just weird,"Three things made this seem like an uncomfortable experience.

1. Our phone didn't work, and the desk advised us to try the pay phone in lobby, which I did twice just to get along. Finally, after three calls to the front desk and some emphasis on our part, they sent someone to try to fix the phone. It seemed like they thought we didn't know how to make outside calls, but the phone was really broken.

2.  I was traveling with my daughter and her friend, both 17.  They tried to go into the ""bar"" area, thinking it was more of the ""snack bar"" area - they saw families inside eating, and I was planning on joining them in a few minutes for a bite to eat.  They were told they couldn't go in the bar because they weren't 18 --- but there were younger children already in the bar.  Hotel explained it was policy and time of day, but it did frustrate the girls.

3.  The restaurant had absolutely delicious, stunning food, but the service made us all uncomfortable.  The server was attending to our table and one right behind us, so we could hear the other table getting plenty of attention. After taking our order, the server never stopped by our table again. I had to ask a busboy for the bill at least 30 minutes after we had finished eating, and I never got that glass of wine I started wishing for in the middle of the meal.

On the bright side, the food was absolutely delicious, and the people at the front desk were very helpful with advice on where to go and what to do.  The hotel iteself was very nicely decorated.  We just didn't feel very welcome.",2,2005,01,15
250,Great hotel with free parking,"When using Dublin Airport we usually stay at the Great Southern Hotel which is really nice but aircraft noise begins at 6.30 am each and every morning.
This time we tried the Crowne Plaza and were very impressed.  Got a good rate on the net, modern large room with no airport noise and with free parking for a week.  Most impressed.
",5,2005,01,03
250,A Must Stay!,"My husband and I were extremely impressed with this hotel and the staff.  From the time they promptly arrived at the airport to pick us up free of charge, to walking into this stunning Hotel and the amazing rooms.  They even made arrangements for our car rental to be waiting for us the next morning.  Extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was perfect and the bed was very comfortable.    We didn't want to leave.  This made part of the charm of Ireland an experience we will never forget!
",5,2004,11,28
250,first class,"I stayed here on business in October 2004 and was very impressed by everything in this hotel. The rooms were comfortable with modern decor and the bathroom with large walk in shower was excellent after a busy day. The food is great and a wide choice is available. All staff were helpful and nothing was too much trouble. A first class hotel 10 minutes from Dublin airport with regular courtesy coach.
",5,2004,11,05
250,Brilliant!,"I was thoroughly amazed when the porters who had picked us up from the airport pulled up in landscaped gardens outside a modern building and told us that this was the Crowne Plaza. 
The reception and entire building is decorated in a modern, almost Japenese theme and is very clean and finished to a high standard.
The room was enormous and everything you could possibly want was to hand. 
Not only were the rooms much more than expected but the hotel restaurant was way up there with the best of them - I heartily recommend that you give it a go rather than trying to find somewhere in the vicinity. The waiting staff were attentive and polite, the wine list was above average and the food was delicious, well presented and not expensive. 
I cannot think of one thing which let the hotel down (except that we had only booked one night!), it was even far enough away from the airport (about ten minutes drive in a shuttle bus supplied by the hotel) for you not to hear the planes.
Five Stars - Well done!

250,great stay at the crowne plaza,"I am just back from a weekend trip to dublin and stayed at the crowne plaza. I have never stayed in a better hotel. The rooms were stunning, the staff very helpful and couldnt do enough and the food delicious. I will definately be back in the near future.

250,GREAT AIRPORT HOTEL,"Located 10 minutes drive from Dublin Airport - hotel courtesy coach runs 24 hours to/from airport - Crowne Plaza (part of the Holiday Inn chain) is located in a delightful park setting, providing a calm, quiet location so close to the airport. The staff are extremely professional, and welcoming, showing great attention to ensuring that you feel a special guest. In my case, I have to especially thank the Crowne Plaza Courtesy Coach driver (Ron O'Sullivan) who went the extra mile to find my laptop bag, which I had somehow left behind in the airport carpark. My stress was eased considerably by the efficient and concerned way in which he dealt with this situation. The hotel room was extremely well equipped, spacious, and decorated in a modern style. I paid a very reasonable advance booking flat rate of 120 euros (approx $145), and for this I had a large (for European standards) air conditioned room with 2 comfortable queen sized beds for myself, partner & child (a double king sized bed for 2 adults only at same rate); a lovely designed bathroom with seperate power shower & bath; internet access via tv for hourly charge; films on demand; standard drinks bar (sensors beneath drinks, so do not lift drinks for curiosity's sake, otherwise it will show on your bill); room service food was quick, and okay, but not brilliant. If you have been disappointed by the standard of ****hotel accommodation at this price level in Europe, then this hotel will reassuringly meet your expectations. Although primarily directed at Business users, this is a great hotel to stay in if your having to stop over for one night in between flights. 24 hour coffee in reception also a plus whilst waiting to depart for airport..

Dies war jedoch nicht mehr verfügbar, so dass wir ein Zimmer mit 2 Einzelbetten bekamen. Die Betten waren vom Schlafkomfort her gut.

Das Zimmer war jedoch stark abgewohnt (siehe Fotos) und die Toilettenbrille war dreckig, was man sofort beim Hochklappen des Deckels sah. Es wurde dann zwar nachgereinigt aber ich finde, so etwas geht bei einem 4* Haus gar nicht...

Le camere sono spaziose, silenziose e ben fornite anche se la struttura accusa un po' gli anni. Nella media per il rapporto qualità prezzo anche se leggermente sotto media per lo standard Crowne che ho trovato in altre strutture.
La lounge IHG dovrebbe essere migliorata sia in termini di capienza, sia in termini di offerta (colazione e pre cena abbastanza scarsi).
Personale sempre estremamente cordiale e disponibile.",3,2017,12,10
250,Top Service,"👍
Saubere und angenehmes Zimmer. Sehr gutes Essen und einen Top Service, besten Dank an Lionel für die Top Bedienung.

250,Schönes Hotel mit Einschränkung,"Sehr angenehme Lage visavis Park. Kompetenter, freundlicher Empfang. Schön eingerichtete, elegante Zimmer mit prima Bett. Die Bar und das Restaurant sind von Einrichtung, Service, Essen und Trinken ausgezeichnet. Das Zimmer auf keinen Fall neben dem Gym nehmen, weil ab 6 Uhr früh das Schlafen wegen des Lärms unmöglich ist. Das Badezimmer war behindertengerecht, aber leider sehr altmodisch, unattraktiv und teilweise defekt.",3,2017,11,13
250,"Perfetta soluzione per visitare Dublino, in 30' comodamente in autobus sei nel cuore di Dublino,in 10' sei in aereoporto","Il nostro viaggio è stato itinerante per l'Irlanda. Gli ultimi 3 giorni siamo stati a Dublino. L'hotel si trova in un quartiere residenziale appositamente realizzato a servizio dell'aeroporto. Con la navetta gratuita arrivi in aeroporto in 10'. A pochi passi dall'albergo c'è la fermata dell'autobus che ti porta direttamente nel cuore del quartiere Temple Bar. Le camere sono comode e pulite, il personale è gentile e premuroso. Olga, persona meravigliosa che ci ha accolti al nostro arrivo alla reception è stata la perla dell'hotel facendoci sentire sempre clienti speciali!!! Siamo stati benissimo",5,2017,09,14
250,"Top Lage, guter Service - außer abends","Hotel ist ideal zwischen Airport und angrenzendem Business-Park gelegen und man kann selbst spät abends noch den kostenlosen Shuttlebus vom Airport aus nehmen. Empfang & Service sind wirklich gut und freundlich. Die Zimmer sind großzügig gestaltet, am Schreibtisch findet man sogar europäische (Schuko-)Steckdosen neben den in Irland und GB üblichen, so da man seine Geräte auch ohne Adapter laden kann. WiFi ist ausreichend schnell. Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr umfangreich und bietet alles, was das Herz begehrt: verschiedene Sorten Cerials, Süßes und Herzhaftes.

Einziges Manko: Wenn man abends nach 21:00 Uhr anreist, gibt es nur noch über den Zimmerservice was zu essen - was natürlich deutlich mehr kostet. Und zudem sitzt man dann im Zimmer statt im schönen Pub, das noch aufhat, aber nur Bier und Drinks serviert, aber kein Essen.",4,2017,08,31
250,Sehr gutes Airport Hotel ,"Gut eingerichtete und saubere Zimmer.

250,Bellissimo hotel ,"Ultima notte, necessitavamo di una sistemazione comoda vicino all'aeroporto. Ottima la connessione wifi, la pulizia, letti comodi, personale gentile. Lo consiglio, nonostante la poca distanza dall'aeroporto non c'erano rumori di voli che disturbavano il riposo ",5,2017,07,20

250,"Una muy buena opción, pero lejos del centro. La ""quiet area"" es simplemente excelente.","El Crowne Plaza es un gran hotel. Habitaciones amplias, modernas y bien decoradas. La limpieza buena. La cama espectacularmente cómoda. Yo estuve en una zona llamada ""quiet area"", que aseguraba que nadie molesta desde las 9 de la noche hasta las 10 de la mañana. Ni se imaginan lo que se agradece eso, frente a otros hoteles donde el personal está molestando desde las 7 de la mañana. El único inconveniente es que no está cerca del centro. El autobús, que pasa a unos 200 metros del hotel, tarda de 20 a 30 minutos en llegar (cuesta 2,70 euros cada trayecto), y los taxis no os especialmente baratos. El personal muy atento. Por lo demás, una zona muy tranquila con un parque precioso en la puerta. La WIFI, gratuita, funciona francamente bien.",4,2017,06,26

La poca amabilidad del personal de bar.

Pura tranquilidad perfecto para reuniones de trabajo. En autobús a 30 min de Dublin (45-60 en hora punta). El bus en la puerta (33, 16, 41 y 41c) cuesta 2,70€ el trayecto.

Zum Hotel gehört auch ein kostenloser Shuttle zum Flughafen.

250,Perfetto,Un albergo fantastico vicino all aeroporto di dublino. Utilissimo per chi arriva con voli tardivi perché ha una navetta gratis che va fino alle 23:15 della notte.

250,"OTTIMO, VICINO ALL' AREOPORTO","Molto comodo in caso di atterraggi tardivi. Abbiamo fatto il chek-in all' una di notte molto velocemente grazie agli ottimi servizi che la struttura offre. Abbiamo inoltre usufruito del deposito bagagli gratuito fini al tardo pomeriggio quando siamo ripartiti.
Camera pulita e molto confortevole. La prima colazione da perdersi nella scelta.
Peccato non sia garantita la navetta aeroportuale dopo le 23,30.
Consigliatissimo per chi atterra a Dublino a tarda sera e deve proseguire il viaggio il giorno dopo.",5,2016,08,09
250,Alle porte di Dublino,"Immerso nel verde, a due passi dall'aeroporto, servitissimo per il centro città. 
Elegante, pulito, accogliente. Consigliato per brevi permanenze, forse un po' caro per i servizi che offre pur essendo un quattro stelle. 
Ottimi il ristorante e il servizio navetta gratuito per l'aeroporto.",4,2016,03,29
250,Passabel...,"Wir waren hier nur eine Nacht, daher könnte auch bei anderen Besuchen auch etwas besser sein.
Das Hotel ist etwas außerhalb des Stadtzentrums. Wir haben das Auto im eigenen Parkhaus gelassen (keine Ahnung ob das 6€ kostet - uns wurde nichts berechnet) und dann mit dem Bus (die Haltestelle ist ca. 5 Min Fußmarsch entfernt) in die Stadt gefahren. Es sind 4 Buslinien, die in die Stadt für 2,70€ (nicht wie im Hotel gesagt 2,80€) fahren: 16, 41, 41C, 33 zu O Connell Street. Die Hotelhaltestelle heißt ""Northwood Plaza"".
Das Servicepersonal war bei Check-Ins und Check-out sehr freundlich. Allerdings wurde wir nicht darauf hingewiesen, dass an diesem Tag im eigenen Hall eine private Party stattfindet und da wir das Zimmer über diesem Hall hatten, war es bis 1 Uhr in die Nacht sehr laut. Zudem befinden sich Raucher und Nicht-Raucher Zimmer auf der gleichen Etage. im Zimmer gegenüber wurde geraucht und wir konnten es auch riechen...

Das Frühstück typisch britisch.

Im Badezimmer müssen die Duschbrausen vom Kalk befreit und eventuell ausgetauscht werden.",3,2016,02,13
250,Correcto y bien comunicado,"Teníamos una habitación kingsize, era correcta para 4 estrellas, ni muy lujosa ni poco, cómoda y de tamaño esperado, además de los servicios habituales de baño y cortesía. Por todo ésto, es correcto, aunque sube de categoría por un gran desayuno, por tener bus lanzadera gratuito aeropuerto-hotel, puerta a puerta cada 30 minutos, y porque al quejarnos del ruido de un aire acondicionado, no solamente nos cambiaron de habitación, como esperábamos, sino que nos pusieron en una de mayor categoría, ofrecierondose a trasladar nuestras pertenencias y invitandonos a una bebida en su bar. Su punto flaco es que se tardan unos 25 minutos de bus hasta el centro.",4,2016,01,03
250,DUBLINO NEL VERDE,"Hotel situato molto vicino all'aeroporto con il quale e' collegato con un comodo bus shuttle gratuito. Stanze belle e comode i servizi sono all'altezza di uno standard internazionale. Immerso in un meraviglioso parco godibilissimo per chi vuole anche passeggiare o fare attività fisica.
Non è molto comodo per raggiungere ad O' connel street comunque collegata con delle linee di bus la cui fermata è a 100 metri dall'Hotel.
Se decidete per il taxi la corsa vi costerà circa 20 euro dipende dal traffico che è notevole intorno alle 18/19.Buono anche il ristorante.",4,2015,12,29

El hotel se encuentra justo al frente de un hermoso parque.",4,2015,12,11

Tiene todas las facilidades de un hotel de lujo las habitaciones son grandes y muy bien decorada, la cama muy confortable y lo mas importante es que esta muy tranquilo aun si el aeropuerto se encuentra a solo 15 minutos del hotel. El hotel se encuentra a tan solo 15 minutos o menos del centro de Dublín en autobús. El servicio es muy amigable y servicial, la comida del restaurante es muy buena algo cara pero muy buena vale la pena cenar allí.
Podéis estar seguros que volveré a Dublín y me quedaré en el Crown Plaza.
Zimplemente me a encantado el hotel.",5,2015,11,23
250,Typisches Crowne Plaza,Unweit des Flughafens Dublin empfängt einen das nette Rezeptionspersonal. Die Zimmer sind gepflegt. Einige Restaurantmöglichkeiten bestehen im Hotel. Mit dem Bus dauert die Fahrt in die Stadt da. 30 Minuten. Am Wochenende ist die dazugehörige Disco im Hotel etwas lauter und auch das ein oder andere Flugzeug ,4,2015,10,27
250,Gutes Hotel,"Kürzlich verbrachten wir eine Nacht im Clown Plaza, weil wir am nächsten Morgen einen frühen Flug gebucht hatten. Der Service und das Essen war gut. Das Hotel liegt sehr nahe am Flughafen und ist doch ruhig. Für sechs Euro kann man den Wagen 24 Stunden im Parkhaus einstellen. Der Weg zu den Mietwagen Firmen am Flughafen ist leicht zu finden und die Fahrt dauert höchstens zehn Minuten.",4,2015,09,30
250,Gutes Airport Hotel,"Auch wenn es in seinem Setting nicht wie ein typisches Airport Hotel daher kommt, es ist in unmittelbarer Nähe. 10 Minuten mit dem kostenfreien Shuttlebus, obwohl der Weg zum Bus länger dauerte. € 11 mit dem Taxi zum Retour Flug. Das Hotel ist modern, sauber, mit guter Ausstattung.  Selbst die Standardzimmer groß genug, besonders das King Size Bed welches mir aber zu weich war. Der Einstieg zur Dusche geht für etwas größer gebaute Menschen nur seitwärts und selbst dann ist es knapp. Das Frühstück ist gut, ich esse gerne mal das Full Irish, das war wirklich sehr gut. Aber auch diejenigen die mit einem Continental etwas gesünder in den Tag starten wollen hatten eine gute Auswahl. Rauchen kann man in diesem Hotel nur draußen, im Stehen. Abends hat die Hotelbar eine gute Atmosphäre, live Sport im TV, leckeres Essen und gute Drinks zu Preisen über die man nicht meckern kann. Das Hoteleigene Restaurant hatte ich nicht probiert, mir war es nach Pub Food. 

Fazit, zum Erkunden von Dublin vielleicht nicht geeignet da man immer mit dem Taxi zurück muss, aber für Geschäftsreisen ein empfehlenswertes Hotel in dem man alles hat was man braucht.",4,2015,09,27
250,Piccola delusione,"Albergo di livello in posizione ottima per 1 notte dopo un volo con arrivo in tarda serata. Purtroppo tante piccole sbavature hanno reso il giudizio non confacente al livello della catena crown Plaza e delle 4 stelle. Nella camera abbiamo trovato un King e un lettino , anziché i 2 queen richiesti ( siamo in 4 , 2 adulti e due bambini) la doccia non scaricava bene l'acqua, abbiamo pagato 6 euro per parcheggiare in un parcheggio in mezzo a nulla. Personale gentile. Pulizia nella norma ",3,2015,08,18
250,Sehr freundlicher Service in allen Bereichen! Tolle Schlafqualität,"+ sehr freundlicher Check-in
+ bequemes Bett
+ grosses Bett
+ complimentary Toiletries sind vielfältig und zahlreich vorhanden
+ Lounge im Executive Bereich ist gemütlich und hat immer kalte Drinks und Essen gratis, das Personal dort ist ebenfalls freundlich und flott am aufräumen 

- keine Klobürste
- Klimaanlage liess sich nicht abschalten
- das Frühstück ist nicht so toll für ein Interkonti-Hotel. Weder Auswahl noch Qualität (zu viel Dosenobst statt frisches, Croissants waren nicht kross sondern weich und feucht)

Ich muss aber auch beim Frühstück sagen, dass die Kellner alle freundlich waren und der Oberkellner aktiv auf die Gäste zuging und Spezialwünsche erfüllen liess ( zB Spiegeleier)
Keiner war genervt oder angepisst das hatte ich bisher selten auf anderen Kontinenten in dieser Art von Hotel. Sehr Lobenswert!!
Darum gibt's trotz den Abstrichen beim Essen ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",4,2015,08,06

Als in der letzten Nacht im gesamten 2. Stock eine Party gefeiert wurde und zahlreiche schon mehr als betrunkene Gäste lautstark am Gang gröhlten und an Zimmertüren klopften, war die Rezeption trotz mehrerer Anrufe nicht in der Lage, dies abzustellen. Ich konnte daher in der letzten Nacht erst ab 5 Uhr früh (!) schlafen - und um 7 Uhr musste ich aufstehen und zum Airport! Zimmer ok, sehr kleines Badezimmer, Frühstücksbüffet ""very british"", insgesamt aber enttäuschend.",2,2015,04,05
250,molto molto accogliente!,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo per il capodanno 2015 e devo dire che ne sono soddisfatta...un ""molto buono"" solo per la distanza dal centro e per l'assenza di qualcuno che parli almeno un pochino l'italiano visto il posto turistico, ma per il resto merita un'eccellenza!
La distanza dal centro (circa 10-15 min con bus)è comunque risolvibile con la vicinanza alle fermate dei bus 33 41 41b e c (a 2 minuti esatti)che ti permettono di arrivare a O' connell street, cuore della città! lo stesso per il ritorno..attenzione che la fermata per ritornare in albergo è ad Abbey street :D!(lo dico perche noi abbiamo avuto difficoltà per ritornare la prima sera!) munitevi di taaante monete perche i bus non accettano banconote!
Per quanto riguarda invece la sistemazione in camera..beh...regna la pulizia!! Molto accogliente... profuma di nuovo! le camere molto comode...noi avevamo una doppia con 2 letti singoli moolto comodi!! Il bagno aveva sia doccia che vasca ed uno specchio immenso *.*!!
In camera era presente un kit per il thè caldo, caffè e 2 biscotti che rifornivano ogni mattina...in più una bottiglietta d'acqua!
Il personale tutto molto gentile e cordiale..
per quanto riguarda la colazione io la consiglio vivamente... è presente sia quella continentale sia quella irish e, come poche volte accade all'estero, ho potuto fare colazione con latte e caffè in quanto era accettabile :D
Comoda anche la navetta da e per l aereoporto ogni 20 minuti dalle 5 a mezzanotte..
come struttura è consigliabile soprattutto per chi come me, dopo un'intera giornata da turista, non vede l'ora di rientrare in una calda comoda e accogliente stanza d'albergo!",4,2015,01,15
250,Excelente hotel en dublin,"Nos encanto este hotel en Dublin Irlanda. Queda un poco lejos del centro de la ciudad pero vale la pena, contratamos un pase de tres días de trasporte público, hop on y off, y del aeropuerto , que el mismo hotel tiene trasporte gratuito. El desayuno es super delicioso. Estuvimos el día de la final del mundial de fútbol y en el bar nos atendieron de maravilla y la comida deliciosa.
La atención el la recepción fue maravillosa y  todo nuestros pedimentos nos ayudaron.
La parada del bus estaba a 100 m caminado , muy cerca. 
Para nosotros fue mejor que llegar al centro de Dublin,",5,2014,09,27
250,Genial hotel de negocios!,"Muy buen hotel de negocios cerca del aeropuerto. 

Me aloje en la planta 4 club. La habitación disponía de mesa de trabajo con silla muy cómoda, que permitía trabajar cómodamente.

Lo único malo el bar...la comida es mala y cara en comparación con otros hoteles de este estilo. ",5,2014,07,20
250,Alles OK dort ...,"Ich war dort in der letzten Woche für 2 Nächte. Das Hotel liegt gut zum Flughafen, was bei frühem Abflug ja sehr praktisch sein kann. Und es gibt einen kostenlosen Shuttle-Bus vom/zum Flughafen, auch recht angenehm. In der Stadt ist man per Taxi binnen 10 Minuten und für unter 15 €

Für englisch/irische Verhältnisse ist das Hotel wirklich OK, ganz nette Zimmer, ein großzügiger Lobby- und Bar-Bereich, sehr freundlicher Service überall. Zum frühstück kann man sich in der Cafebar der Lobby Scones und Kaffee bestellen, was ich getan habe, und das war sehr lecker und ordentlich. das Büffet habe ich nicht ausprobiert.

Also, alles in Ordnung da und ein sehr gutes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis, ich habe für ein Zimmer etwas über 100€ bezahlt. Das Hotel ist übrigens derzeit auch das Crew-Hotel der Lufthansa, was ja auch einen guten Standard sicherstellen sollte.",4,2014,07,17
250,"Molto bello, funzionale e comodo","Hotel situato vicino all'aeroporto con il quale e' collegato con un comodo bus shuttle. Stanze molto belle e funzionali ed apprezzabilissimi servizi come il quotidiano in camera. Ho avuto un problema con il condizionamento e si sono adoperati subito per risolverlo. Buono anche il ristorante. Lo consiglio per chi, come me, si deve recare a Dublino per lavoro.",4,2014,07,09
250,Guter Einstieg für die Irlandrundreise,"Ein schönes und sauberes Hotel mit nettem Personal an der Rezeption. Umrahmt wird das Hotel von einem großen Park, der zu Spaziergängen einlädt. Das Abendessen war sehr gut - zwei Gerichte zur Auswahl mit Vor- und Nachspeise. Zur Nachspeise sevierte man uns noch wahlweise Kaffee oder Tee. 
Etwas merkwürdig fand ich, dass die Getränkebestellung zwar mit einer Rechnung kam, die man auf das Zimmer schreiben konnte. Jedoch wurde ich dann gegen 22:45 Uhr auf dem Zimmer besucht und darauf hingewiesen, dass ich die Rechnung nun bezahlen müsse, es wäre kein Kredit für das Zimmer eingeräumt. 

Für Besuche in der Innenstad von Dublin stehen mehrere Buslinien zur Verfügung (Kosten: einfach 2,60 Euro in bar und abgezählt)",4,2014,06,23
250,Opinion sobre el Cinnabar,"La verdad es que  no estabamos alojados en este Hotel. Nos alojabamos en el Holiday Inn, que está justo al lado. La opinión y la experiencia es solo sobre el Cinnabar, donde cenamos. La calificación del local es de 3 puntos, por no conocer otros aspectos del hotel, pero la clasificación del Cinnabar es horrible, por lo siguiente. Una de las elecciones fue un Tika Masala (es pollo con salsa de tomate y algo más) Estaba tan picante que ni mi mujer ni yo, pudimos con ello. Unas pocas cucharadas y parecia que teniamos un agujero en el estomago. Se lo indicamos a la camarera y lo lamentó. Lo suyo hubiera sido que nos trajeran algo alternativo o que no cobraran este plato, pero ni una cosa ni otra.",3,2014,05,23
250,Hotel bellissimo e funzionale,"Hotel bellissimo e funzionale a pochi minuti dall'aeroporto a cui è collegato con una navetta gratuita disponibile a tutte le ore.
Ben collegato anche dagli autobus di linea (2.50 euro) con il Centro Città.
Difficile trovargli difetti. Se trovate un'offerta vantaggiosa prenotatelo senza indugio è una bellissima base di partenza per un week end indimenticabile.

250,Tolles Hotel und tolles Personal,"Das Hotel liegt zwar nicht direkt in der Stadtmitte aber dank vieler Buslinien ist man superschnell überall wo man hin möchte.
Der Service ist einfach nur top. Das Essen sehr sehr gut und vor allem wird man schnell und zuvorkommend bedient.
In der Lobby und Bar war immer was los.
Das Internet war gratis und hat super funktioniert. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern und gepflegt.",4,2014,01,06
250,La qualità vale il prezzo,"Per il soggiorno a Dublino avevo scelto il Buswells perchè amo le atmosfere ovattate edoardiane, gli arredi antichi. Poichè il mio volo di ritorno partiva molto presto al mattino, l'ultima sera ho deciso di trasferirmi al Crowne plaza, che in modo chiaro offre GRATIS (altri hotel non lo specificano, e poi risulta essere a pagamento) il servizio di transfer ai terminal dell'aeroporto, 1 e 2( io partivo dal terminal 1 - la fermata del minibus era vicinissima) che è stato eccellente.
L'hotel merita le 4 stelle: il letto king size, il bagno, il confort...mi ha dovuto far ricredere sull'efficienza dell'american style. Di più..ho cenato nell'ottimo restaurant ad un buon rapporto qualità prezzo come tutto il resto. Una buona soluzione per quando si debba partire presto o per quando si arrivi tardi.",4,2013,09,12
250,Hotel tranquillissimo,"Ho soggiornato una settimana in questo albergo per motivi di lavoro. Ho utilizzato anche le sale conferenze, peraltro molto grandi e c'è tutto un complesso di salette per piccole riunioni, tutte molto comode e attrezzate. Ottime le stanze: pulite e comode; quello che si vede sul loro sito è reale. Ho fatto colazione, pranzo e cena quindi posso dire di aver assaggiato di tutto: colazione ricca, pranzo e cena sempre buoni (almeno secondo il mio gusto), certo non c'è la varietà che c'è in Italia però la carne era favolosa ed il pane da inzuppare nelle salse molto buono. Personale tutto molto cortese, alla reception ci hanno dato anche gli euro spicci per poter prendere l'autobus per il centro e 25 minuti per arrivarci passano in fretta, non è il caso di lamentarsi. La vicinanza con l'aeroporto non la si nota, non so perché ma gli aerei non si sentono.
Rilassante il bel parco tutto verde davanti all'hotel; cè una strada davanti all'hotel ma le auto sono rare.
Ottimo il servizio navetta con l'aeroporto.
Quindi è un hotel da consigliare certamente ad occhi chiusi.",4,2013,08,23
250,Upgrade zum Nulltarif,"Wurden vom Holiday Inn Express ""upgegratet"" das ganze für unter 80 Euro, da kann man nicht meckern. Sauberes Hotel mit sehr guten Frühstück. Erfolg auf der ganzen Linie.

250,Empfehlenswertes Business Hotel,"Für Geschäftsreisen optimales Hotel,nahe am Flughafen, trotzdem nicht laut, dazu kostenloser Airport Shuttle. Zimmer schön und komfortabel,kostenloses WLAN ist eine nette draufgabe. Mehrere Restaurants bzw. Bars, dazu ein kleines Gym. Top.

Für Sightseeing durch Lage aussserhalb aber weniger geeignet.",4,2013,06,18
250,Angenehm überrascht von einem Airport Hotel,"Ich war sehr angenehm überrascht von diesem Hotel. Es liegt im Prinzip sehr nah am Flughafen. Durch die Baustellen am Flughafen, dauert die Hinfahrt zum Hotel länger als die Fahrt vom Hotel zum Flughafen.

Die Zimmer waren sehr schön eingerichtet, sauber und relativ groß. Betten sehr gut. Fenster lassen sich öffnen, so dass man auch mal frische Luft reinlassen kann. Was ich sehr an Hotels schätze, in den meisten lassen sich die Fenster ja nicht öffnen. 

Zimmer sind gut gedämmt und man hört so gut wie nichts von den Nachbarzimmern oder von draußen (bei geschlossenem Fenster).

Bad ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Groß, mit separater großer Dusche. Vergrößerungsspiegel und schön hell. 

Das Personal an der Rezeption ist sehr freundlich und flott. 

Die anderen Einrichtungen des Hotels kann ich leider nicht beurteilen, da wir nur über Nacht dort waren und früh wieder abgereist sind. 

Habe mich rundherum wohl dort gefühlt.

Wlan war auch kostenlos. Und es gab einen Hosenbügeler auf dem Zimmer.",5,2013,05,20
250,Top Preis Leistung,"War drei Tage geschäftlich in diesem Hotel. Das Hotel befindet sich zwischen dem Flughafen und Dublin. Wir wurden gratis vom Shuttlebus abgeholt. Das Einchecken ging schnell. Das Empfangspersonal ist sehr freundlich. Das Zimmer ist gross und sauber. Das Bad bietet Badwanne und Dusche an. Das Morgenessen bietet sehr viel an: von Rühreier, zu Speck, zu Würstchen, gebratene Tomaten, frisches Brot, Aufschnitt, Früchte, Säfte, Croissant und was das Herz begehrt. Der Konferenzsaal Red Wood war riesig und schön. Es wurde Kaffee und Kuchen serviert. Das Mittagessen war hervorragend. Es gab Asiatisches und Urländisches Guinnes Voressen. Einfach wunderbar! In die Stadt braucht man rund 10 Min. Darum ist das Hotel super gelegen. Der Preis ist für ein 4 Stern Hotel sehr gut. Habe 125€ pro Nacht bezahlt. Habe schon anderes erlebt. Konnte nach meinen Aufenthalt sehr schnell aushecken.
Kann dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen. Ob für ein Businessanlass oder wenn man Dublin besucht und man gleichzeitig etwas ruhe will!",5,2013,02,10
250,Un albergo tranquillo,"Situato all'interno del parco di Northwood, a poca distanza dall'Aeroporto di Dublino, l'Hotel Crowne Plaza offre un soggiono ideale per chi si reca a Dublino per lavoro. Belle camere, spaziose, pulite, dista circa 30 min. dal centro. Buona la prima colazione, non altrettanto buono il ristorante che presenta una varietà di piatti molto speziati e assai sofisticati. Ottimo l'Irish Pub situato all'interno dell'albergo, ove si possono degustare una notevole varietà di birre nazionali ed estere. All'interno del locale, inoltre, si esibiscono bravi artisti con musiche dal vivo. I prezzi sono ragionevoli.",4,2012,11,05
250,Una breve vacanza,"Weekend lungo a Dublino, il Crowne Plaza si presenta subito bene perchè viene ad accoglierti in aeroporto con la sua navetta gratuita. L'hotel è immerso nel verde del parco di Northwood, comodo, elegante ma sobrio, con un ottimo ristorante dove si possono fare colazione e cena, e un bar classicamente irlandese, con tanti monitor che danno in diretta le partite del campionato di rugby e fiumi di Guinnes disponibili per gli avventori. E' possibile cenare con buoni piatti della cucina internazionale. Dall'albergo si raggiunge una comoda fermata d'autobus che ci porta fino in centro. I mezzi pubblici sono disponibili fino a tarda sera, al costo di 2,15 € per corsa.",5,2012,10,07
250,Imperdibile king size bed..,"Situato a pochi chilometri dall'aeroporto, questo hotel sempre affollato offre tutti i servizi di cui un cliente ha bisogno per un ottimo soggiorno.
Non è vicino al centro (mezz'ora di autobus anche se non ci si accorge nemmeno del viaggio) ma è sicuramente un'ottima base per chi come noi aveva l'aereo di ritorno all'alba.

Stanze spaziose e molto confortevoli, ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.
Imperdibile il King size bed, praticamente un letto a 4 piazze dove perdervi nel mondo dei sogni...Mai visto un letto così grande!
Dotato di parcheggio multipiano convenzionato (6 €/giorno) è comodo se arrivate in macchina e avete il problema di parcheggiarla..

Consigliatissimo!",5,2012,09,06
250,Perfetto,"Ottima posizione in un parco bellissimo con laghetto e cigni a due passi dalla fermata dei tram per il centro (fino alla via principale O'Connell Street circa 30min). Stanza molto bella, funzionale, grande, ben arredata con bagno nuovissimo e molto pulito. Il ristorante offre cibo di qualita' , di ispirazione orientale. Colazione internazionale con possibilita' di caffe' espresso. Wi-fi gratuito.Fortemente consigliato.",5,2012,08,06
250,Gutes Hotel in Flughafennähe,"Das Zimmer war sehr groß und das Badezimmer nahezu riesig, mit Dusche und Badewanne. Beides war modern und zweckmäßig eingerichtet und vom Flughafen in der Nähe haben wir nichts mitbekommen, außer den kostenlosen Shuttle-Bus. Die Hotelangestellten arbeiten sehr effizient und sind immer freundlich. Leider finden in der Lobby bzw. den Restaurants öfter sehr laute Veranstaltungen statt, welche man zu Glück im Zimmer nicht hört.
Das Hotel liegt weit außerhalb der Innenstadt, aber in der Nähe des Hotels befindet sich eine Haltestelle und man benötigt etwa 30 min bis zum Zentrum.",4,2012,05,27
250,"precioso, en las afueras, cuidado y lujoso","Para tener coche para mi gusto fué la mejor opción en DUblin, retirado del centro pero acogedor, limpio, grande, moderno, decorado con gusto. Las habitaciones de las mejores en las que estuve, una King Size a un precio realmente económico. Con su propio pub muy bueno dentro. El baño nuevo, limpio, con plato gigante de ducha y tb con bañera, muy bien decorado. Al igual que las habitaciones, con mucho gusto tanto el mobiliario como la cama.LImpieza y agradable, personal atento, pedí una ruta para hacer en coche, y a los diez minutos mandaron un botones a la habitación a llevarme indicaciones y plano. Lo recomendaria sin duda, alejado del centro pero con coche, la mejor opción",5,2012,05,07
250,"Como hotel es excelente, ubicacion no centrica","Muy buen hotel, moderno, limpio, habitaciones espaciosas, de muy buen gusto, decoracion agradable, wifi en todas las habitaciones, el unico punto en contra es q no es nada centrico, aunq en bus (numero 39, 39a y 37) se accede economicamente al centro de la ciudad.",5,2012,03,04
250,Ideales Hotel auf dem Weg vom und zum Flughafen Dublin,"Positiv überrascht hat uns die Lage, die an der Schnittstelle eines Gewerbe- und Wohngebiets  zu ausgedehnten Grünzonen lag. Zimmer und Servicebereiche waren angenehm und in gehobenem Standard, das Bad ein kleinwenig abgewohnt. Die Mitarbeiter von ausgesuchter Freundlichkeit, die über professionelle Normen hinaus ging.",4,2012,01,21
250,Hotel nähe Flughafen,Sehr gutes Hotel nähe Flughafen. Shuttle Bus vom Flughafen zum Hotel kostenlos. Zimmer sehr gut eingerichtet. Frühstück hervorragend. Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Sehr gute Tagungsräume. Betten in den Zimmern hervoragend. Bei geöffnetem Fenster natürlich durch Flughafennähe Fluglärm. Klimaanlage ist vorhanden.,4,2011,12,09
250,Zwischen Stadt und Flughafen gelegen,"Das Crowne Plaza Dublin Northwood ist ein schönes und stylisches 4 Sterne Geschäftshotel, das ich gut empfehlen kann. Das Personal des Hotels ist sehr kompetent und man spricht am der Rezeption sogar sehr gut deutsch. Die Zimmer sind sehr gut ausgestattet und das Bad groß, incl Badewanne und extra Dusche. Die Betten waren groß und wirklich bequem. Man kommt gut mit dem Bus in die Stadt. Zum Flughafen sind es ca. 10 Minuten mit dem Taxi oder Hotelshuttle.",4,2011,09,24
250,Eccellente!,"La mia esperienza in questo hotel è stata ottima, sia dal punto di vista della camera, spaziosa e dotata di tutti i comfort, sia per quanto riguarda la colazione a buffet, per la vastità e ampiezza della scelta, tanto da poter fare praticamente un pranzo. Non molto comodi invece i collegamenti dei bus, dall'hotel   al centro di Dublino: ci sono tre linee di bus, con una frequenza di passaggio ogni mezz'ora circa ( ma il week-end sono più rari) e la durata del tragitto per arrivare a Dublino è di circa mezz'ora.",5,2011,09,01
250,Per noi ottimo,"Possiamo solo dire: Per noi ottimo!!! Atterrando all'aeroporto di Dublino alle 23,35 ora locale (per noi italiani le 00,35!) ,avendo tra le mani un'auto a noleggio appena ritirata e doversi abituare alla guida a sinistra , la presenza di questo Hotel a 4 km. dall'aeroporto è stata davvero fondamentale, quindi consigliabile in analoghe situazioni. Albergo davvero splendido ed ineccepibile, colazione ""continental"" o ""irish"" a scelta, a buffet, ottima!
Peccato che il centro di Dublino sia a 20 minuti circa con i normali mezzi pubblici. Lo consiglierei come punto di passaggio per la location prossima all'aeroporto.",4,2011,08,21
250,Spitzenhotel das seinem Preis gerecht wird,"Das Crown Plaza liegt ca. 10 Minuten vom Airport entfernt und wird mit einem kostenlosen Shuttlebus bedient. Checkin verlief schnell und freundlich. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig, sauber und es sind auch kontinentaleuropäische Steckdosen vorhanden. Gäste haben im kompletten Hotel gratis Wifi sowie inkludiertes Frühstückbuffett. Besonders der Service, ob Taxi, eine Flasche Wein aufs Zimmer oder der Gepäckträger, das Personal liest dem Gast die Wünsche von den Lippen ab und mitunter ein Grund, dieses Haus weiterzuempfehlen!",5,2011,07,01
250,Ruhige Lage und Top Qualtität,"Vor und nach einer Irlandrundreise haben wir im Crown Plaza Northwood übernachtet und sind von der Qualtiät des Hotels beeindruckt. Wir waren zuerst etwas skeptisch, da das Hotel doch außerhalb von Dublin liegt. Aber eine vor dem Haus befindliche Bushaltestelle bringt einen unkompliziert direkt in die Stadtmitte und auch wieder zurück. Es ist durchaus von Vorteil in einer ruhigen sehr schönen Gartenanlage zu übernachten, als Mitten im hektischen Dublin. Die Zimmer angenehm durch die Größe, Service und Schlafqualität sehr gut und auch das Restaurant konnte uns überzeugen. Nicht zuletzt gibt es einen direkten Shuttledienst vom Hotel zum Flughafen.",5,2011,06,14
250,Kein schlechtes Upgrade,"Gebucht hatten wir das direkt nebenan gelegene Hoilday Inn Express, bekommen haben wir das Crowne Plaza. Empfang freundlich und effizient, Zimmer sauber, freundlich und mit allem Nötigen ausgestattet. Pub im Haus, Frühstück sehr umfangreich auch mit ""Full Irish"" und höflichem Service. Shuttle zum Flughafen inklusiv, könnte aber gerne häufiger fahren, zum Teil nur alle Stunde. Taxi kostet ab 15 € aufwärts zum Flughafen. Bushaltestelle fußläufig Richtung Innenstadt und Flughafen, derzeit in die Stadt 1,85 € (nur passend zahlen!) pro Strecke. 
Insgesamt gerade bei später Ankunft oder frühem Abflug gute Wahl, und dank Upgrade zu einem unschlagbaren Preis für die gebotene Leistung.",4,2011,03,23
250,mehr Schein als Sein,"Der ursprünglich gute Eindruck wurde durch einiges getrübt. Nordseite gestörter Schlaf durch Airport Lärm, Speisen einfallslos und sich ständig wiederholend.  Getränkeservice während der Tagung befriedigend und ausreichend. Die vorhandenen Geräte wie Overhead etc. konnten mühelos gentzt werden. 
Bar ständig lauender TV mit englishem Football. Der Wunsch, auf leider-stellen wurde ignoriert und/oder verständnislos abgelehnt. Umfeld des Hotels wenig ansprechend. Shutlebus zum Airport gut.",3,2011,01,27
250,"Gut ausgestattetes Hotel, aber leider etwas außerhalb gelegen ...","Ich habe ein paar Tage in diesem Hotel verbracht, als ich geschäftlich in Dublin war.

Positiv: 
- sehr neu und modern eingerichtet
- kostenloser Shuttle-Bus vom Flughafen
- nette Bar / Restaurant im Hotel

Negativ: 
- weit von der Stadt entfernt. Jedoch gibt es in der Nähe eine Bushaltestelle, von der es eine direkte Verbindung in die Stadt gibt (ca. 30 Minuten!)",4,2011,01,09
250,hotel fantastico,"vicino all'aeroporto, a venti minuti di bus dal centro, questo hotel merita più di 4 stelle. Stanze ampie e comode, wi-fi gratis e personale gentile... tutto per 70-80 euro. Assolutamente ideale.",5,2010,10,30
250,Immer wieder gern genommen,"Das Crowne Plaza in Dublin-Northwood ist ein ausgezeichnetes Businesshotel mit allem was der Geschäftsreisende benötigt. Die Schlafqualität ist erstklassig, die Zimmer sind ruhig, alle Businessvorteile (kostenloses Internet mit Kabel im Zimmer und W-Lan in übrigen Bereichen) sind vorhanden. Es gibt einen Businesscenter, Meetingrooms, eine erstklassige Bar mit ebenso erstklassigem Essen. Ein Gymnastikraum wartet auf Sportbegeisterte. Auch das Frühstück ist kaum zu übertreffen. Dazu kommt noch der kostenlose Airport Shuttle Service alle 30 Minuten ab 05:00 Uhr. Entfernung zum Flughafen ca. 15 Minuten.  Nur ein hauseigenes Schwimmbad fehlt noch...
Ich übernachte in diesem Hotel schon seit ca. 10 Jahren und es ist in all der Zeit keinen Deut schlechter geworden und hat in allen Belangen nicht nachgelassen.",5,2010,10,17
250,sehr ruhig gelegen,"Ich habe hier eine Nacht vor dem Heimflug verbracht, der Flughafenshuttle-Bus ist kostenlos und die Fahrt dauert kaum 10 Minuten. Das Hotel liegt am angrenzenden Park (Santry Demesne) wo man sich gut die Beine vertreten und frische Luft schnuppern kann. Reception gut besetzt, schnelles Check-in und freundlich. Das Zimmer geräumig und modern eingerichtet, Arbeitsbereich funktionell. Das Pub bietet leckeres Essen und lädt zum Verweilen ein, die anderen Restaurationsbetriebe (Café, Asiatisches Restaurant) habe ich nicht besucht. Hotel fällt weder speziell auf noch ab.",4,2010,10,12
250,Ottimo hotel,"Struttura favolosa, spazi puliti e  arredamento ricercato. 
La posizione è un pò scomoda. La struttura si trova infatti fuori Dublino, ma la città è raggiungibile mediante l'autobus la cui fermata si colloca a cinque minuti dall'hotel. 
Davanti ad esso si estende un grande parco verde, tipico in Irlanda! 
Il parcheggio è una delle note dolenti. Si trova a pochi metri dal Crowne ma... è a pagamento. 6 euro circa al giorno. 
Lo staff è molto cortese, anche se non si destreggia molto bene con l'italiano. 
La colazione è abbondante e di eccellente qualità. 
Nella struttura è presente una stanza dedicata all'attività sportiva con parecchi attrezzi (tapis roulant, cyclette, etc.) .
Consigliato ASSOLUTAMENTE.",5,2010,08,31
250,Ottimo,"Ho pernottato in questo hotel una sola notta, prima di partire il giorno dopo per un tour irlandese. L'ho trovato ottimo per la pulizia delle camere, il servizio e la cortesia dello staff, ma soprattutto è comodissimo per/dall'aeroporto, in quanto è vicino (un paio di km) e offre un servizio gratuito di navetta che lo raggiunge in 5'  (l'ultima corsa da è alle 0,15, il che permette di utilizzarla per chi arriva con il volo Aer Lingus in arrivo alle 23,35). Inoltre è anche economico (ho pagato 63 euro per una camera tripla, senza colazione).",4,2010,08,27
250,Businesshotel mit Flughafennähe,"Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb von Dublin, sehr nah am Flughafen, sehr ruhig; ideal zum Zurückziehen. Zimmer sehr gut und sehr modern ausgestattet, allerdings wenig geräumig. Bad sehr großzügig ausgestattet. Service insgesamt sehr gut. Frühstück etwas eintönig; Club Lounge am Wochende nicht mit Frühstück, aber sonst großzügig ausgestattet.",4,2010,08,02
250,Super Hotel zu super Preis,"Dieses Hotel kann ich wirklich nur empfehlen! Für 35 EUR pro Nacht (gebucht auf booking.com) schläft es sich wunderbar! Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig und wirklich sauber. Das Badezimmer enthielt Badewanne und Dusche alles sehr sauber und gut funktionierend! 
Das Personal ist äußerst zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit!
Das Frühstück ist zwar im oben angeführten Preis nicht inbegriffen, aber man kann in der Früh noch zwischen 3 verschiedenen wählen (9,13 und 18 EUR). Der Courtesy Bus ist kostenlos und fährt alle 15 Minuten vom Flughafen zum Hotel und auch umgekehrt. 
3 Gehminuten ist eine Bushaltestelle von der aus man mit dem 16A eine Direktverbindung zum Zentrum von Dublin hat. 
Auch die Hotelbar ist sehr empfehlenswert. Das Ambiente im gesamten Hotel ist sehr elegant und anspruchsvoll! 
Dieses Hotel ist wirklich sehr empfehlenswert!",5,2010,07,27
250,Gutes Hotel in der Nähe des Flughafens mit Shuttleservice,"Dieses Hotel hatte ich im Rahmen einer Prämiennacht als Priority Club Mitglied gebucht. Das Hotel verfügt über einen Shuttleservice, den ich allerdings nur für den Transfer vom Hotel zum Flughafen am nächsten Morgen genutzt habe. Der Shuttle scheint sehr oft zu fahren, da direkt nebenan ein Holiday Inn Express (gleiche Hotelkette wie Crowne Plaza) zu finden ist und ein Parkhaus, in dem man recht günstig parken kann. Die Fahrtzeit beträgt etwa 10 Minuten. Check-In und Check-Out verliefen reibunsglos und zügig. Das Zimmer war sehr gut eingerichtet mit einem sehr großen Doppelbett, Flatscreen-TV und insgesamt sehr geräumig. Alles war absolut sauber. Das Frühstück habe ich nicht in Anspruch genommen. Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen, gerade als Ausgangspunkt zum Flughafen, aber auch als Ausgangspunkt, um Dublin zu erkunden, da das Hotel an einem sehr schönen Park gelegen ist.",5,2010,07,20
250,Sehr gutes Business Hotel,"Wenn die Nähe des Flughafens gebraucht wird, ist das Crowne Plaza optimal. Es gibt einen 15 minütigen kostenlosen Shuttle service. Alle Businessrelevanten Annehmlichkeiten sind vorhanden. Internet gibts per Kabel gratis auf dem Zimmer. Diese sind geräumig und sehr gut ausgestattet. 
Rundum - für Geschäftsreisende alles da!
In's Dubliner Zentrum sind es allerdings 30 Minuten mit dem Auto.",4,2010,07,15
250,wunderbares hotel,"ein wunderbares hotel am stadtrand von dublin, ideal in flughafennähe gelegen, man kann mit dem shuttlebus direkt vom flughafen hierher fahren und kostenlos auch parken, wenn man mit dem eigenen auto anreist.

das restaurant ist sehr gut, auch das reichhaltige frühstücksbuffet ist perfekt, viele gesunde und exzellent zubereitete speisen

das personal ist äußerst freundlich und berät bei den gästefragen

der zimmerservise passt zum guten ambiente, perfekte betten",5,2010,06,17
