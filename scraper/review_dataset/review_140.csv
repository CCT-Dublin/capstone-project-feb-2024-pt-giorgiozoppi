140,Fantastic Stay!,"I had a fantastic stay! The room was brand new, with modern, practical amenities and beautiful décor. The staff were incredibly friendly and made us feel very welcome. I especially loved the daily turndown service and the thoughtful welcome fruit. Highly recommend for a comfortable and enjoyable stay!",5,2024,10,17
140,Well kept and worth a stay!,"Since the Great Eagle Holdings in Hong Kong has taken over the brand of Langam, it has since expanded its brand by renaming its properties around the world under the names of Langham and Cordis. But to me the original Langham in London has always been the one and only Langham Hotel. 

Having stayed in quite a number of “antique” hotels, I have to say The Langham hotel is really one of the most well kept properties that I have ever stayed. That said, owing the structure’s limitation, some facilities like the lift or the swimming pool might need to be retrofitted in a way that might not be as user friendly. In one of the days that I stayed in this hotel, all four lifts in the wing that I resided were out of service.  Fortunately upon check out, all the lifts have resumed their service, or else I might need to drag my luggage to another wing where lifts are still operational.
 
Speaking about well kept, you have to admire its effort in keeping the property like its grand opening in the late nineteenth century. What’s more admirable was that despite the legal requirement to keep the building as is, it has successfully installed double glazed windows which minimised the road noise coming from the vibrant shopping area,  and hence during my entire stay, I was able to sleep through the night without any trouble. Also I’m very impressed by the presentation of the room, which is oozing vibes of British classic homes in the late nineteenth century without being too Victorian. In particular I was surprised that a room with around 500-600 square feet can manage to accommodate both the living and sleeping area without feeling too cramped.

The bathroom is also well kept.  Having stayed in a few Park Hyatt hotels in Australia, you kind of think that their bathrooms were all “inspired” by this hotel’s bathroom design, but on closer look you would appreciate the luxury elements of this bathroom are actually more subtle than the Park Hyatt, whether it’s the choice of marble floors or the use of bathroom doors. For bathroom amenities, they have chosen diptyque, which is increasingly popular among luxury hotel chains. I have to say that it’s soothing to use and lightly fragrant, but is quite similar to other French brands like Balmain that was used by hotels like Sofitel, the lather of which was sometimes difficult for me to be thoroughly cleansed. 

Breakfast is served at two places.  You can choose  the semi buffet package at the Palm Court. This is also the place where one of the most fable afternoon tea is served, and like its lobby or the rooms, the Palm Court is oozing British elegance.  The buffet area provided a wide range of choices like fruits, premium cheese and cold cut. Coupled with your choice of a la carte breakfast, this is a very sumptuous way to start you day.  Mind you I found the sausage or the bacon to be a bit salty for me, and I can’t help but thinking whether this is actually a very British thing because it is not the first time I have tasted bacons that are way too crsipy and salty. That said, you can also choose to have breakfast at the Club Lounge. Although it has less choices in its a la carte menu, I think the breakfast is as good as the one served at the Palm Court. But maybe that was because the chef was from Hong Kong, which suits my taste buds more. 

Speaking of afternoon tea, no stay in this hotel would be complete without trying its fabled tea set.  While I dare not say this hotel has actually “invented” the afternoon tea, it definitely has a long history of serving high tea for the privileged group. Their finger sandwiches can be refilled, and I have to say these are some of the best finger sandwiches that I have ever tasted for years. That said, for the dessert department, you might have noticed that Britain’s afternoon tea dessert has evolved over the centuries, and this time Langham tried to reimagine the traditional British desserts into one bite versions like Creme de le Creme, Chocolate Fudge and Butter Pudding. Be prepared that it will defy your impression the British desserts are just monotonous, as I am very impressed by the taste of all the sweet items in this afternoon tea set. 

For the scone, I think it is up to standard, but what impressed me the most was the apricot and strawberry jam. Last but not least, don’t miss the cheese scone of this set, as it was tasty without being too heavy in taste. For tea, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the Jing brand this time. This Earl Grey tea is very fragrant and helped me cleanse my palette. 

The set has also included champagne but as a non-drinker, I have only ordered non-alcohol Rose which is not bad.

For dinner, it was predictable but not impressive. The leek and potato soup resembled the taste of mashed potatoes, albeit in liquid style, which I think is very tasty, while for the grilled lamb rack, while it’s beautifully grilled, I think the rack lacks lamb flavour. Fortunately the fries are very delicious and complements the taste of the lamb well. But the one that impressed me the most was the floating island dessert, the egg white was very fluffy and the caramel taste well balanced.  Overall, this is a decent meal but having tried the food at Intercontinental O2, I have to say it really needs to up its ante to justify its price.

As for its fitness facilities, as mentioned earlier, due to the structure’s limitation, it is located on the underground floors of the building. In particular, the swimming pool seemed to be situated under the railroad where you can occasionally hear trains passed by. However, you have to give credit to the Langham for managing to provide a decent gym and pool, especially for the gym, as they are well equipped with most of the strength training machines and treadmill available.

Overall, my stay in Langham is a very good experience. Although you wouldn’t expect the room rate to be cheap for this kind of hotels, my stay package included one complimentary night’s stay which is already a bargain. Plus given its location, food quality and facilities as well as the quality of the building, I think the price fully justifies its brand and service. That said, having stayed in London for more than a month now, I have realised that if you want to have a taste of British classic luxury stay, there are actually quite a number of boutique hotels that matches with Langham’s classic vibes, at a similar if not less expensive price. So it all depends on your willingness to explore or stick with the old guns.",5,2023,09,25
140,The best service and sleep experience in London!,"This is a 5-star hotel and it maintains that level with quality of room and facilities, with staff and with amenities.  It could be one of the cleanest and most attractive rooms we have ever stayed in.  Plus the room was QUIET, probably due to the solid construction of this grand hotel.  The reception staff and concierge team were extremely helpful.  All of the staff in the restaurants and bar are extremely well-trained and housekeeping  was excellent.  Can't say enough about the Langham!",5,2024,10,16
140,Fabulous stay,Another great stay from start to finish. Beds super comfy. Location great and staff charming as ever,5,2024,10,14
140,Next level,"If I could give 6 stars I would. I have never said that before, but The Langham London is that good. Well actually it is the staff who elevate the property to that level. They are genuinely caring and interested in helping or serving you.",5,2024,10,11
140,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location of London,"It’s a beautiful hotel in a great location.  I’d give it a 4.5 and not a 5.  The rooms are gorgeous.  The service is top notch. My only room complaint is that they put a governor on the air conditioning so that it limits the temperature.  I like to sleep in a cool room so it was a bit hot for me.  I suggest they set the temperature a couple of degrees lower for guests like me.  

The breakfast is well done with a nice assortment of fresh fruit, juices, egg dishes and other options.  Service is a bit slow though and probably should open earlier than 7am during the week.  Our last day was a Monday and we were waiting online at 650am with 8 to 10 other guests.  We were all a bit annoyed with the hours and the wait.  

Overall the hotel is fantastic and special.  Shout out to the concierge as well.  Very helpful with restaurants and tours.  Definitely a place I’d stay again and again!",4,2024,10,10
140,Memorable stay in the heart of London,"Extraordinary place, a truly gorgeous property in the heart of London. 
Location was convenient in every way. 
The building is grand, bright and beautifully furnished.
Wonderful bar, excellent restaurants. Stunning pool with spa and gym. Loved the kind and enthusiastic welcome at the spa. 
My room was on the small side but it had every comfort expected in a 5 star hotel.
The breakfast was outstanding in every way.
Thank you for a lovely stay in London.",5,2024,10,08
140,Very disappointing stay. The F&B was good though.,"This is one of the cheaper luxury hotels in London especially given its location. However, it is not hard to see why. 

I stayed for 2D1N in late September in a Superior Room. 

The Bad:

- The front desk staff who I dealt with was polite enough but oddly po-faced. The porters were not as proactive as the other London hotel I stayed at on the same trip. 

- I was informed that the room was soundproof. However I could hear people talking in the corridor. I could also hear movement on the floor above. I ended up using earplugs to sleep. 

- The mattress was so old one side was sunken. This I really did not expect from a purportedly five star hotel. 

The Good:

- The breakfast was impressive and included a continental buffet with a very decent selection. There was a good choice of hot mains from the breakfast menu as well. 

- The service at the F&B outlets were significantly better than the hotel staff. Cocktails at the Artesian were pretty impressive. 

- The location is decent.",3,2024,10,07
140,Expensive but you get what you pay for…,"This is probably that most expensive hotel I have ever stayed. My wife and I came to London to specifically see the theatre, a lifelong dream. We decided to live it up a little after so many years of work.  The hotel is truly old fashioned style and outstanding service that we all wish for in a hotel. From the front door to your bathtub it is high quality without being excessive. That’s a hard thing to do. Evidently the locals think so too, as we saw lots of black ties around in the evenings. Proximal to the Tube, theatre, parks, and shopping. No wonder …if.you choose to afford it, you probably wont regret it.! ",5,2024,10,04
140,Fantastic as always,"Awesome hotel... kind, helpful staff, great rooms , great location ..  You cant go wrong here - also the Langham club is fantastic ",5,2024,10,04
140,Perfect stay in London!,"My solo adventure in the UK started in London, and the Langham was perfect spot. I walked endlessly but could always pop in a taxi or take one of the 2 Underground lines to get within blocks of the hotel. And the breakfast, it was amazing every morning. Wonderful staff, I felt so welcomed. ",5,2024,10,02
140,An excellent hotel that's well-located in London with wonderful staff,"We had no issues. The hotel was in excellent condition, and it was very comfortable. The staff was, likewise, excellent. We look forward to staying at the hotel again!",5,2024,10,01
140,Excellent 5 Star Experience!,"The room was beautiful and had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable, too.  Every member of staff delivered above and beyond service!  We felt like VIPs!  This is a great location, just three blocks from Oxford Circus station for the Underground.  I would highly recommend and can't wait to return for another visit!",5,2024,09,30
140,A Wonderful Step Back In Time With All The Amenities Of Today,"Treat yourself to bliss and stay at The Langham.  Brilliant service, stunning rooms, excellent food and drink, majestic surroundings.",5,2024,09,29
140,Exquisite... the best hotel I have ever stayed at...,"The best hotel in London, I have to say the staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for you... Door men to breakfast staff - they remembered my name; the lobster omelette was to die for... THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING :)",5,2024,09,28
140,"The Langham, London review","Excellent service. We had the executive room with included breakfast and drinks and food in the Langham Club Lounge. I wholeheartedly recommend that, worth every penny!",5,2024,09,24
140,Strongly discourage staying at the Langham London,"As a pediatrician and mother, I strongly discourage staying at The Langham London. The staff improperly stored my breast milk during my stay, causing me to lose days worth of breast milk to bring home to my infant daughter. Although these mistakes can happen, the staff did not demonstrate accountability for the mishap and minimized the situation. ",1,2024,09,24
140,"Luxurious, Beautiful Hotel!","The Langham, London, is without a doubt one of the most fabulous hotels I have ever stayed in.  We were warmly greeted and ushered into the hotel, bags secured, and were able to check in early as we had requested after an overnight flight.  The room was not only beautiful but had every amenity, very comfortable beds, and lovely bathroom.  The breakfast was wonderful and had every thing you could want on the buffet, plus the choice to order off the menu as well.  The after dinner desserts were delicious and creative.  Cabs were readily available or easily summoned at the curb.  London is a huge and widespread city;  we used cabs quite a bit although several tube stations were an easy walk.  A definite luxury and a treat, I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning.",5,2024,09,23
140,Another amazing stay,"You cannot beat the service at The Langham. Ty again for creating more memories for my wife and I, as well as our friends who stayed for the first time. They gave you an 11 out of 10.",5,2024,09,21
140,Langham hotel London,"My favorite hotel in London , we always stay at Langham . Good location , breakfast is overpriced , service is declining .",4,2024,09,21
140,Great Trip,"We were greeted by the friendliest staff, Zabrina checked us in and we were told that our room was being upgraded due to us celebrating our birthdays and anniversary. The room was amazing and incredibly clean. We were then brought a bottle of champagne. We ordered room service for breakfast and it was beautifully setup for us. Would absolutely recommend and will be back! ",5,2024,09,18

140,The Perfect 60th Birthday Stay,"We have been staying at The Langahm for many years and for us the hotel standards continue to surpass every time we stay.
We had a Junior Club Suite and it was perfect in every way. The presentation and just little details made our stay just so special.
We ate in The Club Lounge everyday and both the staff and food and excelled.
The Langham has always and will remain our most favourite of all hotels",5,2024,09,17
140,Our best hotel experience yet!,"Could not fault The Langham London.  Every touch point from the moment you enter the hotel, the room through to the departure is perfect. Super impressed! ",5,2024,09,16
140,Wonderful and attentive staff,"Wonderful experience. Staff paid attention to my young daughter by bringing her a child size bathrobe and teddy bear, stocked milk daily. She noticed at another hotel when there was none of that. Pool only open certain hours for kids which I get if traveling for business but be aware of the restrictions.",5,2024,09,12
140,Disappointed,I’ve booked a Room and it was very small comparing with the other rooms from the same category and when I asked the to change it for me as I’m regular client to the hotel they have bigger room but in the first floor and there was constructions work directly under my room. And then they change it again to other small room and the constructions work still can heard but I had no other choice. ,3,2024,09,10
140,"Elegant , charming and beautiful","The most amazing stay

Thank you everyone xx",5,2024,09,08
140,"Beautiful rooms, comfy beds, excellent service.","We stayed for three nights as an escape from the London hustle and bustle. 
Had a beautiful superior double room, bed was so comfy we didn’t want to get out. Beautiful bathroom and all facilities you needed. I requested ice and extra water due to a medical condition for the evenings and they delivered it at 2000 on the dot each night. Excellent service from the door men and the spa receptionist. The only thing the spa is missing is a jacuzzi.",5,2024,09,08
140,An Elegant Refuge,We spent 5 nights at The Langham and were thoroughly delighted. Classy and elegant with an incredible staff that took care of us at every turn. It starts with the team out front greeting us upon our arrival and carried on with everybody we encountered until we departed. The room was great and the dining we experienced was all great.,5,2024,09,04
140,Luxurious Experience in Marylebone,"The entire experience was a joy to behold. From check-in where the Doorman loaned us £10 upon arrival, to accommodations upstairs,  every bit of the experience was excellent. We opted to take advantage of the Langham Lounge, Artesian, Palm Court, and Wigmore for eats/drinks and the fitness/pool areas during our stay. Location was great for access to tube (Oxford) and rail (Euston & Kings Cross) as well as for running (Regents & Hyde Parks). 

Staff and Service exceeded expectations throughout the stay (4-days). Excellent and Well Done! We look forward to the opportunity to stay here again!",5,2024,09,04
140,Did it wow me - read on!,"I am a long time Langham brand devotee with many Langham and Cordis stays all around the world over the past 15 years but never at the Langham London. As it is the most iconic hotel in the portfolio it was a no brainer to choose the hotel for a 6-night London visit.

The hotel is genuinely 5 star. Well-kept spacious rooms (I was upgraded one category from an executive club room to a junior suite) but more about that later, convenient location about 8 minutes easy level walk from Oxford Circus tube station, spotlessly clean, beautiful furniture, giant plush towels and super comfortable beds, proper turn down service that you don't have to request it just happens. In summary - I felt pampered and the service was seamless.

I always book a room with Club Lounge access as they are reliably very special in their hotels in other parts of the world based on personal experience, and this one is apparently the best in London according to reviews and my research of 5-star hotels in London.

Club Lounge staff were wonderful (it is a fully staffed Club Lounge). One of the staff (Luis) went above and beyond, sourcing a jar of Vegemite (Aussies will know what this spread is) and then purchasing it on his day off. The assistant manager of the lounge (Adel) was also charming and helpful. The Club Lounge breakfast is spectacular, a-la-carte and buffet style including caviar - yes please!

Light refreshments from 2 to 4 pm are wraps, cakes, scones, salty snacks etc but we were out and about most days so cannot comment much about that offering. Evening light refreshments are served from 5 to 8 pm and this is where the food is their weak point. Unlike every other Langham Club this one served no hot food whatsoever during the evening buffet, just cold cuts, cheese, bread, sweet pastries, cookies and lots of salad. 

The range of alcohol on offer (cocktails, wine, beer, soft drink, spirits) is expansive but the food variety/rotation not so. They can also make you a real coffee so big tick there. The food in the evening is also not reliably replenished, once something popular is gone on a busy weekend I noticed that's it. 

No one I mentioned the lack of hot canapes to was aware this was a Langham Club standard at many other hotels in the brand so I hope they will consider aligning this aspect of Langham London Club Lounge with sister hotels in Australia, Asia and the US. 

A word of warning to those who need to work - there is no business centre in this hotel so if you need anything printed and have Club Lounge access you have to email it to a staff member who will print for you as a workaround. Not ideal with sensitive work documents going via a non-secure 3rd party email. 

Lastly, I need to comment on the new loyalty program called Brilliant. IT IS NOT BRILLIANT, the app is poor (cannot even check my current and future booking details other than to see there is a booking). I was not acknowledged as a member at checkin and I think the system does not flag it? Previous benefits such as room upgrades, in room welcome amenity and a welcome note that were given to Voyager level members in the old loyalty program have all been removed. The program disadvantages those members who are not resident of the US (i.e use USD) as the earning rate is 150 points per $5 USD. There is no recognition of number of nights, just $ spend and there are no upgrades as a benefit even for the top level (Ruby). Ruby requires an annual spend of $24,000 USD (or $35000 AUD). Late checkout is not guaranteed at any level. 

Previously at Langham group hotels I was reliably upgraded to the next room type if it was available and ALWAYS received a nice welcome note. For this stay I was upgraded off the back of my dissatisfaction with the new program, but it was clearly a ""one off"" they were very reluctant to offer. I appreciated it nonetheless and realize head office decisions are not under the control of individuals working at the hotels.

I hope someone at the head office of the Langham Hospitality Group in Hong Kong reads this feedback about the new (not so) Brilliant loyalty program.",4,2024,09,04
140,Fantastic Langham,"This was our first stay at this fantastic hotel, and from the moment we arrived, we felt warmly welcomed.

Rooms are lovely-we stayed in an executive room, with our son.
If you haven't been, I recommend going to The Wigmore too.

140,Home Away From Home,"I normally visit the Langham 2x a year, if not more, and  it is truly my home away from home. Another incredible stay. I am an odd ball when traveling solo and requested I stay in the same room as I did the last time I was here. As a female traveling alone, it just makes me feel safe. The staff found the room I stayed in previously and honored I my request.  Additionally, I am celebrating my 40th, and when I returned to my room after a day out, there was a beautiful fruit platter, box of chocolates, a treat from their restaurant, and balloons waiting for me. I was blown away. Thank you, Langham! I will never stay anywhere else. The staff here is truly incredible, a true differentiator, and that is why I always return.",5,2024,08,22
140,Another wonderful stay at the Langham,"My daughter and I recently revisited the Langham, after she had been diagnosed with celiac. She was a bit nervous about the the options at the Langham Club, which she had greatly enjoyed on previous visits. She had no need to worry. The staff at the Club were very knowledgeable about the allergens for each food item and were quick to provide great gluten-free options for her.  Big shout out to Gee and Ivan at the Club (as well as the rest of the wonderful staff) who provided amazing hospitality (and great cocktails, too!).  Out room was lovely and spacious, with great housekeeping.  We are looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2024,08,21
140,We will be back!,"The stay at the Langham was the highlight of our trip...and we even saw Taylor Swift--so that is a high bar. This is the best hotel that I have ever stayed. Not the trendiest hotel, or coolest hotel, but it is an absolute gem. The history of this building is wonderful, and they have kept the old but it is very updated and timely. But the real reason, is the people that work there. They make you feel welcomed and are willing to do what it takes to make your stay special. We will  be back! ",5,2024,08,20
140,Superb,If I could rate this hotel higher I would. I booked the executive room for 3 nights.  I was not disappointed with the room it has the best view of the bbc building and the layout of the room was great.  The staff within the club lounge and the rest of the hotel were polite respectful and made us feel very welcomed .    Nothing was too much trouble and really I couldn’t find fault. We have stayed at quite a number of 5 star hotels but this outshines them all .,5,2024,08,19
140,Allways a pleasurable experience,"The Langham is the hotel I choose every time I go to London. The service is excellent, and the staff are smiling and friendly.

We now plan our vacations based on if there is a Langham hotel at our destiination of choice!",5,2024,08,17
140,What a disappointment !,"I'm a bit conflicted. I chose the Langham because I wanted to repeat the experience of the other Langhams I've done in the United States (see NYC and Chicago)... and especially for the Club Lounge, which always amazed us! What a disappointment here in London!   The welcome wasn't personalized at all. No one took any interest in us at the Club. You saw other customers at the club treated differently! Staff behavior changed depending on the customer! The Club was very discriminating!  Food at the Club disappointing. No choice at all in drinks. Go to the Chicago Club and you'll see the difference!  Breakfast very simple and not at all up to standard. The Club's front desk staff were borderline rude! The chef never came to talk to us. And the Club manager spent the whole time speaking very loudly in Arabic to the Arab customers! Without even telling them that their phones were bothering us a lot (SMS and calls received at the Club)... By 7:30 p.m. there was nothing left to eat! Just a poor salad and two pieces of chicken. What a shame.  No newspapers available... No one did the Club's work with passion... with love... you could see it ... I kept having to ask for things that weren't on the buffet: napkins... glasses... cutlery... I really regretted having taken the Club... but above all I regretted having booked the Langham...  Frankly, there's a lot of work to be done... Too bad",2,2024,08,12
140,Gorgeous hotel with beautiful attention to detail,"Had the most surreal experience in this beautiful hotel. From the beautiful grand entrance to the beautiful decorated marble reception area, the entire stay throughout was most enjoyable. We received such a warm welcome from the staff who were incredibly attentive, professional and supportive throughout- thank you for the stand out service.

The room was gorgeous with incredibly comfortable linen, beautiful bathroom and incredible amenities. I loved the attention to detail such as the crystal glasses in the room and that the tea set was laid out in the draw to use and the little link pens in the room, all so thoughtful. Even having bath salts and little toiletries which smell incredible was so nice. I especially loved the pink theme running through the hotel really added a touch of elegance to the stay, from the pink flowers and phones and beautiful notes of pink throughout the hotel. The fact they have a courtesy car that can take you around the surrounding area complimentary is such a nice touch. 

The spa staff were incredible, their service was flawless especially Nicolas, Anna and Ernestina they were so welcoming and made me feel at ease and were so helpful throughout. The spa facilities were amazing and I had an outstanding Langham signature massage the Harmony massage. The tea served in the spa from a Japanese cast iron tea pot was also amazing.

140,The Langham is THE place to stay in London,My husband I and I stayed at the Langham on our honeymoon and had an absolutely amazing time. I had booked us a room that gave us access to the Langham Club Lounge and it was a thousand times worth booking that beautiful room. Every single member of the staff was so friendly and professional and I especially enjoyed chatting with Ian at the front of the hotel when waiting for a car or my cousin who came and visited for High Tea at the Palm Court. The Langham London defines hospitality in my opinion and I don't ever want to stay anywhere else when I eventually go back to London. I can't thank the staff enough for their warm hospitality. I highly recommend the Langham Hotel. ,5,2024,08,01

140,The best hotel experience ever!,"We stayed six nights at the Langham and it was fabulous!  From the moment we arrived we were treated as valued guests.  Housekeeping was perfect-our room was kept impeccably. The food and service was wonderful and the concierge provided the best recommendations for restaurants. The Langham  has the best concierge service in London. 
We had access to the Langham Club and I can say that it was the icing on the cake -wonderful food and service provided throughout out the day. 
We arrived at the Langham after a terrific luxury cruise through Portugal, Spain and France, so our hotel expectations were high - the Langham delivered.
It was our first stay the Langham but it won’t be our last!",5,2024,07,27
140,Amazing hotel,Service was amazing making arrival and departure seamless. Very central location and beautiful hotel.  Pink roses were seen around the hotel with a beautiful aroma throughout the lobby.,5,2024,07,26
140,Elegant and Excellent,"Really elegant and classical hotel near Regents Park, the BBC and Regents Street. Comfortable and quiet room with a bed that meant I slept like a log. Breakfast was fantastic - had been there before for a breakfast meeting and it was as good as previously. Outstanding service. All as you might expect - and then two steps beyond that. Will stay again - truly excellent base when in London.",5,2024,07,24

140,Not for families,I just called the hotel only to be told that I need to book two rooms as my 3 and 5 year old can't share an executive room with me and my husband. There is a king bed and roll-in bed. Shocking to say the least-- and certainly not safe. Extremely disappointing.,1,2024,07,19
140,"Timeless elegance, exceptional","I am home having spent an unforgettable weekend break at this exceptional and iconic hotel.
It oozes class in every way and it’s such a pleasure to experience such professionalism and timeless elegance.

140,Elegant and Exquisite,"The property is exactly what you would expect in London. Beautifully appointed with every amenity necessary and beyond. Quiet and spacious rooms with lovely personal touches make this a must in Central London. The staff is plentiful, friendly and go above and beyond with five star service. Walkable to most everything in central London and the Taxi’s are plentiful should you require one. This property is definitely a cut above that places quality and luxury at the top of the list.",5,2024,07,05
140,The Chuan Spa,"My daughter booked a facial treatment for me last week  Thursday at the spa as a small gift. My facial treatment was done by the lovely Ernestina. It was an amazing experienced which enhanced me into a relaxing mood and as well she perform the facial treatment and massage tremendously and with terrific experiences, skills and as well very professional and knowledgeable about the products explaining as she goes along.  

Having this said, sharing my recent experienced with friends and my families we will most definitely return to the Chuan Spa. 

The facilities and services are not comparable to other places I have been.  Superb!",5,2024,06,30
140,Beautiful Langham Is a fine stay,"The Langham is an excellent and beautiful hotel.

The rooms are glorious, beds super comfortable amenities generous and luxury.

This is an expensive hotel and a couple of frustrations.  They only have one bar, the outside area of which was closed for private functions both evenings.  When charging as much as they do, their guests should have priority to roam the facilities.  If they had more than one bar, fine but, to close it off is not really acceptable.

The food and beverages are extortionate.  For a hotel of this calibre one would of course expect the mark up, but this was a joke, 

Staff are excellent and extremely helpful.",4,2024,06,30
140,Absolutely LOVED this Hotel!,"We loved our stay at The Langham!  Conveniently located to many attractions and close to the Oxford Circus tube.  We were blown away by the flower arrangements and lovely scent that greeted us when we entered this luxurious hotel.  We arrived early in the morning from Gatwick Airport and our room wasn't quite ready.  They suggested breakfast at the Plam Court restaurant which we enjoyed.  Fortunately our room was ready after breakfast.

The room was very nice with a comfortable bed and linens, robes and slippers, and Diptyque toiletries.  The warming rack for the towels and the bathroom mirror that did not fog were nice touches.  Turndown service  was provided.  This is the kind of place where you hit the service room button and they are knocking on your door within 5 minutes.  The concierge has gold stripes on his jacket.  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and accommodating.

We found this hotel to be a decent value booking through AMEX FHR.  The breakfast benefit was clutch and the breakfast that was delivered to our room every morning was delicious and filling!

Tip:  Check out the rooftop bar at the Treetop Hotel across the street called The Nest.",5,2024,06,29
140,One word: Luxury,"My wife and I are in luxury industry and were in London for business, and as we stayed at The Langham, the place simply exceeded our expectations. The room was superb and filled with amenities. Dinner at the Palm Court restaurant was flawless...great food with professional service. We had one iron incident and it was handled in a very prompt and effective manner...and follow-up (Eszter and Fani) was ensured...THIS is luxury...
We would go back to The Langham in a heartbeat !",5,2024,06,29
140,5 star hotel ? More three stars with some cracks.,"My first stay ever in a 5 star hotel - I was very exited about that. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. 

The room rate would have normally been around GBP 900 - I was invited but still was shocked about this prices as there are - beside the special location, the beautiful building and of course the history of the hotel - it is just not something special,

The team was friendly and the breakfast very good. But there are many cracks:
- the water pressure in room 429 was absolutely poor and the water not really hot
- the room was way to small for that price
- the spa area had no deck chairs for relaxing between two rounds of sauna - just sofas you do not want to use if you are wet
- breakfast costs extra 35 GBP which is a discount already to 40 GBP or so normally.....on top of GBP 900
- the sauna is tiny
- the two bathrobes in the room are bot L. For a person of 1.96 meters the sleeves are way to far. Why not placing a second one there with longer sleeves?

To summarize: I did not feel the 5 stars, I did not experience them - the atmosphere for me was not 5 stars. Many 4 star or even 3 stars are more outstanding then the Langham in London I have to say.

140,A Luxurious Stay with Exceptional Service,"The Langham provided a truly luxurious stay in the heart of London. From the elegant rooms to the impeccable service, everything was on a high level. Special thanks to our housekeeper, Rodica, whose attentiveness and willingness to go the extra mile made our stay truly exceptional.

Highly recommend!",5,2024,06,25
140,The Unbearable Stench…!,"Have stayed at The Langham of London before and have always appreciated the elegance and location of the hotel. 

This time around we stayed in room 082 which is in the adjacent building (near to where the spa is) that you have to traverse through by walking a series of long hallways, multiple elevators and a plethora of fire doors that are reminiscent of the old GET SMART tv show opening where you follow the titular character Maxwell Smart through a myriad of doors. 

The problem with the wing of the hotel where we were staying — rooms 081-084 — was the fact that there was a fetid smell in the hallway.  It was truly unbearable and something that seemed to be the result of potential water damage to the carpets that had begun to mold underneath.  Whatever the cause, it smelled truly awful.  My wife and I would try and hold our breath and make a dash from the stairwell to the inside of our room whenever we were navigating our floor. 

The room itself was lovely.  And I’ve always been a fan of the hotel.  But they have a real issue with this wing of the hotel.  The smell of the hallway is god awful and I hope it isn’t as toxic as it smells. 

We informed Nick at the front desk of the smell.  Hopefully they find a way to rectify it.",2,2024,06,23
140,"Wonderful week at The Langham, London","We stayed at The Langham for a little more than a week in May/June 2024. The Executive Room is bright and has a very good working desk with plenty of light, natural or otherwise. I cannot say enough good things about the service and hospitality. Every staff member was very kind and helpful. It has everything one needs for a home away from home. Will definitely be back!",4,2024,06,19
140,The Langham is a tourist destination,"The hotel is the lap of luxury. On one day of our visit, we just stayed in the hotel after enjoying their superb breakfast and afternoon tea.  We have never been so pampered.  At check in, our clerk personally showed us to our room.  All of the staff were marvelous.  The flowers throughout the hotel are so gorgeous.  Staying at the Langham was an exquisite experience.",5,2024,06,17
140,"A flagship for British hospitality, quality and service.","Second visit to this wonderful hotel. Preparation of our stay was meticulously realized with the help of the very dedicated and competent guest and concierge services who worked quickly and cleverly to ensure us a comfortable stay from A to Z and who arranges surprises for a member of the family's birthday. The rooms were perfect and spotless, every square inch of the property is pure luxury, calm and comfort with the utmost level of service. The location is perfect and all the employees are absolutely helpful and professional, anticipating each guest's needs and making their best to be sure that you feel at home. I've been travelling for more than 30 years now and I visited many 5 stars hotels in the world. Many of them are Wonderfull but few, very few encompass the perfect blend of cleanliness, perfect service and detail perfection of this one. Always a pleasure to come back.",5,2024,06,16
140,"Charming Hotel, a beautiful little gem!","The Langham London is a charming, luxury hotel. We generally book modern/new hotels however this little gem was a wonderful surprise. We booked an Executive King room, and although having that old charm, the suite was modern (and very large) in its own way. The bathroom amenities were wonderful. The complimentary chocolates and savoury surprises at turn down were a delight!
The location was great, perfectly positioned to stroll Regent/Bond st and take in the Christmas lights.
The Club room offerings were delightfully simple but adequate throughout the day, the Club room itself although small, was beautiful and boasted stunning decor, chandeliers and cabinetry.
Would definitely return to the Langham when we visit London next.",5,2024,06,15
140,Amazing Hotel!!,Incredible Hotel. Very friendly and the attention to details is amazing. The hotel room service is amazing and the Palm Court for Dinner was fantastic!

140,Hi there! For the ppl trusting my advices this is my new experience in London…,"Welcome back in London! As you know me usually stay in Connaught or Mandarin in London, but im here for a charity next to Marylebone so i booked here, not with centurion amex, with little emperor app…
I booked a deluxe room 33sqf, when i arrived they proposed me a room on 2nd floor, i ask if it was possible to have an higher floor, they told me yes on 5th but  its the executive floor, room more bigger but more expensive, like 200£ more and not ready yet, if u want it u can stay at business lounge 1h time to prepare the room…
I said ok, no pb, i wait for 1h…
After 2h waiting in the lounge with no news, i went back at reception and tell them that it was not nice to let me wait that long, they told me : we re so sorry, the room is ready please go, this is the key…
Guess what?
5th floor they gave me the smallest room of the floor!
Smaller than the deluxe😂
Genius….
So Dont forget :: Always ask to visit the rooms before change or pay for upgrade)",3,2024,06,14
140,Impeccable experience!,"Dayvid Antonio and Chef Bridget went above and beyond on a very specific ask for a late night snack. The scones are absolutely to die for.  Best scones of all time! Truly made our stay! 

We will definitely come back here on our next trip to London.",5,2024,06,14
140,Great Stay - Great Location,"One night stay. 
I work in finance so should reiterate that I am not an interior designer but it's  probably the most visually  pleasing hotel from top to bottom. The colour schemes are lush and the whole place looks absolutely beautiful and the corridors are really spacious and each floor has its on character. I do like to wander around the Hotels I stay at and this place is massive. I think it's probably the biggest in the city in terms of 5 star hotels and sometimes you can get a bit lost. The staff were excellent although Check-in took longer than I would have liked. The room was beautiful and the staff at the lobby and doorman were really charming and helpful. The room was spacious and immaculate. I must say that the location is probably the best placed out of all the hotels I have stayed at . It's only a  stone throw from the  BBC building and 2 minutes from Oxford Circus, so perfect if you want to stay around the retail area. One highlight of my visit was the exceptional breakfast offered at the hotel. The variety and quality of the breakfast options were outstanding including freshly baked pastries and a selection of gourmet cheeses and fresh fruit.  Worth mentioning that, unfortunately, I was unable to secure a booking at the hotel's renowned restaurant. I have to say that this was entirely my fault for not booking in advance and I only attempted as my date mentioned it when we were walking around Oxford Street. However, I have to say that   the concierge staff went above and beyond to help rectify the situation. They were urgently trying to make alternate dining arrangements for me, which was a very thoughtful gesture and truly appreciated. Ended up getting nice Burger from room service.

All in  all, a great stay and probably the best value for money in terms of quality that I have stayed at.",5,2024,06,14
140,No coffee at The Langham,"I entered the Langham at 10.15 am this morning intent on coffee for two and the opportunity to discuss a matter with my colleague prior to a significant business meeting. 

Imagine my surprise to be told that The Langham was only offering full breakfast service, and indeed only to residents. 

How on earth can one of London’s most celebrated hotels possibly not be able to provide morning coffee to two business women? 

Ridiculous. Certainly “nil point” on hospitality and service.

140,Luxury in London,"From the moment you step into the Langham you feel at home. The hotel itself is elegant and comfortable. The employees can not do enough to make you feel welcome.
We enjoyed the Langham club level, it was a great spot to grab a bite and relax before the day’s events. 
Club level room was large and very well appointed. House keeping is one of the best I have experienced. Many little details were incorporated in the room that just made you feel special. 
We enjoyed the Wigmore pub, great food, service and spirits. Artisan bar crafted a spectacular Old Fashioned and Expresso Martini  and the olives…. Oh my.
I can’t finish the review with mentioned the bellman. We encountered an issue with a taxi driver and the door staff came to our rescue and dealt with it. 
Search no further than The Langham. You will not be disappointed.",5,2024,06,11
140,Basic really,"The hotel itself was nice enough nothing special really. Rooms were quite basic and small. Breakfast in the morning we waited around 50 minutes for our food watching everyone else receive their food, we asked two staff and nothing, then half apologised saying their system always messes up. We missed our train thanks Langham",2,2024,06,09
140,Most enjoyable,As mentioned earlier. Service and help was great especially with the light bagel to go that was prepared for me as I couldn’t stay for the breakfast the second morning.,5,2024,06,07

140,Beautiful property- Horrible Front Desk Management.,"Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Langham, having stayed at their Chicago property and loving that property I was excited to give this property a go.. That excitement ended the moment I entered my Superior room- it was awful…smaller than a cruise ship cabin and the window overlooked a pitched roof- immediately outside the room- I asked Aurora at the front desk to change me to another room- stating no other rooms were available with 2 beds (which is not true- I had friends arriving later that evening with a room with 2 beds- who I never identified as travel companions so Aurora did not know they were traveling with us) so Aurora could have easily switched rooms with their reservation but never offered that option- (By the way- my friends asked to be changed to a king bed room and were given a beautiful room at no extra charge) instead taking me to an Executive room with a king bed and sofa bed -it was much larger but note- does not look anything like the executive rooms shown on website- but the room would work, till she told me it was 350 pounds extra per night!!! What a bait and switch!! Why walk me to a room that was double the cost of the room I was paying without discussing the cost first? I told her that was not in my budget- I was then told I had to accept the unacceptable room or pay 70 pounds extra per night for a deluxe room - which I agreed to as I could not stay in the first room and after almost an hour of dealing with the situation I was worn down- At check out I explained to the agent that I felt it was not acceptable to tell me there no options but to accept a room I felt was not acceptable or pay more- this is a luxury world class hotel- this felt personal- like a front desk manager looked at me and said to his team do not give him any other room without charging him (maybe it was because I booked through Agoda) - I could see the agents reading notes and once done they immediately said nothing else they could do since they were so busy…it was very obvious… I consider myself a fair person, thus giving the Langham 3 stars even though I felt completely belittled by the front desk…. All that said, the deluxe room was nice,  wonderful bathroom, and their housekeeping team was able to turn the room from a king bed to two twin beds- (I wish the hotel would notate that on their website as I would have booked the deluxe room to begin with- but superior room is the highest offered with 2 beds on their website). We enjoyed massages at the spa and the beautiful pool area… I also hosted a reunion afternoon tea for 9ppl at their Palm Court- which all of us throughly enjoyed!!  All said and done, had the front desk acted like a true 5 star front desk, this would have been a 5 star review- with a note to future guests according to Aurora at front desk, all standard and Superior rooms are on 1st and 2nd floors with no views- so be warned if you want daylight- you have to book a Deluxe room or higher- (unless I was just told that to force me to pay more- their website does say Superior rooms could have courtyard, or city view With plenty of natural light!- that’s a bold lie considering the room I was given had a pitched roof outside the window and no view at all!!).",3,2024,06,02
140,ABSOLUTE PERFECT WONDERFUL HOTEL,"We stayed for three nights to celebrate my birthday ... chosen due to location to The Palladium with Barry Manilow tickets in hand !  From the moment we stepped from the taxi into the welcoming reception we knew our stay was going to be special . Lawrence was wonderful ....such a perfect person to be greeted by.   He personally took us to our AMAZING room .... after handing me a birthday gift ... we had fruit , chocolates , champagne and a cake waiting with a lovely handwritten note !  The bathroom was perfect ( they so often aren't even in the best hotels ) water pressure perfect in the shower , a lovely bath with hand shower over for hair washing.   The toiletries smelled beautiful and so soft.  Fluffy towels , soft robes.  Everything and more you could want or need .   We watched the Cup Final next door in The Langham's own Pub ..  with tasty  light lunch and drinks a plenty ! The fantastic staff looked after us so well.  The TV was a pull down screen ( had teething problems but the wonderful staff pulled out all the stops to mend it just as it kicked off ! They were not going to let us down !  Then on to sleeping in The Langham ...   could not be more perfect.    Turn down ( always a wonderful gesture ) and makes you feel so cared for ...  the sheets and comfort here off the scale !   Despite the location of the hotel no outside sound heard.   Temperature also perfect ( air-con if you wanted it too ) Breakfast ... what an amazing experience ! The staff are incredible ... as is the food and selections ... no rushed or hurried feeling in this breakfast room !  Smart , smiling staff in abundance .   The location of this hotel is perfect .. we shopped on the smart streets , we wandered around Marylebone , we walked in Regents Park , walked to Soho, Covent Garden ,  Buckingham Palace , we had the luxury of a ride in the chauffeur driven Mercedes to another 5 star hotel for cocktails  ... but could nt wait to get back to our new London Home so didn't stay there too long !!   Anyway, Barry Manilow cancelled the show just before the doors were due to open .....  do you know after the initial disappointment we went back to The Langham was found a beautiful table in the Artesian Bar by the lovely young lady who went over and above to make up for our disappointment, as did the fabulous young man who recommended and  served us tasty cocktails and glorious food ....  Barry who ?    I think our last night at the Langham was made so memorable by these two .. when it really could have been disaster !! To sum up ... I apologise for the many times I used "" lovely , wonderful , amazing and perfect "" but there are no other words to describe this hotel , the staff , location, ambience and our mini-break.     We have stayed in all of the "" other "" main five star hotels in London . and we , now we have found The Langham , will only ever  stay here .

Not only in the well-appointed room, but with the way the staff went out of their way to make me feel at home. I had a king-sized bed that I did not want to leave.

I liked the gym a lot with everything you need.
The breakfast experience is just amazing, very British, classic, stylish, healthy options which I liked a lot, and also a special corner for the kids. Although I was traveling for business this time, I would definitely recommend to go there with kids, there are very child-friendly.",4,2024,05,29

140,An Historic and Comfortable Stay in the Heart of London,"The Langham is itself part of the history of London, and a stay here cannot help but deepen one's appreciation and admiration for the hotel on this basis alone.  But we found that the amenities of the hotel, its friendly, welcoming and hard-working helpful  staff, and the very high quality of the accomodations and restaurants on premises truly made our stay a top-notch, unforgettable experience.  The rooms are spacious, quiet, clean and comfortable, and the two bars on site, the Wigmore and Artesian, offer excellent cocktails, beers and wines to either start or end an evening.  A special shout-out to the hotel's amazing concierge staff, especially Marcin Wasilewski, who spared no effort to provide truly personal and exceptional guest service.  I can say the same for the wonderful reception and Palm Court staff and servers, who made us feel like family each morning at breakfast.  Incidentally, the experience of High Tea in the Palm Court, started at the Langham, should not be missed.  Finally, the Langham's central location in Marylebone is within an easy walking distance to several major Tube stations at Oxford Circus, Bond Street, and for the new Elizabeth Line, as well as major London attractions, shopping, and diverse restaurants/pubs near Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.  If you enjoy exploring a city on foot, you are very well situated at the Langham.  London surely is full of excellent hotels to choose from, but you definitely will never regret choosing to stay at the beautiful and historic Langham.",5,2024,05,20

140,No value received,"Very disappointed in the room for the price we paid; not worth the money. Room was extremely small - no storage - credenza was used to for the mini-fridge storage and all of the drawers were full of glassware, tea/coffee accessories - so there was hardly anywhere to store clothes especially with two guests in the room. Closet was miniscule and nowhere to store luggage, so it took up floor space in the already tight room. The room had not been updated so there were no USB ports for charging phones, etc. The bed had toppers to extend the use of the mattress and they were old/horrible. They slanted to one side and the slightest lean on the bed would send it rolling across the floor. Good location and friendly staff, spa was a nice amenity, but the steam room was not functioning/draining properly – it flooded twice during our stay. The food/beverage options were very limited – the new restaurant, Mimosa, was disappointing and everything closed early. Concierge couldn’t figure out how to book our train tickets to Hampton Court Palace and then booked the wrong date for our tour and couldn’t get them reimbursed initially. I ended up having to book the train and entry tickets myself in the end. Overall, with the number of luxury hotel options in the city, this was a disappointment.",2,2024,05,07
140,First class service,"Excellent customer service, well appointed rooms, fantastic breakfast. As usual our latest stay at the Langham was perfect from start to finish. ",5,2024,05,06
140,We will definitely go back to this hotel,"Very clean, beautiful building, great location a very good wellness area .. with a great indoor pool ",4,2024,05,06
140,Amazing location and experience,"In these days of virtual here is a location you can feel and touch which heightens your senses and provides you with a once in a lifetime experience.
From the fragrance to the staff to the food and the ombience, it’s the total package for anyone visiting London for a high end experience. We love this place and it is our second home!",5,2024,05,06
140,Amazing service you will feel like you're royalty!,"From the time you walk into the time you leave, you are treated like you are royalty! Everyone is there to make sure that you are extremely happy and they came by several times to check if the room was clean, if you needed anything for turn down. 
Every person made an impression, from the porters, concierge and check in staff. The housekeeping to the wait staff. I wish everyone in USA was this fantastic. 
Specifically, chef Bedjet came out to check our food at palm court. We got to meet him and this made us feel more special but then we ended up feeling like family. 
The services provided were amazing. 
The room was large for London. Modernized. Huge tv, and the shower and bathroom updated 
Robes and slippers were plush. The bed was so comfortable , not too hard or soft. The bedding was also plush and luxe.  
The only bad thing is the small size of elevator, if more than 4 people you felt very cramped. The spa and pool were very far away from where my room was but I was still able to find it. 
The underground was a few blocks away but walkable. 
I would stay more days if I could. Thank you, this was an amazing experience ! ",5,2024,05,06
140,English service at its best!,"Although this hotel is massive, we had the feeling that we were being taken care of in a special manner.  The attention given from the moment we stepped out of the taxi made us feel that we had been expected.  In the grand lobby we were escorted to check-in which was seamless. Our room was large and extremely comfortable though, in our opinion, rather neutral in decor.  A fabulous bathroom with a luxurious bathtub and lovely amenities added to the overall comfort and feeling of exclusivity. Housekeeping did everything to make sure we were comfortable. Rena at the switchboard managed all our needs in the most friendly and efficient manner - including sending up extra complimentary milk balls when I mentioned that I had become addicted to them.  How attentive is that?!  We loved having breakfast in the elegant yet comfortable Palm Court dining room. The friendly, efficient staff knew us by name from the get-go, remembered our drink preferences and made us feel at home. The staff exuded a subtle elegance without being stuffy. The bar was very comfortable, the service personnel extremely friendly and attentive, but the food only mediocre. We were also grossly overcharged for two glasses of wine, luckily we checked our bill.  It was certainly an honest mistake, but one that shouldn‘t happen all the same. There was some confusion trying to book an early morning cab. The concierge said reserving a cab at that hour was difficult and instead he wanted to order us a private car for the hefty price of 250.00! After a quick chat with the lovely doormen out front we were assured a cab would be waiting for us , which it was.  It pays to ask around!  All in all, the Langham delivers what it is known for. Luxury, excellent service, the feeling of being looked after and a great location. We would definitely consider returning here on our next trip to London.",5,2024,05,06
140,An Oasis,"A well appointed hotel with exceptional staff attending to your needs in a luxurious setting. We stayed on the Club Lounge level and delighted in the relaxed, yet sophisticated atmosphere where the needs of the guest are paramount.",5,2024,05,06
140,Perfect London Hotel Experience,"Our experience at The Langham London was awesome and couldn’t have been better. The staff, from the waitstaff, concierge, cleaning staff, front desk, to the  doormen were all exceptional.  

The breakfast was amazing in terms of quality of food and breadth of selections. ",5,2024,05,06
140,Great Service in a Great Location,"We had a great time at the Langham.  Our room was very comfortable, though, like a lot of London hotels, the bathtub/shower is on a raised platform was on a raised platform which makes it awkward to get into and out of.  The service at the hotel was outstanding and the front desk was very generous in granting us a late check-out.  The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of Regents Park (5 min), Oxford Street (5 min) and Trafalgar Square (15 min).  We look forward to returning to the Langham on our next trip to London.",5,2024,05,03
140,business trip,"The club is a key part of my selection of the Langham. Location, service and quailty are also a +.  Price is a bit high...but the Club, Location, Service and Quality get me over the price hurdle.",5,2024,05,02
140,The perfect stay!,"The perfect stay at the perfect hotel!
What a magnificent hotel! The staff are just amazing! From housekeeping to first desk and door men everyone are just super friendly and professional. The hotel is both luxurious and still very warm. 
We stayed for 6 wonderful nights and had the best time.
Perfectly located this hotel is a gem!",5,2024,05,01
140,Great experience,We had a wonderful stay at the Langham and the staff and service was excellent. It’s located in a great area and within walking distance of everything.,5,2024,04,30
140,Wonderful place,"I had a recent 12-day stay at the Langham and it was everything I thought it would be.  The service, amenities, and staff are all outstanding. Looking forward to my next stay here when I come back to London. ",5,2024,04,27
140,Favorite hotel in the UK,"The Langham is always a place where one returns to feeling like a family member. Nothing is ever too much trouble for the staff and just the trade mark tuberose scented  corridors are enough to keep me going back over and over again! From the comfortable beds, small gestures like a beautiful seed bookmark placed in my book to a running map of the area placed on my running shoes to the best oat milk I’ve ever tasted   -not to forget the lovely personalized letters form management with thoughtful gifts - this place is like a special little corner of the world to go to when you need a pick-me-up. Thank you to all at the Langham who once again made our stay so memorable!",5,2024,04,27
140,Dom Taylor suddenly exits The Langham early,"After booking Dom’s Front Room months ago, we turned up at the Langham tonight only to find that Dom finished his residency early. The Langham didn’t make much of an effort to inform us, even when I phoned to confirm the booking today. Really disappointed by the service and not what you’d expect from a hotel like The Langham. We were treated with casual indifference. 👎🏾",1,2024,04,25
140,Lovely stay,"Having stayed at the Langham 5th Ave last month, we decided to try the london hotel for our anniversary weekend, and simply wow.

This hotel is regarded as Europe’s first Grand hotel, opening in 1865. Despite its age, the hotel has blended the old with the new and has all the comforts you expect in 2024.

The staff were amazing, professional and  always on hand to help when needed.

Our room was on the small size, but that didn’t bother us, as it was just a place to get afew zzzzzz",5,2024,04,23
140,Beautiful hotel - top notch,"Our stay started with the good news that our room was ready with our 10 a.m. arrival after an all-night flight from Los Angeles.  The bed is dreamy, house cleaning was great.  Food at breakfast was very good, but a bit pricey, even for this hotel.  One piece of brioche French toast with berries was 20 pounds.  That’s a stretch.  

Wigmore was okay, but only went once.  The pub menu was not extensive enough to warrant dinner, especially when there are so many alternatives just steps away.

HUGE shoutout to reception and concierge staff.  They all provided amazing service and support.",5,2024,04,22
140,Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Langham for one night at the end of our trip before heading home. The hotel is grand, but they are keeping up with everything. Clean, comfortable, and professional. The staff are all courteous and capable. This is a top-notch hotel, and they live up to the expectation. My only issue (and this personal to me) is that the A/C does not go a little lower. I found this to be consistent throughout England, so no fault to the Langham.
Great hotel.",5,2024,04,21
140,Would stay again.,"What a pleasant surprise beautiful and , very very nice hotel with excellent service, we came with our children but will come again solo :) the room service menu was more than adequate and we had very nice breakfast we did not use any of the amenities as we were out sightseeing everyday.",5,2024,04,17
140,"Big rooms, small bathrooms.","Great spacious room, small bathrooms. Lighting was bad in bathrooms. Concierge Jamie was fantastic. Front desk wonderful. Dining was not great in Palm Court. Had high tea there. Not great. Recommend other places for high tea. Valet wonderful and friendly. If this hotel had better dining, I’d give it a 5 star. Breakfast is just so so.",4,2024,04,16
140,Fabulous Stay at the Langham,"We had an excellent experience with the hotel's customer service. Ashley, who worked in the Club Lounge, and Mondi were extremely courteous and helpful. The hotel's history tour was also outstanding. The food and champagne in the Club Lounge were a fabulous touch. Moreover, I was delighted to find beautiful birthday gifts left in my room. Everything was impeccable and wonderful, including the room, the Club Lounge, the spa and the hotel. Our stay was on April 4th in room 750. Thank you for the amazing hospitality!""",5,2024,04,13
140,Great stay at the Langham Hotel London,"Just back from 3 days staying at the Langham Hotel and the service was superb as usual
We were met at the door by Fadi who escorted us to the executive floor and personally sorted our room out big thanks for that sir
We stayed in an executive room which was superb and very comfortable and the use of the exec. lounge is a great facility to have with fantastic very attentive friendly staff
Ash and his team there made us feel very welcome and comfortable. We will be back very soon",5,2024,04,09
140,Luxury with a friendly touch,"We just stayed 3 nights in April in an executive room at The Langham, as our friends had recommended this hotel very highly. We weren’t disappointed.

An executive room comes with access to the Club lounge, where you’ll discover real luxury with a friendly touch from the amazing staff.

The food, drinks and decor are truly 5 star but what makes the Club experience very special is the excellent service from the Club team.

A special mention and thank you to Kanu, Ivan and Gee for making our time in the Club so memorable. They couldn’t do enough for us and genuinely wanted us to have the best experience.

It was so good, we’ve immediately rebooked to go back in May for my wife Tracey’s birthday.

See you soon guys,

Graham & Tracey Whitehurst",5,2024,04,08
140,Practically perfect in every way,"This hotel was perfect.  The facility is perfectly located, central and close to the shopping but just enough off the main drag to be quiet and peaceful in the room.  The staff was amazing, the housekeeping services were top notch.  The room was spotless, tea and milk were restocked as used, the nice china and glassware in the rooms were much appreciated and used.  The bathroom was really nice, stocked with Diptyque shampoo, gel and lotions and conditioner.  
We ate room service one night and lunched in the attached Wigmore pub one day.  The food was really good, the service was top notch.  I have nothing but positive impressions of our ten day stay and would happily return again in the future.",5,2024,04,08
140,Luxury at its finest,"This is a true 5 star hotel that really understands it's all in the details. 

The staff is beyond amazing. From the second you set foot on the property you are greeted with a warm smile. Everyone is so helpful and seems genuinely happy for you to be there. 

Location is perfect in London. Just outside the crazy hustle and bustle, but a short walk to the action and Underground Oxford line. We also enjoyed strolling into Marybelone in the evening. 

The cleanliness is top notch. The housekeeping staff left no detail forgotten. Little details (like setting up my jewelry in a jewelry case) made all the difference. Turndown service nightly, heated bathroom floors, luxurious robes. Everything you could hope for. 

We enjoyed the Langham Club immensely. Breakfast was served there daily, along with afternoon snacks and evening canapes. The staff remembers your cocktail of choice and name. We loved having that space to enjoy and I would highly recommend it. 

The cocktail bar in the lobby has the most innovative, delicious drinks we've had in a while. My husband loved the pub, The Wigmore. We had dinner at Palm Court and we enjoyed it. Right now its a pop up restaurant called the Good Front Room from an acclaimed chef who won a Netflix cooking show. 

They hosted an Easter kids arts & crafts which my kids enjoyed thoroughly! 

One thing to note about the room setup. We had connecting rooms as we are a family of 5. There is one main entry door, and then each room had its own private separate entry. If you had young children I think it would be a challenge to hear them as I dont think you can leave the big doors between rooms propped open. I could be wrong though! 

Thank you Langham. We will be back!!",5,2024,04,05
140,An Easter surprise,"The Langham was very much as advertised an English experience I have been seeking in London for my many years visiting.
The rooms were impeccable and only surpassed by the amazing members of the hotel staff.
My hats off in particular to Marcella the fourth floor housekeeper that is the best I have ever experienced.
All I can say is it was a grand experience that I hope someday to surpass by returning",5,2024,04,02
140,Langham Hotel,"Fantastic service and hotel. Staff very attentive and thorough and all facilities kept immaculate with nothing that could not be provided. Whether afternoon tea, the cocktail bar or the Wigmore pub everything was faultless. Would not hesitate to return.",5,2024,04,02
140,Traveler's Dream Hotel,"Perfect location at top of Regent Street, luxurious bathrooms with everything you need to never leave your room, thoughtful tech approach with adapter outlets for travelers, best pub ever. We spent 3 nights, used the pool (lovely, small), had concierge help with dinner recommendations, missed the restaurant. Can't wait to return and can't imagine staying in another London hotel after this experience.",5,2024,04,01

140,The best hotel in London ?,"Stayed at The Langham for a couple of nights for my wife's 60th birthday. The entire stay was exceptional primarily down to every single staff member that we had the pleasure of engaging with. Food and drink was superb. We drank/ate in The Wigmore, The Artesian and The Palm Court. Everything was top notch including the friendly service. Is there a better hotel in London ? I think not. Superb hotel in the best location with staff who care - what else could you want ?!",5,2024,03,30
140,London in Top Form!,"Exceptional service, great location and exquisite hotel.  This hotel is centrally located in the heart of London with access to all of the amenities to walk, travel and restaurant access 2-3 blocks away..   They provided exceptional service, support and a super clean atmosphere. ",5,2024,03,28
140,Loved it. Will come again,"Excellent hotel with terrific service from everyone on staff. We did not encounter a hint of attitude from anyone. We had a text chain where my qs would be answered by staff almost immediately. The servers at restaurant were amazing and cleaning staff w turn down service and little touches like fruits, q tips etc and change of towels and robes daily were terrific. 
Restaurants were great. Check out mimosa. I would skip the high tea. It was just too expensive $245 for two w champagne and sandwiches did not thrill at all. Palm court is great for breakfast though and so is Wigmore but selection there is less. Artesian is terrific for drinks and light snack and don’t miss the pool. 
My only gripe was that after telling staff ahead of time we are celebrating a special birthday our room overlooked the roof of another building w smoke coming out of it. At this price point I would have liked a better view but it did not affect our stay and again the service is terrific. 
Oxford Circus tube was a short walk and so was regent park.",5,2024,03,25
140,Cocooned in luxury,"Our stay at The Langham was an indulgent and well researched treat. I wanted to really spoil my 86 year old mum after a particularly distressing few months in which we lost my dad.
I spent months researching different hotels and The Langham stood out for two reasons: location and staff. Considering the steep price point (we are an ordinary family. We are not wealthy!), the offer of a third free night is what ultimately persuaded me to book!
We were not disappointed! The Langham oozes ‘quiet luxury’. The imposing marble foyer, the perfectly curated artwork, the chandeliers and  ‘signature pink’ touches which ran throughout the hotel were just perfection. The abundance of cherry blossoms and a nod to the Orient was just sublime.
I choose a deluxe room, as it was important that we had both a bath and a separate walk-in shower.  It was also at the maximum of my budget! 
I had asked for twin beds if possible and on arrival this had not been noted ; however reception quickly rectified this and we were allocated another room (we didn’t see the original) and staff divided the beds at turn down. The room was ‘quietly luxurious’ with a small entrance lobby, which housed the wardrobe, mini bar etc. Placing the wardrobe outside of the actual bedroom was a clever touch as it made the bedroom itself appear particularly spacious (although there was plenty of storage). The very spacious marble bathroom (with a separate toilet) was a dream with Italian frette robes and French brand,Diptyque  toiletries. The whole hotel smells gorgeous and guests can purchase the range of Flavours of Langham, which includes room scents and soy candles.
The location was perfect-bang opposite the BBC building and at the top of Regent Street. I easily walked down to Buckingham Palace and walking, if you can, is just the best way to really experience London. Marylebone village is also a short walk away and has some lovely boutiques and shops, including the famous Daunt book shop. 
The staff were just so lovely. There were clearly enormously wealthy guests staying, but they treated everyone with kindness and respect. They even offered to go to the nearest chemist for my mum when she was unwell, which they did, without charging. Housekeeping was discrete and the best we’d ever encountered-it was literally faultless. They anticipated needs and even things like spectacle cloths were provided when they noticed our glasses cases. The turn down service was so lovely to return to, and we appreciated the  little touches of Classic FM playing in the background and slippers and mats next to the bed (hands down the comfiest bed I have ever slept in!). 
The Stationery Set provided and the classic Langham pink pens were such lovely touches-even a spare USB cable was tied with a signature pink ribbon! 
I tried to note down as many staff as I could as I think it’s so important to acknowledge excellent service so I apologise if I have left anyone out or got spellings wrong but thanks to Abule (Abdule ?) and Desi the porters, Kelvin and Alex on reception, Jessica the breakfast manager, Maryanne (?) in the Palm Court, Vera from housekeeping and the friendly doormen. Staff in The Palm Court were all very patient and accommodating to us with my mum feeling  a little unwell (which once we returned home turned into a nasty chest infection!) & myself, a fussy eater! Also staff in the Artisan  bar were also so friendly and professional.
I’d booked Afternoon Tea in the famous Palm Court for Mothering Sunday and had requested a table to the side or corner due to my mum’s hearing issues, and I was pleased to see we were taken to a lovely table in a corner which was perfect for us. My mum was also presented with a celebration chocolate cake, which was an unexpected thoughtful touch and all the mum’s received a bouquet of tulips. 
If I had to find any faults, I would say that some flowers (even faux) in the bedroom would have been a nice touch (we used a whisky glass to display the Mother’s Day flowers and I half expected this to be picked up and a vase provided, but it wasn’t). Bamboo stems were in the bathroom but for the price point something would have been nice and added a splash of colour. A selection of biscuits would have been appreciated (there were some complimentary posh type of Maltesers) and perhaps a selection of fruit; rather than three artfully placed apples! Also if I was to be super fussy, I did expect a hairdryer with a diffuser and wish I’d taken my own!",5,2024,03,24
140,A True Five Star Hotel,It was wonderful to experience the true five star experience of the Langham London   It reminded me of the luxury of the Ritz Carlton brand at if is exception before the bean counters at Marriott decimated luxury hospitality  truly a wonderful experience for anyone who appreciates and understands luxury  ,5,2024,03,23
140,Splendid hotel in the centre of London,"A wonderful place to stay, everything is perfect, staff warm and helpful. Food with huge choices, great quality.

140,Husband's 50th birthday weekend,"We stayed at the Langham for my husband's 50th birthday and it was outstanding!  Everything from check in to check out was perfect. We had an upgraded room and balloons, cake, fruit and wine were beautifully presented which was a wonderful surprise for us both. The room was gorgeous and the bathroom truly luxurious. We used the Palm restaurant for breakfast and the Artesian bar for pre dinner drinks, both are truly beautiful and the staff are exceptional. The breakfast head chef even came out of the kitchen to wish my husband a happy birthday and presented him with another cake stacked from pancakes and fruit. The lobster and champagne breakfast is a must and absolutely delicious. I honestly cannot fault anything about the hotel which also has a stunning spa and pool. It should be 7 stars instead of 5 and everyone from the check in staff, housemaids, waiters, barmen, doormen,spa staff and concierge were just wonderful.  We will be back ASAP!  Thank you to the Langham!!!",5,2024,03,19
140,The Langham is a wonderful retreat in the heart of London,"My husband and I stayed at the Langham for the week this March.  I cannot say enough about the property itself as well as the service.  Our room was lovely, only to be outdone by the food and the spa.  We included breakfast in our stay and I am quite glad that we did.  The Palm Court is an elegant room; the food (buffet and/or a la carte) was absolutely delicious, and of great value  and the service was exceptional.  The staff is well trained and interested in helping you have everything you want/need, which is a rarity in most hotels these days.  The spa services were exceptional.  My husband and I both raved about our massages.  All of the spa rooms are immaculate and clearly attended to on a regular basis.  We used the gym which was also consistently clean. The location of the hotel is near to everything, but quiet at the same time.  It was a totally wonderful experience and I have booked to stay there again in June 2024.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2024,03,18
140,Bravo the Langham!,"I stayed for a week at the Langham 
Best week ever, my room was beautiful, super clean, very spacious, beautifully decorated and with all the special touches you can think of if you are a perfectionist like me.
Excellent staff very attentive very helpful and polite. Dinning in the restaurant and in room service was top, loved the breakfast! 
The spa was another place where I enjoyed an hour massage. Truly worth every penny 
Exceeding all of my expectations from the kind smily doorman to the management. 
Centrally located you are in the heart of London! 
I sure will come again and stay no where but at the Langham.
Bravo!",5,2024,03,17

140,Taken money wrongly.,"The Langham, after receiving a cancellation confirmation have proceeded to take the £880 from my bank account anyway.
The communication with the team was politely rude after an error on my behalf. The lack of understanding over it is terrible. And now to see the money has been taken even after proof of cancellation for free had been taken.
I'm so disappointed.",1,2024,03,16
140,"A touch of pink, a hint of grey, a fabulous stay","Should you have the money and inclination, splurge with a stay in the one bedroom suite. The rooms are tastefully appointed, sophisticated and clean. The extra powder room in the entry means you won't be disturbed in your bed if your guest in the sitting room needs to was their hands. And the entrance to the Club lounge is a civilising experience! Tea with clotted cream! Lovely pink cookies! My one teeny tiny complaint is that I'd prefer other tea pots, but you know there has to be Something that needs improvement!
But of course, it is the staff that makes a stay at The Langham so special. From check in to a late check out they are there to help. The butters, the baggage people, the receptionists-- all do a great job. I guess you can tell, I'll be back soon!",5,2024,03,15
140,Heavenly Stay,"I can’t recommend this hotel highly enough. The whole team is outstanding- from making initial enquiries all the through to the stay and check out it was exemplary service. The hotel itself is beautiful, with great food available in a number of restaurants and bars",5,2024,03,10

140,The Good Front Room . Caribbean Michelin Star  Experience,"The Good Front Room. Wow . The Location and venue was amazing. The music and the artwork was incredible. The  service was 5 star all the way from start to finish. Cocktails to start. The Punch was so flavoured and super strong. Where to start. The food chicken, goat prawns to name some were all eye catching and the flavours were on point .The price to was also  very reasonable for 3 courses and 4 drinks £300. If you get a chance I recommend that you visit this establishment before 30th April.
Thank you chef Dom and your team memorable experience.",5,2024,03,04
140,Three days at the Langham,"Once again a great stay at the Langham. Many highlights as always. The rooms are always superb as are the staff in the club room. Everyone makes you feel like family returning from a long holiday. Nothing is too much trouble and the way they remember what you like, what you did last time you stayed with them, etc makes them very impressive. You have to stay here to understand ",5,2024,02,28
140,Our favourite hotel in the UK but a disappointing visit on this occasion…,"We’ve been staying at the Langham for about 12 years. Our very first stay was booked via Secret Escapes so to say the standard of experience at the Langham has dramatically changed over the years (in a good way!) is an understatement, and we’ve been there throughout the journey to observe this incredible hotel flourish. For years we have tried to get to the Langham as regularly as possible, 3/4 times a year, and our experiences have been faultless resulting in the Langham being very special to us and certainly our favourite hotel in the UK, if not the world. We’ve never needed much of a reason to visit but every time we’ve had a special occasion, we’ve celebrated at the Langham. We love the club lounge experience and, since this concept was introduced at the Langham, we have always booked an executive room albeit have spent very little time in the hotel room and all our time in the club lounge on first-name terms with the club lounge colleagues. We visited in September 2022 and persuaded friends to join us. This was the first time we had ever encountered issues, predominantly in the club lounge with slow service and a lack of food offering, although I also had some costs incorrectly charged to my credit card too. Eventually, the hotel resolved this, although it was hard work, and I was left really disappointed especially as we had raved to our friends about how amazing the Langham was. Subsequently, we ended up having a rest from visiting for around a year. February 2024, I decided it was time for a revisit with the hope that the club lounge would be back to its exemplary standards and took other friends along with us. Regretfully, the club lounge service was considerably worse than our visit in 2022 - slow service, no service, wrong orders etc… I was bitterly disappointed on the day we checked out having again brought friends along with us and seeing their disappointment too. I spoke to a manager in the club lounge who didn’t seem particularly interested and simply thanked us for our feedback. I then sought out another manager, Lawrence Toms, who was excellent. Genuinely sorry and disappointed for our experience and asked us to please return again in the future and give the Langham another chance. So, will we return again? Of course. The Langham will always be very special to us and I don’t think there’s much they could do that would make us never return. I’m currently looking at other top hotels in London for a birthday celebration and just the thought of not staying at the Langham like we normally do fills me with sadness. It’s a beautiful hotel, the lobby area and Palm Court are stunning, the cocktails in Artesian are awesome, the hotel rooms are elegant and well-maintained, and the beds are up there with the best and most comfy I have ever slept in. We genuinely love the bones of the Langham and always will. We plan to try again in the future in the hope that the club lounge has regained its exemplary standards. All those years ago when we booked via Secret Escapes, we paid £250 for two nights! Now, the cost of staying at the Langham is significantly more, and with big price tags, comes big expectations. At its best, the Langham is worth every penny and more which is why we have kept returning over the years. I was hopeful of providing all this feedback in the survey that normally lands on check out but, unfortunately, one wasn’t sent one on this occasion.",3,2024,02,28
140,Beautiful. Service impeccable,"We love staying at The Langham. It's one of my favourite hotels. From checking in through to departure, every single step was fabulous!
The turn down service was lovely with little treats to help aid with sleep. All the staff are so friendly! ",5,2024,02,26
140,"Fabulous, loved our stay and highly recommend","Fabulous property, central location and wonderful staff. Highly recommend for either business or pleasure.  Stayed 4 nights and found the food, service and employees to be absolutely amazing.  Location is perfect for shopping, West End, Leicester Square and easy to get taxi’s.",5,2024,02,19
140,Another superb stay,"This hotel is without a doubt the best hotel in London, location and staff are all excellent.

The club lounge takes it to another level and would definitely recommend getting a room or suite that comes with this perk.

We were celebrating my wife’s 50th and the hotel went out of there way to make it special even with the staff in the lounge singing happy birthday, it’s the small touches that make it.

Thank you again everyone at the Langham, hope to see you again soon",5,2024,02,19
140,Amazing Service,"Simply amazing on every conceivable level! Staff cannot do enough to make your stay as wonderful as possible.

140,Excellent stay,"Classy hotel in a beautiful building. Top location with access to all part of London. the staf is very good with a great attention for detail and service. Elegant lobby. Very nice room in a style that suits the hotel. The spa facilities are very good.

One of the best hotels to stay.",5,2024,02,14
140,"Location, comfort and pure bliss","One of my favourite hotels in London.  Think this was my 8th stay in just over 2 years.  This trip I booked an average sized room, as I was staying for 2 weeks.  Room for me was nice size, but was a bit small when my husband arrived.  I wanted a room with  bath.  Also I prefer the regency side as you feel like you are staying in an apartment as apposed to a hotel. Has its own private entrance.  
Hotel is well looked after.  Was there over Xmas and new year.  I didn’t book breakfast at all.  
The location is perfect, on regent, close to Oxford, Bond Street and tube station.  
All the staff were friendly and most helpful.
My only thing I noted was, turn down was rather inconsistent and a few minor housekeeping things left behind.  
The welcome gifts of fruit, and biscuits always a nice touch. .  Xmas received a beautiful chocolate ball, which I took home in my luggage.  
Had my birthday in London which I did mention, but clearly that was forgotten.
Otherwise a lovely stay.  
Highly recommend.",5,2024,02,12
140,Another wonderful stay. The Langham never let's us down.,"Another wonderful stay. The Langham never let's us down. The room was super comfortable, specially the bed and pillows, great in-room facilities inc a Nespresso machine and pods. Really well looked after. the additional benefit of having The Wigmore next door, accessible through the hotel. We only had breakfast here and it was of the highest quality.",5,2024,02,11
140,Review by Gabriel Cohen,I feel really at home when I stay in the Langham hotel. It’s always a pleasure. Great service and amazing staff. Beautiful hotel with amazing bar (best in the world) . Really best service I ever had in hotels ,5,2024,02,10

From the arrival until departure, reception team (especially Mrs. Fani) doormen team, cleaning ladies, all makes your stay a memorable one! Beautiful and very clean rooms, big bathroom, delicious breakfast and dinner worth trying at Palm Court restaurant.
The location of the hotel is the best ever, Regent Street and heart of Marylebone.
Definitely my stay always, when in London, and I recommend Langham Hotel to anyone who loves to be pampered and respected!",5,2024,02,07
140,Faultless Stay,"We planned a three night stay for my husbands birthday. We have previously stayed in this hotel on a busy trip with our grandson to London so we were keen to return and enjoy the club lounge and have a more relaxing stay. The hotel delivered in spades. Our stay was truly faultless. Our room was upgraded to an one bedroom suite, which was so luxurious. Little touches like house keeping giving us more of the things we used… like coffee and water before we asked for them. They were delightfully proactive. The rooms were spotless and turndown was very comprehensive. Every member of staff we dealt with were charming and efficient. The club lounge was wonderful. Delicious breakfasts are served until 12 and then afternoon tea and later canapés. Champagne is available as are cocktails and wine. We also tried the Artesian Bar cocktails. Very inventive and a different vibe. The director of rooms, Benjamin, was in particular worthy of a mention.  He checked in with us on several occasions and his gifts for my husbands birthday were very much appreciated.  Thank you to everyone, we will be busy booking stay number three later tonight!",5,2024,02,02
140,Luxury birthday stay.,"We stayed here for three nights for my wife's birthday.  I booked a deluxe room but was kindly upgraded.  I'm not quite sure what the upgrade was too because the next room up is an executive room but we weren't given access to the Club lounge that goes with that (unless that wasn't part of the upgrade, which would be fair enough). But is was certainly a large and lovely room with a double aspect including views towards the BBC on one side. The room also had a separate roll top bath, which we made liberal use of, There was a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the room when we arrived, which was extremely nice of them. Staff were polite and professional, especially the lady who checked us in and personally took us to our room. I have to complement the cleaning and maintenance staff because the place looked immaculate. I certainly can't think of a reason why we wouldn't book here again.",5,2024,02,01
140,The agony of choice for a landmark birthday,"Being an avid fan of the Landmark Hotel it was an agonising choice to have my wife’s 65th Birthday at a new location, but how right the decision of the Langham was.

Booked an executive room giving access to Langham Club, on arrival our room was upgraded to a suite and what a suite, it was a one bedroom house and immaculate in every aspect.

Given the age of the hotel 159 this year, everywhere looks like the builder’s handed the keys over yesterday, not a scuff, scratch or dust anywhere, taps blinding in their brilliance, this hotel is loved by its staff obviously who go the extra mile.

The staff from arrival, to reception and on to the Langham Club, all smiles and eager to ensure your stay is magical, never before have we felt so wanted at an hotel. To pick one out would be unfair as they were all brilliant.

Having travelled extensively for over 45 years to many countries never have been greeted and treated so well and without doubt never have we stayed in a hotel so spotless and warm.

Thank you everyone from reservations to senior management for making this landmark birthday unforgettable.",5,2024,01,29
140,Good location,"Good sized rooms, with large bathrooms.  Some of the rooms have showers only, so ask for a room with a bath if required.  We had a room on the 8th floor with great views over London.  Oxford Circus tube station is only a 5/10 minutes walk away.  Regents street and Oxford street about 5/10 minutes walk also.  A discretionary service charge of 5% is applied to your room per night on check out.",4,2024,01,28
140,Exceptional Service,"On arrival, the staff at reception desk was very friendly and welcoming.

We were delighted to be able to access our room on arrival and enjoy a late breakfast.

All staff were welcoming and remembered us from previous trips",5,2024,01,23
140,Attention to detail,Everyone is so attentive to your every desire! Love the attention in all areas of hotel. Love the location of this hotel literally 20 minute walk to everywhere. Especially love the heated pool! Room was beautiful as well very clean not a mark on the walls!,5,2024,01,21
140,Beautiful hotel but service lacking,"My family and I booked our much anticipated staycation at The Langham hotel almost a year ago! Needless to say we were really looking forward this post-Xmas indulgence. Having paid over £2000 for a 3 night stay, understandably our expectations were pretty high. However, sadly our overall experience was disappointing. 

This started with the poor check-in experience. Having booked a room with Langham Club access, the receptionist, although polite, instructed us to go up to the lounge to check-in. We were not accompanied nor was assistance offered, so we had no idea where we were we going! The hotel is large and it took some time to finally find the lounge. Upon entering, the only member of staff at the welcome desk was on the phone. She ushered to us to take a seat somewhere in the lounge. We sat there waiting for about 25 minutes, before the lady finally came over. She said that our room wasn't ready, even though, at the hotels request I'd emailed ahead to let them know what time we'd be arriving (1pm). It wasn't until two hours later that we were permitted to go to our room. 

One of the great perks of the stay was the club lounge. However, on more than one occasion we were waiting for a long time before a waiter approached to take our order. I even walked out of the lounge one afternoon after waiting for a drink which I'd ordered but never arrived. The waiter had obviously forgotten the order, only to notice the same member of staff refilling an American couples champagne glasses who were perched at the bar. Unfortunately, inconsistent and seemingly preferential service by waiting staff towards some of the guests was a noticeable feature of the stay. Perhaps, this is a reflection of an all too indiscreet policy for 'VIPs' or as a result of additional tipping by some guests, we're not sure but it was quite uncomfortable to witness and left us with a bad taste in our mouths. 

Mid way through our trip after a long, cold day hitting the shops, we thought we'd treat ourselves to some hot chocolate from the in-dining menu. I asked the staff member whether they could add some cream and marshmallows to my daughter's drink, only to be told that they weren't sure if this was possible.. I was so surprised by this response! Having been fortunate to stay at some fabulous hotels within the same price bracket, a request like this would normally be a total walk in the park! Such a small thing really, but it's these kind of little details which you would reasonably expect that the Langham falls down on. 

On our final morning, we had a knock on the door 30 minutes before check-out time, it was the housekeeping supervisor asking us when we were leaving. Perhaps noticing my surprise at this lack of discretion, she then quickly followed-up with asking whether we needed any help with our bags. I accepted, however 20 minutes later and still no porter, we decided we'd been forgotten about again and dragged our own bags down to reception. 

There is no doubt that the Langham hotel is totally beautiful but the service was so disappointing for a hotel at this price point. When you holiday in your home town it really needs to exceptional to make the financial outlay worthwhile! In conclusion, we don't think we'll be returning, which is a shame as we would have liked to have added the Langham to our yearly staycations. However, based on our experience, we have decided that there are much more exemplary London hotel options available for the money.",3,2024,01,18
140,"Wonderful stay & staff, food needs to be improved.","I’ve stayed at most of the luxury hotels in London and wanted to give the Langham a try. The lobby is beautiful and hotel Staff could not have been be nicer from the doorman to the front desk, Concierge and housekeeping, everyone was accommodating and always had a smile on their face. 
I give a shout out to Sophia at the front desk the evening of the 11th when I arrived, who saw it was my birthday and immediately provided lovely amenities to the room and upgraded me. Same for the Greek gentleman in the artesian bar who knew it was my birthday on Friday evening and provided a small cake with a candle for me and my guests,  again I say the whole staff were wonderful. 
The downside? I ordered in room dining for my late night arrival, room, service breakfast and breakfast in the Palm Court. The food needs to be improved significantly. Nothing special, nothing great. 
The room was nothing special for the grade, the furniture seem to be old and reused pre-renovation. The bathroom shower had  limited water pressure. 
The location is wonderful, near Piccadilly, Region St., Oxford Street the tube. Wonderful location. 
The only caveat was the food in the hotel needs to be improved significantly.",4,2024,01,15
140,The perfect stay,"Our stay at The Langham exceeded our expectations. All the staff were very helpful, our executive room was very comfortable, had great views and was made even more special with the access to the club lounge on the third floor. This is a very special hotel and we will be back for sure",5,2024,01,15
140,Memorable Celebratory Stay,"First class stay, impeccable service, and nothing was too much trouble.
We had a suite with butler service and access to the Club Lounge with superb complimentary food and champagne.
My wife’s birthday was celebrated with surprise champagne, fruit, cake and chocolates delivered to the room.",5,2024,01,15
140,Memorable Stay & Tonic for January Blues,"I highly recommend The Langham, London, my favourite hotel in London, for a memorable experience.   The hotel, itself, is exquisite.  The facilities are first class.  The food and beverages are divine.  

The most important aspect of the hotel is the staff!  Without them, the Langham would not be as special as it is.  They work cohesively as a team, appear genuinely happy and proud to work for The Langham and treat all guests with dignity and respect.

Whenever I have stayed at The Langham,  I have had the privilege to access to The Langham Club.  The staff in the club are wonderful people.  They work extremely hard, but are always professional,  warm, welcoming, and attentive.  They assess the needs of their guests and go out of their way to meet them.  It seems to me, it is more than their desire to fulfill their duties, but their genuine fondess of people, their compassion, and warmth.

I highly recommend The Langham, London, for anyone who desires a luxurious break.  The service is exemplary, all the staff, especially those in The Langham Club, make guests feel valued, welcomed, and appreciated.",5,2024,01,13
140,Great service,"Langham is a fabulous hotel with amazing facilities and staff who create a lovely atmosphere.

It’s in a great location and the building is beautiful, lunch in palm court was delicious and the bar is a great place for a late night glass of wine.  ",5,2024,01,12
140,Great hotel,"Fabulous true 5 star hotel. The bed was sumptuous and I wanted to steal the
Pillows. The breakfast was on another level. The breakfast was £40 per head but highly recommend. Great staff - especially Mohammed the night porter.",5,2024,01,12
140,Just lovely,Another amazing overnight stay at the Langham.  The whole place has a wonderful calm and is just a great place to spend time.  Laurence at reception was fabulous with a very welcome which was an early taste of the warmth of the staff throughout the stay.,5,2024,01,11
140,Anniversary visit to London,"We have stayed at the Langham on quite a few occasions over the past few years. It is our automatic go to when we visit London. The reason i say this is because the Hotel is top class. From the moment you arrive and welcomed by the front of house porter to checking in at reception you already are made to feel special. The rooms are classy maid service as good as anywhere. We had afternoon tea, along with the sandwiches, cakes and champagne  very good and the service excellent. We experienced their cocktail bar which is a lovely experience and their bar food very different and tasty it has a nice vibe. We also had a spa treatment, again treated special and the massage was as good as we have had elsewhere and we have had many at various places. One evening we decided to eat in room and this service was a nice touch, the food excellent and they provided everything to support the food including tooth picks and nice condiments.",5,2024,01,10
140,Superior stay,"In London to assist daughter who is studying abroad. We had a delightful stay at Langham.
Staff was friendly and helpful. As an upper end hotel we were quite satisfied and our one BR suite that was great. Although we did get an upgrade through Am Express. Definitely would stay here again.
",5,2024,01,08
140,Making Christmas Special,"Our 7-day stay at the Langham over Christmas was wonderful. The staff was amazing, always responsive, always helpful, and caring. This was not just a stay at a nice hotel with great service, it was a family event that followed 8 years of no holidays and the death of my wife's mother. We looked at going to Brussels, Paris, and London. Having been with AMX Centurion for many years and seeing their recommendation for the Langham, we made the decision to book a junior suite and an executive room. But after speaking with Alex, the day manager, we moved the reservations to the Terrace and Regent Suites. When we arrived, they we fully decorated for Christmas, with Christmas trees and other decorations. On Christmas eve, our butler arrived with mike and cookies for Santa and a carrot for Rudolf. What all this means is that the actions and support of the hotel staff made Christmas for us. As you would know, driving repeat and referral business comes largely from people internalizing their stay, thus creating a connection with the Langham that becomes dear to them, often a result of experiencing unexpected value that is the manifestation of true staff caring. We now have such a connection and will be making our Christmas stay at the Langham a yearly family tradition!   ",5,2024,01,05
140,Probably stay elsewhere next time,"Glad I tried the Langham, but I'd rather stay elsewhere next time if coming during the holidays or for a trip longer than 2-3 days.
Positives - high quality finishings and a bunch of nice freebies for the kids around the holidays.
Negatives - it is an old building so had issues like toilet wouldn't flush well plus elevators are very small, I could hear brief dragging noises in middle of night/ early morning everyday, same breakfast variety every day even over the holidays week which got boring. Staff are ok but noone stood out or was super friendly. Surrounding area is too busy with people and traffic during holidays.",3,2024,01,03
140,London Finest,"What a great stay !! Excellence at every turn .. service standards as they should be. the door staff couldn't have done more upon arrival, check in staff super friendly and fast .. rooms clean and comfortable .. what more could you want from a hotel !! ",5,2024,01,01
140,New Year’s Eve visit,"We came back after last years Xmas visit to celebrate New Years Eve 
We chose to upgrade to Executive level and enjoyed the experience 
The room was superb, clean and the bathroom very nice and well fitted
The overall service was excellent 
We chose the Palm Court for NYE dinner 
It was nice although an unusual menu which we found limiting 
They also wanted to charge for moving to the Artisan Bar to see in new year which we thought was a little “off”
However we really enjoyed our time here and will return",5,2024,01,01
140,Night at the Langham,"My wife and I stayed at the Langham on the 30th December 23 for one night to celebrate her birthday. The Langham didn't disappoint with a wonderful nights sleep, amazing food and attention to detail from the moment when  you arrive. 

The Artesian cocktail bar is a must as tasted the
Best cocktails we have ever been served. This is the same as the Langham Full breakfast. Wow wonderful!!

Thank you to all the staff at the hotel and we will for sure see you again very soon.",5,2024,01,01
140,Maintenance lacking and age showing.,"Been coming to the London Langham for 10 years at least, sometimes more than once a year. 
The upkeep and maintenance of the hotel and the rooms seems to be again and not getting maintained as once was. 
For me this is the best location to stay in London as well as a great hotel in general, however cracks are starting to appear. ",3,2023,12,31
140,A worthy treat.,"The most amazing experience - from the engaging, friendly and helpful staff to the actual grandeur of the building itself.  What a fantastic place to stay.  The entire hotel is absolutely pristine, the decor fits the classic design without being outdated, it is a wonderful grand dame of a hotel.  We did have breakfast which was beautifully presented, tasted lovely and arrived quickly as there is a lot of staff available to serve.  We were so enamoured with our stay that we've booked to stay again in February - you only live once and you are worth it!",5,2023,12,31
140,TERRIBLE stay at Langham. Housekeeping & service are appalling,"The stay was very disappointing especially housekeeping and service, which is really unacceptable esp for Langham.

The moment we arrived, it was BAD. There were some miscommunication but i have to commend Rodrigo for trying his best to accomodate and provided a room for us to freshen up as we arrived early. That is very thoughtful. However the rest of the front desk (filippino male and asian female) were very unwelcoming and made us feel very uncomfortable.

When our room was l ready at 3:30PM, towels and hand wash gel were missing. We called housekeeping and they only brought up 2 towels and no hand wash. We had no hand wash gel through the entire stay (almost a week), in the end we had to buy our own from the pharmacy. Tissue boxes as well.

Housekeeping was extremely poor everyday. Tissue paper box was not refilled. Coffee cups just left out after we used them for days. Stains on the table were not cleaned. They reused the same hand towels we threw out (marking on the same spot). The still water provided in the room is just filtered water in a reusable bottle, which is quite disgusting. I have never stayed in a hotel that didnt provide water in sealed bottles. The thought of them pouring water into these reusable bottles and supplying them to all guests just makes me cringe. 

The porter and bellboy service were the slowest i have ever encountered. We waited over 20mins for our luggage to be sent up and we desperately wanted to freshen up after our flight. Upon checking out the porter also took over 15mins to come take our luggages down and we had to leave for the airport soon, our car was already waiting for us. We decided to take them down ourselves and bumped into them after their smoke break.

The room itself was a little dated despite being refurbished. They are trying to preserve the heritage of the building so this cannot be helped. There are no usb points and the power point locations are a bit inconvenient in the room. I was also informed by reception that my specific executive room has no mirror, but it does in fact have a mirror behind the toilet door. I find it very odd that a 5* establishment such as Langham do not train their staff properly and aren’t familiar with their rooms.

Only positives are Rodrigo at front desk and the langham club.

Tip, just pay a little more to pay to stay at Claridge’s which is just around the corner. A million times better service and housekeeping is superb. 

The entire experience at Langham was appalling. Worst hotel we have ever stayed at… hygiene standard is non existent and with covid still going around, i prefer staying somewhere cleaner and more meticulous. Service is also terrible for a 5* establishment.",1,2023,12,29
140,Family trip for Christmas,"Unfortunately the hotel Wi-Fi connection was very poor during our stay. As a  family with a one year old baby, we brought along with us a Nanit baby monitor so we could keep an eye on our child whilst he was sleeping in the evening so that we could experience the hotel’s restaurants. The Wi-Fi connection was very poor and the Nanit wasn’t working which resulted in all the family being unable to leave our rooms for the 3 evenings we were staying there. 
",3,2023,12,28
140,Great 4 days in London,"Terrific location, and service all around. We booked through Amex FHR and the extra amenities were excellent. The food at the Wigmore and Palm were both excellent with plenty of healthy and vegetarian options. ",5,2023,12,26
140,Great value.,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. A little worn and tends to have a fair amount of families with kids. 
This stay was marred by one of the two elevators out of service the entire stay. A real problem in such a large busy hotel. Got a LOT of stairs in during our stay. ",4,2023,12,25
140,Probably the best hotel experience in London. ,"Luxurious hotel, absolutely first class staff, amazing food - what a wonderful experience. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Langham!  Slept like logs, and were treated like royalty. They even treated our Yorkshire Terrier like a guest. Oh, and the Club - well worth the visit. Fabulous!!!",5,2023,12,25
140,"Lovely hotel, but maintenance is slipping","This is a lovely hotel in a great location, and I've stayed here a couple of times over the last 5 years, but maintenance is slipping:  2 of the 4 elevators were broken the entire week I was there resulting in long waits.  A bunch of little things in the room (drains not working, toilet not flushing well, leaky shower stall, broken curtain mechanisms, etc.",4,2023,12,24
140,Best hotel in London.," You must go to experience out of this world first class hotel and service. It’s like walking into a dream you never want to wake up from. Staff exceptional. Rooms to die for and food heavenly. Definitely will be returning. ",5,2023,12,22
140,Langham hotel a home away from home,"Very nice hotel. Not too far of a walk to Oxford Street and shopping. Enjoyed the welcoming and friendly attitude of the front door service, reception staff and the room service. Rooms are fairly small but lean and up kept very well!  Will stay here again. I know it is pricey but it is Langham at the end of the day!  Loved our time in London overall!",5,2023,12,22
140,mid week birthday stay at the langham,"We could not fault the service, staff and food at the Langham. Everything at the hotel was immaculate. The room we booked allowed access to the langham club lounge which i would highly recommend. We cant wait to return next year",5,2023,12,22
140,"Lovely hotel, but stay spoilt by being woken up by loud bedroom door bangs as guests came and went","Would recommend this hotel for dining and for meetings, but not for staying over. Despite the lovely overall feel, not getting a good night's sleep due to being woken early-doors after a heavy Christmas party evening, followed by stumping up £450 for the (lack of) pleasure of it, doesn't gel with me. I have stayed in much quieter places and had much better nights' sleep in most other hotels I've stayed in. Sadly I will not be going back.",3,2023,12,20
140,Staying at the Langham made our London holiday that more enjoyable.,"We spend a lovely four days at the Langham. From the time we checked in we felt at home with reception trying to accommodate our wishes of an early check-in and walk-in shower. Many thanks to housekeeping for managing this at such short notice.
The Langham is situated at walking distance from several musea like the National Gallery and the Wallace collection. And the best restaurants in town with several Michelin star restaurants around the corner. Kamel the concierge (for those on the continent and beyond, Kamel's mother tongue is French) was so very helpful in booking tables for the two of us: even after three days he finally managed to get us in a top-rated Indian restaurent which would have been impossible otherwise. ",5,2023,12,20
140,AMAZING Experience!,"
As a blind and disabled customer from the minute Stuart greeted me and ensured I was seated safely before my friends arrived I felt looked after and ready for a brilliant evening. Whilst I could not see anything in the room the ambience and reception just felt good. Nothing was to much trouble, Stuart was polite, knowledgable, friendly, and endearing and his banter was funny whilst always remaining professional. The drinks arrived and the fun began. The food was amazing, I do not really do spicy food but all the the flavours danced on my tongue invitingly. The Myriad of side dishes were plentiful and we embraced Chef Dom's attention as he sat with us where we complimented him and grilled him on his experience. We are proud of him as if he was a brother, may you continue to ride high and show the world your unbelievable culinary skills. We love that you are a ""Sarf Londer"" and working at such a prestigious place clearing isn't changing you. Good luck our friend, we will continue to be inspired by you and follow you on your journey.",5,2023,12,19
140,Unforgettable experience!!,"We travelled to London from the Midlands and booked The good Front Room at the Langham.. The food was amazing however during our meal my Mother in Law was poorly and an ambulance was called which was very unexpected. The staff were very calm and called the paramedics they were empathetic, understanding, caring and respectful,  a huge thank you to  Kajaal and Vani the security team who rang a couple of days after to check up how my Mother in law was. Sam the hostess who went off duty but  something had happened and came back to check in. 
All in all although we had a scare, the evening was beautiful!  the restaurant, service and staff were very impressive. The hotel was decorated beautifully. We will definitely be revisiting the Langham and will make sure that we thank the staff for their amazing service personally. Merry Christmas  to Good Front Room at the  Langham 🩷",5,2023,12,15
140,It’s only the Langham,"This was the third trip to the hotel. We were celebrating our 55. wedding anniversary. The  hotel is beautiful and is the rooms are spacious .

The location is also wonderful  and taxis are easily available. We stayed in several hotels in London but always favor the Langham.

140,Fabulous!,"I would return to The Langham again and again. The decorations for Christmas were wonderful. The hotel is elegant yet homely, spotlessly clean and faultlessly managed. The staff are wonderful - from the doormen to the reception to the concierge to the housekeepers to the bar & restaurant team. Nothing is too much trouble - they are professional, efficient and charming. A special thank you to Rodrigo on reception. This is a world class hotel and my favourite in London. ",5,2023,12,14
140,"Fabulous luxury hotel, fabulous West End location, exceptional food, service & concierge facilities!","Whilst not specifically a ""boutique"" hotel, The Langham London, although sizable in the number of rooms and suites, has a luxury feel in every aspect. Overall everything was excellent and truly exceptional during out ten day stay. Beyond my expectations, yet more importantly, beyond my wife's expectations.

Beginning with our hotel concierge arranged  pickup at Heathrow airport and transfer to the hotel. I'm glad I made the choice to do so, as we had traveled to The Balmoral in Edinburgh Scotland, then stayed and attended a Scottish friend's wedding in Inverness in a manor Castle no less. All that before heading to London. My wife who has mobility and health issues and I were traveling with four large suitcases we had overfilled and added to along the way, as well as with sizable hand luggage, all of which the driver skillfully managed to get into the Range Rover. A better elevated view on the way into London too.

With our baggage delivered to the room and shortly after settling in were able to get seated straight away at the Palm Court for dinner. It turned out to be a wonderful beginning to our stay at The Langham London. We met Fliton who really provided attentive help and guidance to my wife as to the most suitable meal choices that she could eat. His assistance and knowledge provided me with insights into not only the menu but the wine offerings which whilst not comprehensive were among the best of their respective categories. The house label French red was perfect paired with the lamb.

We retired to our room, which was beautifully appointed along with a nice range of tasteful amenities and with a clear view looking towards the center of the city and then across to The Shard. The beds were divine and we slept very well. The bathroom was nicely appointed too and spacious. Everything we needed was provided or offered. The room was quiet and restful.

Fliton made our first night for dinner with my wife at the Palm Court so pleasant, that it was a pleasure to repeat  dinner there during our stay and every day I ate there for breakfast. As busy as they were the staff were always pleasant and engaging. They went out of their way to assist me with my wife's breakfast needs of croissants, lots of butter, raspberry / strawberry jams and bottled water, which I would take back to her in the room.

After Fliton departed on a well-deserved vacation, Stefano's personal touch in the Palm Court daily, helped us to continue building the relationship that began with Fliton, for the remainder of our stay. Stefano is a seasoned professional, like Fliton also very personable, yet also an obvious leader with staff in the Palm Court dining room. He successfully managed a very busy team, serving customers with high expectations.

The concierge staff were extraordinarily helpful too. Apart from hauling our luggage up to and down from our room. They offered and arranged a number of things we wanted to do beyond my already planned events and bookings. A day trip to the Cotswolds and Oxford was one such event worth the added cost. That being a luxury car, driver and guide.

It was so nice just to get out of the city to experience the beauty and history of the English countryside beyond London proper. The activity was seamless and the experience very rewarding despite my wife's limited mobility. We ate fish and chips in a pub in a small village in the Cotswolds. We enjoyed wandering around Oxford and other village shops and various churches, TV shows and film locations amongst other things. A great day out as it were.

The Langham London is in a tremendous location, where you can simply step out onto the street and walk to high end shopping, name brand stores, department stores, restaurants, bars or simple pharmacies. Taxis were useful from the hotel for getting to Covent Garden, Harrods or the plays and shows we saw whilst in London. Shows like Mama Mia, Harry Potter & The Cursed Child, Abba Voyage, and the Rocky Horror Show were all within quick reach by taxi from the hotel.

The neighborhoods and parks around The Langham were fun to walk. Whilst most of the excellent fancy restaurants I booked required a taxi ride, some were within easy walking distance of the hotel like the famous Golden Hind in Marylebone which was so good we went two nights in a row, for their unbelievably good fish and chips. I highly recommend you book any activities, shows or restaurants well in advance, like months in advance.

I'm overdue in writing this The Langham review on Trip Advisor. I still recall this stay as a most memorable and one I'd like to repeat because of the hospitality and service we had was exceptional and second to none. In fact we met a couple who changed from their regular stays at the well-known Browns boutique hotel, to staying at The Langham London, which they said liked much better, because of the quality of the hotel, service and amenities. There are so many magnificent luxurious hotels in London. Whilst we could have stayed at many of them, I am grateful for having chosen and having had the privilege and opportunity to experience The Langham London and the staff there. It is truly a wonderful place to stay in London.",5,2023,12,13
140,Birthday weekend,Wonderful weekend away staying at the Langham which was a treat as always. I can’t fault the hotel other than the fact that one night wasn’t long enough! The staff are so helpful and the service is always above and beyond what you would expect. ,5,2023,12,12
140,Wonderful Holiday experience,"The London Langham was beyond our expectations.  The staff, the hotel, the room were superior to any we have experienced and we are well travelled.  The 6 nights were perfect for our winter holiday.  The lounge was worth the upgraded room and welcoming after a long day. We will be back.  ",5,2023,12,12
140,"A wonderful, luxurious ""home"" in London - get to know the staff - they are just beyond ...","My husband and I have stayed at The Langham several times prior to the pandemic, and hadn't been back to the UK until just recently.  

We have always really enjoyed The Langham for their rooms, location, staff, etc., this trip was something pretty special, and a real stand out.

Without boring you with all of the details, I would highlight a few things:
- the staff are all there to help you, and they are incredibly good at it,  there really isn't anything they can't make happen
- the concierge team is the best I have ever worked with.  They just get everything done, work seamlessly together and are so on top of everything.  Whether it is airport transfers, special tours, restaurant bookings, you name it - they are truly the glue that keeps everything together at the hotel
- the bell men are wonderful - Ian and Ray are particular stand outs - but you can always be assured of a warm greeting and very capable help from the team
- the rooms are lovely.   They are small for us North American's, but standard size for UK and European hotel rooms
- the front desk staff, the operations staff,  housekeeping are always happy to help - whether it is getting your shoes shined, getting something sorted in the room - they are there
- Most importantly, if there are any issues, they respond immediately, ensuring satisfaction - so no worries about hiccups or being frustrated - which can happen even in the nicest of hotels",5,2023,12,11
140,Family time in London 2023,"We had a lovely stay at the Langham and would highly recommend this hotel. The location just a few minutes stroll from Oxford Circus. 
The hotel was so festive and the trees are stunning.
We had executive rooms with access to the Langham Club which is worth upgrading too. It is a quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of London.  The bedroom was amazing and so comfortable. 
Breakfast, afternoon tea along with evening refreshments were amazing. Staff are so attentive and friendly, although the club was busy the service was still exemplary.
We decided to drive to London and have valet parking which again was seamless and a great service. 
When I originally booked we were staying for three nights but shortly after an offer came out where you got the fourth night free. After e-mail communication this offer was added and so we a four night stay. Just amazing service from start to finish. From check in when our room was not ready as we were early, the club room was offered and also offered breakfast as it was still being served. 
Every member of staff we met always said hello and asked how we were, it makes a difference.
Thank you",5,2023,12,11
140,The top langham london,"The langham Hotel is a destination that I can't keep away from for long..its always the people factor that took my attention.  Starting with the great Ahmed from reservation whom cater my requirement prior to arrival then the warm welcome by the concierge team, Mansoor, Naseem & Eian.  Then the swift check in process by Thomas. The rooms are spacious and the condition of the furniture is excellent.  Cleaning service and turn down is amazing..my room was continuously refreshed. Location is prime and close to almost every attraction.",5,2023,12,04
140,Simply a dream experience ,"We could not have been looked after any better by staff whether in our room, dining or in the spa. Such a memorable experience in a beautiful hotel with immaculate staff, a luxurious room and superb dining at Palm Court. Cannot thank the team enough for looking after us and showing so much thought and care",5,2023,12,04
140,Berry Christmas Party,"The venue was fabulous, and the staff very attentive and helpful. The location is perfect, and the hotel has a wonderful Christmas atmosphere! The room décor are beautiful, and the rooms are amazingly quiet....We will be going back.  ",5,2023,12,04
140,Flawless ,"Our recent 4 night stay at The Langham was quite exceptional.  Upon arrival from our overseas flight, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite through our American Express Fine Hotels reservation. We are fortunate to stay at only the finest hotels when traveling. This hotel did not miss any detail and is on top of their game. We had access to The Club which was excellent in every way. I cannot single out any employees as they were all extremely professional, helpful and friendly. The location of this hotel is an excellent launching point for shopping and other activities. I typically stay at other hotels for comparison purposes when traveling back to cities but The Langham has definitely won my loyalty for future stays in London. ",5,2023,12,02
140,Disappointing and overrated,"I stayed here for 5 nights in November ad this was my second time staying at The Langham.Overall a disappointing stay:
- Staff were attentive but lacked warmth.
- I rarely got acknowledged by the team at the main door - not a good morning, good evening - I was invisible.
- The room was very small even by London Standards. When I ordered room service, the waiter could not actually fit the trolley in the room without moving the bed and desk!  The trolley took up most of the space in the room but was not collected until the next by housekeeping, despite multiple requests after the meal.
- The bathroom - again tiny with an odd double leaf 'mini door' - the show / bath itself was very high and required a very flexible 'climb over and into' the bath / shower - which itself was very small - like a caravan / RV. Finally the water pressure was vey poor and height of the shower head was too low like a comedy show - more like a B&B than a five star hotel.
- The Wigmore was the saving grace - excellent friendly and attentive service.",2,2023,11,29
140,Simply a Must if Visiting London!,"We return time after time due to the quality of amenities, comfort of bedrooms and attentiveness of staff. This hotel is simply wonderful and a real home from home.
The Club Lounge is so comfortable and the staff cater to every taste, nothing is too much trouble.
A must if visiting London!",5,2023,11,29
140,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"Wonderful experience for afternoon tea in Palm Court. Delicious selection of foods, Ginger cocktails & Pink Champagne. Service was excellent.
Icing on the cake was in house Pianist, who played all of our requests which made our visit perfect. He really got us in the festive mood. 
My sons birthday and was blown away. 
A truly memorable time and we shall return.
Many thanks 🙏🏽💯👌🏽",5,2023,11,29
140,Losing its charm and overall attraction,"A favourite for many years, we have always returned to the Langham as our first choice for London stays. 

Sadly on this most recent visit the whole place has changed sadly, apart from the always very pleasant staff. 

Most significantly the Club Lounge is a far cry from past years. The food was once a feast of choices, including soup, pasta dishes, selection of various cheeses etc. desserts always so nicely presented and in all cases, dishes were constantly replenished. 

Sadly now, limited choices without replenishment. Small salad with maybe some dips, two cheeses, one bread selection. Really not inviting at all. 

The staff remain friendly and efficient thank goodness but the whole fun and ambience of the lounge is lost. 

We took a Junior Suite and were allocated a room that was not in line with our on file preferences. After a long journey we accepted the room but had a sleepless night due to constant hum of traffic outside the third floor, front facing windows. 

The management swiftly and efficiently moved us to the a superior suite, which whilst very nice, had its own issues. 

The rooms were very cold and without heating. In particular the bathroom. The team were quick to attend and over 24 hours the situation improved, albeit we needed a heater in the lounge area. 

Having turned off the bedroom aircon the system was continuing to make a noise. We were told that this was a common problem throughout the hotel and that many guests complained about it but that nothing could be done. Hardly five star. 

Seriously think that the whole heating and aircon system needs a revamp and modernisation. 

In room dining was simply poor. We tried breakfast on two occasions and both were a disaster. Basically inedible food served on first attempt and the second, we kept dimple, soft boiled eggs and toast. We were given. Hard boiled eggs and cold toast and asked to pay £90 for this! 

By the way, herring to breakfast in Palm Court very difficult at weekends. 15 minutes wait. Not that good in any event, Club Lounge better. 

Not a great experience sadly. 

Special mention to Mila our Butler who was amazing and made our stay all the better for her excellent manner and service.",3,2023,11,28
140,Room for reward,"Experience was amazing, staff, and everyone concerned with the Hotel were very helpful, from arriving to leaving. Would recommend to anyone who intended having a trip to London, cocktail bar, and the restaurant were 1st class.",5,2023,11,28
140,Delightful stay,"We had a very relaxing and wonderful time at the hotel during our Thanksgiving vacation. Amazing property with amazing team (reservation, concierge, front desk, bell desk, doormen, restaurant's hostesses, cleaning crew)  made our stay a pleasant experience. Our flight was delayed by 12 hours, but once we arrived at the hotel, all the stress went away. Our most anticipated time to come back to our hotel after a day of sightseeing. We miss our hotel already. Thank you for our memorable journey!",5,2023,11,26
140,Great Stay at the Langham,"We stayed at the Langham the last week in August 2023.  We had an amazing time and would recommend.  The property is impeccable, and our room was spacious, comfortable and elegant.  But the staff and service were what really makes the hotel stand out.   Every staff member we interacted with was great.  The location is perfect as well in central London.  We can't wait to stay here again.

140,The Club Room at the Langham ,"The hotel staff are really helpful and always great you with a warm hello The Staff in the Club Room go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and nothing is a problem for them i went there to visit some friends who where staying at the hotel, a special thank you to Ivan, Hoy and Gee from the Club room for a nice evening  and Rodrigo the reception supervisor for the little gifts for my friends.",5,2023,11,25
140,Prestigious but missing something …,"Excellence without any faux pas except maybe … the decor of the dining room which seemed very ostentatious when you compare to the sobriety of the overall place.
Spa and pool in the middle of the city very much appreciated.
Breakfast offers a very wild range of options, excellent.",5,2023,11,24
140,Amazing hotel in London!,"I recently stayed for the weekend on a business trip at the Langham in London, and was very pleasantly surprised. I stayed there years ago and the hotel has clearly been modernized and remodeled. It retains its traditional style but now is beautifully appointed with modern technology and look and feel. The room was roomy and comfortable, the front desk, concierge and bell boy service was amazingly helpful and friendly. The fitness room was also great as was the lobby. The location is also great close to all the attractions on the west side of London.",5,2023,11,24
140,Perfect location and beautiful hotel ,"Stunning hotel. Rooms are beautiful. A lot of extras that you would expect at this 5 star hotel. I would recommend the executive rooms as you have the club lounge that has complimentary buffet and all drinks, including free flowing Champagne!! The hotel is a perfect location for shopping trip. Selfridges 15 mins walk. Regent Street shopping 5 mins.",5,2023,11,22
140,Wonderful 60th Birthday Celebration,"From facilitating an early check-in on the Friday at 9.15 am (and an amazing room upgrade!!), all the way through to check-out on the Sunday, the staff provided an excellence of service I have not experienced in my travels throughout over 40 countries. Without exception, every staff member was so friendly, engaging generous and sincere. The Team completely indulged my wife (and me!) on her 60th Birthday celebrations showering her with kind wishes and gifts - making the experience totally memorable!! Amazing.",5,2023,11,22
140,"Excellent stay at the Langham, London","The Langham has a both a great location and top-notch accommodations; but it was the wonderful friendly service that set this London hotel apart.  We especially enjoyed having the Club Lounge amenity available to us and can't say enough positive things about the staff there, especially Melissa and Ivan who were both wonderful.  Highly recommended!",5,2023,11,21
140,Not as good as before,We were in London as part of our 43 wedding anniversary. We love the Langham and have stayed many times before. The spa and swimming pool were excellent. However overall we felt it was not as good as before. The dinner in Pam Court was just ok and the standard of housekeeping was not up to scratch. The Club is great but the food was not quite as good as before. We still loved it with a small but ? ,4,2023,11,21
140,Amazing Hotel.,"The Langham is a special hotel.  The hotel is beautiful.   The ambiance is one of beauty and sophistication, yet it is relaxing.  The rooms and facilities are exquisite.  The quality of beverages and food are superb.  For me, however, the professionalism, generosity of spirit from the staff, their attentiveness, their friendliness, and abity to make guests feel welcomed and valued is the most important aspect.  The values, attitude, and behaviour of the team at The Langham makes it The Langham and make me a returning and extremely grateful returning customer. ",5,2023,11,20
140,Wonderful experience,I had a great experience at The Langham. Everyone is super friendly and make sure you are happy and comfortable during your stay. My room was perfect everyday and every time I walked outside of my room I was greeted and felt welcomed. It was such a great stay. ,5,2023,11,20
140,Excellence as usual at the Langham,"As always the Langham with its signature smell of tuber roses, the elegant marble entrance and the vibrant energy did not disappoint! Every time it just gets better and better. The rooms are magnificent, the staff ever so attentive and the breakfast plentiful!  I still need to find out what oat milk they use- it tastes so creamy and home made! A seemingly small but noticeable detail for me!
We were lucky enough to get a room upgrade to a 1 bed suite which was next level...the bed, the lounge area,the space...all incredible!",5,2023,11,20
140,The best way to say thanks to a dear friend,It beat a trip abroad for a short stay. We were in the heart of London and able to enjoy the very best of the the hotel and do sightseeing with ease. I would definitely stay again with family/friends. ,5,2023,11,12
140,Marvelous hotel,"The Langham has a wonderful old world atmosphere, but is totally modern in every way.  The rooms are comfortable, the staff and food top notch, and the location is fantastic. Concierge service was impeccable. Every one of my needs was met promptly and with tremendous graciousness.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,11,10
140,Wedding Weekend,"We stayed at The Langham over our wedding weekend and extended the stay to include a minimoon.

The stay was flawless – due to the nature of the weekend I contacted the hotel prior to our stay and Nick from the Executive Club Lounge was so accommodating with every request I had.

During our stay the staff were phenomenal – we were quite demanding guests and the answer to everything was “yes”. For example, we had been gifted bottles of Nyetimber for the wedding morning and the Club kindly chilled them for us and sent them up to the room the morning of the wedding. They even stored our wedding cake in the fridge after the wedding.

We had a massage during our stay which was great and made use of all the spa facilities. It is a really relaxing space.

The Club Lounge is excellent. We made full use of it throughout our stay and the staff were so wonderful and friendly. We sat in the lounge, had afternoon tea and opened all of our wedding cards drinking Champagne – a memory I will always treasure.

Thank you The Langham for such a special stay. We can’t wait to return and celebrate our wedding anniversary with your every year.",5,2023,11,09
140,Nice with a price to match,"This is a very nice hotel with a price to match.  Loation is excellent in Marylebone, next to Regent St (shopping) and walkable to many tourist attractions and restaurants.  I was disappointed the room, nearly $1K per night, lacked either a sofa or reading chair (and I can swear one was pictured on the website when I booked).  The decor was new, the place was clean, the service generally good.  On the less-good news side, the bar was consistently crowded enough that I couldn't get in, the room service was expensive (nearly $45 for a very mayonnaisey club sandwich) and they did funny things to make my USB cables pretty that I didn't appreciate.  Leave them cables alone, please!  Overall, I'd come back but be ready to have your checkbook open.",4,2023,11,09
140,Exceptional Service and Luxury,"We have stayed at many of London's top hotels and decided to give the Langham London a try for a milestone birthday celebration.  We expected to find an elegant hotel but were quite amazed by the extremely gracious and warm service from the entire staff.  We booked a suite which was most comfortable and spacious and allowed us access to the Langham Club--located on the 3rd floor of the hotel.  This has to be the most outstanding feature of the property.  This is not your average club lounge with a light continental breakfast and a glass of wine in the evening--this is more like being on a five star cruise ship.  Caviar and smoked salmon was served at breakfast along with your cooked to order meal.  A delightful afternoon tea was on offer and in the evening, the champagne flowed although our servers remembered that we did not drink and made us delightful non-alcoholic cocktails instead.  It was this attention to detail that made the hotel really stand out in a city with many of the world's finest hotels.  If you are looking for a grand hotel in London but one that makes you feel special and appreciated--the Langham London is for you.",5,2023,11,06
140,Exceptional Club Lounge and Suites,"This hotels is one of London’s finest and the Langham Club is outstanding.  The offerings are first class including caviar at breakfast and the staff are welcoming and professional.  The suite was well equipped and spacious with superb housekeeping.

140,Afternoon Tea - The Langham ,"Food (two exceptional Jams) , venue, staff, service, birthday cake and value all exceptional. Was so looking forward to trying this new menu after seeing the Michel Roux Jr You Tube video. A great couple of hours. Luxury and relaxing!",5,2023,11,04
140,Great luxury hotel,"Lovely luxury hotel in Marylebone with comfortable rooms, excellent staff and delightful facilities. Well situated, but out of the more frenzied parts of town.  Book a room that has club privileges, as that really enhances the stay ",5,2023,11,04
140,Weekend stay at the Langham,The hotel is in a nice location. The facility is calm and inviting. The room was large and elegant. The staff was professional and took care of any requests. Breakfast was plentiful and convenient. We would look forward to returning.,5,2023,11,01
140,Exemplary Service from the Langham London’s team!,"The Club at The Langham is exemplary in every way!
With new deluxe hotels opening in London, it’s so important that a hotel excels and draws in the guests.

140,The Best Hotel in London,"Fantastic hotel in the centre of London. 
Service and facilities were outstanding, and the Club Lounge is an excellent place to spend quality time.
Staff were very attentive, polite and professional.
The bedroom was spotless and the Palm Court restaurant is a great place to have breakfast and afternoon tea.",5,2023,10,28
140,Langham is a great place to stay in London,What a beautiful hotel and top service staff. The extra spend is worth the experience. I have no complaints. Me and my wife went to London for her birthday and she said it was the best birthday experience she ever had. ,5,2023,10,26
140,Really Lovely Hotel.,"Beautifully decorated rooms, some of the most comfortable bedding I’ve slept in and lots of nice touches included. The food and drink options are all superb quality and I need to make special mention of the gentleman doormen. It’s apparent that the London Langham is a class above most other hotels. I can’t wait to return.",5,2023,10,24
140,You REALLY have to give The Langham London a try!,"Staying at the glorious The Langham in London, finding the experience everything that we had believed it would be and more. Being met with a smiling front of house staff at the driveway, and then at the reception being greeted by Sophia. Throughout the stay, Sophia and the team attended to every requirement and expectation, and we would HIGHLY recommend to all, to experience a vacation at The Langham Hotel London. ",5,2023,10,18
140,Memorable Stay in London,"We could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Langham. The service was exceptional at every touch point throughout our visit. We were assisted with tuxedo rentals, dinner reservations, transportation and travel planning. We can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,10,17
140,A two night escape,"On our arrival we were greeted by your lovely doorman. He retrieved our bags and our car was parked close by.  
Reception was welcoming and we were taken up to The Langham lounge. A beautiful tranquil place. 
Ivan recognised us from a past visit which was so lovely.  Ivan is curteous, sociable and so very helpful - ‘Professionalism exemplified’. Every Langham should have their own Ivan, if you want an Ambassador then he’s your man!! 

Sunday breakfast in the lounge was very slow, we felt sorry for the Barista who must have been inundated with orders.  Glad to say Monday morning was different. 
With regards to the management of the lounge, look to The Langham New York as the benchmark. 
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for Ivan and Canen 
We will return!!!!",5,2023,10,16
140,Home away from home,"Love staying at The Langham- the scent, the staff, the beautiful room decor.
Attention to detail is fantastic. In-room dining was great quality and served beautifully.
Club lounge service is great, staff are all very friendly.",5,2023,10,13
140,Wonderful experience at the Langham,"We just returned form the Langham and it was a top notch experience.  The room. and bathroom were spacious, the food was very good and the location was ideal for shopping, dining and theater. Other hotels sacrifice something in one of the categories, but that was not the case at the Langham. It was an excellent value.",5,2023,10,10
140,Best Hotel Stay of our European Trip,"Our last stay here was four years ago and we loved it so much we had to come back.  The only problem is that once you stay here, it will spoil you for everywhere else.  We've stayed at several other hotels whilst on this trip and every time the others fall completely short when compared to the professionalism, customer service, beautiful aesthetics, cleanliness, attention to details.  I could go on and on, but instead I would urge you to treat yourself and stay at this beautiful hotel whilst in London.",5,2023,10,08
140,Comfortable and plush but a bit of a let down.,Comfortable and plush hotel - not sure that it quite reaches the highs of 5 star luxury I expected. The room was tastefully decorated and on the larger side for London standards but it was rather noisy and the sound proofing from outside could definitely be improved. The bathroom was disappointing - shower was very poor and it was impossible to get water at a comfortable temperature only cold or scalding was possible. At this price point I would have expected much better. Breakfast was nice but service was lacking and inattentive. We also had the afternoon tea which was great. Location is excellent and central so this is definitely a plus. Check out was chaotic - we requested our valet parked car be brought but when we went to reception 15 minutes later this had been ignored. Indeed we were told we would have to wait 30 minutes until the doorman came on duty - in the end we walked to get the car from the car park ourselves instead of missing our flight - really poor service which detracted from our entire stay. Will look for a different luxury option in London.,3,2023,10,07
140,A Luxurious Haven in the Heart of London,"First and foremost, the level of service at this hotel is truly exceptional. The staff's attention to detail, professionalism, and willingness to accommodate every need made my stay both comfortable and productive. They anticipated my requirements, which is crucial for a business traveler.

The rooms are elegantly appointed, providing a perfect blend of comfort and functionality. The spacious work area and reliable Wi-Fi ensured that I could stay connected and be productive during my stay. Plus, the comfortable bed and luxurious amenities made relaxation a breeze after a long day of meetings.

The Langham's central location in London is a significant advantage for business travelers. It made getting to meetings and exploring the city during downtime incredibly convenient.

Dining options within the hotel were superb. The quality of food and service at the on-site restaurants is top-notch, making it easy to have a business meeting over a meal or unwind after a day of work.

In conclusion, The Langham Hotel in London is an outstanding choice for business travelers. Its exceptional service, well-equipped rooms, central location, and dining options combine to create a luxurious haven that caters perfectly to the needs of those visiting for business purposes. I highly recommend it for your next stay in London.",5,2023,10,03

Special mention to Benjamin Ng who was very friendly, professional and helpful. The room was (and all the hotel) was immaculate and so clean - the room was a great size and the bathroom was beautiful. I loved the special touch of balloons cake and sparking wine for my birthday what a surprise! The breakfast was delightful and a lovely setting. Will definitely be back soon! ",5,2023,09,26
140,Club level service is impeccable,"We booked an executive room through Amex Platinum FHR, which includes club access. The room was not great - first, it was not located in the main building of the hotel, and we had to switch elevators to get to the club lounge. Second, the bathroom in the room was so, so outdated and depressing. I went downstairs to reception in the lobby to ask if there was a room with a more updated bathroom that we could switch to, and the lady working there just stared at me, visibly annoyed, and said she'd ""make a note"" in the system. I decided to seek help from the nice gentleman in the club lounge instead, and within minutes, he was able to determine that a more updated room in the main building would open up the next day. The next day, they arranged for our bags to be moved, and we were in the new room by early afternoon. Many heartfelt thanks to Ashley in the club lounge for making this happen, because it truly made our entire stay so much better. Each and every person working in the club lounge was warm and helpful. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to deal with people all day long and maintain a smile - so thank you all for your kindness and patience.",5,2023,09,26
140,"Great Hotel, Warm Welcome & Great Service","Having stayed at the hotel on several occasions, as usual I had a warm welcome and the staff is very efficient. I got an early check-in after a nearly 13 hours flight which not many hotels would do. Room spotless as usual, spacious and airy. Everything that a traveller would wish to get for a pleasant stay. You will never be disappointed.

140,Best Overall Hotel Experience!,"My 9 year old daughter and I took a Girls' Trip to London at the end of August/beginning of September 2023. Our travel agent suggested a few hotels for us, based on my very high standards, and I am So glad I finally decided on The Langham. From the moment we pulled up until the moment we checked out, we were treated like royalty. The entrance of the hotel greets guests with luxury and the aroma of the beautiful fresh flowers that line the stairs. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the entire building, including the guest rooms, are immaculate. I even saw a housekeeper cleaning wall hangings in the hallway!
We stayed in an executive level room, and my daughter was thrilled with the small activities backpack, umbrella and teddy bear that was left on her bed. The lounge on our floor was perfect for daily breakfast, snacks throughout the day, or even a light dinner. The Afternoon Tea in the main restaurant was lovely and the famous cheese toastie at the Wigmore lives up to its top rating! 
I've been to luxury hotels all over the world, and The Langham London has been my favorite of all!

140,"Beautiful historic hotel. Great service, great rooms, great food.","This is everything that a 5 star hotel should be. Situated in a gorgeous building from the mid-1800s the hotel itself is stunning and full of history. There is a phenomenal restaurant in the lobby, a great pub attached to the hotel and a great lobby bar that serves small bites. The service was exceptional, the rooms clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a great location central to many underground stations and walking distance to many attractions. I would absolutely recommend this hotel and hope to stay again in the future.",5,2023,09,15
140,Amazing!,"I love the Langham because it's a large hotel so you can almost always get a room, even when London is brimming.  It's a very high class hotel and the rooms are lovely - not the largest and certainly not AMAZING but good enough.  The spa is lovely with an indoor pool and plenty of treatments - enjoy. ",5,2023,09,14
140,5 Star Bespoke Hotel & Experience,"With hundreds of options for hotels and a flexible budget for a 10 night stay, we chose the Langham. I've traveled to London several times, but this is the first time with this hotel. I cannot say enough good things about our experience - from booking to arrival to departure, everything was above and beyond my expectations. We were Mother and daughter traveling - sadly sometimes, two women can become part of the woodwork even in today's diverse world, but not here. The rooms are lovely and beautifully appointed in terms of amenities, furnishings, floorpan and cleanliness. The hotel is quiet and in the perfect location - for us anyway. There are fabulous 5 star hotels closer to Hyde Park but I find that area to be crowded and a bit chaotic personally, and prefer the more tucked in location of the Langham. Staff is courteous, attentive, responsive, friendly and professional. We had everything we needed and more and I couldn't be happier. I'll be returning in May with my husband and very much look forward to staying here again. You will NOT be disappointed in any way. ",5,2023,09,11
140,Summer vacation,"The hotel is very nice but not for the price that they charge.
The bathrooms are small and the rooms are outdated. Breakfast is very average for a 5 star hotel and the service at the bar needs improvement.

140,Tranquil Ambience,"We have just spent 2 wonderful nights in this gorgeous hotel for a special anniversary. 
The Langham is in the heart of the city, but the tranquil ambiance is the first impression on entering. This , along with the outstanding service and warm welcoming staff, make the Langham a truly exceptional experience. We will definitely be returning !",5,2023,09,11
140,Fabulous….luxury at its very Best. ,"I recently stayed two nights at The Langham in celebration of my husbands birthday and was thoroughly impressed by both the exquisite cuisine and the impeccable service. The attentive and knowledgeable staff ensured that our stay was a memorable one, providing excellent recommendations and ensuring our satisfaction was paramount at all times. Nothing was too much trouble. All staff, on all levels had a genuine desire to want to please their guests, which never felt forced or contrived. We had a room that gave us access to The Club Lounge which offers an unparalleled personal service on par with other high end establishments both in London and Worldwide which I can’t recommend highly enough. 
A special mention must go to ‘Hoi’ who was both warm and engaging without intrusion.  He should be commended for his professionalism along with Gee and the rest of the Club Lounge staff who were all fabulous in their own way. I must also extend my gratitude to Duty Manager ‘Fedrica’ who went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction was priority. These experiences coupled with the luxurious surroundings and prime location of the hotel made our stay truly memorable for all the right reasons. So much so that we look forward to planning our next visit. ",5,2023,09,10
140,Perfect hotel,"One c annot ask for better service or overall hotel experience. Expensive.If you can afford it, I would book it.quiet and peaceful.For those who want night action there is a rocking packed bar.Afternoon tea is the best in London both for the edibles and the intangibles.",5,2023,09,10
140,Welcome to London!,"What a wonderful welcome to London! Although this was our first time at this particular Langham, it felt like we were being greeted by long lost friends. The attention to detail and personal attention we received by absolutely every single staff member was truly unprecedented. They gave new meaning to “bending over backwards” with Mohammad the porter taking us to our room, making suggestions and repeatedly asking us what else we needed or what else he could do for us. Soon after, we received a telephone call from Jamie, the concierge, inquiring as to whether a 20 pound note that I had dropped on the other side of his counter belonged to my husband or me. (Thank you, Jamie!) 
Next, when ordering room service from a more basic menu because of the time of night, Rena from food services,  expanded the menu in an effort to find something that was able to conform to my diet and palate, and happened to be absolutely delicious. Equally delicious was the most comfortable bed and an amazing night’s sleep in our beautifully appointed room, not to forget waking up to the best shower in the world!
It’s truly the little things that people do that contribute to an absolutely outstanding experience. 
We checked out after only one night for a visit to the New Forest, but checked in for three more nights the following day. Upon returning back from an overnight in New Forest, Lina from the Langham Lounge, welcomed us back, and I instantly felt like I’d known her forever. How each of these staff members could elicit such warmth in such a short period of time should be bottled and sold. 
The hotel itself is gorgeous with specially selected and unique pieces of art throughout. At one point when we had a particular issue with our room, we were immediately put in a new room the very next day.  The staff does anything and everything to please, and a stay here promises to be the best escape ever. 
As Lina checked us out and walked us down to our taxi, we were already planning our return to the Langham.

All the Best, 
Cynthia and Laurence",5,2023,09,10
140,Beautiful luxury hotel,"Great (expensive) 5☆ hotel.   Excellent service.  Well appointed rooms.  But like most old upscale hotels, dim lighting, especially in the bathroom, made applying makeup and fixing hair difficult.  There is a magnify mirror but they should upgrade to one's with lighting.  For Americans, the nespresso coffee in the room is better than in the restaurant, so have the tea.  It's England, silly.",4,2023,09,09

140,Outstanding Staff,"The room was spacious and well appointed.  Housekeeping kept it tidy and turned it down in the evenings.  

We enjoyed having tea at the Palm Court, breakfast and canapes in the club, cocktails at the Artisan, and pints at the Wigemore.

Hotel management is doing an excellent job.  Every staff encounter was pleasant from check in to check out.  Housekeeping, in room dining, club and bar servers all seemed genuinely happy to assist you. 

I hope to stay here again.",5,2023,09,04

Lots of eating options. The casual restaurant (the palm) do great salads and options if more formal dining in the Landau. Breakfast is fantastic too. ",5,2023,09,04
140,Two great days at The Langham,"Our room was well-appointed, clean, and tended to nicely throughout our stay.

140,A Timeless Experience at Langham Hotel London (Oct 2022 Stay),"In March 2022, my partner and I had the pleasure of staying at the Langham Hotel in London, and although this review comes a bit late, the memories of our exceptional stay are as fresh as ever. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel to the moment we reluctantly checked out, our experience was nothing short of perfection.

Upon our arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to be informed that we had received a complimentary upgrade. This unexpected gesture immediately set the tone for our entire stay. The staff's warmth and genuine hospitality were evident from the start, making us feel like valued guests throughout our time at the hotel.

Our upgraded room was a true gem. Elegantly furnished, it effortlessly combined classic charm with modern comforts. The attention to detail was apparent in every aspect, from the luxurious linens to the carefully curated decor. The stunning views of the city added an extra touch of magic to our stay.

One of the highlights of our Langham experience was the access to the club lounge. This exclusive privilege offered a sanctuary of relaxation amidst the bustling city. The lounge provided a serene atmosphere where we could unwind with afternoon tea or evening cocktails. The delectable spread of snacks and refreshments catered to every palate, showcasing the hotel's commitment to providing a top-notch experience.

The Langham's central location was another advantage that allowed us to easily explore London's iconic attractions. Whether we were strolling through nearby Regent's Park or delving into the rich history of Oxford Street, the hotel's proximity to these landmarks made our sightseeing endeavors both convenient and enjoyable.

However, what truly sets the Langham apart is its exceptional staff. Their dedication to ensuring our stay was flawless was palpable. From offering insightful local recommendations to promptly addressing any requests we had, their impeccable service exceeded our expectations.

Although our stay was over a year ago, the memories of the Langham Hotel continue to leave an indelible mark. The hotel's commitment to delivering an experience beyond compare is truly commendable. Our complimentary upgrade, access to the club lounge, and the overall impeccable service made our stay an unforgettable one. The Langham Hotel doesn't just provide accommodation; it offers a journey into luxury, comfort, and the heart of London's charm.

In retrospect, we are reminded of the saying that ""good things come to those who wait."" While this review may be a tad delayed, our gratitude and appreciation for the Langham Hotel's exceptional hospitality remain as timely as ever. If you're seeking an extraordinary stay that combines opulence with genuine warmth, look no further than the Langham Hotel London. Your memories of this enchanting experience will undoubtedly stand the test of time.",5,2023,08,28
140,Beautiful luxurious hotel,"I loved my stay at The Langham. We lucked out with hotels in London and stayed in places with all ranges. I read so many reviews that featured The Langham as not among the top 10, maybe top 20. I still booked an Executive room and loved our stay! The bed was so comfortable, service fabulous, always taxis on-hand, beautiful room and surroundings. The hotel itself is very well-maintained and super clean. Turndown service and daily housekeeping follows strict guidelines and ensures that everything is clean and well-supplied. The Club Lounge was ok - breakfast was good, but overall average and not as many ""goodies"" as I would have liked, but still quite good. We would have been more comfortable in a family room but settled on Executive due to club access. The staff here is amazing, and we were very happy with our stay. The room was beautiful, well-lit, and quiet. I wish we could have stayed longer! By far our best stay of the trip. And the spa is quite fabulous too, highly recommend this hotel for your London stay. And even though it is on a busy street and area, it is situated in the quiet part and is easily accessible. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2023,08,19
140,Unveiling a slice of Caribbean heaven right in London! ,"Reviewing the  The Good Front Room at The Langham, London.

Unveiling a slice of Caribbean heaven right in London! I had the pleasure of immersing myself in the vibrant flavors and tropical vibes at The Good Front Room, expertly curated by Chef Dom Taylor within the historic Langham, London.

🍽️ From savoring the tantalizing Jerk chicken with its plantain jam and blackened sweetcorn dressing, to relishing the burst of flavors in the Ackee and saltfish cakes, every bite was a journey to the Caribbean's heart.

The mains took my taste buds on an exotic expedition - the Dark rum-glazed pork belly was an absolute delight, paired with charred hispi cabbage, and the Banana leaf baked sea bream with lemongrass and ginger was a dreamy escape to sun-kissed beaches.

The dessert experience was truly exceptional! I couldn't resist savoring the Jamaican Bun and cheese, a perfect blend of sweet and spiced, and the Coconut soft serve topped with pineapple compote was the ideal tropical finale.

140,Never again,"Overpriced, pretentious... rooms are very small, bed was one of the worst I've ever slept in, almost no value for what you get. Only good thing was the location. We did not pick this hotel (was picked for us by a friend) and would never stay here again if you paid me.",1,2023,08,14
140,Family London visit,"We stayed as a family of 4 for 3 nights in 2 rooms across from each other. Beautiful hotel in a great location. Super friendly staff. Great bar and restaurant. Impressive breakfast room and good menu. A little expensive breakfast buffet to be honest for a family of 4 but I think the staff sensed we thought and even if we didn’t raise it they gave us a good deal when checking out. The gym, swimming pool and SPA area is great. One of the few hotel pools in central London big enough to actually get some work done :-)",5,2023,08,14
140,An Awesome Stay in the Heart of the City!,"My wife and I had such a great time at your hotel! The room was always clean and cozy, and we really appreciated that. The vibe of the hotel was super cool - we loved the whole ambiance. Plus, being right in the center of town made it a breeze to get to all the cool spots. Gotta give a big shoutout to the doorkeepers – they were friendly and helpful every time we needed something. Thanks for making our stay awesome! We'll definitely be back!",5,2023,08,14
140,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"We arrived late at night and were not totally satisfied with the attention we received from the person in the reception. Next morning we stoped by the reception and were attended by Frederica from the front office.               WOW! What a great attitude. Lot's of patience and real interest to make us feel good, and improve our stay.  We changed rooms, and from then on Federica made sure we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Beautiful  hotel. Convenient location. Very nice room  and very very clean. great job of the cleaning team. Although a bit complicated to get there,  we enjoyed our stay at the regent section. We also enjoyed the spa and the bar. And again I am sure none of it would have been possible without Federica that understands the difference between a bitter client and satisfied one. ",4,2023,08,13
140,Fabulous,"Honestly we went to the other 5 star hotels- The Berkley, Claridges, and Connaught and nothing compared to The Langham. I enjoy the old classic stays apposed to a modern up to date and this was fabulous- I do wish the prices were a little bit more reasonable, but I think it is better if booked ealy. Martin was FANTASTIC!",5,2023,08,09
140,Great  experience. The guality of their service is tip notch,"The Langham is a beautiful hotel with great dining and bars and public areas. It is extremely well located but its main asset is their staff which is highly professional, very friendly and always willing to go the extra mile for their guests. The executive club is one of the bes or the best that I have experienced . Their rooms are beautiful and the extra touches like fresh fruit every morning, or their nesspreso coffee machines in every room or nightly treats were amazing.",5,2023,08,06

140,Beautiful historic hotel ,"We stayed over a weekend while visiting friends. Service was excellent, and was able to check us in early, and the location incredibly convenient for getting around London, as well as walkable. We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had many options and phenomenal and attentive waitstaff. The property is in a beautiful historic building, but our room was small and in need of updates—sequestered up in an older wing that was a considerable walk from the lobby. I would recommend the hotel but would flag to be mindful of your room choice. ",4,2023,08,01
140,"""The Langham Way""","My wife and I recently stayed at The Langham London, whilst attending Wimbledon.  

We had not stayed at a Langham hotel property previously, but that said … we had heard great things.  

Needless to say, the bar was set quite high.

I must say, our stay was absolutely wonderful!  One of our best hotel experiences ever.  

We have been members of Inspirato for many years (from inception, actually) and over these many years we have had the great pleasure of staying at many of the world’s best.  

Our stay at The Langham was second-to-none.  We can’t wait to return, and we’ve since booked a reservation at their Boston property for early September.  We are very much looking forward to it.  

The hotel is of course beautiful, and beautifully maintained (1850 as I recall?) … but it’s the service … from bow to stern … that’s just first rate.  

From the bellman to the barman, to the fellow who fixed our phone, even(!), there’s a polish that’s vanished from many of the (once) fine hotel chains.  

While just about everything about our stay was perfect, the very best part was our experience at their club lounge.  It’s beautifully appointed, and the food/drink wonderful, but it's the service that makes it truly special.  It was just exemplary.  Over the top, actually.   

There were two fellows in particular that made our visit extra special, they are … Mr. Genadijs Juskajevs, and Mr. Hoi Thich.  

These two gentlemen are quite the … Team Langham ..!  

(To Wit:  On only our second visit to the club lounge, with only a wink and a nod, a Belvedere vodka martini arrives on a lovely silver platter, for “Mr. Dordevic”.  I don’t get service like that at my own club.  How good is that?!)  

On our last morning at the hotel, we were chatting with both, and I asked, “what is it that makes this hotel so special, we’ve never experienced anything quite like it?”.  

Mr Thich, then smiled and said, “Mr. Dordevic, It’s just … The Langham Way”.  

Yes, indeed … “The Langham Way”.  Bravo ..!

140,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic staff, fantastic suite, fantastic stay. We love this place and we where spoiled rotten","We received a complimentary upgrade due to this trip being our wedding anniversary. Champagne, cakes, chocolates and fruit gifted to us by The Langham to help us celebrate. This pkace is, and always will be, very special to us. Love these guys.",5,2023,07,30
140,Suite Stay,"We had the pleasure of staying in a suite in December 2022. The room was stunning and the club lounge is a must. They have throughly of all of the small details you expect at a 5 star hotel such as the beautiful scent in the lobby. 

The scones at afternoon tea in the lounge were wonderful and they served my favourite cocktail which is sometimes hard to order in other places! 

The staff at the hotel are truly fantastic. We are getting married in London in October. I toured various hotels to find the base for our wedding weekend including: Hotel Cafe Royal, Pan Pacific, Kimpton Fitzroy, Charlotte Street Hotel and more. When I met with a sales representative at the Langham I new I had found the one. It is a special hotel and the sales representative was fantastic and as excited about the wedding as I am! 

After our stay in December we decided to not only book The Langham, but to extend our stay and incorporate a minimoon at the hotel to fully enjoy the facilities.",5,2023,07,29
140,Perfect Stay ,"Take me back, please!!!

Stayed for 4 nights during the final of Wimbledon. Hotel busy, but still excellent service. 

Had a two club rooms (which I highly recommend) 
Club Lounge is honestly one of the best I have encountered. Staff fantastic !

Have a Europe trip planned for later in the year and I will have to come back to London to just stay at the hotel even for just a couple of days. 

Was after assistance at concierge one night and the Director of Rooms Benjamin Ng was walking by and honestly couldn’t have been more helpful. I think I will contact Benjamin direct, to book . 

Thank you Langham for the most enjoyable stay. ",5,2023,07,29
140,A great Place To Stay in London,"Staff, dining and accommodations were way above expectation.  This included the concierge group, greeters, front desk, dining room personnel and room attendants.  Highly recommended which I usually don't say often.",5,2023,07,27
140,The Quintessence of Luxury and Service,"My stay at Langham Hotel London in July 2023 is surpassing all expectations. I had the privilege of experiencing hospitality at its finest, which left an indelible impression on me.

I would like to commend Sophia Zaki, a delightful guest services agent who personifies service excellence. Her politeness, professionalism, and enthusiasm were incredibly refreshing. During my stay, I am also celebrating a family event, and Sophia went to great lengths to ensure it will be memorable. 

I would also like to commend my housekeeper. I didn't catch her name but she's a lovely Hispanic lady whose dedication to service has been wonderful. One evening, during the turndown service, I asked whether they provided the bedside chocolate that sometimes hotels give during turndown. She said they do not usually, but promised to see what she could do. In no time, she returned with the desired treat, further exemplifying the Langham's commitment to personalized service.

This ethos of outstanding service, embodied by remarkable staff like Sophia Zaki and the diligent housekeeper, truly sets the Langham apart.

Finally, I'm really excited to try Dom Taylor's restaurant later this week after bingeing five-star chef on Netflix! Hopefully it will live up to how the rest of the week has gone so far!",5,2023,07,25
140,Perfect 5 Star Stay in London ,"Absolutely beautiful 5 star property and incredible service throughout every aspect of our trip, from check in, to check out. We booked through amex and will be returning again on our next trip to London. The hotel is located extremely close to the Oxford circus tube station and a short 10-20 minute ride took us to all of our site seeing locations, which was important for us. It was also very centrally located and a short 10 - 15 minute walk to many famous spots if you’re in the mood for walking, for example Piccadilly Circus.  We took advantage of the  breakfast at Palm Court every day, which was included since we booked through Amex, and it may have been our favorite part of the trip- it really was that good- and an incredible value. We were not able to try the high tea but this seems like a can’t-miss as well and will be trying this next time we are back. We booked a Deluxe room and were upgraded to an executive  room  (another amex perk) which had a beautiful view, and was incredibly comfortable. I think regardless of the room type, important to note the bed was like a fluffy cloud of comfort, the AC worked (to American standards, ha ha), and they had USB and US outlets for American electronics (so convenient for US travelers not having to take turns with only one outlet, or pack multiple adapters). I believe they also have EU plugs as well. Could really go on and on about the perfection of this property and it’s staff but needless to say we have previously been four seasons fans however this hotel has absolutely stolen our hearts, and we cannot wait to come back.  Thank you Langham London for an absolutely incredible trip! ",5,2023,07,12
140,Don’t stay - Especially with Amex,"Langham is a beautiful hotel, but the rooms are a mess. I booked with Amex for $1300 for one night. I ended up in a tiny room in something called the Regent Wing. It was essentially the size and quality of Courtyard Marriot - older renovation with odd and dated bathroom, including a bizarre step up shower that is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Tried the brunch, basically Costco pastries and fruit for $30 a person with terrible service. Overall, beautiful building, nice lobby, but awful rooms. Worse, they say they’re an Amex hotel, but don’t offer any benefits. Avoid!! So many better places for the outrageous price.",1,2023,07,09
140,Perfect London hotel,We were very pleased with this hotel. The staff were very attentive and the facilities were excellent. The breakfast was included and was served in a beautiful space.  The location was great until they closed the road for the Pride Parade. We just packed up accordingly and came back late that night. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.,5,2023,07,08
140,Can’t wait to return,"Simple. We’ve stayed in 5 star hotels around the planet and this Langham property is in the top 5 overall. 

Location: perfect 
Staff: exceptional 
Food: amazing 
Room: beyond comfortable 

If you are fortunate enough to spend $1000 per night in London, look no further. 

You wait for nothing and the staff actually anticipated our needs. Wow, we can’t wait return. Front desk staff is competent and our favorite was Jack at the front door right when we first arrived. 

Everything was right and no details were missed. 3rd floor club access is a must too.",5,2023,07,07
140,"Beautiful hotel, nice staff and well located.","Small confusion with my breakfast order mixed with another room order.
The Aircon a bit noisy
The Staff is very friendly and hotel is beautifully decorated. Loved the flowers.
Check in and check out is very easy, although I was asked to pay for a room that was prepaid.",3,2023,07,07
140,Best choice - Langham hotel,"The hotel is fantastic! I made the best choice when I booked this hotel for one week holiday to London with my12 years old grandson. 

The hotel is very elegant, the location is great and the staff extremely nice. The rooms, the beds, the pillows, the breakfast, the swimming pool, fully contributed to our memorable vacation.
I came several times to London before, but I never enjoyed it so much as I did this time when I benefited of the comfort offer by Langham hotel.

140,A spectacular experience in a perfect location,"This was our second visit to The Langham and it was every bit as fabulous as the first.  From the moment you arrive until the moment you depart, you are treated to special people who truly understand hospitality.  Attention to detail is apparent everywhere. 
Although you will pay a bit extra to stay here, if you can take advantage of this special place, please do.  
Also, if you can treat yourselves to an Executive Level room, you will be more than pleased.  ",5,2023,07,03
140,Wonderful stay,"everything at this hotel was exceptional. The staff, the facilities, the restaurants, and the location were all up to expectations for a five star hotel property. Very memorble stay and we would stay there again if we came to london. ",5,2023,07,02
140,Top service and kind staff,Super service and fabulous experience with ?victoria (lith) doing flower arrangements - she deserves more than a gold star! The room was clean and not too small and the staff were very accommodating throughout our short but excellent stay. Thank you,5,2023,07,01
140,The PERFECT London Five-Star Hotel!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hotel.  My daughter and I stayed for four nights.  It has all the service and amenities (great gym, pool, spa, and several resturants) of a bigger hotel, but it feels like a small one (attentive service, spotless housekeeping and doormen).  It does a good job of feeling like a timeless British five-star hotel, but not old and stuffy.  Everything feels new, works well from the elevators to the fact that they have both European and US plugs in the rooms.  Will stay here again. ",5,2023,06,26
140,Anniversary Trip in London,"The rooms are awesome, the club staff was great! Ashley/management gave us a welcome gift and anniversary present. It's in a great location as well.  But all of the hotel staff is great.  When we go to London, this is the hotel we always prefer to stay at.",5,2023,06,24
140,A stay in London's original grand hotel,"This hotel is a complete stand-out on the London scene. Although only there for one night my room came as part of The Langham Club, which provided me with access to their lounge, where all-day refreshments, snacks and a peaceful place to hangout were possible. My room was beautifully appointed, and large by London standards. The bed is beyond excellent, and after a long day of travelling was the perfect place to set my jet lag in order. If I'd had time, Afternoon at The Palm Court would most certainly been in order, as I've had that before and it is delicious. While the hotel is over 150 years old, the care taken with the interior and the amenities make it the perfect place to explore London's shopping and vibrant nightlife.",5,2023,06,22
140,"Cozy, boutique environment, lovely staff service, but not high luxury","Reservation was easy, and our room was ready super early for us (if only I’d known, I wouldn’t have booked unnecessary treatments at the spa to kill time… That could have been shared with us. I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep.) Still, the spa is cute and dim, and the staff & treatments were divine.  

On arrival, nobody greeted us or directed us to reception. We wandered around a bit and had to ask someone. (It’s to the right as you walk in; the stairs keep going, so you’ll miss it if you focus on getting to the top of the stairs, as we did.) 

The room was far more contemporary than the photo, we booked this hotel for the classic feel shown in images, but were put in the newer regent wing, whose decor did not match the photos. Perhaps a new photo shoot is in order? The bed was incredibly comfy though, thank you. 

The tiny maze of hallways and corners isn’t so pleasant, we got lost a lot. It’s a bit of a labyrinth, with two buildings fused together, and feels like as many rooms as possible have been squeezed in. Just part of the historical effect of older English properties. It just leaves the hallways quite small & dim. Acceptable for a boutique stay, not really suitable for a property promoted as five star luxury. 

The staff were all really trying to be attentive and professional. Some better than others, but all were obviously trying to be aware of guests, even housekeeping. Very professional and polite.

Bit of confusion on leaving though, when the concierge were not communicating well, so one told our driver to leave (?), another went to put our bags in the wrong car.. We were left standing around on the street outside the hotel for 15-20 minutes, thinking our chauffeur was moments away, and ended up calling our chauffeur back ourselves.. Not ideal when my husband has back issues & I have social anxiety :)  

Overall the hotel is suitable for someone seeking something cozy (particularly for London’s typically lower hotel standards), but I do think the original advertised fee was way overpriced, (thankfully we only paid £900, which seems more appropriate - it was originally listed AGC£1800-odd, which is why I booked it, thinking it was high end.) The images portray a much more grand environment than it is. Yet it’s not unpleasant. Not quite dinky. Just .. boutique :) 

We might recommend the Langham if someone just wants a local weekend relax, but not when traveling under stress & needing a smooth, luxury atmosphere. 
Thank you for having us. ",3,2023,06,21
140,Overall great stay!,"Stayed at the Langham Hotel London and had a great experience. The location is convenient, consistently exceptional service with every staff member, and the rooms (on the smaller side)  lobby, and gym are lovely. Only things to note is that the WiFi and heat/cooling was a little temperamental.
 Would highly recommend!",5,2023,06,20

I was there for a conference and everything from the moment I arrived was hassle free and relaxing despite having a tight time schedule for my conference. Rooms were ready early with a brekkie due to me arriving early morning and the staff were very happy to press any items. The rooms and food was excellent. Brekkies were excellent and very prompt, usually the ideal time to network with colleagues and drinks at the bar were exceptional. Overall a blissful stay",5,2023,06,17

140,Outstanding service ….,"From arrival , to room service and checkout, meeting experience and friendliness of the teams are just some of the attributes of this super hotel. As a frequent traveler I can only recommend this hotel. Especially as many hotels have issues with motivated and services oriented employees after Covid. At Langham you do not feel it !

140,Central London Hotel,The Langham Hotel London is an exceptional hotel for those who wish to experience the shopping highlights in central London. Bond Street High fashion is less than 1 minute away and the tranquility of Regents Park for morning exercise is a 2 minute cab ride away. The Langham Hotel London is a truly great place to rest after shopping in Central London.,5,2023,06,08
140,Excellent Stay at the Langham,"My wife and I recently spent three nights at the Langham London. The hotel is in a great location near Regent Park and just a short walk from the Oxford Circus tube station. Our room was excellent. The staff are exceptional, unfailingly courteous and immediately responsive. I would highly recommend the Langham to colleagues, friends and family. And I strongly suggest a room with access to the Club for breakfast and other amenities throughout the day. It will make the Langham your new favorite hotel.",5,2023,06,08

140,One of the best Hotels In The World. ,"One of the best Hotels in the World. 

This is what Luxury is all about. We were left with memories of London and the Hotel. A hotel that not only understands what Luxury is but also deliveries this with such class and pride. 

The price is worth every moment in this special location. Housekeeping greeted us by name. The attention to details impressed us. 

We will be back for a lifetime of amazing stays. Thank you, Langham London you blew, our minds. ",5,2023,06,02

if you like the feeling of being a welcomed guest in a 5 star hotel this is the place!
From the moment your mode of transportation pulls into the impressive entrance and welcoming doormen at the Langham hotel until you depart
they make you feel like it was their pleasure to have you as a guest.
We will return, because it was OUR PLEASURE
",5,2023,05,28
140,Attitude of this hotel has changed,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and it has been great.  This year the doorman was always talking to his partner you had to interrupt to get a cab. They made no effort to help get you seated for lunch or breakfast they didn’t seem to care you were a hotel guest. The menu was very limited so you had to look for restaurants around the hotel. I was disappointed with this stay, there comment to me was sorry it is the chelsea flower show we are very busy.  Best part of the trip was their breakfast",3,2023,05,28
140,Luxury service and more in London in a luxury hotel,"We spent ten (10) days at The Langham London in deluxe room. I did extensive research on the best central London luxury hotels, reviewing reviews, both personal and professional to ultimately select The Langham Hotel based on this information. This and the proximity of the hotel to the theater district. It is a 400 room hotel yet the service we gathered from other guests we met there that the service is actually superior to a number of boutique luxury hotels in London.

Based on our experience, I can honestly say I believe I made the right choice. The service is exceptional in all aspects. It is not a small boutique hotel yet the service matches or exceeds other hotels with similar standing or repute.

Due to my wife's mobility issues and a large amount of luggage we needed for a wedding in Scotland, I arranged the hotels car service upon arrival in London and departure from the hotel to London useful r Heathrow Airport. A nice selection of vehicles were available on the website which was also useful for determining capacity. The car service was excellent as well with the drivers of both range Rovers managing to fit all of our luggage. Multiple doormen helped us to and from our room with the baggage and were quick and efficient despite the heavy loads they had to manage.

All the staff I encountered were friendly and accommodating. Some went beyond what would be considered exceptional service to provide additional personal service to me and my wife. In the Palm Court restaurant the folks serving breakfast, lunch and dinner were extremely attentive yet not intrusive. Their dining room manager, supervisors and staff were exceptional.

The room and amenities we enjoyed were of high quality and greatly appreciated. Whilst some might imagine an extensive range of everything, The Langham provides a balance and what might be described as a their selection of the best of everything.

The concierge folks were very helpful and made our trip arranging everything from day trips with drivers and guides to horse rides and advice on where to eat or shop outside of the hotel, in London or elsewhere.

The rooms were well maintained and the housekeeping staff were very flexible in providing service as and when it suited our schedule. 

Based on our long stay experience I can highly recommend The Langham London, it's staff, their service and its luxury amenities and offerings.",5,2023,05,22
140,EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE!,"If you are truly looking for a home away from home service and experience, this is the hotel you are wanting to stay.

140,10 Stars,"The most fabulous hotel experience in London!  From the concierge setting up all our private VIP tours, to the club lounge team taking extra care of our needs, this hotel ROCKS!  Don't waste another minute..just book a suite at The Langham London and your butler will take care of the rest.",5,2023,05,19
140,Just Amazing,"If your looking to stay in a top hotel in London then you should really consider The Langham. The hotel itself is grand and beautifully decorated, but the staff and the way the go about their craft ensuring you do not want for anything and that nothing is too much trouble really make it an amazing place to stay. Another mention is the Langham club within the hotel, here you can eat drink and feel relaxed in your own private space being looked after by its wonderful staff.",5,2023,05,18
140,Sensational Hotel. ,"Truly world class accommodation with exceptional service.  The staff at the Langham London are beyond belief and always made themselves available to assist and ensure we had a memorable stay. Their polite and friendly manner made our stay enjoyable and easy.

140,Langham Lounge - the Hotel within the Hotel,"My wife and I returned to the Langham after our amazing stay last November. Once again we were so impressed with this hotel. The sense of calm is such a luxury when stepping in from the busy London streets. The main reason we returned though was because of our experience in the Executive Lounge. Once again, it was the staff within the lounge that made our stay so special. They go out of their way to ensure that you are made to feel welcome and cared for. This truly is a Hotel within a Hotel. Thankyou to the Langham and specifically the team from the Lounge. We look forward to seeing you again in November ! ",5,2023,05,03
140,The Langham London: Luxury and Exceptional Service,"Staying at the Langham in London was a wonderful experience.

Staff was very attentive throughout the visit.

I highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a luxurious stay in London.

140,The Langham stands out,"If you can afford to stay at the Langham in London, do it. Without question one of the best hotels in the world and I’ve stayed at a lot of them.

We loved that the sandwiches, pastries and scones were served in a timely fashion without us feeling rushed even though we were given a 'slot' for our tea to last.  I have told friends that if they are looking for an unforgettable afternoon tea, they need to go to The Langham.  Thank you team for a wonderful afternoon!",5,2023,05,01
140,"Superb service, excellent location","Extremely comfortable with superb service and a terrific, central London location.  The only downsides were the length of journey through the hotel to the pool and the slippery floors in the pool changing room and en route to the pool - plus, being central London, the rooms, though extremely comfortable, are fairly small. ",5,2023,05,01
140,"Phenomenal service, very comfortable and clean! ","Phenomenal service, very comfortable and clean. The staff is very helpful. The location is very quiet but still nearby everything you'd want to walk to. Close to the Tube and easy to get a taxi. The Club is very well stocked and the breakfast and snacks are wonderful. The elevator is a bit slow but it's an old building that has been exceptionally renovated. We will be back! Highly recommend.",5,2023,05,01
140,LTSB's 10th Anniversary Gala Dinner at the Langham London,"We held our 10th Anniversary Gala Dinner at the Langham at the end of March and the events team at the hotel led by Chloe helped us to put on the most incredible evening. The hotel worked tirelessly with our fantastic event planner to make our evening special. From booking the ballroom to meeting the chefs and then enjoying the delicious dinner designed by the Roux brothers on the night, everything was of an incredibly high standard. The ballroom is beautiful and certain to impress your guests who will be waited on immaculately all evening. If you are trying to find somewhere to hold a special event, I would whole-heartedly recommend that you choose the Langham over any other West End Hotel.",5,2023,04,30
140,Master Timekeepers in a Timeless Era,"Nested within the busy Oxford Street area, the Langham has modestly stood in its place, throughout its history. The building blends into the architecture of the nearby area, only overshadowed by the BBC's HQ facade. Over the last 15 years, I have passed though the footsteps of the hotel, greeting the hotel as a sign of respect every time I walked through Regent Street. While living in London, I never stayed at the hotel, but since moving away, it has become a prime location for business trips. 

You are sure to find personalised luxury here. But let's face it, if you are searching for hotel reviews for the Langham, you might probably be searching for those who pick at its minor faults or major offerings. I offer to you neither, but a gentle look into how one of London's master pieces has mastered its uniqueness against the backdrop of other luxury properties. Time has swallowed some of the original glory of the Langham, after all, it was the first to offer electricity and set the stage for the Afternoon tea experience. After passing through several different owners, it has again brought exceptional value to its guests through a tranquil and modest take on luxury. 

They are true timekeepers in a timeless era that is defined by them. An atmosphere of energy and serenity through use of flowers and wooden furniture helps maintain its new owners' heritage and philosophy for the natural environment, and its rooms well appointed with soft colour carpets with equally matched nature themes as the communal area decor. Walking into the room, it's like forgetting its within a hotel, stress simply melts away. Though you are bound to find the odd thing like leaking showerheads, or a toilet that doesn't stop flushing, but these are only gentle reminders that we still need to live in reality. 

For me though, the experience is glamourized with access to a lounge club (in Exec Rooms and Suites), for a little private retreat after a busy day of meetings or shopping. If it's a short walk to London shopping, the Langham is perfectly placed. We can truly appreciate the Langham experience by taking full advantage of its services, delivered by staff that genuinely want to make your day as stress-free as possible. 

As we walk away from the Langham, it is never a goodbye, but a promise to return. But be realistic on your expectations, and remember that the experience at this hotel cannot be summarised by only one category, such as its service, rooms, decor and philosophy; it's how all these blend into one unique tone that give the Langham an advantage over the other London luxury properties.",5,2023,04,29
140,BEST HOTEL,"Excellent location, courteous staffLots of attentive and nice staff members , pampering hotel. a spacious room. Dinner in the room was excellent. The breakfast was excellent, and the dinner service in the room was very tasty",5,2023,04,29
140,Terrible reception night manager,"We have been a regular customer to Langham hotel having stayed many times recently- unfortunately last weekend we were staying  in the old Regent side of hotel, the room was nice and spacious however at 3am I awake on a terrible mattress - hard as a rock and couldn’t sleep. I called the reception and explain I couldn’t sleep on the mattress -to be told I was wrong and the mattress was from same supplier as the other rooms in the newer quarter we had previously stayed in - to which my response was ‘have you slept in a number of the hotel beds? Well I have and these are not same mattresses even if same supplier’ I was told there was nothing they could do about it even though I explained at 3am I was unable to sleep in a room at nearly £1000 a night!
I woke my poor husband and packed to leave - upon arriving at reception the ‘duty night manger’ who had no ‘customer care’ said I am sorry I have rooms but you will need to down grade! At this point we left. Now this turned out to be our good fortune as Claridges once we explained our predicament at 5am even though they were fully booked offered us drink/comfort and had a room made up for us by 9am - gave us a free upgrade and didn’t charge us early check in or for the breakfast they offered whilst they got a room turnaround quickly. 
Hence Langham have lost loyal guests …..",1,2023,04,28
140,Masterpiece ,"The hotel was wonderful, it is located in the very city center, the room was super clean and comfortable beds, perfect delicious  breakfast, moreover helpful and friendly stuff!

140,Usually so good. Tonight just awful.,"Usually so very good. This trip has started so very bad. Couldn’t find my booking. Check in guy was surly like it was my fault even though I had the correct booking number.

I’m sorry The Langham but you need to do much better than the experience tonight.",1,2023,04,26

140,Terrible bed,"Terrible beds, terrible experience, night staff unhelpful, uncaring, left at 4am, slept in car, called reception to change rooms to sleep on a suitable bed to be told nothing available, but we checked on line and suites were available, would have happily paid extra, ive stayed here for the last 5 weeks every weekend but never again. This hotel believes its name is better than the guests, now staying at claridges, staff, hotel and care are far more courteous . I don’t usually write on social media sites but this whole experience had my wife in tears and others  should be aware.
On a positive the door men are fantastic, we will miss Mike and Ian and there hospitality- shame reception don’t share the same care to their loyal guests",1,2023,04,23

140,You get what you pay for - and that's a good thing!,"This is an expensive hotel - no doubt. But, sometimes you get what you pay for, and that was the case here. 

I arrived a few hours before the official check-in time but was still able to check-in, which was much appreciated after my overnight flight. It was a little odd at check-in since I was told I was being upgraded, but the ""upgrade"" was actually the room class I had paid to be in, so I wasn't sure I understood that.

ROOM: The room itself was very nice - quite large, had a nice view and was well decorated. The bed was a little hard, but not so much that it was uncomfortable. The bathroom needs a heated towel rack - it was freezing!! But, the walk-in shower was nice (although I missed the individual shower amenities - the large sizes seem a little unsanitary to me since everyone uses them and you don't actually know what's in there, even though I understand the conservation aspect). The tv had a huge assortment of channels in numerous languages.

SERVICE: With the exception of the odd exchange above, everyone was lovely!

RESTAURANT: My room rate included a $100 credit for the restaurant so I had lunch there and then an evening snack. It was very good both times, and the soup was delicious!

LOCATION: It's located at the top of Regent Street, which is why I stayed here - easy to walk most places you want to be, but quiet since it isn't right on the main street.

Would I stay here again - absolutely!",4,2023,04,19
140,Kindness,"Before I began I must say I did not stay in the hotel.I just waked by with my children and brought them close to the door to see it.The door staff were very kind and friendly and took the time to speak to us.When I explained we were not checking in or anything and that I was just showing it to my children they said please continue in ,you are very welcome.We stepped inside and the most beautiful scent filled the marble foyer.I would love to know what it was.I could have stayed there all day.Beautiful blossoms and piano playing drew your attention to a gorgeous room where people enjoyed lunch or afternoon tea.The staff was so very kind,polite and inviting and I am really grateful for that.It left a truly lovely impression of a beautiful city and someday we will check in❤️",5,2023,04,19

140,30th birthday stay,"The staff were very friendly, accommodating, welcoming and attentive. I received a cake and the hotel fragrance as a birthday gift. The swimming pool was beautifully lit and was quite during the evening so I had a solo swim. The relaxation room had Refreshments, slippers and towels for guest to use. The floor landings were beautifully decorated like the bedrooms. I was shown to my room by the receptionist and shown all the facilities in my room. The cleaning staff came into my room to provide new clean towels during my stay. I had dinner at the palm court, I arrived 10 mins before the kitchen closed but I was still greeted and seated by the friendly restaurant manager. The food was good considering I ordered a burger and chips. I received a mini cake and rose champagne complimentary for my birthday. ",5,2023,04,14

Let us stay in our room when flights got cancelled. 
We would highly recommend going here.",5,2023,04,05
140,A perfect place for your London stay,"We stayed for 3 nights at The Langham, London. The hotel has perfect location - right on the end of Regent Street next to BBC Headquarters. You step out of the hotel and you are on Regent Street. The location made it possible for us to move around at any time of the day. The check-in process was swift, rooms were small but well-appointed and breakfast was nice. Overall, we had a lovely stay at The Langham, London. They gave us a VIP Card for our Bicester Village visit which made the visit more comfortable and we could access lounge at Bicester Village and avail discounts.",5,2023,04,02
140,we enjoyed the stay,"hotel location is convenient and easy access to different areas; service in restaurants was attentive and made guests feel comfortable, breakfast has a wide range of choices; house keeping is doing a good job",5,2023,03,26
140,A perfect stay,"Terrific, memorable stay at the Langham. Absolutely stunning hotel with history, character, well-appointed/elegant rooms and extremely pleasant/helpful staff. The location is perfect - you are in the center of it all yet it is easy to escape into the quiet luxury of this incredible hotel. My husband and I travel to London often and this is easily our new favorite place to stay. Special thanks to Lawrence and his team for their kindness, patience and hospitality at they helped sort out one or two room changes. :) We will be sending everyone we know traveling to London to the Langham and can’t wait to return - hopefully in April! Wanted to note they also very kindly granted us an early check-in after an overnight flight from New York. We have never had this request honored at nearby five-star competitors. Thank you again, Lawrence and team, for everything. Because of the staff, I wish I could give six stars. Impeccable service. We will be back soon! -The Elliotts",5,2023,03,25
140,Very nice.,"The hotel is very tastefully done, traditional contemporary decor. Staff were excellent and the location was great. Walking distance to lots of things. The Palm court staff were sensational. An incredible team !! ",4,2023,03,24
140,A special and memorable hotel.,"The hotel is wonderful in every way-from the minute you walk in the door, the service is exceptional! The staff are so polite and attentive, and one is made to feel special from the moment that you walk in. We booked an executive room, and what a treat it was.. It allows access to The Langham Club, which is such a nice space to spend time in, and I can't imagine booking any other type of room now. In fact, it was so lovely in there, that we ended up eating breakfast in there rather than bothering with the restaurant. The rooms are comfy, and spotless. I didn't use the pool, but my husband and son did, and they seemed to thoroughly enjoy it! The location of the hotel is rather good too. 
I've already booked another stay. ",5,2023,03,23
140,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel with great service and location. The rooms are nice, large and clean. They deliver all the things one would expect from a 5 star hotel. The lounge is a big plus. Mila the butler is warm and caring. ",5,2023,03,20
140,Modern luxury/ Perfect Location in a London Classic,"We stayed at the Langham for over a week altogether and loved the location and beauty of this beautiful hotel. The Langham has the exterior feel of a classic London grand hotel, but the inside is intimate with modern amenities and high style. We stayed in a suite on the 7th floor which was perfect for us and our teenager. The club level on the 3rd floor was an area we used heavily for breakfast and evening drinks and snacks. The service and food on the club level is well worth the option. The bar on the main level is vibrant and the perfect place for a cocktail while the restaurant is elegant and beautiful for meals, although quite formal. Not sure we would have utilized on premise dining as much if we had not had the club level. The location couldnt be better with the hotel at the corner of Mayfair/ soho/ Marylebone and at the top of Regent Street. After a busy day seeing the sites, we welcomed our entry to the Langham with the friendly greetings and distinctive floral fragrance. It was above the madness and tourist fray of Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square but an easy walk / taxi ride from everything. We loved this hotel in every way. Only issue we had was the quality of the mattress which in our room was pretty uncomfortable/ below the quality we would expect in such a luxury hotel. There is also a beautiful pool/ spa/ gym which we did not use. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,03,18
140,Birthday Break,"Amazing hotel - Staff , Rooms and Lounge just fantastic. From the time you arrive to the time you leave, the Hotel and its staff just spoil you.
The rooms are spotless and feel like an Oasis in London. Our home from Home when in London.",5,2023,03,13
140,The only place to stay in London!,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in all of the best hotels in London including the Dorchester, the savoy, The Ritz plus many others, over the last couple of years however my family and I have started staying at The Langham London, this hotel is amazing and we have made a decision between us all that unless something was to drastically change, we will never stay anywhere else, we are treated like family from the moment we arrive until the moment we leave, the service we receive from everyone at the hotel is far superior to other hotels, the food and drink is also great and the afternoon tea in the palm can not be compared with other hotels serving afternoon tea, if you can afford to pay the extra I would very much recommend upgrading to an executive room which gives you access to the Club Lounge, this place is amazing! once you try this hotel you will not ever go anywhere else. Just wanted to take this opportunity to that Aurica Cacau (Guest Services Executive) Fadi Samhoun (Director of Guest Services) Nick Sprujit (The Langham Club Manager) for making every stay an amazing stay, of course there are many other members of the team who are also amazing but I would be typing all day",5,2023,03,13
140,Amazing stay,"We had an amazing stay at The Langham for my partners birthday. We’ve been to the Artizian bar many times, even having our first date there 5 years ago, but this was the first time we’ve stayed. The staff were truly amazing, going well above our expectations, from the reception staff providing a free room upgrade, the waiters at Palm Court providing a free bottle of champagne, a cake, flowers and a cocktail and the staff at the Artizian bar providing another small cake and singing happy birthday. We had a free bottle of champagne, fruit and sweets and another cake in our room as well as a gift bag that included a candle and diffuser. The staff made our stay truly memorable and we will definitely be staying again.",5,2023,03,12
140,A perfect weekend stay in london,1 night stay to celebrate my sons birthday.  The best lounge in any hotel we have stayed in. The staff could not do enough! Super friendly. The food was excellent and the ambiance was perfect! We will 100% be back very soon! Highly reccomend the langham hotel!,5,2023,03,11
140,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely place to stay a stone's throw from Regent St. Check in was surprisingly slow but once completed our room was lovely and quiet. Breakfast was extremely good. Get a deal with it included if possible, it will save you cash if you plan to eat in. The facilities are great. It is oe of the nicer hotels to stay in in London.",5,2023,03,08
140,A Hotel that truly makes you feel Welcomed.,"All the little details that make you FEEL that someone has cared for your Happy stay: the presents we got for both of our birthdays, the cake (Delicious!!!), the fruit, the candy, the way all of our questions and needs were answered in such a good smiling way...
All of them just make the perfect location and the Perfect sheets and beds to be just secondary in this really amazing hotel.
I highly recommend staying at The Langham London. After trying many 5* hotels around the world and in London, this had become my favourite.
Really Clean, pleasant, Beautiful, Pinkish touches everywhere, smiling faces all along, comfortable, spacious enough, very specious clean and comfortable bathrooms, perfect location, perfect in all ways.

The room was crisp and clean every day which was much appreciated.
The beds Super comfortable with the most perfect sets of sheets!!! 
even the slippers were wonderful :0)

Thank you Langham!",5,2023,03,08
140,Pleasantly surprised ,"The hotel is lovely, I have stayed in several other hotels in London all five star and I have to say for the price I will continue to choose the langham, the hotel is at the level of all the others if not better. A truly welcoming surprise. The service is also excellent and location was perfect. ",5,2023,03,06
140,Wonderful.,"Location, services, friendliness, food: All excellent. Of course, quite expensive, but what with a good breakfast offer, the gym, the pool, the quality and cleanliness of the rooms, the efficient and always friendly service, nothing to complain of and much to praise.",5,2023,03,05
140,A special hotel,"We had a wonderful belated 25th wedding anniversary stay at The Langham. Location is perfect, all the staff looked after us to a high standard, a special mention to the staff in the club lounge, the food and service was fantastic (and the champagne). A truly special hotel.",5,2023,03,05
140,No excuses - understated excellence,"Covid changed everything including travel.  There has been an acceptance of lower standards due to lack of staff, increase in regulations and ‘training issues.’  None of these excuses or explanation will be found at The Langham.  The Langham continues to provide superior service seamlessly.

We stayed in a beautiful room and had access to their ‘club’ where we could enjoy breakfast, light snacks (delicious) a modified tea time and evening snack and libations.  It was a quiet lovely place to stretch out and enjoy after a day of shopping and sightseeing.

I regularly saw staff cleaning high touch areas.  Everything worked, we never had issues with our key cards, temperature in the room worked well( I like a cool room).

The facility was exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel.  It was delightful to rest in such opulent surroundings. No excuses.",5,2023,02,26
140,Great hotel and location,In the center of London and great hotel with many services. Definitely recommend the afternoon tea and the bar is very good.  The rooms and service from the staff are exceptional.  The location is perfect in terms of proximity to central London.,5,2023,02,25
140,Perfect stay,"Stayed one night for my Wife’s birthday. Visited the Wigmore for the evening, including a bar meal. I was recommended to try the ‘cheese toasties’ an I must say I was not disappointed. Sounds ordinary, but actually, far from ordinary needs to be experienced to believe. Had breakfast in the Landau. Best breakfast ever. All staff are friendly and very helpful. Room was fantastic . All in all a perfect stay. Would highly recommend.",5,2023,02,24
140,Expected so much more,"I am disappointed by my stay at the Langham. Service was constantly confused and disorganized, with front desk not communicating with each other, and mistakes with luggage dropoff to the room on check in and other such inconsistencies. The staff manning the front doors (not the costumed bellhops who were amazing) rarely held doors or said hello even when the lobby was empty. Elevator was down multiple times during our stay.

The positives: fabulous concierge support before our stay from Milena, and during from Dayvid. Excellet service in The Wigmore. Housekeeping was thoughtful and discreet and turndown service was lovely. Bellhops were friendly and lovely too.

If the cost per night had been a bit less, I would not have had as high expectations, but I will splurge an extra 100 GBP a night to stay at The Dorchester next time, for a true luxury experience.",3,2023,02,21
140,Has Langham lost it?,"Seems standards have slipped. Use to stay here loads, and could never flaw it. Back again today and getting very different impressions. Bar, restaurant and lobby are still as lovely, but lots of other things disappoint.
Bellboy barely cares to greet, broken elevator, lots of junk and wear on the reception desk weren’t good signs but not the end of the world. Worse, they gave me a dark and somewhat dingy room really far in the back (I got lost every time so far), and had a problem with a soaked carpet outside the bathroom that reception didn’t know how to resolve.
They can’t move me to another room, because “they are smaller and not as nice”, whereas ANY room I stayed in before beats this dark cot. Not a fun argument to have when you pay 400 and just want to sleep.
I hope the coming days will somehow make up for this,  because I still want to like this place, but at this moment regretting my choice because it’s not the Langham I used to know and love.
Lastly, some hotel staff members were doing after work drinks in the cocktail bar together. I found that weird… do that anywhere else, or hide it well. It doesn’t look good and makes the place less special.",2,2023,02,20
140,so so spoilt with the most amazing hotel stay ever,"oh there is nothing but positive feedback, we had the best stay ever and was just amazed at the level of service you get.  The rooms are so big and luxurious that you will not want to leave. Please eat at the hotel the food is an experiance not to be missed, the location is central to everything and it is a short taxi ride costing £8 from Euston station.

Enjoy",5,2023,02,20
140,Vist every quarter for business and they never disappoint,"One of the finest Hotels in the world. If you long for personal service, amazingly friendly staff, beautifully crafted cocktails and dinners, and efficient concierge and business services, this is the place. ",5,2023,02,20
140,Quality hotel,"If you are after quality and service, that is perfectly situated with secure parking almost on the doorstep. The Langham Hotel is the one to stay at. Cant wait to go back. Next time we will book dinner in the restaurant as opposed to going out to eat. ",5,2023,02,20
140,A welcome home,"I felt welcomed each time I entered the Langham. The attention of the staff to my presence never waned. Though I’d stayed for over a week, I was always treated as if I were a new and special guest.

My first experience at The Langham was over 20 years ago. I had fond memories of that stay so I returned recently. Everything was as I remembered.

 I feel welcomed and appreciated at The Langham.",5,2023,02,17
140,Valentine's day saty,Just spent a wonderful 2 nights at what to me is an absolute fantastic hotel and one which my wife and I come back to. We were met with a warmth and check in went very smoothly. The room was beautiful and the roses I had requested were just where I wanted them to be and were very beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and you could certainly stretch out. Breakfast in the Landau was truly amazing with plenty of choice and excellent service. We had room service one evening and the Club was very tasty and very well constructed; something I have worked on for years but not yet perfected nor ever will I suspect.    We also used the pool which is very nice and clean as was the sauna and steam room.  Overall a fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel. ,5,2023,02,17
140,Fabulous stay,"Loved our stay at the Langham. We always book an executive room as we love their Club where we enjoyed fabulous cocktails, delicious snacks & a wonderful breakfast in the morning. 
Nick and his team always deliver & service provided by Ivan is top notch - he’s superb! 
Thank you very much for all your hard work to make our stays so memorable.",5,2023,02,13
140,Amazing stay,"Great location, friendly staff, prepared to go extra mile to make the stay as enjoyable as possible.
Sufficient size rooms. Gym 24 in operation which is amazing for us business people who don’t sleep much. And swimming pool in the hotel who is unusual for center of London ",5,2023,02,13
140,High quality hotel,"The staff is amazing their attention is 100% personalized they have nice details. The hotel is very luxurious and fancy. The breakfast was delicious. Will definitely stay there again, fully recommended.",5,2023,02,12
140,Still lost inside The Langham,"The Langham is not a good hotel. The layout is ridiculous. It’s impossible to navigate your way around it. I’m still lost inside there right now. When you do eventually stumble upon your room, it’s old and tired and needs an update. If you’re in the Regency wing, call your family now and say goodbye - you’ll probably never see them again. Maybe they can stop by and hang up some “Missing” posters around the endless winding corridors.  For the money they are charging, you’d think they might invest in some better signage or some Sherpas to help you navigate your way around. I would say, I’ll never go back but I have to find my way to door and be able to leave first!  ",1,2023,02,12
140,Love this hotel,"The Langham is simple a great hotel to stay. Great location, fantastic service. The room I had was spacious and comfortable. Bathroom is a bit small, mainly if two people are staying but nothing to complain.  ",5,2023,02,10
140,An Extended Weekend to Relax and Take In the Sights in London,"My partner and I had an excellent stay the Langham Hotel in London. The service was top notch and the ambiance was what one would have expected. The breakfast was fantastic. The room was elegant and comfortable and in particular, quiet. The location is also great. In addition, the pool was a highlight. We will return for sure! :-)",5,2023,02,07
140,Langham Hotel London,"It’s been another perfect stay over experience.  Immaculate decor, comfortable room and warm and welcoming staff. It’s become our London home from home. We really like the Door staff.  Nothing to much trouble and always a friendly smile. ",5,2023,02,06
140,Don’t hesitate…,"This was my 2nd stay. On this trip my husband and I  stayed for a whopping 14 nights. We also booked 2 extra rooms for 2 nights for my mother,  sister and niece whom we hadn’t seen due to Covid. 

That’s a lot of time for you to truly experience a hotel! 

Again, just exceptional. 

My mother was extremely nervous coming in from Manchester to stay so much so she insisted I met her from her taxi. She felt it was such a ‘posh’ hotel she would be out of place and staff would judge her.. bless. 

By the end she loved the hotel and all her fears were alleviated. 

This is as my mum would say a ‘posh’ hotel but it is far from pretentious. The staff are highly trained and will mirror your mood, personality and be as conspicuous .. or inconspicuous as you need them to be. 

The cocktail bar is a must. One of the best in London. 

I lived in London for 25 years before moving to Canada so I can say with conviction the location is perfect. Whether you are shopping, visiting the West End, sight seeing or have business in the City nothing is too far away. 

Whenever I return home this is my 1st choice. Just exquisite, yet a home from home… how they achieve this is a skill not many hotels have acquired.",5,2023,02,05
140,Outstanding premises of a wonderful hotel !,"Wonderful hotel with great staff, especially Mrs. Sharon Leung from the reservation, and the Reception Team! 
Very clean rooms, spacious, mouth-watering exceptional breakfast and tasty dinner in The Palm Court Restaurant. Beautiful premises with outstanding professionalism of the entire Langham Family! 
Always in London we will chose Langham only !!!!!",5,2023,02,04
140,Absolutely marvellous,Once again a wonderful stay. We were so well looked after by everyone from the Club to the concierge. Also shout out for the housekeeping which was very conveniently efficient in the morning and great turndown. Basically this is the best place to stay in London. Love the location. Most importantly though everyone is very friendly and great fun to be around. Thank you!      ,5,2023,02,04
140,Great stay!,"If you want a relaxion and culinary top stay, go to the Langham.
Friendly service!
Nice decorated rooms and perfect cleaned rooms.
Great cocktails and ambiance at the Artesian Bar.
The Langham lounge club is an asset for your stay in the Langham.",5,2023,02,02
140,Langham,"We went to London for a post op e ration follow up appointment and stayed for a few extra nights to catch up with our son. We chose to return to the Langham as its well located for our appointment and the shops and it’s in close proximity to lots of great restaurants, and Marleybone just around the corner 5min walk.",5,2023,02,01
140,"Lovely weekend, spoiled a bit by feeling robbed afterwards","I have updated my review to add that they took a “discretionary service charge” without saying anything to me when we checked out, leaving me feeling like I’ve been robbed a bit after our stay. I called and asked why I didn’t get my full deposit back and he has said that he will contact the accounts team and remind the front desk staff to let guests know. It has left a bit of a sour feeling after a lovely stay.  

We stayed here as a treat to ourselves after a rough 2022. 
The staff were very friendly, the room was very clean and I loved coming in after a night out to find the bed turned down and soft music playing.
The bed was huge and very comfortable. The room was very dark and so quiet, meaning we both slept very well. 
The location was excellent for shopping, eating and the theatres. 

It is very expensive, we had a drink and they were small bottles of beer at £10 each. We didn’t eat in the hotel.",4,2023,01,31
140,A wonderful weekend!,"I cannot rate the experience of staying in The Langham highly enough. My husband had a ‘special’ birthday and right from the outset the staff made us feel like royalty.  The Executive  Club was beautifully appointed and the food and drinks were first class. Again the staff were faultless. We’d some cocktails in Artesian on the Saturday night and the atmosphere was wonderful. The room was a perfect temperature without obtrusive heating/aircon and the bed/pillows was/were the best I’ve experienced - which includes Gleneagles, Raffles and several other leading hotels. The birthday gift was a lovely gesture. I could go on, but I just want to thank the hotel for a wonderful experience. ",5,2023,01,30
140,"Amazing service, amenities and location!","The excitement of Oxford circus melts into a dream as soon as you step into the hotel, an oasis of calm and luxury. The cocktails are absolutely delicious and the staff really made you feel welcome. The pool was heavenly and never too busy during our stay and the spa staff were also so lovely. Some amazing restaurants in the area too! Sadly let down only by uncomfortable beds in the twin room. would not book a twin again as a result.",5,2023,01,30
140,"Really, truly superb - a 'must-stay' in London","This must have been our fifth or sixth stay at the Langham, and yet again they have demonstrated why we never even consider staying anywhere else when visiting London. Our visit was flawless - in fact flawless doesn't really do it justice. The class and impeccable yet unstuffy service was again abundantly evident from the first moment of dropping our car and luggage well before check-in time, and continued throughout literally every aspect of our stay. The check-in experience was fast, friendly and efficient. The rooms provided were exactly what we had hoped for, were beautifully appointed, and there were some really lovely thoughtful extras in our daughters' room (we were celebrating a birthday). The pool was lovely, calming and quiet. The Artesian bar was superb, with a very buzzy (but not too intrusive) atmosphere and lovely cocktails served with with a perfectly pitched measure of conviviality! Breakfast remains the best I have ever had in a hotel, and again, the service was just stunning. Check-out and door staff were again faultless.

Ironically, it requires monumental levels of effort and commitment from every single person on the staff (both seen and unseen) for a guest experience like this to be delivered in such a seemingly effortless manner. So I hope that the staff know that this is noticed and appreciated.

There are many hotels out there with five stars over the door but that fail to deliver; so I'm very happy to see that the Langham still delivers on every single level, and I have every faith that it will continue to do so.",5,2023,01,30
140,Perfect Weekend,"I celebrated a recent anniversary at The Langham staying for 2 nights. The whole experience from start to finish was perfect.
Attention to detail, service etc. Rooms were spacious and very comfortable.
Staff couldn't do anymore to ensure all our needs were met.",5,2023,01,30
140,Best in London-no contest.,"There are very few reviews truly deserving of 5 stars but I can honestly say that The Langham should get six stars.  The hotel is beautiful.  It’s immaculate.  It’s historic.  Nothing out of place.  Top level of luxury I’m all aspects down to the heated bathroom floors.  Service is flawless, welcoming and helpful right from the moment you enter the hotel.  The men working outside remember who you are and help you with anything you need.  Front desk is perfect and very personable.  Breakfast is phenomenal.  Location can’t be beat.  Right next to the biggest shopping and dining area in London yet tucked away to avoid the chaos.  Have stayed here several times and can’t wait to return.  Best in London for sure.",5,2023,01,26
140,One of the best London hotels,"We stayed at the langham for our anniversary this year. It was impeccable. The service. The staff, the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff went out of their way for us. 
It’s always the small touches. Definitely worthy of its 5* and one of the best hotels in London. ",5,2023,01,26

They are all very KIND and NICE and helpful whenever is needed.

140,The Lanaghan Hotel,"Fantastic beautiful hotel and csnnot recommend it highly enough.  We were celebrating my husband birthday and booked executive room with club access . We were thrilled to get a lovely upgraded room with its own lift to the ground floor, meeting room and Club lounge . The staff in the Club Roon were amazing and special mention to Aurca Cacau and Kin Hoi Thich who are the best and went out of their way to make our stay and my husband birthday the best .   We were thrilled  to find in our room most amazing birthday cake, huge bottle of sparkling /champagne wine, fruit bowel, cookies an lovely happy birthday note . Making it so special and ok departure a wonderful langham candle whhch we readied.  The Guest Manager was very friendly, helpful and cannot rate high enough. His team are the best. The Chaun spa is fabulous with a great gym and lovely swimming pool. The Artisen bar was lively and great place to have cocktails.  The Wigmore bar was beautiful and great choice of drinks. The food menu looked great but sadly the kitchen closed too early for us (8.15pm) .   However the food in the Club Roon was great . Unfortunately we didn’t have time to visit Palm a court and Roux at Landou but have been in past and on those occasions were excellent",5,2023,01,24

140,A very classy Christmas,"My teenage son and I stayed at the Langham for a classy Christmas treat. Everything was as I expected - wonderful! The highlight was the staff, all of whom were excellent. 

The greeting on arrival was special. From the men on the door taking our luggage, to being shown to reception, to being escorted to our room. We were not used to staying in a 5* hotel so this was really lovely.",5,2023,01,20
140,Could do better,"I'm not a fan of London,when i have to go I book into the best hotels to cushion the blow.
We've tried many of the major contenders and the langham we'd not  so as a treat for my wifes birthday we booked 2 rooms with our 9 year old.
Firstly the staff were excellent,the reception areas immaculate and we had high hopes.
The room was adequate,I won't criticise the view as they can't fix that,it was clean,the bed was great and it had everything i needed.
The bathroom was OK, i'd prefer either a decent shower or a decent bath instead of a mishmash of the 2. The screwed in toiletries were unfortunate as if you wanted a bath you had to stand up and get shower gel from the shower section.....and of course no bubble bath.Not really 5 star standard and that loses them a star.
Friday lunchtime we ate at the wigmore - a bit pubbish for my taste and some food average but cheese toastie  saved the day.
Booked out of hotel friday night but we like to have a drink in the hotel bar before hand,this loses them another star,main restaurant shut,main bar shut.....tried at the artesian (?) and were told our 9 year old would have to leave at 6pm and were directed to the closed bar....i complained.....we were told we could get drinks in the closed restaurant that was being used for afternoon teas.....not ideal,a bit formal and on night 2 we were told it was full with afternoon tea customers but after kicking up a fuss we were found a table.
At this price point in a top class hotel residents should have a nice area to sit,relax and be served a drink.
I should really be deducting a 3rd star as my email request 36 hours before we arrived was ignored or missed.No flowers or champagne for my wife on arrival. A complimentary bottle arrived while we were out for dinner but by then we didn't really want it.
Final gripe.....service charge for the room???Really? We'd paid over £3000 already for a weekend stay and you're adding a room service charge?
I must be out of touch.
With the competition out there we won't be back.

140,A fantastic 40th Birthday treat,"We loved our time at The Langham Hotel. It was a special treat for my 40th Birthday and we travelled as a couple with our 16 month old toddler. 
The room was beautiful and immaculately clean. We were really surprised either the lovely treats in the room for our little boy: a Teddy, a backpack, organic kids toiletries, snacks and drinks. There was a bowl of fresh fruit, a bottle of tattinger and a delicious cake along with a handwritten note wishing me a happy 40th! 
As part of the suite we had use of the Club Lounge which was great for us as was very quiet and we could relax with our little boy and not worry as it was a relaxed environment. We missed afternoon tea refreshments unfortunately but stayed from 5 until 9 enjoying the complimentary light buffet and waiter service for complimentary drinks. There was an extensive drinks menu and the service was fantastic! The staff at the Langham are  credit to the hotel. They were very attentive, friendly, and made our stay extra special. They were excellent with our little boy, entertaining him and one even went and printed off a picture of Paddington bear and found some crayons for him when he was a bit upset! The door and reception staff were fantastic. The doorman carried our boy out of a taxi and made a fuss of him and they remembered his name. Little details like this were great.
The club lounge was closed for breakfast in the morning, but was served in the beautiful restaurant instead. Very nice with lots of choice.
There is a pool, sauna and steam room buy unfortunately we didn't get time to fit this in but would have loved to.
Lastly wanted to mention the bed. It was the most comfortable bed, pillows and bedding ever! I didn't want to get out. It was also huge, I think I was bigger than a super king. Bliss!
Thanks for an amazing stay, we can't wait to come back.",5,2023,01,16
140,First Time Stay at the Lanham,"After reviewing several 5 star hotels with a spa in London, I landed on the Langham due to its proximity to other areas of London and special January rate. My deluxe room in the main building was  large and well appointed, with a separate bar/coffee area and closet just off the main hallway into the room. They were highly accommodating of an early check in and my request to stay in the main building. The bathroom was all marble with a stand-in shower/small tub combo, although it might be a bit cramped with 2 guests. I took advantage of the spa which was also a huge bonus for this hotel - quiet indoor pool with steam room and sauna in men's locker room. Staff were eager to help and always available. Location was easily accessible to areas of Marylebone and Mayfair. While I did not eat at the hotel or stop by the bar, they appeared busy and well utilized by others during my stay. Overall excellent stay and would certainly stay again.",5,2023,01,14
140,Stay elsewhere,It’s a very nice 3 star hotel with loads of infrastructure problems. Who was the architect? Weird how they have the two areas. Need to take two sets of elevators to reach certain guest rooms. Ballroom breakfast felt like a cruise ship. Why didn’t the housekeepers take away / replace used glasses? What’s up with all the 1980s technology panels? Room service was poor. And expensive. ,1,2023,01,13
140,"Wonderful stay, attentive staff, luxury experience","We stayed here for my husband's birthday. We checked in a little early and were given champagne whilst we waited. Such a wonderful touch. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special. We had balloons in the room, a cake, chocolates, biscuits, a written message and a bottle of bubbly. The room was wonderful with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was immaculate although only one tissue left in the box (I'm being picky!). We had an early dinner in the Palm Court. I did have a dirty champagne flute on my table but the waiter changed this.   I thought he may have been a little more apologetic, but it was sorted. Later that night we had cocktails in Artesian. We had a table available to us, as residents, which was really good service. The next morning we had breakfast and were sent to The Langham Club. This really was a wonderful experience. The staff really were amazing and made things so special. Looking forward to booking our next trip.",5,2023,01,04
140,Heavenly ,"As always, The Langham is heaven on earth. We were in a tight spot on New Year’s Eve, and once again The Langham came to our rescue. The most amazing hotel in the world, bar none.
It was a busy evening, but they put themselves out for us as returning customers. ",5,2023,01,01
140,Beautiful hotel and bar,We had a lovely drink in the main bar at this hotel.  Gee was a great member of staff who explained all about langhams own vineyard and we tried some of their wine which was excellent.  He also shared some of the history of the hotel with us which was really interesting.  Beautiful hotel at Christmas and excellent service - we will be back,5,2022,12,30
140,Super Xmas stay,"We booked The Langham out of all the central London 5*s for a 2 day Xmas break. It was perfect! And such a great location. From the minute we arrived the doorman helped us out with parking, the receptionist was charming and we got an upgraded room! It was in the Regent wing so a bit of a walk from reception but worth it. Lovely size room large bathroom and all lovely. As we’re all the staff we met. Bearing in mind they were on duty over Xmas they all always had a smile and were charming. We had a fabulous Xmas lunch included and it was top class. Not cheap and we were spoiling ourselves but we felt it was well worth it. Merry Xmas The Langham !",5,2022,12,26
140,Disappointed,Disappointed in service. Just checked in and all of their systems are down. Took 45 min to check in and we’ve been waiting for our luggage on top of that 30 minutes. The gentleman who checked us in was quite officious and did not even attempt to upgrade our platinum  Am Ex room giving us a room in front of the elevators.  This is not our usual Platinum Am  Ex experience. The room is just ok-I’ve stayed here before with much nicer room and service and would choose to stay elsewhere in the future.  If you have choices …pick another luxury hotel. Since writing this review we still don’t have luggage now 45 min,3,2022,12,24
140,First Class service,Service is always excellent at this very beautiful hotel. The location is great for the west end shops and theatre areas if required. This hotel offers all of the luxury you would expect and more from a inner London hotel. I would recommend to all that this experience is like no other within the area.,5,2022,12,22
140,"Highly Recommend the Langham, London","Beautiful hotel and great location but what really set it apart was the exceptional service.  The staff at the Langham London were welcoming, friendly, helpful, and really went above and beyond. Some of the best most professional service I’ve experienced. ",5,2022,12,22
140,Couldn't wish for better,"I booked an executive room for a birthday/Xmas treat for myself and my other half; and it could not have been any better. Staff were excellent, facilities amazing, and the room was everything we wanted. Bring on next year!",5,2022,12,21
140,could not be better!,"The location speaks for itself, but we were stunned on how quiet the hotel is given it's central London location.  The room was also very quiet from hall noise and adjacent guests--we didn't hear a peep from a neighbor or the common areas. Every staff encounter we had was enthusiastically helpful and pleasant, and people are super happy here.  Bell staff are rock stars at having taxis ready to go. Room size and comfort was excellent.  The 3rd floor club is well appointed with excellent food and beverage offerings, and service.  The condition of the property is exceptional--not a paint chip or scuff to be seen anywhere!  We didn't get a chance to hang out in the bar (seemed like a hip place to be!), but they were happy to serve us and let us take our drinks upstairs.  Literally nothing could have been better here! ",5,2022,12,20
140,Wonderful Hotel with Amazing Staff,"Stayed for the night for my wife’s birthday. All the staff were lovely but Chloe on the front desk went Aboyne and beyond to ensure we had a great stay and delivered a lovely bottle of champagne for us ti enjoy, which was fantastic surprise.

Breakfast was great and the pool was good too.",5,2022,12,18
140,"Excellent hotel, good value, good location.","Do not hesitate to stay here.  We enjoyed it from start to finish.  I would stay there again.   Weather was extremely cold while we were there and there was snow, but hotel tried to accommodate as much as possible and, obviously, nothing they could do about it except help you with your needs due to the weather.    ",5,2022,12,17
140,Great hotel for week in London,"We stayed a week in the Langham. We enjoyed our stay very much. Everything was comfortable the breakfast was great the staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a very good location, the choice of good restaurants are in the hotel or in the hotel area. ",5,2022,12,16
140,The Langham,"This place is brilliant, it's not not cheap, but you as we all know you tend to get what you pay for in life. The staff are fantastic.This hotel is right opposite Broadcasting House and near my old uni on Regent Street. It was great to finally stay at The Langham having seen it being converted from a BBC building and a Barclays bank back in the 80's.",5,2022,12,16
140,"Just perfect! Kindness, beautiful building, fine dining, great breakfast, excellent cocktail bar. Super location. What"," Just perfect! Kindness, beautiful building, fine dining, great breakfast, excellent cocktail bar. Super location. More than lovely Christmas decoration. Great service. What else is there to say? ⛄️🎄❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",5,2022,12,13
140,"The Langham is back, better than ever","We recently stayed at the Langham twice during November. This was our first time back to London since the pandemic and a return to the Langham. Whilst many businesses used the pandemic as an excuse to cutback on customer services and facilities the Langham have done the opposite. And what a difference it makes. The level of every aspect of this hotel has been raised to a new height of luxury. The doormen are welcoming and reassuring. Within the first day they recognised us and provided a sense of security and style. The public areas are pristine and glow with a gentle light and the signature scent that says, 'welcome home'. Our room was beautiful and wrapped us in luxury and serenity. You will not find a better bed anywhere in the world. The pool is amazing and my wife enjoyed the skilled pampering of the spa. The food offerings are all exceptional and even the Wigmore 'pub' delivers more than expected. We have stayed in many hotels around the world with so called executive lounge facilities and find them all to be similar. Not the Langham. Hands down the best lounge we have ever experienced. Of course its spotless, of course it offers great food and wonderful champagne. Of course the decor is thoughtfully curated and perfectly in keeping with Londons finest. But...the one thing that impressed us most was the staff. Everyone, from the reception desk through to the restaurant teams impressed us with their genuine care and professional manner. The Langham truly felt like a home away from home (and Australia is a long way off). So impressed were we with our Langham experience that we cancelled a booking we had for late April 23' and changed it to the Langham. We were that impressed. If you have the opportunity please stay at the Langham at least once and if you can.. make sure you book a room with lounge access. You will not be disappointed.!",5,2022,12,13
140,Another fabulous stay,"We always look forward to our stay at The Langham, once again we have nothing but happy memories everyone looks after you so well we didn’t want to leave!
We try and fit three weekends in a year, it’s our little break away and we are already looking forward to staying again.",5,2022,12,12
140,Proposal/Engagement Stay at The Langham,"I decided to book The Langham for our stay to propose to my partner, as one of our first dates was at The Artesian, and would highly recommend The Langham for anyone else looking for a special occasion! The hotel staff and Guest services team was incredible and helped out far in advance and during our stay to make it special. ",5,2022,12,12
140,Marvelous hote - consider staying in the Regent wing,We stayed in the Regent building which has its own separate entrance and is above the fabulous swimming pool and spa.  The room was elegant and spacious. Breakfast in the Roux at the Landau had both an extensive buffet and menu; the food was outstanding.  We had dinner one evening at the Palm Court which was  delicious.  The concierge was very helpful in booking a terrific restaurant which was a 10 minute walk from the hotel. ,5,2022,12,11
140,Best of London,Our seven-night stay was excellent in every way.  Bath was one of the best we have ever experienced.  Staff was amazing and we enjoyed the dining room very much.  This hotel will be our first-choice next time we are in London,5,2022,12,10
140,Centrally located luxury!,"The hotel is gorgeous. The atmosphere is so welcoming with a beautiful scent wafting throughout the lobby and hallways. The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. The breakfast was amazing and although the room was on the small side, the bathroom was huge with marble heated floors and a giant tub. This was a very welcome respite from all the walking we were doing every day (not to mention the cold and rain). Also, the hotel was central to every place we wanted to visit and a short hop to the tube if we needed to go further.",5,2022,12,06
140,Excellent hotel,"Top notch 5/6* hotel! Not a single complaint . Everything perfect. Rooms, cleanliness , service , quality all 10/10. Location is perfect too. Close to Oxford circus tube station and close to all the shopping , departmental stores on Oxford street, Regent st.  shops on Bond and new bond street. Walkable to the lovely Marylebone village nearby and lots of good food. It’s walking distance to Carnaby street too where Liberty store is. Practically you have the whole of London stores at your doorstep. With a bus just at the doorstep , 22 will take you to Knightsbridge and Chelsea as well! I highly recommend this lovely hotel! ",5,2022,12,05
140,Recent London stay,"Nice location, services and great staff. However, there are better 5 stars hotels in London in terms of value for money and quality of room facilities. My recommendation is to do a room improvement as soon as possible. ",4,2022,12,04
140,Another great stay,Excellent service and great location for central London. Room was very comfortable and had agreat view. The Cub was great for breakfast and evening buffets.  Always feel like staying in our own pad in London.,5,2022,12,03
140,Coming home,"I count myself very fortunate to stay here, you receive the warmest of welcomes from the handsomely dressed door man to the reception staff. 

The room are beautiful, practical & comforting like being at home. 

My only improvement would be the seating in the palm court is to low for the tables, we felt a little hunched over which isn’t comfortable. 

The staff as always are wonderful, treated myself to a nice candle, the Christmas trees look magical.",5,2022,11,29
140,"Even with major rate increase, remains our favourite in London -- pool should be open later though","We all really like this hotel, even after the hotel raised its rates considerably this past year, having stayed in many of London's top hotels. This is probably our 5th visit to the hotel. We had a deluxe room connected to a corner executive room. Everything works well; the staff is very accommodating. The key cards and air conditioning system worked better this time after the staff kept programming room keys with the wrong number -- if you have rooms 311 and 313 interconnecting, the keys need to be programmed to room 312 which is the hallway door that leads to the two rooms. This is really important to know. The Lounge is excellent. Dinner and breakfast at the Palm Court also excellent. They stopped giving out small liquid bath amenties and there are now large containers in the room. I like the gym, steam room and pool which is heated decently, and there is even a bathing suit spinner. Only thing I wish here is that the pool should not close at 9pm. It's too early and several nights I come in from evening activity or a flight and want to be able to use the pool and not just the gym. (The pool door was locked this time.) Really good hotels in cities you fly into at night keep their pools open till 11.",5,2022,11,28
140,Awful experience at the Langham,"Awful experience at Langham!

Got to the hotel just before 3 and got informed that there’s going to be wait for the room even though check in is at 3pm!! After complaining we got offered complementary drinks at the bar, which involved further waiting to be seated as the receptionist that escorted us to the bar decided it was appropriate to make us wait while he chatted to another customer! Eventually they gave us another room, who knows how long we’d have to wait if we didn’t complain.

Upon returning to our room several hours later we found that our keys have been disabled! More time wasting travelling back to the reception to get keys reactivated!

But best part was following check out when I had to phone up at 10pm to see why I’ve still not received the final bill which should have been in my email at the time of check out. The final bill had extra items added from mini bar which we never took! They must have thought we are idiots and will never ask for their final bill. So make sure to check your final bill after leaving the hotel!

I’m shocked and appalled with the customer and wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. This was not a 5 star experience, barely a 2 star.",1,2022,11,28
140,A  classic/classy hotel with great service and attention to details,"Went with my daughter and would go again for any occasion as great hotel and great people.  Has all the facilities to appeal to anyone with great service including housekeeping, room service, front desk, doormen, and conseirge. ",5,2022,11,27
140,Hospitality at it's Best,"I wish to congratulate the management of The Langham, London for hiring the best staff and for maintaining the hotel pretty well. 
The staff made us feel truly welcome when we first arrived and sent us off when we checked out like we were leaving our home!    
The rooms are well-maintained and well-appointed. Everything in the guest room is curated. 
The food completes the homey experience. The afternoon tea is a must-try!
The Langham, London is highly recommended. ",5,2022,11,26
140,Afternoon Tea,"Sit back and imagine what you would like your perfect afternoon tea experience to be like, open your eyes, you are at the Langham. My wife and I had the best experience at the Langham whilst having afternoon tea there. The staff were both discrete and yet attentive, they catered to our needs and the food was excellent. If you have had a long morning shopping on Oxford Street, head a little way north and have one of the best afternoon tea experiences that you can have.",5,2022,11,26
140,Excellent Hotel,"We have stayed in several five star hotels in London, and found the facilities and service at the Langham equal to or better than any of them, at a more reasonable price. Couldn't have had a better five days with my wife. Highly recommended.",5,2022,11,24
140,Event / Birthday Party / Hirer ,"We did an event at the Langham London 
The food was really nice for the crew and performers... all staff were lovely apart from Sarah, the food & beverage manager (very rude, uninviting) really didn't care we were the customer and hiring the ball room.
to the point, the event nearly got cancelled, 1 hour before guests arrived.
Jonathan on duty shift manager was awesome.
",2,2022,11,22
140,Tennyson,"A seamless class experience .

 We arrived in our car to be met at the front entrance by very welcoming valet parking .  Baggage transfer was seamless , our room was ready early , and everything about our stay was perfect .

 We will be returning here for more London nights out . . . . . .",5,2022,11,22
140,Great stay,"Great visit to the Langham on a quick business trip. Although certain areas were lacking in service, general housekeeping of areas and attentiveness of reception staff left one a little disappointed. However, the waiters were absolutely fabulous, they went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable, which is wonderful especially as I was dining alone. Please pass on my thanks to a very gracious gentleman from the hotel bar, he is a real treasure in your hotel! ",4,2022,11,21
140,"Fantastic hotel, outstanding service.","This is an outstanding hotel, clean, friendly, beautiful, great breakfast, great location. Fantastic. Close to shopping.
Close to tube. We had a great experience and will stay again. We especially liked the staff. Very very helpful ",5,2022,11,21
140,Night at the Opera,"Stayed at the Langham before (3 nights - 2021), exceptional service then coming out of COVID.  This trip was a family affair and placed some special demands on the team who once again rose to the occasion.  A truly wonderful stay where nothing was too much trouble given our circumstances.  A great place to stay, fantastic staff, looking to go again soon we hope.",5,2022,11,18
140,Comfortable and relaxing,"Excellent hotel to base yourself in to explore the city.The staff are attentive and caring.
Would stay again when in London or any location around the world that there is a Langham hotel.
In room breakfast excellent experience.",5,2022,11,18
140,A London Jewel outside the Castle!,"For a truly relaxed high service experience, the Langham is at the top of the list. 

The food, ambiance and service was very impressive. 

The holiday decorations were wonderfully executed as well!

Although the gourmet restaurant is closed right now, the other options, for our tastes, more than filled the gap. And the staff was so accommodating to our changing needs for in room dining and transportation!

They were also a great resource for guidance around an ever-expanding city. 

We love London and are sure to be back at the Langham soon! Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so memorable!",5,2022,11,15
140,Need to see what the competition is achieving.,"There are a lot of positives when we stayed.  The best of which were the staff.  However, the rooms felt like the hotel had given up trying.  Nothing massively wrong, and this is only minor irritations.  Apart from one big annoying part.  We have stayed in many grades of hotel around the world at some point, and with some lower grade hotels, you can see the extra they go to improve.  Things such as clearing away used glasses, cups and rubbish daily.  Two nights with the remains of champagne in the bottom of two glasses, not expected.  However, things such as USB charging points, or night reading lights.  Even premier inns do these.  Toilet paper that doesn't feel like sandpaper would also improve the feeling that £630 per night was worth it.  However, interrupted sleep due to a noisy bathroom extraction fan that was improved, but not irradiated, will be our reason for reconsidering our stays at this hotel in the future.",3,2022,11,14
140,Fantastic hotel and service as usual ,"Stayed here with my granddaughter as a birthday treat. As usual all staff amazing. Especially the guys helping us get taxis in the pouring rain.  
Expensive but great service and valet parking a bonus.  
Will stay again!  ",5,2022,11,13
140,Perfect,"Great place to stay for business trips. Clean rooms and friendly and accommodating staff, it definitely stood out to me from a services perspective, especially given the current challenges in the hospitality industry. I'll definitely consider it on my next trip to London. ",5,2022,11,11
140,Classis elegance,"Classic elegance indeed.  AMX recommended it and that was a good call.  Centrally located.  Pre-trip, the concierge staff was instrumental in helping with tours, dinner reservations, etc.  The entire staff was friendly, polished and professional.  We experienced a minor system malfunction in our room, and staff addressed it immediately and completely - - and with profuse apologies.  That's service.  A delightful stay (6+ days).   Saw the pool and spa  - - GORGEOUS!- - but time constraints precluded our enjoying them.  Next time, however, . . .  ",5,2022,11,05
140,Another memorable stay!,"We have been staying at The Langham since 5 years and it has always been a memorable stay! Their lounge is one of the best in London! The Executive rooms are just perfect- could be a bit bigger/ depends on your luck on which room you are given. 
Their indoor heated swimming pool and the steam and Sauna are fantastic!",5,2022,11,05
140,The Langham London,"I was in awe of this gorgeous hotel from the moment i saw the bellman with the long coat and hat. This is a Cinderella’s dream. Accommodations fit for royalty. Service fit for The Queen, rest her soul. ",5,2022,11,02
140,A true Gem in central London,"The Langham is truly amazing in every aspect, it’s welcoming, comfortable, friendly and a beautiful hotel. Located in central London but some how feels calm , quiet . A stones throw from beautiful Marylebone with its village vibe .",5,2022,11,02
140,Great stay.,"Great location in central London and a great property. 
Visited close to Christmas - it was beautiful.. some of the best decorations. 
Food is great - breakfast and room service options as well as restaurants and proximity to other options. Great vegetarian and vegan options. Amazing to see nice non-alcoholic options in the mini bar. 
Room was new and spacious but quite a way from the reception.. got lost once or twice. 
Gym is very good. Very much recommended.",5,2022,10,30
140,Wonderful hotel in central London,"One of the best hotels I have experienced. Very clean rooms, great breakfast and lunch, incredible kind staff, big room with beautiful bathroom, 2 times a day cleaning service, everything was completely wonderful!!!",5,2022,10,27
140,The ultimate luxury experience in the best location,"As Aussie's experiencing the Langham London for the first time, this was a fantastic place to stay. The service we received from the moment we stepped out of our taxi, to the moment we stepped back into one was spot on and genuinely friendly. We particularly enjoyed the Executive Club as a beautiful way to start each morning, in a gorgeously decorated space that is calm and welcoming. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and getting on the tube to experience London. We will be back!",5,2022,10,25
140,4th time visit and we keep coming back to the Langham!,"When we planned our visit to London, it was obvious we wanted to come back to the Langham. We had already visited 3 times this great establishment due to its location, service and superb atmosphere - and these same reasons are still very valid. We spent 4 wonderful days in London pampered by the Langham. Our family of 4 had one de luxe room and another junior suite, which was a great combo!
Having a suite allowed us to use the lounge, which serves snacks and refreshments throughout the day, besides offering also breakfast. Quality of service and the whole selection there was great. On saturday and sunday mornings breakfast was quite busy, which resulted in a bit longer wait times with coffee and eggs, which was a minor downside only.
We enjoyed lunch and dinner once at Palm Court restaurant, which was very good. We also swam 3 times in the pool with the kids as well as appreciated a lot the well equipped gym. Hotel also organized our transport back and forth from Heathrow which was very nice for us.
Special thank you to the personnel at the entrance and lobby counter: they were extra friendly, helpful to all needs and hence we felt from the 1st second entering the hotel that we are welcome!",5,2022,10,25
140,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"The Langham London has everything you'd want in a five-star hotel. It runs the length of a city block yet has the feel of a small boutique hotel, with staff that learns your name and is eager to assist to make your stay exceptional. And though it's a big place, it's designed so it never feels overwhelming or cavernous; rather, it's quietly elegant.

And the rooms are extremely large and well appointed. We had an ""executive room"" that had a separate sitting area, vanity area and bedroom, and plenty of closet space -- it was larger than most London hotels' suites.

Plus, the Langham itself has several excellent on-site bars/restaurants, an amazing spa (complete with indoor pool, sauna and steam rooms) and even offers cooking and wine classes. And the location is walking distance to great shopping, top restaurants, the theatre and more, and the Oxford Circus tube stop is less than three blocks away. Even most business meetings we had while in town were walking distance.  

It's absolutely five stars all the way -- but priced more reasonably than most other five star properties in London. We will definitely be back!",5,2022,10,23
140,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel, great staff and great atmosphere. Very relaxed hotel and always feel unhurried which is great when you just want to relax. The staff are all very on the ball and thoroughly nice people",5,2022,10,21
140,Birthday Celebration,"My friend and I recently stayed at The Langham.  We encountered a couple of issues with our bedroom which was swiftly addressed by Mr Mostafa Ibrahim.   Mostafa was kind, patient and attentive. He truly has the customer’s best interest at heart.  We are grateful for his assistance.",5,2022,10,18
140,Well done and classic touches near Regents Park!,"Inviting space just south of Regents Park, steps from Oxford Circus. From check in to the quality concierge to the dining and restaurant/bar options, a very solid facility. The staff was wonderful, happy, and very cordial. The morning breakfast service in two different locales was a great way to start the day. I was the only one of our party to use the spa which was great but the others used the gym and pool and had solid reviews.  The room was small but well appointed and the bathroom was elegant in its finishes..The concierge helped this group of mates once again score phenomenal seats for the Premier league matches as well… second year in a row for us and we hope to be back again next fall….Staff is extremely attentive and it makes a difference!",5,2022,10,16
140,Mediocre,"Average experience to be honest. Very overpriced food and drink. No chocolate for turn down service. Small bathroom with a leaking shower. Incredibly noisy from outside, bed rattled due to the tube. Check in was good, had to ask for a glass of Champaign on arrival. Pretty average overall experience",3,2022,10,12
140,"This is Luxury, Excellent Location,  Excellent Staff","Stayed at the Langham for our 20th Wedding Anniversary .  Fantastic Hotel 5 stars all the way.  Rooms excellent , Breakfast was very nice only complaint is to much choice when it comes to tea I just like plane Tetley or a PG tip teabag however they even went out of there way to accommodate.  Yes it is pricey but if you can afford it you must try it .I wished now that I booked another stay with the Langham instead of Intercontinental Park Lane . Looking forward to coming back .  The bar is really good I would of liked to try the Palm Court but the night I stayed it was booked.",5,2022,10,04
140,Mind blowing experience,"We are used to five star hotels in Europe, this was our first in London and it was exceptional. The hotel in itself is beautiful. The staff is very friendly and helpful (big thanks to Lily from the lounge club). We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and we had an upgrade as well as little surprises waiting for us in our room. It was just perfect ! Can’t wait to come back.",5,2022,10,04
140,London holiday,"Langham continue to be one of my favorite hotels.  They provide good service in all areas:  Bell, Front Desk, Concierge, Dining, etc.  The location is very convenient and the room is very comfortable and clean.",4,2022,10,04
140,An excellent hotel,"We had a family trip to Langham for our 30th wedding anniversary. We booked 5 rooms and had traveled from all over the country by car as there was a train strike that day.  We felt frazzled when we arrived but the welcome was warm, the cars taken off for valet parking without fuss and nothing was too much trouble from the moment we arrived.  Prem Kochman was the duty manager who helped us check in. He could not have been more welcoming and was so kind. 
All of us had such a lovely stay. The rooms were very comfortable. The beds, linen and towels were all luxurious. We loved the pool! Every person we came across was genuinely kind and wanted guests to be at home and at ease. In our room we were given a lovely bottle of champagne, some fruit and a delicious honey cake. We would definitely choose the Langham again.",5,2022,10,03
140,One night not enough,"I was in London for a business trip and had one night free for which I wanted to stay in a nicer hotel than the corporate one. Was looking for something central and when I found the Langham it looked so luxurious and the location was ideal. It didn’t disappoint! I got the regular room as it was just for one night which was comfortable enough, but for a longer stay I would have booked a larger size. High brand toiletries and lovely design accents in the room. Didn’t have time to eat at the restaurants as the whole stay was less than 24 hours so I didn’t get to experience much but if you can afford the splurge do try! They have an offer if you book directly on their website for a free night on a minimum night stay so check that out, it can make it more attainable. 
Brilliant, would love to go back.",5,2022,10,02
140,Great place in London,"If you want a memorable experience in London, this is a great place to stay in. It is an expensive hotel, but it worths the money. Is near the main attractions in London and you can take a long walk to many places from there.",5,2022,09,30
140,Weekend stay,If you haven't stayed at this superb hotel you are missing out ... we had a great weekend thanks to the wonderful staff ..superb rooms.. great pool ...amazing food... excellent location ... I could go on.. just fabulous...thank you x,5,2022,09,27
140,A truly wonderful stay,"I booked The Langham as an alternative location to stays we usually have in a London.  What a wonderful choice it was!  

My mother and I arrived at the hotel a little too early for check in, but, Mike, the concierge at the door, immediately took our bags, issued us a ticket and said ‘not a problem and our bags would go straight up to the room once allocated at check in’.  Such a seamless arrival and we were able to go straight in for some coffee and admire the beautiful drawing room being set up ready for afternoon teas.

We returned later after a spot of shopping and the manager, Prem Kochman, at the front desk promptly gave us our keys and a glass of champagne with which to walk to our room with.  What a lovely touch! Delightfully, on walking into our standard twin room, my mother was greeted with a very welcome surprise of champagne, chocolates and a beautiful honey cake!  This really was such a thoughtful acknowledgement of my mother’s birthday.  A truly beautiful arrangement of fresh flowers were also neatly arranged in the vase on the bureau.

On returning in the evening, turn down service had been and we were able to slip straight into our superbly comfortable beds with quality linens. The ‘White Company’ sleep spray made it all the more easy to fall asleep on the enormously comfy pillows. A perfectly quiet night followed, with no disturbance.  I should add that the air con could be adjusted to a comfortable level and was ‘quiet as a mouse’ too. 

In the morning we enjoyed a Nespresso coffee or two from the machine in the room and enjoyed the little bottle of semi skimmed milk thoughtfully left in the room, meaning no awkward call to request some from reception/room service.  Big fluffy towels were fab too but I noted that the floor was not heated, despite other reviews saying that they were.  The Diptique bathroom toiletries were a gorgeous scent to use when showering though!

Check out was seamless too.  We were advised the night before, of the front entrance being closed but the concierge team were there to guide us on exit.  Also, Alex Yuen, who dealt with us on check out, was so helpful when offering to store our bags.  His conversation with us about our plans was well received and his suggestion that there would be a ‘surprise’ for my daughter and niece when we returned to pick up our luggage was such a thoughtful gesture, really going above and beyond any expectations.  True to his word, there were two little teddy bears tucked into our bags when we returned. What a lovely thing to do!

We cannot thank The Langham enough for making my mother’s birthday celebration such a wonderful stay!  Service is most definitely what staff here get right.  Flawless in every sense of the word.  We will be back! An enormous thank you to you all for making us feel so welcome and part of The Langham family x",5,2022,09,26
140,Five start hotel adds a service charge at the end.,I was surprised that my check out added a service charge. I guess for folks looking in Mayfair this hotel has a lot of street noise at night. Food and service was great. Just disappointed with service charge where you expect great service at the rate they charge and lots of ally noise. ,2,2022,09,26
140,Grest experience. Best place to stay in London,"Very hard to find fault at The Langham. 
It is expensive, but worth it,  An overall brilliant hotel in brilliant location an easy walk to London attractions. Wonderful staff only too pleased to answer any queries. ",4,2022,09,22
140,Birthday Stay,"The Langham exceeded my expectations on a very short one-night birthday trip that I wish could have been longer! From the moment of arrival, the front desk staff took great care in answering my questions and accommodating some requests.   We had a very early train to catch and we were able to have a full breakfast brought up along with some takeout boxes in case we didn’t have time to finish it all.   My friend and I were celebrating a special birthday and received a lovely surprise both in room and when having tea in the Palm Court.   The Palm Court team was so lovely and accommodating to our group who had various dietary restrictions and preferences without batting an eye.  We visited another supposedly comparable hotel in Paris after our stay at the Langham and it did not compare in the slightest.   I can’t wait to plan another trip to London and treat myself to a stay in my new home away from home at the Langham! ",5,2022,09,19
140,Another Great Stay !,"We stayed at the Langham Hotel this visit for only two nights, wish we had more time ! This is a terrific place to stay while in the London, location is easy to get around plus it has plenty of street to just walk around. The entire hotel staff our outstanding, always very friendly and more than willing to assist with any questions.",5,2022,09,19
140,Great Stay,"It was very much a great stay. Check in was easy and they fit us in early. We often called down for things and they were great. The location is also fantastic. So close to the Oxford Circus station. Bed was so comfortable.

 I'll nitpick a few things but they did not take away from the experience.

1. The bathroom was awkward. Very small shower, only one person could fit. The large door always seemed to be in the way. 
2. Breakfast service was weird, but not bad by any means. Slow to greet on some days, immediate service the next. Miscommunications about orders but minor and when brought up immediately fixed. Coffee and food quality were excellent. 
3. No USB ports near the bed. A US plug was at the desk. ",5,2022,09,14
140,Amazing Place with Amazing Staff,"My husband and I stayed at the Langham about two weeks ago. We found the hotel to be absolutely beautiful, remarkably clean and very welcoming. The staff were all very professional and helpful.  The food was delicious and expertly prepared. The location was excellent, we were able to walk to many places, including Starbucks right across the street. We're already looking forward to our next stay.",5,2022,09,13
140,Top luxury hotel with prime location ,"First all big shout out to Ahmed, the sales director as he took care of my booking and tailored all services to my ""above expectations"" level. The hotel is very well maintained and the breakfast is really tasty as well as the afternoon tea. The hotel got a very unique nice smell which makes you calm when you wall through its corridors. Laura from housekeeping was amazing and addressed me with my name which made me feel very special. The location of this hotel is a plus and the spa is quiet good as well.",5,2022,09,13
140,Great stay,Excellent room stay and wedding reception function. There were no problems at all and staff were uniformly helpful. Palm court restaurant can be excessively hectic and apparently understaffed which detracts from the food quality,5,2022,09,13
140,Lovely place with amazing waiter,"I visited The Langham for afternoon tea after having been at the Claridge’s a day earlier. Despite the doormen not being interested in acknowledging my greeting, I really liked the afternoon tea. My friendly waiter Gee was amazing. I am not a tea person, I usually prefer coffee, but I asked Gee to choose teas for me. He did an outstanding job and I loved the teas that he matched with my sandwiches, pastries and scones. The sandwiches were very tasty. The pastries were also very good. The scones were too sweet for my taste and the clotted cream was dry like grated parmesan cheese. Julie took over from Gee and she was very kind & friendly too. Thank you, guys!",5,2022,09,10
140,Best location,Had a few days here for a conference and it was very very good. The conference facilities and food was great and the staff were so helpful. The location is prime being so close to everything and the bars and restaurants are also superb. Definitely recommend this place.,4,2022,09,09
140,The Langham London,"Excellent luxury hotel, but not at all stuffy.  Staff were very friendly and professional.  Room was superb and very clean.  We used the pool, and although quite small it was still good with separate male and females saunas/steam rooms.  Afternoon tea was delicious as were the breakfasts.  Would definitely go back!",5,2022,09,06
140,The problem with this hotel is it sets the bar!,"There is only one issue with this hotel and it's that it sets the bar for hotels everywhere!  We arrived in a very cold April, and it could not have been a more welcoming respite. The entire team were very welcoming, managed to check us into our room early to recover from an overnight flight. The entire hotel is sublime, the rooms are perfectly formed and amazingly luxurious, and the hotel pool / spa area is also perfect and a must visit even just for a few minutes. It's a true sanctuary in the heart of London and a perfect base to explore the city. It's worth the money, no doubt!",5,2022,08,29
140,A real treat,"My brother and I had afternoon Tea at The Langham in August. It was a real treat. From the opulent decor, pianist and the super comfortable seats to the staff with their attention to detail, we felt like royalty for the afternoon.

The vegetarian sandwiches were super tasteful with a real spread of flavours from fillings that included Jackfruit and Artichoke to the classic cream cheese and cucumber. The deserts were melt-in-your- mouth good 😋 and just heavenly. To top it all off, the scones were warm, fluffy and soft. It was a real delight to be able to dine here. Big thanks also to all the staff who offered incredible service.",5,2022,08,28
140,Experience at The Langham,"It was a wonderful experience and look forward to a repeat stay. The hotel staff are friendly and warm. The room is very neat though baggage space was small. Overall, is comfortable and your close to Oxford Street and other high streets.",5,2022,08,27
140,Brilliant afternoon tea,"A birthday treat at the hotel - tea. It was lovely. The decor, the staff and the flavours of the food. Particularly want to praise Magda who looked after us so well. It was relaxed, efficient and calm, with an amazing atmosphere.",5,2022,08,25
140,Palm Court breakfast staff need training,"I’ve stayed at London Langham before and it is an excellent overall experience each time. However, this time the service at the Palm Court restaurant was noticeably lacking. Perhaps the staff is new, but they made the most basic mistakes every day at breakfast. I would ask for simple things like ice water and they would forget. Or butter for my toast, or cream for coffee, etc.  these are simple things they couldn’t get right. I never complained because I could see the staff was trying and they were very friendly.  Still, I expected better from Langham and especially the legendary Palm Court restaurant. The afternoon tea service was better, thanks to one gentleman … I wish I had gotten his name but he wore a blue suit so maybe he was the manager.

Everything else was excellent.",5,2022,08,22
140,Stayed For a Month,I loved my stay here the staff were amazing. They made me feel at home. The room's are great and the lobby and afternoon tea is simply lovely. The hotels location is great too. I highly recommend them.,5,2022,08,22
140,Living on its name,"We stayed for three nights in a family room.  Lots of space and the beds were comfortable.  The big downside was I could not get the toilet to flush appropriately.  I called for the engineers and they came right away and adjusted the pressure, but it still didn’t help.  I ended up using the bathroom on the first floor for my entire stay.  In addition the bathroom sink drained very slowly unless I took the stopper out so the water could drain.  It just felt like no one had checked our room to make sure it was ready for guests before they put us in it.  At the level that one expects from the Langham, I was disappointed.  Smaller things included the toiletries being bolted to the wall and the pool being cold.  If you want to save money on toiletries, then give out sample sizes to the guests and refresh them every day.  We came from a luxury hotel in Venice that did just that.  Having them bolted to the wall makes it awkward to use.  And the pool wasn’t just our observation, we were there with three other families and each commented on how cold the pool was.  I own a pool and know how expensive they are to heat, but again, you’re the Langham and if the rates aren’t high enough to pay for pool heat, you should raise them.  Your guests are price elastic, but have high expectations.  Let me note that the service we received from everyone we interacted with was excellent.  It just feels like the Langham is penny pinching in a number of areas, and that shouldn’t be happening at a hotel of this caliber. ",2,2022,08,22
140,Customer Experience #1,"Exceptional customer focus, the best I ever experienced and exemplified by Rodrigo on reception who was a complete superstar.

Great central location with easy walking to local restaurants, attractions and shopping. Great base for an experience in London.",5,2022,08,21
140,By far the best hotel in London!,"At the suggestion of a good friend, I booked The Langham London for my much needed solo trip and it was by far—the best hotel in London!!  It is centrally located so I could easily walk to museums, shopping and hop on tour buses a short distance from the hotel.  The highlight of my trip was without a doubt, the hotel and its staff.  From the bell staff, front desk, spa, concierge and the entire team at the Artesian bar I felt like part of the family as soon as I walked in. Even though I was traveling alone, I never felt alone during my stay.  Whenever I needed suggestions on what sights to see or places to go, your staff always offered great options.  And when I wanted to do the best staycation day, I started with breakfast at Palm Court, had a wonderful signature massage at the spa and spent my evening under the expert service of Giulia and Lorenzo at the Artesian!! Genuine customer service reigns supreme at The Langham London and I would definitely recommend this hotel if traveling on business or for leisure.",5,2022,08,21
140,Has-been hotel,"- Staff unpolite and not helpful (mostly with the luggage)
- Rooms ridiculously small for the price and what you can expect from a five-star hotel (no room to open two luggages)
- Old rooms needing a serious refurbishment 
- Good location in London ",2,2022,08,21
140,A wonderful hotel.....but....,"For our silver wedding anniversary I decided to repay the kindness showed to me by the Langham Hotel (there was an issue over a booking for my 50th Birthday which they handled truly superbly) by booking a stay at the hotel. I felt it was the least I could do having been treated so well by them when the mix up occurred. 

I cannot fault the hotel, there was fantastic attention to detail (especially in the spa area which was stunning) a lovely honey cake arrived in our room with fresh fruit, breakfast was stunning and for those of you on a slightly tighter budget thinking that you cannot dine or drink at the Langham, try their pub called The Wigmore it is really good value for money.  

The but in my title comes from the new 5% accommodation service charge they have introduced. I booked an paid for our stay upfront and was somewhat disgruntled to find that the price I had paid and was quoted (thinking it was all done) was not the price at all but there was another £25 or so per night to add on. 
Apparently this was introduced by the hotel in November 2021. 

Perhaps this 5% is discretionary ????  and I am aware of thigs like 'Amenities charges' at US hotels. However, call me old fashioned I sort of think that when you agree a price and you pay up front then excluding minibar etc (of course) this is the price you pay? 

Perhaps to the normal clientelle of Hotels of this stature, this charge is 'small potatoes' but to me it makes a longer stay here almost out of reach. 

I do not want the majority of my review to dwell on this, the hotel is unbelievable and if you can stay there, DO !! You won't be disappointed but it seems as if the hotel and service cultures from the US etc are creeping in and I think that is a huge shame. For all UK hotels, let us pay the price quoted, no hidden costs and let us reward/tip excellent service ourselves rather than enforce service charges please",5,2022,08,19
140,Exceptional classy service and made to feel very special.,"Langham London - tick! Life long dream to stay at The Langham. Ours was only a very quick overnight stay in London but the quality of service, staff professionalism & luxurious facilities were outstanding. ",5,2022,08,13
140,Stately and historic,"Stately and luxurious, the Langham London was a fantastic stay right in the busy heart of London. I received an accessible room which was a but modified but gave a huge amount of space. Service was top notch and everything very comfortable. 

The attached pub was a treat - an upscale pub experience. However I had heard a lot about the cocktail bar, which was a letdown - I just didn’t find anything so interesting about it given the reputation. 

Will stay there again when back on business.",5,2022,08,13
140,Anniversary Trip,"Let me preface this by saying that this was our first time staying at a Langham hotel. We were deciding between the Langham and the Browns hotel, which we have stayed at multiple times before. We decided on the Langham back in February for our anniversary trip and I’m so glad we did! The hotel was so beautiful and the staff couldn’t have been more lovely. It felt like classic London. Upon arrival, they had left a little anniversary surprise in our room which I thought was very sweet. Staff can really make or break how enjoyable a hotel stay is and I was more than pleased with the Langham staff. 

There were excellent dining options which was important to us, and we enjoyed many nights in their cocktail bar as well as many afternoon lunches and teas at Palm Court.  The hotel is also in a great location if you are looking to be around great shopping and restaurants. We were close enough to Hyde Park for a walk and even closer to Regents Park. 

The rooms itself are also very nice and spacious. We stayed in the least expensive room, and it was still very sizable. The beds were very plush and comfortable as well. We will be traveling back to London next summer, and we will definitely choose the Langham again.",5,2022,08,11
140,Luxury at its finest,"This hotel and its staff were impeccable from start to finish. I’ve stayed in many iconic hotels and this one for me was one of my favourite as an all rounder. The staff are intensively trained and some of the most polite and helpful people I have ever come across. The hotel was immaculate and the fine touches to detail in the rooms, including langham postcards and bespoke shopping bags were lovely touches. The food was amazing and very reasonably priced in comparison to other 5 star hotels. I look forward to coming back soon.",5,2022,08,10
140,Wonderful stay for wife's 60th,"The Langham was wonderful as were the staff and service - my wife received a Langham candle and we got champagne, chocolates and cake in the room complementary - it's these touches that make all the difference - the staff are all amazing - from check-in to turn down service to leaving - it's was a joyous experience",5,2022,08,08
140,Wonderful Stay at The Langham,We had an amazing stay at The Langham. The service was impeccable. The location of the hotel was great for our trip. We loved our dining experience at the hotel especially Artesian and Palm Court. We can’t wait to go back! ,5,2022,08,04
140,15 nights of exceptional service,We had an unplanned trip to London when my daughter got into a 2 week program at the royal ballet and with nothing else but the internet to look at locations and rating's we chose the Langham for location and quality.  The decision turned out to be the best one for both reasons.  The hotel was very central to all London has to offer and the quality of the hotel and the excellent staff made it the best hotel experience I have ever had.  When we checked out we felt like we were leaving family behind.   I would highly recommend the Langham to anyone looking for a great experience in London. ,5,2022,08,02
140,Magical place in central London,"I visited the Langham because of the recommendation from a friend. I’m very happy I made  this choice! From the moment you step in and get greeted by the doormen to the staff in the Artesian bar that creates a magical experience just for me (us), everything was amazing. It’s definitely a place I want to get back to! Also, I loved the scent in the foyer, so much I ended up buying an air diffuser with it!",5,2022,08,01
140,Another superb stay,"If I could rate  higher than 5 I would. As far as service goes, there is nothing that is too much. Every small request of mine was done, from a coffee mug to smaller slippers. I asked to move rooms and it was done with no problem. Just a lovely few days that went way too quick",5,2022,07,27
140,not worth it,"Obviously the hotel cannot handle the influx of tourists.
The staff were unprepared and management had no answers for their lack of service
Do not waste your money as it is definitely not a five star experience.
",1,2022,07,25
140,Service is wonderful,"The service at this hotel in every department was excellent.  We called to complain about an air conditioning problem, and a very friendly and capable technician came and took care of the problem within 30 minutes from reporting it.  I guess if you're spending 1200 on a room, someone should jump at your requests and they do.",5,2022,07,23
140,Luxurious stay at Langham for graduation trip,I enjoy my stay at Langham for my graduation trip. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bed is very comfortable which gave me good sleep. I felt great when I returned to hotel at night like home. Highly recommended to have a cocktail in Artesian!,5,2022,07,23
140,Wonderful honeymoon stay,"We stayed at the langham for four nights in a club room in july for our honeymoon. 
We travelled up to London from Cornwall on the sleeper train so we arrived at the langham at 0600hrs, obviously too early for check in. However  Mustaffa on reception kindly let us have a room for a few hours to freshen up and rest before going out sightseeing in London.
The club room we had was fantastic as was the club lounge .Nothing was too much trouble for the staff in the club lounge and they ensured  our glasses were always topped up with champagne. 
The staff in the club lounge who made our stay so enjoyable were Hoy, lise, Alex and vitalis. 
Housekeeping kept our room immaculately clean and the doormen were really welcoming and efficient. 
A truely wonderful stay and we are looking forward to returning next year.",5,2022,07,18
140,Beautiful hotel,Stayed here with my wife for her birthday. We had some issues with the facilities in our room. The hotel acted promptly and when it was found the issue was not resolvable we were moved to a better room immediately. Location is great. Food and bars serving top level food and drinks. Would highly recommend. Will be returning soon.,5,2022,07,18
140,"Beautiful Hotel, lovely location","Gorgeous hotel with wonderful amenities. Just note that the standard rooms are very small, the bed was also quite smaller than expected  (I believe was a Queen/Double Bed instead of a King) We are a shorter couple so was fine, but would be too short for anyone over 5'10"". The bathtub/shower is also small/narrow in points, so if you are a larger person or if traveling with child in room,  get a larger room as will be more comfortable",5,2022,07,14
140,Luxury weekend,"I love everything about the langham. it’s my favourite hotel in London. the smell is amazing, the staff are extraordinary and the experience from beginning to end is always exemplary. Always exceed excpetations.",5,2022,07,13
140,"Amazing service, best hotel ever!","Amazing service, best hotel ever! We traveled with our kids and stayed in two rooms connected and it was just the best experience, food was amazing, service outstanding, rooms clean and comfortable, well done!",5,2022,07,10
140,"Excellent experience, but check your travel dates","I recently stayed at the Langham Hotel in London.  My experience there was excellent.  The staff was very helpful, my room was great, and housekeeping was top notch.  I went to two restaurants inside the property (Palm Court for breakfast every morning and once to Roux at the Landau), the food was always excellent, and we got the best recommendations for food and drinks every time.  The Langham is great for business meetings, and it is located close to the Oxford Circus underground station, so you are very well connected to most places in London.  My only recommendation for someone planning on staying there is to check your travel dates to London.  During my stay there were several big events going on in the city (Wimbledon, Formula 1 at Silverstone and the 50th Anniversary of the Pride Parade), so prices for most hotels in the city were higher than usual, so plan your business or family trip carefully and you would have a great time at the Langham in London. ",5,2022,07,10
140,Fabulous Hotel,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Langham. This was the 4th occasion we stayed and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. I would recommend booking well in advance as the rooms do get booked out quickly, however this time we were able to book at short notice and still have a fabulous experience.",5,2022,07,09
140,Big Disappointment,"I booked a “Club Level” Executive room at the Langham for a special treat to celebrate my sister’s recovery from serious illness.  Having stayed at the Langham London before, I anticipated a first-rate experience—lovely big room, fabulous service and generous amenities.  However, what I got this time was a small, somewhat dingey room with dirty towels and few amenities.  I planned to bookend our two-week trip with stays at the Langham.  However, our first leg of the trip was so disappointing that I cancelled the last reservation.  

The “Club” part of the stay was fine – comfortable setting, good food and copious amounts of champagne.  However, our room was small and there were actual stains prominently displayed on one of our towels.  I had requested twin beds.  Rather than having two individual beds, it was what appeared to be twin beds on wheels pushed together to make a king, without much room to pull them apart.  

When I complained to the front desk about the room they said there was nothing they could do as the hotel was fully booked.  However, they offered a bottle of champagne or free drinks at the bar.  Since our “Club” already offered those to us, I declined.  We also had trouble figuring out the lights and electrical service in the room.  Had someone shown us to our room (as I expected, based on prior experience) they could have explained how things worked.  Every time I went to the front desk with a problem, they did endeavor to fix it promptly.  The Langham used to provide a lovely box filled with all the amenities one would expect at a first-rate hotel.  No more.  Once again, a trip to the front desk to request a shower cap.  Luckily I discovered the lack before I disrobed for my shower.  At 1,000 pounds per night I really take offense at having to beg for the simplest things.

Upon checkout I cancelled our remaining reservation, at which point they offered an upgrade if I would reconsider.  The thought of spending more money in the hopes of a better experience did not appeal to us, so we made other arrangements.  They did, however, give us Langham scented candles as a parting gesture.",1,2022,07,07
140,Very welcoming,"A welcome return. Staff are exceptional. Public rooms beautiful. Bedrooms luxurious. What’s not to love. It has gone expensive  but for an occasional splurge this hotel should be on your shortlist.
Breakfast was good but the buffet isn’t a patch on its pre Covid days.",5,2022,07,05
140,Best of the best - a home from home,"We have stayed here, our favourite hotel in London, countless times over the last two years and seen the hotel emerge from the weirdness of lockdown, devoid of forgeign tourists, to become the busy, buzzy hotel of its former self. Our last stay was during the Jubilee Weekend with the hotel adorned with bunting and portraits of the Queen.

We always receive such personal, discrete service here and have a wonderful contact on front desk, Harry England (great name!) who always arranges a lovely, front facing room - usually with a free upgrade - and a prime parking spot for by fella’s Ferrari right outside the front of thee hotel.

The property is incredibly beautiful and so centrally located off Regents Street - everything is within walking distance and you’re staying in the very best part of town.

Like most of the grandest hotels, perhaps with the exception of Corinthia, the hotel is not at all stuffy and we two Midlanders feel right at home here.

We love the brand so much we booked the sister hotel on Fifth Avenue in NYC - not a patch on it’s London brother, but still a great hotel group that makes you feel incredibly special whenever and wherever you stay.",5,2022,07,04
140,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed in the Langham over the weekend and what a wonderful experience.  The check-in was so friendly and we had a great chat about our plans. All the staff are so helpful and work with smiles on their faces. We were upgraded to a de-luxe room on the 7th floor which was one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in. It was our anniversary and when we  arrived at the room there was flowers, champagne, cake and a lovely personal note from Susan.  The breakfast was excellent with everything so fresh and with attentive staff.  Well done to the Langham.",5,2022,07,04
140,Great Place to stay in London,"This is a great hotel in a great location.  Staff was very attentive and the room we had was very comfortable.  We stayed there for 8 nights and mixed pleasure with business and this was a perfect hotel to combine both.  The Wigmore Pub provides a true pub experience and we ended up going there every day.  The hotel staff will even get a reserved table which I highly recommend for Thursday nights.  Staying in a downtown area can always be noisy, they had some sort of plexi glass between the window and room, you will get a good nights sleep there even though you are in the middle of central London. .

140,"Poor service throughout the hotel, and a very mediocre breakfast","We stayed in this hotel for 5 days. The location is great. Room was very small, but it was okay considering it is a very old London property. What bothered us most was the overall poor service in this $800 a night hotel.  

We had breakfast every day there since we had paid for it. It was a vey mediocre food, with a limited buffet,  and all that with a poor service. If you order a coffee, one might get the toast before the coffee. The sausage and bacon were so hard (like plastic), I thought we needed a sharper knife. The waffle and pancakes that I ordered were equally bad!! Unless one waves the hand, no one will come anywhere near you. It looked like they have employed few unhappy people there. I heard few complaining about the service, but they had total inertia. 

One particular experience was mindboggling. Since our bag was damaged on UA flight from Newark, we ordered a suite case for overnight delivery. The bag arrived within 24 hours and we were informed about the delivery by the carrier. We approached the front desk and they said it has not come. Over next 24 hours, we were told the same many times. I contacted the carrier and they told me the name of the person who signed for it at Langham. When I asked the concierge, they told me that it is a common name although they have someone with that name working there. They reiterated that they did not receive anything 24 hours after the carrier told us it was delivered. Finally, I spoke to one of their manager, and they found it within 30 minutes clearly labelled with our name and room number in the area they normally receive deliveries. No real apologies except for a superficial suggestion ""what can we do for all your inconvenience?' Instead, she (the Manager) could have said, ""this is what we want to do for multiple phone calls you had to make to the carrier in the last 24 hours"". She was happy when I said I did not want anything except a heartfelt apology which I did not receive. 

The check-out was equally bad. I waited for 30 minutes hoping that someone will come to get the bags. When I called after 30 minutes, I was told that the person who checked us out did not place the order (despite our clear request). So we carried our bag ourselves.",2,2022,07,03
140,Excellent location.,This high end hotel is within walking distance from many attractions such as the Westminster Abbey and National Gallery. We did walk to the Tower of London but it was about an hour through safe areas. It’s minutes away from the shopping areas and there are a lot of restaurants near by. The bar and restaurant in the hotel were very good. The service was great and the room was very clean.,5,2022,06,28
140,Apparently their standards have slipped quite a lot,"When I was diagnosed with cancer, my sister promised a lavish trip to England *when* I survived. The trip had to be postponed twice because of COVID but we finally were able to travel in June 2022. Our first stop was the Langham in London, which she had visited before. 

My sister could have booked *anywhere* - she considered all the five star hotels in London, but chose the Langham because she had a very good experience there right before the pandemic.

Apparently things have changed quite a bit.

She booked a Club-level room, which is purported to offer private check-in, but no such check-in was offered.  

The room was tiny, dark, and felt a little unclean. While we were absorbing our rather disappointing surroundings, a member of the staff came by to audit the minibar, which had not been done when the prior guests checked out. We felt like criminals, sitting there in silence while she counted drinks and snacks. 

A hand towel in the bathroom had visible dark yellow stains. It would be impossible for the staff to not see the stains, as they were right at the top of the fold of the towel.  There were no amenities – no shower cap, emery board, cotton swabs. The card on the tray where the amenities should have been stated that this was to protect the environment. It felt more like they were protecting their profit margin.

We requested twin beds. We *got* twin beds, but they were pushed together to make one big bed. When we requested the staff separate them, someone came to the room, kicked them apart a little with her foot and pushed them back together as though to demonstrate how easily we could have done this ourselves. Astonishing.

My sister went to the front desk twice to complain and literally no accommodation was made other than some *clean* towels and a couple of shower caps. She gladly would have paid more for a suitable room or suite, but no option was offered.

I’m not sure another room would have provided less inexplicable service, however. 

Turndown service provided *one* eye mask and *one* set of ear plugs. I’m sure we could have requested more, but candidly at those prices they should be able to count the number of room inhabitants and provide accordingly. A fruit bowl, some chocolate and two side plates were provided the first night. Nothing was refreshed for the duration of our stay – used plates disappeared and were not replaced.

There were ample doormen, but they never opened the door when we entered or left the hotel. There were occasionally up to four people stationed *just inside* the door, seemingly just to smile and nod at us.  

One morning someone entered our room – without knocking – before 8:00 am. The person said nothing and immediately left. We asked the front desk staff how this could happen and were told that they thought we had gone for the day and were freshening the room. We had not pressed the button to request that our room be refreshed and it’s bizarre to assume people had gone out before 8 in the morning.

On prior trips to London, we have stayed at the Premiere Inn and the room was bigger and felt more clean.

We checked out and canceled our planned return to the Langham for the second half of our trip. My sister was offered an upgrade for her next stay, but I believe it is highly unlikely she will return to this Langham property. Oh, and they gave us a couple of candles. 

All of the above complaints seem trivial – if any of these things had happened at the Premiere Inn, we’d shake our heads and write it off. If the Langham wants to be considered in the same category as the Premiere Inn, they should charge commensurate rates. When luxury hotels start cutting luxuries – for whatever reason – people looking for luxury accommodations will look elsewhere. The Langham would do well to remember that. 

Because we had a Club-level room we spent many hours in the Club because our room was so unpleasant. The staff and services in the Club were the only redeeming aspects of our stay.",1,2022,06,27
140,5 star hotel but quite mediocre,"I think I must’ve expected a lot more from a 5 star hotel, but this was quite mediocre. The location cannot be beat, however, and reception is AMAZING. However, beyond that, the rest of the stay was entirely mediocre. All facilities and rooms are very clean, nothing to complain about. However, one of the rooms I stayed in (trip was split over a week) had one of those doors that slide closed in the middle from opposite ends. The doors were faulty, and they did not close or lock at all. Not ideal for a stay with another person in a snug room. I was most disappointed with the service at the Palm Court for breakfast. After we got seated, our female server (Joanna Raro, I believe) took our drink orders. She got one of our drinks incorrect, which I mentioned and she took it away just saying “ok, I can bring you X drink” without an apology (which I thought was common courtesy). But then she left us with menus and never checked up on us ever again. We didn’t realize the continental and English breakfasts were both in the same corner, and thought it was all continental (since it’s self serve…) because she never explained anything to us. When I saw the bill, I was obviously surprised to see us charged for an English breakfast instead of continental (as we thought) and tried to get her attention when she was talking to a male colleague. She didn’t see me trying to grab her attention since she had her back to the room, but the male colleague she was speaking with did and pointed it out. She kind of just put her arms up in exasperation, and then had a look of annoyance when walking over. She put on a “smile” and when I asked her the question, she explained hurriedly in an annoyed, matter of fact way. How was I supposed to know? That experience kind of put a damper on my morning and I was quite disappointed. ",2,2022,06,27
140,Fabulous hotel and amazing staff,"We stayed a few days in this hotel with my family before we went to Oxford for my daughter’s medical internship there. The hotel is nice and is in a good location close to many local attractions and famous shopping districts. We can go to all those attractions on foot, no taxi is needed 
Deepa did an excellent job of hosting us in the hotel and arranged nice connecting rooms. The rooms were fabulous, clean, and had classic decor. She was enthusiastic about our comments regarding the area of improvement in this hotel, demonstrating the attitude to seek continuous improvement. Palm Court was decent, we had breakfast and dinner there. Yubi, a Korean guy who served us at Palm Court and Wigmore, was friendly and gave us the warmest welcome, and was attentive to our needs. 
Overall, a lovely hotel, definitely we will come back.
",5,2022,06,26
140,Loved my stay,"Great location very helpful front desk and everyone you meet .. loved the breakfast .. the rooms I liked even if it has become little old .. the person who cleaned my room organised it very well .. very walkable distance to Oxford street , restaurants all around and clinics enjoyed the stay will come back again and again",5,2022,06,25
140,A wonderful stay!,"An outstanding, elegant hotel with excellent service. The room had everything you need and was furnished beautifully. The club lounge staff were friendly and helpful and 
made you feel at home. We will be back!",5,2022,06,23
140,So underwhelming,"Very Disappointing! 

Firstly, reservation’s insisting on adding 5% service charge upfront. The check in was awful, some Phillipino guy trading with us like a used car salesman. 

According to the website if you book direct there is a complementary upgrade subject to availability. So we were told sorry no availability. But there’s is availability if you want to pay £50 per night per room.

Secondly, house keeping forgot to clean our room. We had to call down at 6.00pm. 

Thirdly, no additional touches of any kind. We had booked two rooms for multiple nights . 

Talk about delusional, how this hotel has the cheek to take an upfront service charge is beyond me. Funnily enough it was easy to remove on check out without question. 

The artesian bar has nice cocktails and atmosphere but the food is average. 

Four Seasons is light years ahead of this place.",3,2022,06,21
140,Wonderful anniversary stay,"Our stay at the Langham was perfect from beginning to end. The room was beautiful, the exec lounge by far the best in London, and the service was outstanding. We cannot wait to stay there again! Hoping Roux at Landau will be open soon",5,2022,06,20
140,25th Wedding Anniversary,"My Wife and I stayed here from 31/05/22 to 02/06/22 for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Having already checking with the hotel we arrived early so we could drop our suitcases off so we could enjoy the day. We were advised to check with reception in case the room was ready early which it was , at no extra charge. It soon became apparent that nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Right from check in , to the moment we checked out the service was simple outstanding. Its all the little touches that made it worthwhile.  One example was at evening dinner where we didn't want desert but the lady knew it was our wedding anniversary and bought a happy anniversary desert to the table. The food was excellent in Palm Court and not over priced. Same with the bar, princes in line with the local bars. The room itself was beautifully decorated and was spacious enough for the two of us and air conditioned also. Overall a very memorable couple of days and will would highly recommend staying here. We will certainly be returning",5,2022,06,19
140,Not worth the price,"I was really looking forward to my stay, but won't be staying here again.  The good: location was close to the tube and fairly centrally located.  The bad: the room was oddly loud (sounded like someone was moving furniture starting at about 5 am each night during all 3 nights of our stay), service mediocre (there are a lot of amenities and items that were skipped in our room), and I didn't find the bed overly comfortable.  The wifi was also spotty and we had difficulty video chatting for the purpose of our covid tests. We enjoyed the cocktail bar (very pricy though--$25/drink) and the attached pub.  

I left an internal review and the manager did reach out to me.  With that said, I just wouldn't spend the money on this hotel again.  It was a very different and underwhelming experience compared to the Langham in NYC, which was A+.  I think I would have had a more comfortable stay in a room half the price.  If the room was $300 I would try again, but it is far too expensive for what you get in my opinion.",3,2022,06,14
140,The Most Outstanding Stay I've Ever Had,"My stay at The Langham London was an absolute delight from start to finish. The luxury is in the details and the entire staff certainly paid attention. The Housekeeping team went above and beyond to provide intuitive service, and the amenities from room service were absolutely stunning. A special shout out to Edmund who personally took us on a tour of the property to make us feel at home. Thank you to Alex who checked us in and gave us the warmest welcome. Dorian helped us get a cab to the airport with ease, removing any stress from our travels, and Jovita assisted with a friendly and efficient check out. My experience at the outlets was incredible- afternoon tea in Palm Court being the epitome of classic luxury, and drinks at Artesian masterfully crafted. The jubilee activations with the ice cream cart and lemonade were a nice touch of whimsy. I truly have never had such a wonder-struck stay at any hotel. I was in awe each day of the trip. This stay left a lasting impression on me that I will remember. ",5,2022,06,13
140,The Langham London is BACK!!,"After visiting a few years ago, my return to the hotel was fantastic. Great food /drink options, great location, great service and extremely comfortable beds. Every aspect of my stay was great. I will be going back. ",5,2022,06,12
140,Perfection,"Our first visit at the Langham London won't be our last. We were pampered every minute, from the quality of our rooms to the meals, to the door service who called many cabs for us. The Palm Court atmosphere and dining were perfection. The hotel and decor are gorgeous!!!",5,2022,06,07
140,Jubilee weekend stay,"Wonderful hotel, with amazing staff. Brilliant location. Walking distance to all the shops, St James area, and the Mall. The check in staff and doormen were so helpful and friendly. The quality of the bedding was amazing and we had a wonderful night sleep",5,2022,06,06
140,stunning stay - looking forward to returning,"My husband and I stayed here in the summer of 2021 following our third attempt at a honeymoon abroad cancelled. The hotel delivered and exceeded everything we could hope for. Kind, warm, courteous arrival as a special treat we were upgraded to a small suit... it was spectacular! Nothing was to much for the staff. We highly recommend making full use of the gym and the swimming pool as well as the spa facilities. We particularly welcomed the free drinks voucher at the artisan bar as a welcome gift as well as experiencing The Wigmore.

The location is great just off Oxford Street so not to far away from the hustle and bustle but very quiet for a restful sleep in the evening.

Looking forward to the day we an return here",5,2022,06,05
140,Amazing,"Beautiful hotel, in a great location.  Piccadilly Circus was just a couple of blocks away.  The staff were all absolutely top notch!  The chauffeur service was exceptional!  Our driver (Daniel?  I’m thinking I got that right) picked us up from Heathrow, and found out we were “tourists” and our first time.  He took the scenic route to the hotel and pointed out where the “to go” and how to “get there”.  

Our room was very nice, it already had electrical plugs for every country (whether from the USA, my sister…..or Germany, me…..they had us covered).  Beds were comfortable, and loved the bath.

The spa……we did go down for a look.  The in-door pool area was unique, but we just didn’t have the time to utilize, due to trying to cram all our sight seeing into 2 days.

The restaurant inside the hotel…..excellent!  Staff were perfect!  Even though I felt a bit “under-dressed” they didn’t bat an eye and served us like royalty anyway…..thank you for that!  

The concierge staff were very helpful, when we mis-judged the time it would take to get to Stansted airport for our trip to the canaries.  I was very pleasantly surprised that Daniel was going to be our chauffeur again!  

All in all, the hotel was one of the best I’ve ever stayed at, kudos to the staff!",5,2022,06,03
140,Looking forward to coming back!,"From the check in, through to the check out, the service was exemplary.  Each staff member went out of their way to ensure our Anniversary stay celebration was a memorable one.  Looking forward to coming back soon!",5,2022,06,02
140,"Classic hotel, great service, dated amenities","The Langham is in a great, central location, and the service is beyond 5 star, but the breakfast service could have been better, and our room had some issues. We experienced several issues with the TV, and the bathroom door lock didn't work and the tub didn't drain properly, as examples. I reported these issues to management, and they were responsive and accommodating in helping alleviate the concerns. ",3,2022,05,31
140,Just exceptional in all regards,We stayed several days with our three boys in a family room and loved it from the beginning and the impression got only better and better. Service was super nice! We will return with pleasure to this very central hotel.,5,2022,05,30
140,London Landmark - Higher end & worth every penny.,"2 nights of bliss in a London landmark. Utterly faultless service & attention to detail. Our 1st time at the hotel & we’ll likely choose again the next time we’re in London.
Superb location for shopping & variety of restaurants, but we ate in the Palm Court (lobby restaurant) on both evenings as it was low key with great staff.",5,2022,05,29
140,Expensive & old fashioned,"The hotels is nice when you walk in but the rooms are very dated and the walls paper thin so you can hear the neighbours. Very clean but like staying at your grand mothers house. 

Beverages are expensive compared to other five star hotels",3,2022,05,28
140,Best Hotel in London! ,"Jessica and Frederica were so helpful and kind to us! We stayed here for my sisters birthday. The afternoon tea was one of the best I've had. The cleanest rooms, relaxing shower and comfiest beds and pillows! Breakfast was excellent. Could have stayed for a whole week! ",5,2022,05,27
140,Outstanding Afternoon Tea,"We were celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary with the family.  From start to finish we were treated like Royalty!  We enjoyed the best afternoon tea ever!  5 courses!  We started off with Champagne which was perfect.  Each course was served to us individually.  The sandwhiches were so fresh a interesting especially for pescatarians and very tasty.  They replenished each course as and when or where requested.  The cheese Scones served with pieces of mature cheddar and chutney were a surprise!  The pastries were small light and so delicious.  As we were  a celebrating an anniversary and birthday they brought out two amazing chocolate cakes which we just had to take home as we were full.  The children’s Tea for our 10 and 8 year old grandsons was very special each sandwhich was a jigsaw shape inter linked to a puzzel very impressive! Service was excellent.  Nothing too much trouble.  The staff were professional and friendly.  We shall return!  Thank you so much!

140,Familiar in the best possible way,Excellent as always.  Staff are attentive and efficient.  Gym is not large but very up to date and shares a pool and locker rooms with the in-house spa.

140,The Langham London and Club Lounge,"We were taking my mum and sister to The Langham for the first time. They were bowled over by everything from start to end. The whole experience was phenomenal.

140,Another excellent Langham stay.,"We are never disappointed at the Langham. This time we took my friend's sister and mum and they were overwhelmed by the ambience and service provided, especially by the staff (who are really friends)in the Club. Brilliant.",5,2022,05,18
140,Could be more pleasant !,"Rooms are nice , location is very convenient and the building does give the historic vibe . 

Staff who attended to us during room service and house keeping were quite pleasant , however the interaction with front desk, doormen and some of the other staff  members who were standing in the lobby felt very transactional . 

I do expect more from a Langham having stayed with them previously in HK .",3,2022,05,15
140,Wonderful Hotel Experience,"The staff in all roles at the Langham are pleasant, helpful and courteous.  The daily breakfast is a wonderful way to start your day.  Rooms are clean and quiet.  The location is convenient.  I would definitely stay there again.  ",5,2022,05,12
140,Great to be back,As always the Langham lived up to expectations. The staff as always were superb as were the rooms. The Club room was as pleasurable as always. Looking forward to our return later this year when we have no doubt it will be as superb               ,5,2022,05,10
140,Return visit!,"We stayed at the Langham late May 2021 for our honeymoon after our abroad honeymoon was cancelled for covid. I’m overjoyed that this happened as we wouldn’t have had the pleasure of experiencing this fantastic hotel. The staff were brilliant, attentive and treated each guest equally. We had breakfast delivered to the room during our stay which equally was fantastic. We can’t wait to come back in just over a week to celebrate our first anniversary! I would truly recommend this hotel and the experience of staying here to anyone.",5,2022,05,09
140,True hospitality at its best,"From the arrival to departure our stay was outstanding. There are so many nice details making The Langham unique. All team members are so guest focused and friendly, a rare trait in many luxury hotels. Furthermore the team members are stunningly groomed with clean nice uniforms, that actually fit!!! Where did I last see this ?!!
In addition there are so many nice details like “the card placed on sport shoes to go for a walk in Regents Park, with a map”, the in room safe placed at a nice height, easy to operate TV, a hair dryer with power, impeccable turndown service .... and classical music playing when you enter the room after dinner.
The F&B is outstanding. We travel extensively and the Langham is definitely more that a notch above most other luxury hotels we have experienced. Congratulations to the whole team",5,2022,05,08
140,Wow just wow… the Langham is a real gem! We loved it and will be back!,"We stayed for my husband’s special birthday in February 2022 and the hotel exceeded our expectations in every way! Checkin was so personalised and our room was just stunning! The bed was so comfy and room was so well equipped- I really appreciated the thoughtful extra touches too like the delicate lemon biscuits, glassware options  and pink rubber duck!
The breakfast was so beautiful and a real experience in itself. All staff at the Langham’s are outstanding and made our trip so memorable. If you visit definitely head to the bar first to enjoy the ambiance and cocktails. We will be back later this year to celebrate another special event and I cannot wait!",5,2022,05,05

140,Value for money,"I booked a special deal at the Langham for my daughter and I. Having always staid at the Corinthia I didn’t want to spend as much on this mother daughter trip.
Upon arrival we were greeted by wonderful staff very friendly, the amenities are super large swimming pool, elegant lobby and breakfast area.
The rooms were very clean and although small noting price paid I felt it was value for money. Staff left a little gift for my daughter and sent complimentary hot chocolate and treats upon hearing our intention to stay in and watch a movie. Highly recommend, I would visit again!!",5,2022,05,03
140,The best in London,"The Langham is the ultimate luxury stay where the customer comes first 

The luxury feel extends throughout the hotel 

Food and drink options abound and you must try the In Room Dining which takes room service to a whole new level ",5,2022,05,03
140,Return Visit,"Unfortunately on a previous visit we experienced a few problems but I always make a judgement on how the problems are dealt with not necessarily the first complaint (we all make mistakes!)
I have to say the response from the Asst Mgr Harry England was exemplary and our return visit was superb in a great room and superb location, only wish we were staying longer!!",5,2022,05,03
140,London Trip,"I cannot say enough about this hotel. From the doorman, to the service, to the food. I was in London for a week visiting my son on abroad. Rarely do you go places that do everything right - this is one of them.

140,Christmas Eve,"We stayed for Christmas Eve (1 night) and it was an amazing experience. They left mince pies in our room and chocolates etc. The bed was comfortable, the room was huge and the bathroom even had under floor heating.

Mums 60th birthday treat","We stayed for one night to celebrate my mums 60th and were not disappointed. 
We had lunch in the Palm  court on arrival which was delicious in a relaxed but beautiful room. 
After lunch our rooms were ready, the bathrooms are luxurious and the set out of the adjoined rooms was perfect.
We then spent a couple of hours enjoying champagne in the club lounge where the service  was amazing.
Lots of choice for breakfast the following day, fresh delicious food enjoyed. 
We finished our stay with a swim in the relaxing spa area, which also smells amazing.
Can’t wait to go back !",5,2022,05,01
140,"Prefect in every way, we can’t wait to come back","My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful weekend at The Langham recently. Everything was just immaculate and real slice of calm in the bustling West End. 

While we had a superior room, we found this suited our needs perfectly for a couple on a busy weekend with the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. We thankfully managed to use the spa and pool facilities which are a real luxury in the city centre and very well maintained, as well as being immaculately clean. 

We had breakfast on both morning in Palm Court and found this to be the best breakfast we have had in any 5* hotel in London. All the staff were very caring and attentive from the doormen to the waiters and front of house. We also had a drink in the Artesian bar which was also brilliant with a great selection. 

Overall, we had the most fabulous time and will be using The Langham as our regular London hotel going forward. The hotel is simply perfect.",5,2022,04,30
140,Amazing experience steaming from my mistake,"I was only in London for a few days on a work trip. The only personal thing I planned to do was Afternoon Tea at the Langham. When I went to check in I found out I had made the reservation for the wrong day! It was at that point that Hanna and Harry really made an impression on me. Hanna went above and beyond, helping make some changes and getting me a table so I could enjoy Afternoon Tea with my co-worker.  Harry helped us pass the time while we waited for a table by telling us about the hotel. Both Hanna and Harry were remarkable.",5,2022,04,29
140,"Cooking with a genius, and a lot more besides","We had a wonderful stay at The Langham.  Along with the luxurious feel everywhere, there's one consistent factor, and that is the service.  Every member of the team that we encountered, whether serving us in the bars, or delivering room service, checking in/out, everything, have the most incredible 'can do' attitude.  They're always smiling, attentive and friendly.  In particular the bars, all table service, and you're never waiting for a drink, as soon as you're empty they are right there.  I have to mention in particular Jay Lee, the Guest Service Supervisor.  I don't think I've met anyone who cares about perfect service as Jay.  He always seemed to be around, always checking that we were ok, and asking if there was anything he could do for us.  He even gave us his personal email address, and told to email him when we were next coming to The Langham, so he could help us with anything we needed.  That's is above and beyond superb service.  We usually stay at The Savoy, which we love, but decided to stay at The Langham as we were cooking with Michel Roux the next day there, but we will DEFINITELY return, it made such an impression on us.",5,2022,04,29

140,A Gem!!,"We visited Langham during my first ever trip to London in April 2022. This hotel will always always hold a special place in my heart. The staff is an asset. Truly wonderful. The hotel, the decor is beautiful. It is more than a 5 star in all aspects. Kudos to the team. A little walk and you are in the central area.. the location is just perfect. Couldn't fault anything about this property. Keep up the good work. Thank you Langham.",5,2022,04,28

140,Top quality experience,"What makes this a great hotel? The staff. The friendliest, caring team of people you could hope to meet. Clean, comfortable rooms.

The manager from Mumbai was so kind and  courteous. The afternoon tea was delicious and highly recommended. The whole experience was enjoyable.,5,2022,04,24
140,"No „family hotel“, but perfect for families","Superb place to stay, also for families. We always felt welcome and the entire staff was extremely helpful at all times. The locations is probably the best you can get in west end. Every hotspot is in walking distance (even with small kids), tube station just nearby, and still the hotel is fairly quite for London despite being right in the middle. Would go again anytime. ",5,2022,04,23
140,Superb 5 star experience,"My wife and I had the most amazing stay and afternoon tea at the Langham. The property is immaculate with a warm welcome on arrival and beautiful décor throughout. There was even a lovely fragrance as you entered. If you are looking for a special hotel with a relaxed, sophisticated, classy vibe then this is perfect. All the staff were excellent too - being very attentive yet not overbearing. 100% recommend this hotel. The afternoon tea was also very high standard with interesting variations on classic cakes.",5,2022,04,20
140,My birthday treat,"We are staying at the Langham london hotel for a 4day treat, as soon as we arrived we were met with Mr Faisal who swiftly checked us in with a upgrade and also we added another night to which he matched our discounted price, which was extremely nice of him. The staff at this hotel is very friendly , this is a good location hotel , we thoroughly enjoyed our stay .",5,2022,04,17
140,Simply perfect ,"Simply perfect. Very nice and helpful staff, beautiful rooms and fantastic food.  We also held an event with Sauce which was a lot of fun. I  would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who comes to London, whether it be for pleasure or business. ",5,2022,04,17
140,The Langham was exceptional,"The staff, service, decor of hotel and rooms was top quality and I would highly recommend this hotel.  Nothing was too much trouble and it was all I had hoped and more.  The staff were attentive, extremely helpful and pleasant and made our trip for my daughters 30th the best time ever.  The location was great close enough to walk to most attractions and in a lovely part of London.",5,2022,04,15
140,Dinner to celebrate grandson's 21st birthday,"WE ate in Palm Court and the food was excellent but best of all was the service.  Our Polish waitress (was her name Flitan?) was delightful and so kind to us that it made then evening really special.  The wine waiter was also excellent. thanks you, both of you for making this an evening to remember.",5,2022,04,14
140,Amazing magical place with good location,"One of the best hotels !
I love all Langham hotels in the world (except maybe ny) and the original one is superb .
Maybe the rooms little old but it have magic all over !
Location is amazing 
Staff is superb
The food is really good from breakfest to dinner it is really an experience",4,2022,04,12
140,Possibly my new favorite hotel,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in all the ""Best"" hotels in London, The Dorchester, The Ritz, The Savoy, The Lanesborough, etc etc and have to say this is now my favorite! Whilst all the others are still great hotels, the Langham added little touches that gave them the edge over the others, as an example, we were staying as a family and in my Daughters room who was staying with her Husband and 2 year old Daughter, the Langham left a Teddy Bear in a back pack with coloring books, in my room I had my 12 year old son staying with me and the Langham left him snacks (Pop corn, Kit Kats, healthy drinks etc) the staff were amazing and made every effort to ensure we were all made very welcome, nothing was too much trouble, there are to many names to mention but literally every single employee were outstanding 

Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so memorable, we will be back soo",5,2022,04,11
140,Thank You Hannah For Your Excellent Service,"What a lovely hotel this is in the heart of London. And what is more, it greatly benefits from staff like Hannah. If all such establishments were blessed with such pleasant and helpful staff. 

I do hope her hard work and dedication is both recognised and rewarded.

Jules",5,2022,04,09
140,Amazing!!,"Amazing as always!! Stayed here many times over the years and I have never been disappointed. Fabolous location, great bar/restaurants and amazing Spa. 

I can’t praise the Langham enough.

We will be back of course.

Thanks for an amazing stay!!",5,2022,04,04

Fabulous rooms with great in room dining and drinks 
Great bathrooms
Fabulous restaurants 
Great breakfast
Great service 
And best of all the spa, gym and pool were amazing",5,2022,04,03
140,Great help from the booking team.,"My small group of lovely ladies and I  have stayed at this wonderful hotel several times over the years, always using the club lounge which I highly recommend. It is seems appropriate for me to take my great team to a place where the wonderful; staff make all the difference.  In Lockdown our work supporting families escaping abusive or controlling relationships was extra busy and indeed stressful, so we are ready to return to our ""happy place""!   
This Christmas treat has been postponed due to Covid but the Langham booking staff have been so helpful throughout. I have had no issues with getting it all rebooked and (unlike other holiday horror stories) this has all been dealt with promptly and at no additional cost.

Huge thanks again to the Langham Team, we are so looking forward to our visit on Friday.",5,2022,03,29
140,Luxurious Anniversary Stay!,"My husband and I spent two nights at the Langham while in London, and we wish our stay had been longer! It was superb in every way. Faisal greeted us so warmly upon check-in and made us feel so welcomed. We stayed in an Executive room where a bottle of bubbly and a fruit basket awaited us. The room itself was lovely, spacious, clean, and comfortable. We appreciated the heated towel bars and floors in the bathroom and the quiet location of our room. 

Breakfast was delicious and afternoon tea was outstanding! When we inquired about airport transportation, Faisal suggested a few options. He was most helpful and kind! My husband and I look forward to returning next time we are in London. I highly recommend a stay here!",5,2022,03,26
140,way bellow 5 stars,"It was really bad experience. First room I got was so tiny that I could not open my suitcase in it. and the bathroom was the size of college dorm bathroom. After my complaining they gave me slightly bigger room, but that one had high windows just under the ceiling, so absolutely no view. They could no be opened either, so no air either. I was on the business trip with my company paying for the hotel, but they pre-authorized the charges for my entire stay on my card, so I complained, they apologized, removed pre-authorization and then 2 days later fully charged the cost of my stay to my card. Such an incompetent mess. The only good thing is the pool",1,2022,03,25
140,Wonderful Anniversary Celebration Stay,"We have just returned from The Langham London after staying for one night in a Junior Suite. The experience was fantastic from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. 

Staff at check in were attentive and interested in what we were celebrating. We received a free upgrade upon check in which helped our ten year wedding celebrations start off so nicely. 

The room was spectacular with awesome views of London and the bbc HQ. 
Bedding and bed was so comfortable. 
Room facilities amazing. 
Bathroom spectacular. 
We ordered breakfast in bed so I can’t comment on the restaurant but the breakfast we had was flawless. 

Club lounge 
Very quiet. Again very attentive staff. 
We arrived around 4.30 so in time for the evening buffet from 5. Food was delicious. Think high end tapas, charcuterie and cheese. A small selection of puddings also. 
Drink - you could choose from soft drinks, cocktails, wine or champagne. Our glasses were constantly full! 

Swimming pool and spa
Swimming pool in central London is an unexpected treat! It’s not the biggest pool area but was not busy so it was fine. The spa facilities are a steam and sauna in the female and make changing rooms. They are not joined. 

We had such a spectacular stay and are already planning when we can next come back! We really did not want to leave! Thank you to everyone at the Langham. 

Ps - The smell is out of this world!!",5,2022,03,24
140,Birthday treat,"I stayed for three nights with my partner as a birthday treat.
We had an executive room that comes with access to the club lounge.

We arrived by taxi around 1.30pm and our bags were taken at the door and delivered to our room. Check in at the front desk was easy and our room was available straight away. The facilities were explained to us and the fact that it was my birthday was noted.
We unpacked our bags in our room on the 4th floor and went out for a late lunch nearby.

That evening we enjoyed the facilities in the club lounge. Lots of delicious canapes / snacks and cocktails and other drinks were free flowing. The staff there were very accommodating and soon got to know our preferences!

Next morning (my birthday) we had breakfast in Palm Court which has a lovely atmosphere and a good buffet selection and food cooked to order. After a day of sightseeing we came back for some afternoon tea items at the club lounge (scones etc). A birthday cake had also been left in our room which was a lovely touch (and very delicious!)

Before going out for the evening we stopped by the club lounge again for a glass of champagne.

Next morning (and also on our last morning) we had breakfast in the club lounge. This was exactly the same as in Palm Court but in the slightly more relaxed surroundings of the club. The staff all knew us by now and looked after us really well.

We had afternoon tea in Palm Court on our third day which is a very elegant and delicious experience. A wonderful setting and attentive staff making sure our dietary preferences were noted and serving sandwiches accordingly. Always asking if we wanted more and explaining the fabulous cakes that are to die for!
They also presented me with a birthday cake (with a candle to blow out) that they packaged for us to take away and eat later. 

When we checked out I was so sad to leave and can't fault anything. The service was amazing and made my birthday really special (especially after a ""lockdown birthday"" last year). 
Amazing service in a wonderful hotel in a great location.",5,2022,03,22
140,Disappointed Stay,"After returning from a two night stay with the hotel I would like to say that our experience wasn’t all bad the location of the hotel is great, everything is in walking distance and the babysitting services are extremely professional and trustworthy. 

Unfortunately there were some flaws in our stay and bearing in mind I have wanted to stay here as it’s been one of the hotels I’ve been dreaming to stay in for a long time.

For a 5* hotel I was extremely disappointment with the lack of urgency in some of the requests made, we have a two year old son who most with children know patience isn’t a virtue. Upon checking in we wanted to take him to the swimming pool when booking the hotel I was advised there would be an activity pack and a bath robe and slippers in the room, they weren’t so I kindly asked for this so he could wear the robe and slippers to the pool. After having to ring twice and nearly waiting 25 mins we decided to leave the room without this, we then seen a member of housekeeping coming down the corridor with the bath robe and had to put it on in the corridor. 
Again, we had the same experience when calling down for a high chair to be brought to the room when ordering room service. The room service came 10-15mins before the high chair arrived. So my sons food was Lukewarm by the time the high chair arrived and ice cream near enough melted.

We had booked an executive room and had a letter explaining what was included in this room. As part of the benefits was to enjoy the club lounge with complimentary drinks and canapés where served. It explained that you could bring up-to two guests from outside the hotel but they would be charged, please speak to the club for prices/charges. 

We went to the club the first night and enjoyed the benefits and where told the price it was for the consumption of the drinks which was fine.

The following day my husband was working all day, so he obviously couldn’t enjoy the benefits of the lounge so as our room was booked for two adults and 1 child I invited my mum to the club lounge with me.

This is when we felt the attitude and level of customer service lacked, upon walking into the club the receptionist asked for my room number and surname then asked what we would like to drink, so we gave her our order. We felt then that another member of staff was looking over and talking to her colleague about us, I actually felt like a criminal so I went to the desk and explained my husband won’t be enjoying the benefits today but as the room is booked under two adults I have brought my mum as again my dad was working and she was alone so we were enjoying our day together. 
I was told this wasn’t allowed and that my mum had to pay but again this wasn’t explained when we arrived and instead of a member of staff coming over and explaining I had to go and ask as the atmosphere was very awkward and could have been cut with a knife and felt staff were unhelpful and accommodating and talking about us. 
There was no price list of drinks on the tables, so my mum got charged £21 for a glass of champagne that was offered to her on arrival to then be told you have to pay and this is the price which is so wrong as well as this I was told if my son wanted fries we can arrange this so I asked for a portion of fries for my son as there was nothing he would eat from the snacks provided again to be charged £6 for these. 

I am staying in the room and have paid for these benefits my room was booked for 2 adults and 1 child which is what I brought to the lounge it’s not as if I 
brought another guest and took advantage of the rules. 

After this experience we left and were extremely disappointed in this rule as basically my mum was taking the place of another guest that would have been there if they didn’t have work and drank alcohol and ate the food provided so what was the difference? 

I rang to reception and spoke to Rodrigo who was extremely helpful and I explained the situation to which he apologised and took the charges off the room but to be honest it was the attitude and rudeness of staff in the club that wasn’t acceptable. 

So a hotel we have been looking forward to stay at and enjoy the benefits was ruined. 
If you have a policy for the club this should be stated in writing in depth on the club tables with drink prices so that the customer knows exactly what the rules are instead of making my mum and I feel ostracised and that I had to go and speak to a staff member. 

I am extremely disappointed and to be honest felt that my stay was not upto the money that we paid as frankly the service and level wasn’t upto the standard you would expect from a 5* hotel not saying all staff were unprofessional but the service and lack of communication was, which is sad considering the hotel is a such a beautiful hotel and has some great attributes.",1,2022,03,22
140,Superb hotel,"Great hotel, staff very welcoming from the moment we got out of the car to the day we left. We used the valet parking which was excellent both on arrival and departure with our suitcases being delivered and collected from our room.
The Executive lounge had a calm relaxing atmosphere with excellent breakfast, snacks and drinks all served with a smile. The spa swimming pool was lovely and we were lucky to have it to ourselves on all the occasions we used it. The room 636 was a good size and the bed very comfortable. I have to admit here I always take my own feather pillow and duvet whether the hotel is 5* or not and this time I only used my pillow.",5,2022,03,20
140,Remains my favorite in London,"Just visited for the first time since the pandemic. Remains my favorite hotel in London. The pool closes at 9pm but I found that you could get in there later because the door was not locked. Good steam room too along with a very good gym. The business lounge has good food (and if you're still hungry after dinner they offer you a 25% discount at the lobby restaurant), and breakfast buffet in the lobby remains excellent (but it could use some fresh rolls). One item that needs updating -- my executive room 405 needs more modern controls on the air conditioning unit and the key cards keep getting demagnetized from cellphones; my cards had to be redone twice in one evening. Other guests complained too. Other than that, it's a great property.",5,2022,03,14
140,Lovely Hotel,"I had a very nice trip while staying at the Langham, London.  I stayed with my Daughter and the Staff in the Club were extremely helpful.  I can not remember everyones name, but, a special thank you to Canen in the Club!  Without the Club, my trip would have been not nearly as enjoyable.",5,2022,03,14
140,Epic Vegan Breakfast - Bravo,"Stop press… I did not eat the buffet breakfast when I stayed at the Langham last month - I paid extra for a full English vegan breakfast and you can turn your nose up as much as you like, the fact is, it was epic.

I should point out it was the morning after the night before.  I was staying over for a friends sons wedding. A most spectacular event which  took place only a few hours earlier on the floor below where I was eating my breakfast.  A beautiful room full of happy revellers and me downing Tequila shots as one does. There were a lot of really great cocktails. I know that because I also drank many of them too. 

So you will probably see now that I needed breakfast. A really, really good breakfast. A Langham buffet breakfast was never going to touch the sides. Truth is I was rather taken aback that they had a Full Vegan English on the menu in the first place, that was like winning first prize before I’d even started the race.

But oh my… the toasted crispy Facon rashers (fake bacon for those that don’t) that criss crossed my exquisitely seasoned tofu scramble were heaven. If God had given me a great night to remember he gave me an even better breakfast. I have never been happier. The toast was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside too #winning

I can honestly say, I have been a foodie all of my life but when I became vegan four years ago I worried I would never have those heavenly food moments again. How wrong I was,,,, and whether you put it down to bring hungover and needing to soak up the alcohol I’d say that I still know what a brilliant plate of food tastes like and the Vegan breakfast was EPIC. 

Thanks guys - you rock",5,2022,03,13
140,Sublime and fabulous,"We are staying here at the Langham since yesterday (room 488 )and I just want to say if you want perfection, then come here...we opted for a club room....we arrived very early but they took our bags and we had a fab breakfast ahead of check in in the club lounge...fabulous selection of pastries, fresh fruit and also cooked breakfasts.

We then went out and when we came back our room was ready with the bags already up in it..they even called to check everything was ok....the club lounge was superb..would highly recommend it if you want peace and quiet....my husband was at Twickenham so I just spent some time up there and then we had a problem as my husband was hungry when he arrived back at 9 pm...but Kenna (hope I spell that right) in the club lounge secured us a table in the Artesian and it was jumping...such a fantastic atmosphere...

breakfast today was terrific.....we do not want to leave tomorrow...but will be back soon and will book a club room again, there is nothing like it.

The staff at this hotel are what make it, and the rooms are so so quiet and so elegant...we have traveled all over the world, the US, Maldives, Singapore, London, France and Japan....and this hotel is up there at the very top!",5,2022,03,13
140,"Excellent hotel,staff were very helpful and friendly.","Room was wonderful,had all that we required.Bed was extremely comfortable and tv had many channels.
We were on 6th floor which was not too far from the elevator.
Bathroom was great and had a large bath with an overheat shower so that was all we needed.",5,2022,03,05
140,"Romantic, Iconic, Legendary!","The most iconic hotel in the world. Every stay has felt like a once in a life time experience. The service is unparalleled. The staff goes above and beyond. I visited this hotel as child with my family and it stuck in my mind as the most extravagant hotel in all my travels. My fiancé and I celebrated our engagement their this past weekend and it was everything I remember and MORE! They are the epitome of a 5 star hotel. They showered us with balloons, flowers, champagne, chocolates, and great service. The concierge helped my fiancé plan a perfect evening. Reception upgraded our room. I could go on and on. In conclusion, I highly recommend this awe-inspiring  hotel!",5,2022,03,01
140,Raising the bar of hospitality,"Similar hotels. usually, they pay attention to the customer experience. But Langham London goes beyond that and takes the extra mile to insure a significant positive experience - It's more than the premier location, comfortable room, quality facilities, and luxury building. It's about small touches that leave a huge positive impact. It's about care, about understanding what would draw a smile in guests faces. 

Langham London raised the bar in crafting the ""hospitality"" business.",5,2022,02,28
140,Wow! Worth every penny!,"I chose this place based on some of the reviews on TA and I wasn’t disappointed. The trip to London is part of my 50th year celebrations so we wanted to push the boat out for a night (we had 3 nights in a Holiday Inn first). We booked an executive room so that we could access the club and I have to say the whole thing was fantastic from start to finish. 

We arrived at the hotel at approx 1pm and although check in wasn’t until 3pm, they gave us access to the club. We sat and drank champagne until our room was ready. The room itself was magnificent and there was a few little touches for my birthday. A hand written note, a cake, some lovely biscuits and fresh fruit all added to the overall experience. 

We literally spent the majority of the day in the club eating snacks, quaffing champagne and after 5pm you can have cocktails with some food. I found myself a bit peckish alter so asked if there were any scones left from earlier? Instead of getting ‘old’ ones, the gentleman got on the phone and said the chef will make you some fresh ones! Absolute legend. 

We had saved up for this and I have to say I felt the whole thing was worth every penny. From check in, the club, the room, the breakfast, the spa, the check out. I can’t recommend this place highly enough. I’m saving for the next visit! Thank you to every member of staff we came into contact with as you were all tremendous.",5,2022,02,22
140,Perfect stay in London,"Had the most wonderful experience at the Langham, and all down to the amazing staff and perfect service. 
This is not a hotel that “shouts” at you. Not too glitzy, not overwhelming with a lobby and reception that resemble a florist, but the Langham screams quality, and quiet attention to detail. 
Our suite was perfect in every detail and nothing was too much trouble for the staff looking after it and us. Everyone seemed genuinely pleased that we were staying, and took time to engage making us feel very at home. 
We set the concierge team a couple of dining challenges, they rose to the occasion and got us reservations at really short notice. The Langham Club is a wonderful retreat at the end of a busy day, the “welcome back” from the door staff is sincerely meant. 
We cannot recommend or praise this hotel highly enough",5,2022,02,19
140,Great relaxing break.,"We recently enjoyed a 2 night stay at the Langham, it’s a magnificent hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed it, the room and suite we booked were excellent, very clean, spacious with lovely decor, the beds are a great size and extremely comfy giving a great nights sleep.

The people that work here deserve a special mention as they really do make the hotel such a great place to stay and relax, so welcoming and nothing is to much trouble.",5,2022,02,18
140,Exceptional experience!,"Everything from start to finish at The Langham was exceptional, the staff are the most friendly and attentive we have ever experienced, we truly had a magical time, staying at The Langham for our 2 night trip to London, made the trip. We cannot wait to go back! The location is also perfect, just off Regent Street/Oxford Street all very accessible, without being in the thick of the very busy areas. We have stayed in several hotels in London and The Langham was by far the very best, in fact we wouldn't now wish to stay anywhere else. I feel they treat each person with the same attentiveness and courtesy, we truly felt welcomed and taken care of.",5,2022,02,16
140,Amazing two night stay - would highly recommend,"My partner and I recently spent two nights at The Langham and already can't wait to return. The service was exceptional - we felt truly looked after throughout our stay. We dined in-room a few times and the food was excellent. The room was lovely; clean with nice decor. Pool is nice with good opening times, only small build was the spa facilities (sauna/steam room) are separate for males and females. We will definitely be returning again soon.",5,2022,02,15
140,50th Birthday night away,"We have stayed at The Langham many times over the years going back to when it was a Hilton hotel.  Each subsequent visit always shows that the hotel is moving forwards in terms of both its customer service and the overall quality of the hotel and the services it offers.  It exceeds other, sometimes more expensive 5* hotels and staying there is always a wonderful experience.",5,2022,02,14
140,My favourite hotel!,Beautiful hotel and 5 star service from all staff makes this hotel the best in London. Breakfast was wonderful as was lunch in the Palm Court restaurant. Cocktails wonderful too 🍸! Room upgrade was lovely. Excellent location - short walk to Regents Park and shops.,5,2022,02,14
140,Super smart hotel,"Faultless hotel, I don’t think it could really be any better other than a lounge where one could read a book maybe. I couldn’t justify spending the extra for an executive room and use of the club lounge.
Each member of staff is so polite and obliging.
Looking forward to returning.",5,2022,02,12
140,Anniversary Dinner in the Palm Court,"I took my wife to the palm court for a celebratory dinner. The amount of care demonstrated by each member of staff impressed us the most; the gentleman in the suit began the evening with an excellent drink recommendation of non-alcoholic bubbles made from fermented tea, which was perfect given that it was a special occasion. Also, a great thank you to the stars of the evening, Ivan, and Emily, who were both very generous and charming.

The food was great, and plan to return to experience the afternoon tea.",5,2022,02,11
140,Fantastic hotel.  My first but certainly not last visit,"My wife and I stayed at the Langham for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay.

My only minor criticism was that when checking in, the staff member was polite however we found the way she said ""You're staying in a category 1 room"" made us out to be cheapskates.  I'm sure guests are well aware of what type of room they have booked in advance.  First impressions it felt like she was politely turning her nose up at us because we weren't spending ££££'s on a suite.

Brushing the check in comment to the side, the porters were very welcoming.  Our luggage was taken to our room and we were made feel at home.

Considering we were in a 'category 1' room, it was fantastic.  We still found it spacious.  Our room was bigger than a suite I had previously stayed in a London 5 star hotel before.  

I loved the Diptyque toiletries, the shower was excellent and the bed was comfortable.
A fully stocked mini bar which items were replaced daily was nice.  On check out there were a few issues but they were resolved.  They supply mini bottles of milk for tea / coffee but when I placed them in the fridge they were registered as I had purchased orange juice.

We ordered breakfast to our room on the morning of check out.  It was delivered at the exact time we requested and was a fantastic spread however there was a large black hair on our plates.  We didn't make a big deal out of it but thought it should've been checked before it was sent out.

The male member of staff that checked us out was an exceptional member of staff.  If he had of checked us in I would've rated our stay 5/5.",4,2022,02,10
140,Fabulous as always,"Fantastic hotel. The bed was sumptuous, the food delicious and the surroundings gorgeous. The staff are so welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. The decor is so tasteful and everywhere is spotless and great quality.",5,2022,02,07
140,A Luxury Hotel with Traditional Service,"It is so nice to be treated as a guest and not a number.  A hotel that I like to visit if not too expensive. Lovely room, in room dining was excellent and enjoyed the stay.
Great staff. Also had a drink in the artesian which is always a delight .Well done.",5,2022,02,07
140,I didn’t want to leave ! ❤️,"Just spent a wonderful night with my Uncle here.  They literally can’t do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble.  The attention to detail is just fabulous.  Big shout out to Rodrigo Moraes , Reception Supervisor who took such good care of me and my Uncle who had specific needs.  Thank you all for a very special stay ❤️",5,2022,02,03
140,An unforgettable stay,"I stayed at The Langham for my 30th birthday this month and couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience! I had chosen the hotel based on the reviews about the service and staff and they were all absolutely correct - everyone who works at The Langham is lovely and nothing is too much trouble for them, they go above and beyond. We were able to check in early to our room and I'd been left some special treats for my birthday which added an extra touch. We chose an Executive Room so that we were able to make use of the Langham Club Lounge and it was absolutely worth it - we spent our entire time in there and it was great to have somewhere to relax and spend time other than your own room. It also meant breakfast was included the next day, which was fantastic. The Langham make so much effort to ensure you have a wonderful stay, with constant little touches to make you feel special. I was so sad to check out and just can't wait to return again soon!",5,2022,01,25
140,Brilliant in every way,"We stayed for 3 nights in the Executive suite to celebrate a special occasion. Everything about this hotel is outstanding, from the interiors to the service. The staff went the extra mile to make our stay memorable and special, and the Club Lounge was wonderful. Shoutout in particular to Lourdes, Canen and Hoi for making our stay that extra bit special. We will be back!",5,2022,01,25
140,Traditional British Biscuits and an Unforgettable Afternoon Tea!,"After receiving my Afternoon Tea Virgin Experiences for my birthday in February 2020, I have been so excited to finally enjoy this meal at The Langham. It was every bit as special as I had hoped and imagined .

From the warm welcome to the expert knowledge of servers, it is clear that everyone is committed to the phenomenal service we enjoyed.

During our meal on Sunday 23rd January, my sister made our waitress aware of a small issue with one of the sandwiches. It was dealt with immediately and to the very highest standard. Whilst issues can clearly occur, what matters is the way in which they are handled - and the team could not gave done more!

The food is AMAZING. For both of us, after enjoying tea at some of the famous London hotels, seeing the incredible pastries based on traditional British biscuits was both fun and delicious! 

Thanks to everyone for making this a memorable afternoon - we absolutely loved it! So excited to return soon !",5,2022,01,23
140,Miss,The hotel is very good and I enjoy staying there. The service is very nice. The hotel is very comfortable and clean. The food at the hotel is very tasty and delicious. The executive rooms are very nice.,5,2022,01,22
140,A first class luxury hotel,"We arrived fairly early about 12 noon not expecting our room to be ready, but checked in straight away. We had booked an executive room which was spacious, clean and beautifully decorated and also afforded us access to the Langham Club. The snacks and drinks available here were plentiful and delicious and the staff in the Langham Club were exceptional, attentive and friendly, nothing was too much trouble.  The general atmosphere in the hotel was relaxed, all of the staff were perfect, nothing was too much trouble.  The gym and pool area were also very good, although I would of preferred to been able to use a sauna with my partner instead of having to use the one in the ladies changing area on my own",5,2022,01,16
140,Faultless stay,"First stay in this lovely hotel. Two nights for my daughter and I have to have some relaxing time before she returned to university. Right from the start we knew we would enjoy it as every member of staff was delightful. We received a room upgrade (as booked directly with hotel) and had a beautiful room. Two gorgeous queen beds, well appointed bathroom, lovely sofa. Very quiet with no noise around us. Enjoyed massages in the spa, again staff lovely (Maria and I think Donna) and we both said we could have spent many hours there. We were meeting people for dinner so didn’t have chance to enjoy the restaurant but cocktails were great.  Everything in the hotel was super clean and we felt very safe. This really was a faultless stay and we would love to return.",5,2022,01,12
140,What a hotel! One of the very best,"A wonderful hotel, so clean and amazing staff that are so helpful and can’t do enough for you

The rooms are beautiful - with a comfortable bed and comfy furniture which makes it feel very homely

The lighting in the hotel is spectacular with some amazing chandeliers & in the room was it was perfect, 

The spa, gym and swimming pool were pristine and the staff were brilliant",5,2022,01,12
140,Exceptional hotel!!,"We stayed at The Langham on New Years Day.  The hotel is located very close to Oxford street and Selfridges.  We stayed in an executive room which was very last minute (booked the day before) which can sometimes be a risk.   Having not stayed with you before I was a little nervous about how it would be.  I feel compelled to email to tell you how fantastic our stay was.  We were overwhelmed by the staff at The Langham, from the Doorman, Reception, The Lounge, Palm Restaurant and the Artesian Bar the service was exceptional but still very, very friendly which is a difficult balance to achieve.  The staff are an absolute credit to the hotel and we would defiantly recommend.  Special mention to Hoy in the lounge for taking good care of us during our stay.  ",5,2022,01,06
140,Superb,"This is a truly beautiful hotel in the heart of London. We stayed for one night only for my wife’s birthday. Everything was perfect - we got a free room upgrade, all staff were extremely helpful and friendly.",5,2022,01,04
140,Amazing,"Again, The Langham never stops giving to us. As usual we stayed just the one night with Langham Club Access. It was stunning as always. The staff (such a horrid word!) - ""our friends"" -  were wonderful - faultless.

An unbelievable experience if you can - I cannot recommend enough.

Thank you Nick, Cristina, Hoi, Mel, Kanen AND EVERYONE.",5,2021,12,24
140,Perfect every time,We always have a fantastic time when staying here. The service is the best in town and the rooms are  fantastic. It also has the best bar in London which we definitely made the most of. Can't wait for our next stay in January! ,5,2021,12,20
140,The best staff in London,"Just got back from 3 nights in the Tower suite. Absolutely fantastic. The staff in the Langham are the best in any hotel in London. They are the most genuinely friendly and just really nice. I must give a special mention to all of the team in the Club who looked after us so well. Just a point on safety, all Covid safe measures were in place and we didn't feel under any danger during our stay. This was our 4th visit and it went be our last.",5,2021,12,19
140,NOT COVID SAFE   -   Arrogant & Uncaring,"I've been dealing with the Langham recently and pointed out that they are not covid safe. But they didn't care about the fact that they weren't covid safe or the prospect of me or my family getting covid because they are not covid safe. 

I wrote a long feedback/complaint email to Doris Greif the CEO of the hotel and Nicholas Davies the hotel manager, neither of who bothered to get back to me. Instead I got an email from a member of staff who didn't deal with any of the issues I raised in my email (and I raised more than the covid issue) and who seemed to blame everything on me.

My experience of the Langham Hotel has been one filled with arrogance, no care for it's guests or prospective guests, unable and unwilling to hear, accept, see or deal with issues in the hotel and no desire to provide guests with the premium service they claim they give. 

I'm so disappointed in the Langham Hotel, it is far from what it presents itself as being. I did try and sort this out with the hotel itself but they weren't interested so here I am writing a review. 

I wouldn't recommend anyone stay or use the Langham Hotel for anything because they really don't care.",1,2021,12,16
140,Fantastic Christmas Weekend at the Langham- December 2021,"Just came back from a fantastic stay at the Langham. We stayed for 4 nights. Our room was lovely and the service  five star.  Bed was comfy and the bathroom was very nice, full of Diptyque toiletries. The staff could not do enough to please us. We had drinks several times at the Artesian Bar.  Great cocktails and buzzy ambience.  We also ate at the Wigmore twice (yummy, Scotch Eggs) and had breakfast delivered one morning.  All was delish.  I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in London.  The attention to detail was perfect and the holiday decorations made for a very festive stay. We did not visit the pool or spa as we were busy with shopping, shows, etc. I've read some reviews where guests said their stay was not as expected but I guess we lucked out!",5,2021,12,14
140,Overnight stay with club room/lounge access,"I stayed at the Langham for 1 night in August 2021 in a club room. The room itself was great and bigger than expected and the staff in the club lounge were polite and efficient. Unfortunately the whole experience was let down by the level of catering in the lounge which was very disappointing. For instance, the evening canapes consisted of one piece of fish, a piece of ham and some very hard bread rolls. The afternoon snack offering was equally as limited. The website pictures of the lounge offerings were totally misleading in this respect. Upon raising this issue with the hotel management, I was told that there were kitchen issues on the day of my stay, but that I should instead come back and purchase another night in order to get a better experience, (i.e. the experience I should've received all along). I do understand that hotels all face  challenges relating to staffing and COVID, but for the price being charged here this is not really an excuse.  I really wanted to enjoy the experience at one of the finest hotels in London but unfortunately i was sorely let down and I still don't feel that anything has been put right.",2,2021,12,14
140,Great hotel and fantastic service,"This is a superb hotel in a terrific location. Service is excellent and COVID protocols are diligently observed. Our room was spacious and comfortable and the pool, although a touch on the small side, is excellent. One thing I must call out is the Langham’s response to a family emergency, which meant we had to cut short our stay to return home. I fully expected to have to pay for the full booking but the hotel insisted I only pay for the nights we stayed. A gracious and much appreciated gesture - thank you again. 100% we will be back.",5,2021,12,13
140,Excellent and comfortable stay,The hotel was very comfortable and in an excellent central London location. The staff were welcoming and friendly. The hotel felt safe and adhered discretely to the current COVID rules. Strongly recommended.,5,2021,12,11
140,A really excellent hotel,"Excellent from start to finish. A great location, brilliant service and a lovely swimming pool. Suitable for families and very welcoming. This is a brilliant, luxury hotel and perfect for special occasions, as well as family trips to London.",5,2021,12,10
140,The best birthday eveeeeeer!!!,"The Langham is my favourite place. Full stop! 
So I was over the moon when we stayed for my birthday. Everything from start to finish was just perfect. 
The hotel is beautiful and located in the heart of London yet you don't get the noise. We arrived in the morning to leave our bags before taking the car to the parking nearby. The doorman was charming, helpful and very friendly. He helped me out of the car, asked me about my day. These little things make this place so special. 
The reception staff were great and again very helpful. Special thanks to Frederika (I hope I spelled it correctly). She obviously loves her job and despite me meeting her for the first time, we laughed and it really felt like ""home from home"". 
Our room was on the 6th floor, spacious, bright and just welcoming. 
I got a card and a fruit basket for my birthday too which was a lovely touch from the staff. 
We had a dinner in Palm Court restaurant and again the staff were superb. We ate here several times and seriously these were one of the best meals I had in a very very long time. 
It really is all about the small things that create an unforgettable experience - mini birthday cake with a candle, pink rubber duck they let you take home (I am thinking of starting a collection.. lol), the small talk with the security after our dinner.. All this created a feeling like I didn't want to go home... 
There goes a huge THANK YOU to all the staff who made us feel so welcome and who made my birthday the bet birthday ever!! 
And so we will be back! Soon! I promise.",5,2021,12,07
140,Luxury historic building with awesome staff,"Fully upgraded charming historic building with super friendly and professional staff.

Every staff member we encountered was professional, friendly and competent. 

Rooms are super nice with the most current upgrades and maintained very well.

Location is very accessible to key local attractions and metro station.",5,2021,12,07
140,Not good enough,"We returned to the langham after having a wonderful stay in the summer, if this was our first stay we wouldn’t have returned the room we were allocated wasn’t a quite room which is what we were after, the decor was tired and the bath was really shallow which was a little weird.

The staff are lovely but I’m not sure if we would return especially as they also added a  service charge on the room, the bar is wonderful but this stay just wasn’t good enough.",3,2021,12,04
140,Great experience.,"The whole experience was superb, from the being greeted at the front door, the reception, restaurant staff and food, the housekeeping staff and the unique lounge experience. Congratulations to all.  The room and common areas were extremely clean and well maintained.  The room facilities were as expected in a hotel of this standing. ",5,2021,12,02
140,Excellent stay,"From the moment we arrived our stay was excellent. We were too early to check in so we left our bags at the hotel and headed out, we received a phone call when our room was ready which was great. When we got up to the room, we thought it was fantastic. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The TV had channels such as Sky Sports and Sky Movies, which we thought was brilliant. 

We had afternoon tea at Palm Court and this was equally as brilliant as the rest of our stay. 

The staff at the hotel are faultless and make the hotel exactly what it is.",5,2021,11,29
140,Outstanding Hotel,"Joined my husband for a business trip to London, thoroughly enjoyed this exceptional hotel. From the room service to the last minute in- house tailor, the tea service , the staff, absolutely everything was exceptional. Very much looking forward to another. Stay at the Langham.",5,2021,11,27
140,"Excellent stay, highly recommended","Just back from an excellent stay at The Langham, a true luxury experience with a caring team going beyond expectations to make the stay memorable. The Club Lounge is the perfect place to find tranquility throughout the day, the Afternoon Tea at the Palm Court restaurant is a true experience (reserve in advance!). Excellent gym, spa and swimming pool + get a drink at the Artesian Bar + try the 'Toasties' at the Wigmore!",5,2021,11,23
140,If Calsberg made beds.....,"
The beautiful Langham ! Decorated with tasteful Christmas delights the hotel was extremely welcoming . We didn't check in till late so didn't spend long awake ! The king sized bed was , I have to say , the best bed I've ever slept in ! So comfortable  , excellent night's sleep. ",5,2021,11,23
140,Need to pull their socks up,"It has been a while since we had stayed in what I regard as a great Hotel.
With travelling easing we booked for three nights whilst in transit.
We were disappointed. The room which was pretty small ( not unusual for London) had not been cleaned properly and the toiletries had not been replaced.
We complained about this and some other small problems.
Eventually they were sorted out and the Assistant front desk manager  went out of
his way to be helpful.
I understand the problems are the reult of staffing difficulties which seem to be endemic in London. However they should tell us in advance that things are not running as they should be. This is not a cheap stay so please get it right next time.",4,2021,11,21
140,What an amazing experience,"Words can’t express the exceptional time we had during our 4 night weekend break for my 50th birthday.

The attention to detail, generosity, outstanding service and genuineness of everyone we came in to contact with, to ensure we had a wonderful time. 
An absolute credit to every member of staff and we have already booked our return visit. The Langham, London is definitely our choice for every stay in the future without hesitation.",5,2021,11,17
140,Outstanding,"We arrived early for our check-in which was no problem, our luggage was taken and we were escorted to the Langham club lounge where we were waited on with Champagne and snacks until our room was ready.
The staff are the real treasure in this hotel, from the managing director Doris Greif, who we met and spoke to a few times to the doorman Ian, all of the hotel staff were just fabulous.
I could go on forever about the place, but needless to say, we have had the best 4 days ever.
The hotel treated my wife like a princess as it was a very special birthday celebration.
To the Langham I can only say thank you and keep doing what you are doing.",5,2021,11,16
140,"Beyond stunning anyway but added to this were the festive decorations making the hotel magical. Staff amazing, helpful",& all with a smile. Location perfect with anything you need on the doorstep. From the moment we arrived the doorman suggested he would take a group photo of us in front of the hotel so we could all be included in one picture - so welcoming.Just an amazing experience from start to finish.,5,2021,11,15
140,Expectations Exceeded,"We stayed in a Junior Suite for 2 nights to celebrate my Wife's birthday and also our wedding anniversary and the whole experience was excellent from start to finish. The room was classically decorated with wooden floors and marble bathrooms giving an understated luxury feel, no Dubai bling here just British opulence.
The Langham Club is a oasis of calm in the center of London and we spent many hours here reading, relaxing and of course partaking in the  Champagne and cocktails that the staff were always ready to provide. Nothing was too much for the team in there and they are surely the hotels number 1 asset, the closest I have experienced this level of personalised service before was in the Queens Grill on QM2. 
Its the small touches that turn a good hotel into a great hotel and that will be my memory of the Langham from the Birthday cake in our room to the lounge team remembering our names.
If you get the chance to stay here grab it with both hands!",5,2021,11,11
140,Lovely Superior Room with super comfortable bed yet beware the discretionary 5% service charge from 1/11/21,"We treated ourselves as a wedding anniversary treat to a superior room/2 night stay.  The room was lovely, bed super comfortable with some small quirky characterful additions (like the Langham pink bath duck).  The disappointing surprise came at check out when the receptionist advised of a new 5% discretionary service charge from 1/11/21 on accommodation which hadn't been pre-advised upfront on booking.  In view the surprise service charge, we declined to pay it yet the exit experience left a sour taste feeling like a hidden cost cheeky.  We provided feedback to the hotel manager yet received a bland response.  Before our check out, would have rated our stay 5/5 yet felt uncomfortable after.  We now appreciate this isn't the only London 5* hotel with a service charge yet much prefer transparent and upfront pricing with the option to reward good service as appropriate.",4,2021,11,05
140,Exceptional Service and overall experience at the Langham Hotel,I have recently enjoyed a 4 day break at the Langham hotel.  If you are looking for some special treatment and overall excellent food and accommodation then I would highly recommend the Langham hotel.  A must is the Langham Club for that extra special treat.,5,2021,10,26
140,Amazing hotel with a quintessentially English feel.,"Fabulous location if you want to shop in Oxford Street, Regent Street or new bond street, set at the very top end of Regent street it is very much in the heart of the city, my sisters and I booked a family room, we love sharing when we get together and this room that could sleep five, was extremely spacious. But as a family room, it only had  two bath robes, two tea cups and only very limited bathroom products, it seemed like was setup as a double from house keeping. The entrance is lovely with beautiful chandeliers and a fire burning, making you feel very much at home, I like the reception just off set from the entrance so it is not the focus point of the entrance, the beds were wonderful, very comfortable. The tv in our room was not working, we did mention it to housekeeping on departure, who was very apologetic, and I was assured that had we called reception it was of been addressed immediately, of that I have no doubt, but it was a not a problem for us, we had no plans to watch television.  The basement pool was just wonderful, listen to the faint sounds of underground as you swim, very relaxing, and Dyson hair dryer (well done)  the artisan bar closed at midnight, which was a tad to early for a Saturday night, the wigmore a little earlier still, but both bars was very good. Love the rubber duck in the bathroom and the pink phones dotted around the hotel, also some lovely books and memorabilia of the hotel,  we had a great old photo of the kitchen staff from 1918. Well done the Langham, I have been looking to visit again soon and have noticed some great deals including afternoon tea, which I definitely will be taking advantage off.",5,2021,10,25
140,Lovely afternoon tea,"Whilst it isn’t cheap, as a treat the afternoon tea is very good.

The service was of a high standard with our principle server very engaging and helpful.

The teas and champagne all very good.  The afternoon tea itself was very nice.  Good fun around the biscuit theme.

The atmosphere also good with a live pianist",5,2021,10,23
140,Fabulous Hotel,"First Time At The Langham London , it was Amazing . We had a Suite it was fab , the Executive Lounge was Great , Will Definately Be Going Back . The Location Was Really Good as We didnt want to use the tube , so we walked everywhere , it was very central. Food was really good, couldn’t fault this hotel at all.
",5,2021,10,21
140,Excellent service and accommodation,"I have stayed here on numerous occasions but my recent experience was outstanding, the staff were very helpful and the accommodation is of the highest standard. I will definitely be coming again and would not hesitate in recommending  the Langham ",5,2021,10,15
140,Beautiful,"Stayed over the course of 3 nights, rooms were absolutely fabulous everything you would expect.
The service was excellent and we were catered for in every way possible, will definitely be visiting again",5,2021,10,12
140,"Beautiful hotel, incredible service","I stayed at the Langham for 2 nights for a Staycation. The arrival check in was efficient and polite. The room service was truly the best ever - incredible food and very generous, especially the breakfast. For some reason the bread especially was memorable :-) 
The room was super clean, well equipped with whatever I needed. I even worked from the hotel for a day and was able to do so easily as the WiFi was really good. 
Overall The Langham is beautiful, the service attentive but not intrusive, the food was out of this world (room service will never be the same). It is also located in one of the best places in London. Enjoy!",5,2021,10,11
140,Fantastic staff,"My wife and I stayed at the Langham for the third time this year at the begining of October. Again we had a really lovely stay. The staff are fantastic and the main reason we keep coming back is because of them. Yes the hotel facility's are what you would expect from a 5* hotel but its the staff that make the hotel what it is. They are so professional, friendly  and welcoming and seem to make every guest feel valued.",5,2021,10,11
140,Outstanding hotel.,"The Langham Hotel is a gorgeous hotel in an excellent location in London. Close to Regent Street, shops & restaurants. Staff service is exceptional.  We were in Executive Rooms with access to the lounge where food & drinks were available throughout the day and evening. Well worth the price.  Look forward to staying there again!",5,2021,10,10
140,Hospitality of the highest quality,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay at this wonderful hotel. We were celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary, and all the amazing staff ensured we had a fabulous experience. Everything was perfect, the spa treatments, the Executive Room 643, which was beautifully appointed, and the fabulous Club Lounge.
We would like to say a huge thank you to Nick and all the Club Lounge staff for making us so welcome each time we visited. the lounge. The breakfast, afternoon tea, evening canapés and the free flowing champagne was of the highest quality.
We would highly recommend the Langham to both couples and families, book now, you will have a fabulous time. My wife and I are very much looking forward to our next stay.",5,2021,10,06
140,Good but not outstanding,"Here for our anniversary and we were really looking forward to it. We parked at Citipark Clipstone Mews which was £21 for 24 hours. Highly recommend doing this as it was safe and just 9 mins walk away and a lot cheaper than the valet.

Hotel is amazing from the exterior and then upon entry. Stunning!! We arrived early and were told someone would call us when our room was ready so we used the pool in the meantime and our bags were looked after. The pool was a bit disappointing really. It is tiny and if you have a rowdy family in there like I did splashing and screaming then it isn’t quite the relaxing experience. There was also a shortage of towels and robes due to the hotel being busy. We then went to check on the room and it was ready though we hadn’t been called as promised. we were also told that our luggage had been sent to them room, which it hadn’t. Room was nice and spacious the bathroom especially. We then had a cake and some fruit arrive for our anniversary which was a lovely touch. 

We went out for dinner and a show then returned around 11pm. There seemed to be a buzz in the bar and restaurant area which was lovely to see. We slept soundly all night then opted for the breakfast. Now I do feel that this is extortionately priced at £38. It is not a buffet so you do feel a little ripped off. The cooked breakfast was okay - nothing outstanding unfortunately. Not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Check-out was efficient and smooth. 

All in all we had a nice stay that had some niggles. Perhaps I expected too much!",5,2021,10,03
140,Private dining experience,"Went here on 02/10/21 after my daughters wedding. The bride and groom booked the roux room for a private dining experience. Absolutely beautiful building inside and out. Amazing friendly, helpful polite staff. Special thank you to Freddy and Ronaldo our waiters for the night, they are brilliant waiters and made the night even more special. The food was fantastic, beautifully presented and delicious. Thank you to the chef and kitchen staff. This was a perfect night to finish the wedding day of Amy and Josh. Thank you all so much for making my daughters special day even more special.",5,2021,10,03
140,When is an upgrade not an upgrade.....,"Had high expectations for this hotel when we arrived we were told our room wasn't ready but should be in an hour, but we'd pleased to hear we'd been 'upgraded' from our superior room to a lovely room on the 7th floor facing the front of the hotel.  We came back 2 1/2 hours later and our room still wasn't ready even though we were past check in time.  When we finally checked in we realised our room was the standard superior room we'd paid for!  

Although this wasn't the best of starts this was the only low point.  The staff were all extremely friendly and the hotel itself is lovely.  We ate in the Palm restaurant which was satisfactory but not amazing IMO.  The hotel itself is extremely opulent as you'd expect and we were brought a bowl of fruit which was a nice touch.  It is also well placed for Oxford Street.

If it hadn't been for being mislead about our upgrade we would have been perfectly happy with the room.  All the superior rooms are the same cost at this hotel irrespective where they are positioned!  Most people would interpret an upgrade to be a room in the next category up and this sort of spin isn't needed and tarnishes the overall experience.

Would we stay again? probably only if their were offers on as there are many other wonderful hotels at this price point to experience.",3,2021,10,03
140,Top Hotel,"This is a top hotel. Totally luxurious and in a superb location. 
Very accommodating staff from concierge to reception to room-service.
Spotlessly clean and comfortable.
Perhaps a little pricey but very good value if you want a special treat",5,2021,09,30
140,Outstanding luxury,"From the minute we arrived we were made to feel welcome & at home! Nothing was too much trouble for any of that staff, they made us feel like family & they smiled the whole time. Ashley Jacques in particular was delightful. He went out of his way to ensure we felt relaxed & enjoyed our stay. The room was beautiful, especially the bathroom which was just pure luxury. We had afternoon tea at Palm Court which really did live up to expectations, absolutely divine. The swimming pool & spa was a welcome break & the staff were equally as welcoming & helpful. Thank you to everyone for a thoroughly enjoyable stay, we hope to return again soon!",5,2021,09,26
140,Great hotel,Great service. Excellent staff. Seems to be very modern and upscale. Wonderful room with all amenities. Very clean. Really enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to friends. Nice location. Felt very safe and followed all Covid 19 protocols.,5,2021,09,26
140,The Langham Hotel London Portland Place,I wouldn't go to any other hotel in London. The Langham is a beautiful hotel with exceptional service and facilities. It is a five-star hotel where the staff make you feel at home.  Its location couldn't be better. If I could give it more stars I would. ,5,2021,09,25
140,Perfect afternoon tea,"A simply sublime experience from start to finish. From the greeting by the doorman onwards we were made to feel special. Fabulous staff who couldn’t do enough for us. I really appreciated the advice about the choice of tea and also the option to try different kinds. The cakes were perfection in appearance and taste. 
Thank you Langham. You gave my daughter and me a fabulous afternoon together and we will treasure the memory .",5,2021,09,23
140,A warm welcome and memorable experience despite the pandemic.,"Given our last visit was pre-pandemic I wasn't sure quite what to expect. This was a 10 person special birthday trip postponed from last year and it needed to go well. Whilst the Roux at the Landau and many of the rooms are not yet open the special essence of the hotel, and why we keep coming back, the friendly and efficient service was still present and on point. I feel for the whole hospitality industry and as for us, and I imagine other returning guests, the hotel still managed to give us the 'home away from home' experience that is a huge part of the appeal. Having access to the Club Lounge which we used as a base was a great benefit and visits to the busy Wigmore & Artesian venues were memorable. Whilst the service level in the relaxed environment of the Club is particularly personal I have to say staff in all the other venues we visited were very efficient and personable despite the challenge of wearing the mask. It was surprisingly quiet in the Palm Court where we had the special dinner and I think, given the absence of the fine dining Landau more could be done with the menu but the team who looked after us there could not have done more. Like all hotels, the Langham is having to contend with an exceptionally challenging environment but given these difficulties, our visit exceeded our expectations.",5,2021,09,22
140,Classic London Luxury,"Was in The Langham for a quick one night stay while over in London. This is classic, grand hotel luxury. It's not flashy or ""hip"" but it's not trying to be I appreciate it for that. There are plenty of wonderful hip hotels in London. The rooms are old school in appearance but once look closely the details make themselves apparent. From the gorgeous floors in the room walkways to the wonderfully made English furniture, there is clear attention to the detail. The bedding is absolutely plush, one of the best sleeps in a hotel I've had in some time. The pool, steam room and sauna is also very impressive and something that a lot of hotels in London don't have. The locker rooms are spotless, with the same attention to detail in the rest of the hotel. If I had a knock on the rooms it would be that I'm not a fan of iHome devices in a 5-star hotel and should be upgraded to something such as a Bowers and Wilkins. Overall a great stay in an excellent location, would not hesitate to recommend!",5,2021,09,21
140,Beautiful Hotel in a good location,"Our experience was good but not great, the hotel seemed to be suffering from a  Covid hangover, shortage of staff lead to areas being closed.
Our dining experience in the Palm Court was not exceptional, although well cooked with quality products
Not a 5 star experience",3,2021,09,20
140,Perfect anniversary weekend with excellent staff who make you feel special.,"I never write reviews, but had such a good stay at the Langham that really wanted to.

The hotel is in an amazing location just north of Oxford Circus, and a really impressive building. Great first impression. Staff really welcoming and felt everybody wanted to help us make the most of our stay.

We were upgraded to Junior Suite from Executive Room and this was really large with a lovely 9th floor view over west London. As we were marvelling at that, housekeeping arrived with a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine, cake and fruit which was a great touch.

I'd wondered about the extra to pay for a room with Club Lounge access. This is on the 3rd floor and serves a delicious breakfast between 6.30am-midday. We didn't go to afternoon tea between 2-4pm, but did do cocktails (that's from 5-8pm). Had a nice martini and Tattinger with some charcuterie and snacks. We had quite an early dinner reservation else would have definitely spent longer in here. There's a lot of space, variety of seating and has a nice feeling.

Used the pool in the morning, which is very attractive and long. Not sure the bamboo in pots adds to the ambience, but hey ho! There are steam rooms in the mens and women's changing rooms. It's quite complex to get to but well signed.

Our only issue was the staff at check in repeatedly underestimated how soon till our room was ready, so we ended up hanging around for 75min when really we should have just gone out nearby and got them to ring us. I think this was because he couldn't get housekeeping to give him a straight answer, and was trying to be positive with us, but you should always underpromise!

Hard to judge value-wise as we have never spent this much on a hotel, but after covid etc just felt like splashing out. The room was expensive - having said that we then felt really spoilt and didn't actually spend anything else other than a nightcap in the Artesian. And I think for this kind of trip I prefer this approach instead of paying a cheaper room rate and then being constantly upsold.

Sorry for the ramble, fundamentally, this was a lovely weekend that we're missing already, really made by welcoming staff who make you feel special with little touches throughout, and we will look forward to returning!",5,2021,09,20
140,Great stay,"My boyfriend kindly took me here for a birthday treat. I had a wonderful stay, the staff were lovely, the room was great and completely silent despite facing the road. The bed was massive and so comfy, I just didn’t want to leave. 

We enjoyed using the pool, which was pretty much empty both times we went down, and also the sauna (although it was a shame the sauna is split men’s and women’s so we couldn’t be together). 

We had breakfast one morning, perhaps a bit pricey but it was good. I’d also highly recommend the Wigmore next door, and the Artisian which does great cocktails. 

There was a small mix up at the beginning as my boyfriend had requested champagne and a birthday cake for our arrival, but the hotel forgot to provide. However they way they dealt with it was exceptional, obtaining a cake last minute and not charging for it or the champagne. We were very impressed. 

Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,09,19
140,One of my favourite hotels,"I stayed at the Langham Tuesday 14 September 2021 and it was the perfect experience, the attention to detail, the level of service, I don't think could be improved upon. The in-room dining was on time and perfectly presented, I was rushing around on a business trip so limited for time and the staff were very responsive to my requests, which made my day much easier. The in-room wifi was fast, enabling me to attend my virtual meeting without issue. The breakfast in the Palm Court, again was beautifully presented, great service and delicious. I can't thank the team enough and I will be returning, hopefully next time for leisure so I can spend more time in the hotel enjoying the facilities. Many thanks for a brilliant experience.",5,2021,09,19
140,The Langham,"The hotel is highly rated, but is still suffering from the lockdown headache. Parts of it are not open, and it is the sum of the parts that make this hotel.
The service is friendly and efficient, but maybe due to a lack of staff some bits are missing. Masks for covid by the staff are worn mainly around their chins and only pulled up occasionally. However the standard of cleanliness and access to antibacterial is very good. Food in the Palm Court is good, but not the highest standard.",4,2021,09,17
140,"Opulent suite, delicious food and sublime wines was only surpassed by the outstanding service and customer experience from all s","We have stayed in many 5 star London Hotels but the historic  Langham Hotel surpasses them all. 

We booked a 3 night anniversary break in a junior suite which gives you access to the executive Langham Club. This club facility is a must if you want the true butler service. 

In summary, the opulence of our suite, the delicious food and sublime wines was only surpassed by the outstanding service and customer experience from all of the Langham staff.

We have found our true London home.",5,2021,09,16
140,"Disappointing, did not leave upto expectations","This was my first stay at the Langham Hotel and overall it was a very disappointing stay. The level of service was quite poor and the rooms were disappointing. Having stayed at many 5 start hotels this was perhaps our worst experience.

Upon arrival the door man did not approach to great us at the car or open the car door. After a few minutes I had to approach him to take the car keys so the car could be parked.

During breakfast some items asked for were not delivered and all the staff appeared in a great rush. They would come to the table but would run away as quickly as possible.

When the evening meal was delivered to the room the the table was not opened and just left, leaving us to sort it out.

Upon checkout I informed reception that I would collect the car and luggage at 8pm. Upon my return to the hotel the car was no there and I was left waiting outside for over 20 minutes. I was not offered to wait inside the hotel.

There is a level of service expected at such a hotel which just was not evident at the Langham. Will stick to other hotels in London in the future.

I reported these issues plus others to the hotel after my stay but received no response.",3,2021,09,13
140,Very special treat,"From the second you walk in you feel like royalty and like you’ve arrived at your new home. 
Room is also outstanding and the extra touches for our 2 year old are the best we’ve ever had won’t spoil it for any future guests.  
Cannot recommend it high enough it’s not cheap at all but you can tell your money is been well spent on the staff and hotel. 
We will 100% be back next year for a special treat!",5,2021,09,13
140,Afternoon Tea And Dinner,"I visited the Langham hotel, London in  August 2021 with my family for an afternoon tea and dinner. Before we were entering the lobby I was stopping by the right hand side corridor where the lounge was quiet to change my shoes, after got changed I decided to take 1 or 2 photos was next to the mirror and stairs, then I needed to use the restroom before eating. 
While I was using the  restroom I have a few knocks on the toilet door and was asked by a woman, name - Slovia with strong eastern european accent that I have to leave the building immediately ( As we entered the main entrance, there were 3 males security guards didn’t question us with any kind of problems). I thought to myself what the point of staying in here to eat or staying at this hotel, when they treated us so badly, so we leave quietly. 
I have been travelling all over the world and London all the poshest hotels like:- Intercontinental, The Grosvenor, Four seasons hotel at Park Lane, so on and never have this kind of bad treatments in my life since I live in London for 40 years.
I was told that because I took 1 or 2 photos at the mirror so I can promote my business (I don’t know where she got this ideas from, I could take photos of Four Seasons Hotel, Park Lane where there have a proper lounge which alots of flowers, why would I chose this hotel when I took the photos with mirror and staircase). I left the building already this woman is still following us all the way to the road. She was the one being racist,  harassing us and was threatening to called the police on us. She kept on threatening and I took a photo of her since I have the right to do so.",1,2021,09,10
140,Made to feel special. ,"My wife has had afternoon tea in many of London's top hotels. I have only done a couple so for me this was very good. The sandwiches were very tasty and the variety was very nice. The highlight of this year's afternoon tea was the British biscuit; iced gem, jammy dodger, bourbon, strawberry tart and custard cream. The transformation of these to something worthy of The Langham was fantastic. My favourite was the custard cream but all of them were excellent. The scones were lovely. Whilst the price, including 2 glasses of champagne was a bit steep, £180 for two, the service was the bit that made it special. Flitan and Ivan made us both feel like we were the only people there. Nothing was too much trouble and we enjoyed our afternoon.

140,Birthday and wedding anniversary celebration,"This was a surprise visit to this hotel arranged by my family , which included my children and their partners..
On arrival 1 out of 3 rooms were ready so we were able to put our bags in this room which  w as fab..then we found out they had upgraded us to a suite which was an unexpected surprise.
We had a few slight issues while here , but they were sorted out straight away with no problems.
The kids enjoyed the pool.
We also ate in the palm court on the Saturday night which was absolutely fabulous, service was out of this world along with the food .
Thank you for a wonderful stay",5,2021,09,08
140,Luxury Hotel that delivers,Ideal base from which to explore Soho and the surrounding areas. Service was excellent and we were offered a free room upgrade. We would recommend this as a ideal romantic break. We also enjoyed the Wigmore attached to the hotel. Breakfast is not the best value and there are much better option close by,5,2021,09,06
140,Amazing,"Had an amazing stay at The Langham, every aspect of our stay was brilliant, the room was luxurious, bed was the most comfortable we have ever stayed in. The staff were very friendly, incredibly helpful and made us feel very special. ",5,2021,09,06
140,Anniversary celebration staycation,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at the end of August, from Sunday night to Wednesday. We have stayed at a number of luxury hotels (5*) in the UK, Europe and the US, so we have a certain expectations of this kind of hotel. 
Our favourite thing about our stay was the Spa, gym, swimming pool and the steam room and sauna, which were amazing and the staff there were just the friendliest and most helpful, they really made you feel welcome. 

The dining from the Palm Court kitchen which we sampled in the The Artesia and through the pre-10pm in room dining was exceptional. The concierge team were also fantastic and could not do enough to make us feel welcome and we really appreciated the complimentary gluten free chocolate torte and sparkling wine they gave us for our anniversary. 

There were however a few things which I felt were not of the standard that I would expect of a 5* hotel: 
For one the 'English breakfast' purchased with the room rate online on The Langham own booking site seemed very sporadic to say the least. The only option for breakfast was to eat in the Palm Court or in-room. However the Palm Court breakfast experience on the first morning was quite bizarre as the al la carte 'English breakfast' that was served on the Monday morning looked like something served at  a Holiday Inn .....items which were not even on the menu such as baked beans and cook-from-frozen hash browns seemed very out-of-place in such luxurious surroundings. Even the fantastic, experienced porter who had been brought in to help with the breakfast service seemed confused as to the contents on the plate. To be fair to the hotel I am a tricky customer as I have a medical condition which means that I have a limited diet (FODMAP), which I did state on my booking notes, but the only substitution to compensate for  85% of the breakfast menu that I could not eat was the offer of some pretty awful gluten free bread, and as I stated previously the one thing that I should have been able to eat (The 'English breakfast') seemed to come with some additions which made that rather tricky too.  So overall the first breakfast experience was a little disappointing to say the least. My husband however was very pleased he was able to eat as many items off the menu as he possibly could! After having a rather disappointing experience on the first morning the standard of the breakfast did get progressively much better but there were no substitute options for anything on the menu for my dietary requirements other than the gluten free bread, which was unusual for a hotel which prides itself in personalised customer service, and previous experiences in other hotels (Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons, The Wellington- Madrid) where I felt that the choice at breakfast was superb for different dietary requirements and was a real 'event' rather than an 'after-thought'. 

We found the interiors of hotel to be of the standard expected, and the interior decoration of the room (a 'Deluxe King' room) was fantastic and quite reminiscent of the Ritz in Berlin. The bed was humungous! and amazingly comfortable and the marble bathroom with a separate shower was truly fabulous.  

But it did seem that there were a few things that seemed odd - I noticed a splash stain on the desk lamp lampshade, and in the bottom right hand corner of the television had been melted by something. Also after the turn-down service on the first night there was a clump of dark black hair left in on the floor in the lobby area, which was a bit weird. (see photos)

But to be honest we still really enjoyed our stay and maybe we'll be back to see if it's any different once the post-covid/Brexit lockdown teething problems have eased and normal service has resumed.",3,2021,09,05
140,Out of this world,"We arrived, checked in & found out we had been upgraded to an amazing suite. We had paid for a suite but as it was my birthday they had upgraded us big time! 

Opening the doors to the suite we were hit with a lovely & fresh smell, it was absolutely spotless. I mean spotless. We had champagne, cake and a lovely welcome card. 

The comfort levels were phenomenal. The comfiest bed I have ever slept in, the living room was beautiful, spacious, cosy, comfortable. 

Service was just out of this world. From start to finish. Every member of staff couldn’t have done more from us! Special shout out the the woman checking us in! I have forgotten her name but she recommended an amazing crystal shop!

Food - out of this world! No words needed. Best steak I’ve ever had!

My only negative, I sent an email basically mirroring the above to thank them personally & I never got a response. Which doesn’t matter really, but, would’ve been nice!",5,2021,09,05
140,"Afternoon tea for a vegan, superb. ","A great afternoon tea session at this grand Hotel  , the staff were so polite and helpful. Best of all the food presented to us was superb  i would definitely consider another visit soon. As an advantage it is centrally located and allows visitors to explore a side of London full of history and beauty. ",5,2021,09,05
140,Outstanding!,"We stayed at The Langham, London for two nights a couple of weeks ago and it’s difficult to express in a review how amazing this place is.  Our stay was quite simply way beyond expectation.  The whole environment is geared 100% towards satisfying customers, and The Langham staff do that absolutely: from the moment you arrive at the entrance (in our case, to have our car valet parked) to the moment you arrive to your room, every step seems amazingly choreographed to ooze class and the feeling of being loved and welcomed.
 
Our suite was perfect in every way possible.  It was spotlessly clean (as were all the hotel areas and corridors); very well laid out and comfortable (and with beautiful décor and interiors); and the surprise birthday treat was much appreciated and enjoyed (thank you!).  We had access to the Club Lounge and ventured there on a number of occasions for drinks, breakfast, etc.  Every time we were made to feel like royalty.  Nick, who mostly hosted the lounge whilst we were there, was simply brilliant in every way.  Poi/Poy (apologies – not sure of the spelling), who mostly served us during our stay, was equally awesome and his cocktails are something of legend.  This is not to detract from praising the rest of the lounge (or other hotel) staff but, sadly, we didn’t catch any more names.  Quite frankly, every member of staff that we had contact with during our stay was excellent in every way.  The service at The Langham really is outstanding.
 
The pool area is lovely, the corridors and access areas all perfectly kept, and the hotel entrance/lobby is beautiful.  We didn’t have time to visit the restaurant or Artesian bar during this visit, but they looked great as well.
 
Finally, Harry (one of the managers?) who we met in the lobby, was really great in advising us of local areas to go and informing us more generally about the hotel, and he made extra efforts to ensure the birthday stay was memorable.

In short, this hotel is something of a nirvana of excellence – arguably, one of the best (if not THE best) hotels we have ever stayed at (especially in London).  Yes, this was a special stay, and that was very well acknowledged, but I suspect that the service etc would be just as exceptional etc at any time. 

Thanks so much to you ALL for making our stay truly outstanding – we will be back!",5,2021,09,03
140,service improvements required,"We stayed for three nights at The Langham in an Executive Room with Club Lounge access. Our room was lovely, the Club was a pleasant place to relax, and the spa facilities are excellent. Overall the service we received was great but it was let down in two areas. 

First, turn down service was not completed on one evening. We left our room at 6.25pm to find a note had been placed under the door, informing us that the maid had knocked on the door at 7pm. I know The Langham can pull off many wonders of the universe for its guests but travelling through time is surely not one of them! The duty manager said that he would investigate. We never received a proper apology or any follow up as to the outcome of the investigation, not even after I highlighted this in my survey feedback after our stay. I felt at worse that we had been lied to, or at best, that an honest mistake had happened. An explanation and apology would have been appreciated.

Second, there was one waitress in The Club who should be reminded that a face mask does not disguise rudeness. She was quite rude when taking our lunch order and walked off shaking her head. We were nothing but polite to her and all staff for that matter but admittedly my mother in law's indecisiveness about what she wanted to eat might have been frustrating! Nevertheless, you don't expect a member of staff at The Langham to display such visible annoyance at that - if a valued guest (my mother in law visits regularly and is known by the staff) is a bit indecisive with her lunch order, so what? It was unprofessional and unacceptable. 

These were two incidents, and I have thought about whether it is fair to highlight them, especially as it has been a tough year for the industry and also because our stay on the whole was enjoyable. The staff on the whole are superb and so friendly. But, to be honest, we love The Langham and would only up until this point choose to stay there when we are visiting London because it has always been a special place. Unfortunately, after these two issues, I am now thinking twice about that and might consider trying elsewhere, such as The Corinthia, in future. I really do struggle to forgive bad or rude service at this price point - sorry.",4,2021,09,02
140,Fantastic stay at the Langham,"We returned to the Langham for my birthday and our wedding anniversary.  Booking the wellness package and executive room which includes access to the best club lounge in UK .  Our room was upgraded to most beautiful suite with a bottle of Roux rose champagne , well stocked fruit bowl, cake , delicious chocolate and sparkling bottle of tea.  Our suite was absolutely beautiful ,  roomy amd well stocked of everything .  I could easily move in!! The club lounge absolutely outstanding with free flowing tattinger champagne , cocktails , drinks of your choice snd fantastic canapes .  Service is the best .  As part of the wellness package we had a one hour free signature massage and can only describe it as heavenly and really good for us .  The spa itself is beautiful.  The swimming pool we didn’t use this time but can assure from last visit it’s wonderful.  We did use the gym which has the latest equipment , very clean , well stocked with water, ,cold flannels , towels , fruit and products to spray, clean down .  No earphones but expect that with what’s happened with Covid .  However excellent gym and ours others to shame . As part of our wellness package we had lunch at the palm court with excellent food and service .  The night before after the club lounge closed we went to the Artisen bar which was excellent and service again outstanding. Unfortunately because it was a Sunday & bank  holiday and Wigmore and Landsu.  However I expect the service at both to match the rest of the hotel.  The Lamgham for us is now our favourite hotel and look forward to returning .  ",5,2021,09,01
140,A very special hotel,"This was our third time staying in an executive room at there is still so much that is great about this hotel.  The location is superb, the staff are friendly and the breakfast is brilliant (as long as you already have it in the room rate).  The stand out staff were probably in the Palm Court at breakfast.  However, and there is a however...

The food offering in the club lounge are hugely down on the pre-covid era and on other club lounges we have been to.  No sandwiches with the scones for the afternoon tea as before and the Hors d'oeuvres were extremely poor (one cheese option instead of a cheese board and one ham/meat option instead of a selection of cured meats).  The other offerings were simply not inviting.  

We were able to discuss the issues with the manager and he was interested in our thoughts and suggestions and promised that a review would take place and he made a very nice gesture to make up for our disappointment.    We really do hope this will be a serous review and changes will be made as this is a great hotel that needs to aim high and not cheapen itself and its offerings.  

So yes I have been generous with the 5 out of 5 but it needs to work harder to keep those 5 star reviews.",5,2021,09,01
140,Stay at the Langham,We stayed at this prestigious venue for a family wedding. Had a most comfortable stay and staff were particularly attentive without being overbearing. Did not have time to visit as many of the areas of the hotel as we would have liked but those we did certainly lived up to reputation. Hope to return at some future date. A bit pricey but guess that's par for its location.,4,2021,08,31
140,Plush and grand but well overpriced,"We stayed at the Langham over the August bank holiday weekend.  First impression were of an old style grand and plush hotel, overall rather pompous and pretentious.  That said, all the staff were friendly and helpful.  We were given a room on the top floor which was quiet, and were grateful for that.  The room was very clean and well looked after, but on the small side.  The bathroom was disappointing, no ventilation fan and no separate shower - the shower was part of the bath unit, not something I expect in a five star hotel!  The bathroom shampoo and shower gel were cheap Chinese rubbish instead of a well known British brand.  The flat screen TV was OK and had all the usual choices you get in London hotels.  The door was old fashioned and was noisy to shut - there was no internal door to separate the hallway from the room itself, again a disappointment.  We were lucky in not having neighbours because soundproofing was definitely not good - you could hear the cleaners banging wardrobe doors and the like.  The bed was not great and not awful, just average and too hard for my taste.  Air conditioning was odd, too cold at night and too warm during the day - no amount of tweaking seemed to change that.  We avoided paying the ridiculous £40 each for a breakfast - there are Starbucks and Pret-a-Manger nearby, across Regent Street.  I was angered that, given we paid over £300 a night for the room we did not get breakfast included.  As for dinner, you would be expected to pay around £100 each, so out of the question, I would rather donate to charity!  Finally, the lifts to the rooms are very small and tight and can only take three people at most, excluding luggage - take note if several of you are coming together.  In summary, a plush but pretentious hotel that I will not visit again - if you like all the pomp and grandness then go for it, but don't expect value for money.",3,2021,08,30
140,Absolutely fabulous stay at The Langham London .,We come back to stay for the second time but this time we come with are children and we had the most amazing time ever everyone went above and beyond most amazing memories were made staff was absolutely fabulous children loved everything was fantastic can’t wait to return.,5,2021,08,29
140,The perfect stay once again,"This was our second stay at The Langham within 8 weeks, the first for work and the second for a holiday. We cannot fault this beautiful hotel. The perfect setting for a luxury few nights away. From the moment you arrive it is an oasis from the bustling feel of the city.

We were originally staying in a superior room, however our television was faulty and the reception team swiftly moved us to a deluxe room just a few doors down on the 6th floor (616 to 623). The rooms are all spotlessly clean and have a 5 star feel in all aspects. Thank you to the housekeeping team. 

We had dinner both in the Palm Court and in room dining, both great and having a severe food allergy, the staff made me feel very at ease and catered for. The only improvement we would like is possibly more variety on the Palm Court menu/in room dining.

The spa was beautiful, we could have spent our entire 3 days there. A little busier in the afternoon than in the mornings sometimes.

Thank you to all of the staff for making our stay. We hope to be back around the winter/Christmas period.",5,2021,08,27
140,Wonderful x 10,"From the doormen to Harry England at reception to the housekeeping team and amazing service and atmosphere in the Artesian Bar. 
Harry England went out of his way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible so a big shout out to him.
Thank you all for a most memorable stay.",5,2021,08,27
140,Five star London,"A lovely stay in a beautiful hotel.  Very nice room with excellent tea and coffee facilities. Excellent pool which we made full use of, never too crowded.  Good location in walking distance of many of central London’s attractions.  Good tube connections from Oxford Circus.  Disappointed that there was no breakfast buffet.  The a la carte options are very expensive.  Pret does a more economical breakfast just across the road.  Would also recommend Salt and Pepper in Bloomsbury Street if you are heading for the British Museum.",4,2021,08,26
140,"Not a 5 star hotel but great location,,,","I stayed in The Langham Hotel last week for 4 nights with my son.
So, the location is great and you get all the shops and cafes nearby but for the price you pay you expect 5 star quality rooms, pool etc....

So the CONS are: 

Very weak water pressure in the bathroom
Water is not hot but just warm...
In room dining is a disappointment..not hot and not tasty at all...
Swimming pool is tiny and if you have more than 3 people in it, it gets uncomfortable..
Room view is horrible, just facing some grey building with offices..
Windows and windowsills are dusty
Not enough storage for clothes
One of the lifts was not working throughout while stay so we had to wait for a while as there are only 2 lifts..

And most importantly very confusing info when booking the hotel, the Receptionist told me that there is £75 food and beverage credit for us to use a day!!! 
BUT UPON CHECKING OUT it turned out that it £75 credit per stay (which was 3 nights ...) So, please do check everything thoroughly and get it all in paper!

Pros
Great location
Friendly Staff
Charming doormen
Posh entrance Hall",3,2021,08,25
140,Best hotel stay I have ever had,"My boyfriend and I are key workers who both received vouchers as part of the Langhams birthday promotion. We felt so grateful and lucky that the kind man who spotted us in our uniform stopped us in the street, convinced us he wasn’t dodgy, and then came and literally made our day with those vouchers and a box of afternoon tea! 

The hotel staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. From the minute we checked in to the minute we left everyone was just so helpful. Even passing staff in the corridor was a pleasant experience! We absolutely loved it here and wished we could have been staying for more than one night! 

We had the superior king room which was really nice, good in size and clean. The fruit and chocolates we received in the room was such a thoughtful addition and really tasty! 

The spa area was also lovely. Although we didn’t have treatments, we did use the pool. It was a nice temperature, spacious and clean. I was very happy with my swim. Also, you can call the reception who are happy to walk you down to the spa from your room and make it seem like no trouble at all.

We had dinner and breakfast included. The palm court restaurant is stunning, really nice decor and the food was amazing. One of the best meals I have ever had! We were served by a gentleman called (excuse the spelling) Flaiten. He was so kind, he did everything he could to make sure we were happy and we couldn’t praise him enough. We then went to the Wigmore afterwards where we endured the most spectacular cocktails with, again, amazing service. The punch was also a must-try drink!! The barman was extremely friendly and helped us choose the best drinks and he seemed excited to want to make them for us.

We feel so lucky to have been able to stay here. We have had no issues at all. My boyfriend and I are a student doctor and nurse who have had a very interesting experience the past year or so! It was nice to have this time to relax and feel appreciated. We hope that we will be able to come back here. Next time i’m going for the spa treatment for sure!",5,2021,08,24
140,Excellent 5* Honeymoon Weekend at the Langham!,"We loved staying at the Langham, London.

The whole experience was excellent from start to finish. 

Booked as our honeymoon hotel, We were first greeted by the doormen & concierge service who were extremely attentive & quick at taking our bags on arrival.

We arrived a few hours early, before check in time, but this was no problem for the reception team, who not only found us a room, but upgraded it for our special occaision! About 10 minutes later our bags arrived via the concierge service, which was very impressive! Given how busy the reception was at the time. 

The touches of the peaches, cake & chocolates, along with a personalised thank you about our stay, made it memorable!

The room itself was excellent, and felt like home from home, we had a room with the best shower I have ever experienced in it!

The bed & bedding was simple, large and luxury!

We didn't eat in the hotel, but the palm court looked amazing, and next time we stay, we will definitely get some food!

",5,2021,08,23
140,Home away from home,"A home away from home! We haven’t felt so relaxed since the start of the pandemic. We wanted to have a change of scene but didn’t want to run the risk of going overseas and getting stuck anywhere because of restrictions, so we chose a staycation at The Langham. We regretted nothing! We stayed in an executive room which was huge and well appointed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the linens so soft! Bathroom was spotlessly clean and the deep bath and rain shower were much appreciated. 

Service was perfect and never obtrusive. We felt so comfortable with the Covid precautions and everything was spotless. 
We had the pool to ourselves more than once and the changing rooms were also spotless and had everything we needed for a comfortable spa and pool visit. 

Room service was lovely and the desserts to die for.  Breakfast is also highly recommended. 
We started planning our next visit before we even checked out. We recommend the afternoon tea in the palm court and a visit to The Wallace collection of you have the time. Thank you to all the lovely staff at The Langham!",5,2021,08,23
140,Excellent Service & Facilities,"Fantastic stay at the Langham, great service and friendly staff coupled with an excellent hotel made our weekend stay a joy.  The club lounge was a relaxing haven where you could enjoy snacks and drinks throughout the day and always looked after by attentive staff.",5,2021,08,23
140,Fantastic to be back,"Lovely to be able to return to the Langham. We always stay there when in London.
Club lounge is excellent, staff just superb and we were happy to be able to use the pool.
Nothing was too much for them and we’re looking forward to returning soon.",5,2021,08,23
140,Beautiful hotel. Loved it.,"This was a beautiful stay.

The room was spotless. 

Loved the bathroom - a separate shower and bath. 

The complimentary cake - very yummy :) 

The robes were nice but could be lighter and smoother (just my preference) 

Everyone was so welcoming and polite. I couldn’t ask for more. 

The breakfast was delicious. We ate full English and pancakes. 

I wish we tried the hotel restaurant for dinner as we went out to eat—big mistake :). 
After returning from our not so great dinner experience, we ordered some room service. I cannot believe a hotel can get biryani so right; I was very impressed. Their chicken sandwich was lovely too. 

I cannot wait to return. I will be trying out the spa and other amenities available next time.",5,2021,08,22
140,One of the best Stays In London!,"The Langham London was one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Booked a one night stay for my partners 30th Birthday over the weekend. Champagne on checkin! What better way to start your break! They sent a small cake, card and fruit to the room on arrival. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who made sure we had a pleasent stay. They even waited for us to leave the hotel before completing a rose petal turn down service. A pleasent surprse that eveing. The location was perfect and central so wasnt too far from anything. And to top it off the pool was fantatic. Will definatly return. ",5,2021,08,19
140,5 stars just isn’t enough!,"Five stars just isn’t enough for this wonderful place! 

My husband and I have stayed at The Langham lots during the past ten years and it just gets better and better! We really missed visiting during Covid but we’ve been lucky enough to stay on a couple of occasions during the last few months. 

On this visit, we originally booked 3 nights for my birthday and our booking was dealt with by Charlotte who is the ultimate professional and always goes above and beyond in looking after us. We had a junior suite which gave us club lounge access and this time we brought our 9 year old daughter with us as well. 

Neil, who greeted us at the door, was professional and friendly and made us feel so welcome to be back, as did the gentlemen who checked us in. 

Our room was lovely, up on the ninth floor. It was spacious and had a beautiful marble bathroom. The bed was huge and so comfy. 

It wasn’t long before we were back in the club lounge - our favourite aspect of the hotel! We really couldn’t have been looked after any better in the club lounge during the duration of our stay. The service was excellent and we were constantly offered and served the most delicious food and drinks. The club lounge itself is just a great concept for guests, spacious and relaxing. We had breakfast here every day, the choice was excellent and food delicious. 

The hotel also organised Happy Birthday balloons and a cake for me which was a lovely touch. 

We had the pleasure of meeting Sylvie, Director of Housekeeping, who regularly popped to see us and check in on how our stay was going. 

Anyway, we had such a great time that we just couldn’t bring ourselves to leave after 3 nights and instead decided to stay for 4 which was a wonderful bonus. 

I sat in the club lounge on our day 5 at the hotel, just before we left, emailing Charlotte to rebook - I needed to know that we would be returning soon before I could leave! 

I think this most beautiful building, always meticulously maintained to the highest of standards and furnished with the most luxurious items (carpet, bedding, toiletries etc...) with staff who are professional, friendly, caring, genuine and super smiley, where nothing is too much trouble, is a truly winning combination which has continued to and I’m sure always will keep drawing us back. It’s certainly not difficult to see why The Langham is and remains to be our favourite hotel in the UK. We can’t wait to return again as soon as possible.",5,2021,08,17
140,Wedding anniversary sublime,"We have just got back from a three day wedding anniversary celebration.

Fadi Upgraded our rooms which was super nice to allow us access into the club lounge.

Let me tell you if it’s going to cost you an extra couple of hundred pounds a night it is so worth it.

With free food and champagne, Also a much quieter breakfast experience. 

Kwan Made our stay in the lounge lovely. 

Other stuff perhaps not as confident as him were still super nice and attentive.

From now on I will always try to get an upgrade to this area our room was also amazing and I cannot fault the whole stay.",5,2021,08,17
140,Soooooo good,"What a fabulous hotel this is. We had the best weekend here. Every one of the staff was so lovely and genuine. My gf had a nice massage at the hotel spa and she said it was incredible. The Artesan lou ge in the evening was fantastic, the waiter remembered us and our drinks from the night before which was a nice touch. We just loved this hotel
So much. We have just booked for my birthday in november cannot wait to come back",5,2021,08,16
140,Afternoon Tea,"We visited The Langham today for afternoon tea as part of a birthday celebration. The food and drink was delicious, with top-ups of both offered freely. The venue is beautiful. The staff are all welcoming and helpful, especially Nina who served us. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion. ",5,2021,08,16
140,Langham Experience.....,"Amazing hotel.Staff inside and out were exceptional. We stayed in junior suite which was lovely size had Club Lounge access  which is are preferred  choice. Such a beautiful hotel the staff are a credit to the Company. The Club Lounge was spot on with drinks food and service other 5star hotel seem to be doing away with part or all .We love you it took lockdown to venture into the Langham as we normally  travel abroad so we will be back hopefully  over the Christmas period. Thank you.

140,So good we didn’t want to leave!,"This is a superb hotel.  My husband and I visited the Langham London 6-9 August celebrating our wedding anniversary and then my husbands 60th birthday.  We stayed on the third floor and had access to the Langham club which was, on this weekend, run by Nick and his excellent team.  Nothing was too much trouble and it was a delight to stay there.  We didn’t want to leave and get back to our real lives!   We will definitely be going back.   Thank you Nick and the staff at the Langham club for making our stay so special.",5,2021,08,13
140,Amazing Experience For The Full Family!,The hotel and it's staff were brilliant did everything above and beyond our expectations. My 5 year old daughter loved every moment we were there. Will recommend to everyone and will visit again! Thank you!,5,2021,08,13
140,Super hotel,"What a great Hotel.  My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights just to escape home as all the family summer holidays cancelled.  Fabulous staff, spotlessly clean, great location. It has has a good gym and a nice pool too.  We came back soaked one afternoon and a member of staff saw us and immediately sent tea to our room - how great is that!!? And the acid test/question - “would you stay again?”  Absolutely.",5,2021,08,13
140,Wonderful,"Fantastic hotel, from the minute you check in to the moment you check out you are made to feel welcome, valued and respected. All of the staff are wonderful, the hotel is luxurious , clean and well managed. Room was fairly spacious, well stocked mini bar , ample luxurious toiletries, very comfortable bed and spotlessly clean. We have already booked a return visit in November.",5,2021,08,12
140,If I could give it 6 stars I would!,"What fantastic experience! 
We stayed at The Langham for my Birthday in July and it was exceptional.
The moment you enter the Grand Lobby you know you are in for a treat.
We were upgraded to an executive room which was unbelievable. 
The room was Huge, seperate shower, bath, every bathroom accessory you could think of. My partner had also organised champagne and home made cake which was delicious.
We ate in the Palm Court restaurant in the evening. Food and service was exceptional. The restaurant is by no means cheap but the size of the portions compared to some A la Carte were very large. 
The Hotel is of course breathtaking but what makes it is the staff! Nothing was too much trouble, from getting your bags to your room to the turn down service.
We treated ourselves to breakfast in bed and it was delicious, silver service and piping hot. 
Cannot wait to return but for longer next time.",5,2021,08,11
140,The People and Place present Perfection,"It is hard to place into words the warmth, welcome and amazing attention to care and detail that every one of the staff provided. Our first stay at this landmark location, will not be our last. The team transformed a weekend away, into a lasting memory. A huge thank you to all the team at The Langham.",5,2021,08,09
140,Simply the best 🎩⭐️🥂,"A return stay albeit many years ago: Stayed for five nights in an executive room on 9th floor. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The room was spacious and included a marble bathroom with separate shower. The standard of cleanliness was outstanding. We used the pool, spa, executive Lounge, Artesian cocktail bar, pressing and dry cleaning services , the in room dining and every experience was spectacular.
The scones were so light and fresh; as if they had just come out of the oven.  The entrees in the lounge were impressive accompanying free flowing tattinger or jasmine tea if that’s your thing.
I have recently had knee surgery and this was my first venture into a pool. It has a perfect temperature and a safety rail all round the pool as well as a hand rail with steps to assist those less able to gain access; really well thought out.
The depth of insight into traveller needs was for our experience beyond anything anywhere … ornate bookmarks left near our bedside and material screen wipes left beside our iPads ⭐️⭐️. The people who work here want to and it shows : thank you Harry for working magic in getting us a table in the Wigmore.  From corridor conversations with cleaning teams , breakfast in bed , taxi hailing, cocktails and club sandwiches it was outstanding.
Booked again see you soon. 
Thank you for my very unexpected candle too Doris.

140,An almost faultless stay!,"My partner and I have just returned here from a 3 night stay. The hotel is absolutely stunning and the rooms very comfortable and beautifully designed. The doormen are an absolute asset to the Langham and we enjoyed many a conversation with them, just lovely people and incredibly helpful. In fact, all the staff are genuinely really friendly.

Breakfast was delectable and a big recommendation for the overnight oats if like me, you prefer a lighter breakfast!

I only have 2 points to make and I only wish to make them to help the Langham potentially improve, definitely not to moan.

We booked for our honeymoon and the front desk staff were generous and upgraded our room, upon arriving at the room we realised it was actually the room we had originally booked. I’m certain it’s probably a mix up from Booking.com and we certainly weren’t about to query a free upgrade but just something for the Langham to maybe keep an eye on, perhaps booking.com aren’t advertising the rooms correctly.

No mirrors in the room were near plugs which made it nearly impossible to style hair, I know it’s a trivial point to make but it was a little annoying. I ended up styling my hair in the mirrored coffee/tea area which isn’t very sanitary but I had no choice. Easily fixable with a mirror on the dresser. Perhaps it was just our room (810).

Overall though we would definitely stay again, as the hotel is so calming and a genuine oasis for hectic London!",4,2021,08,06
140,Fight to stay here,Nothing to fault in this gem of a place service at its finest . staff impeccable everything runs like clockwork in this oasis of calm. Staff remember the names of their guests and smiles are genuine . Cannot recommend highly enough,5,2021,08,05
140,unforgetable,"we stayed for two nights for our 45th wedding anniversary and were treated royaly.  we would like to thank Mattia Lento and Harry England especially for their kindness and thoughfulness when i was feeling unwell.  the location is superb for walking, shopping and sights even Buckingham Palace was walkable but a distance.  We enjoyed a spa treatment, afternoon tea and lunch and all without exception were impeccable.  service second to non as was the quality of food.  all the staff we encountered were helpful and very professional.  the room no 801 will stay with us as special as it was close to the lifts.  the bed was heavenly. we will definitely return.",2,2021,08,01
140,Birthday weekend,If you want the 5 star treatment without feeling uncomfortable this is the place to go. They treat you like a person not your status. Fully amazing! Cutest birthday cake and the perfect extra touches. ,5,2021,08,01
140,R JONES,"What a wonderful hotel, only stayed one night but this location has alot to offer. Well worth paying the extra to experince the Langham Club. The swimming pool and sauna are a must. And finally the eggs Benedict where probably the best i have ever had and will take some beating.... WELL DONE!",5,2021,07,31
140,A perfect visit,"Spent the weekend with the Langham. The room, the pool, all the meals, all the staff - the lot, were perfect. Would recommended the afternoon tea a huge amount and a visit to the pool. Ate in the Palm Court a few times and it again did not disappoint. One to visit.",5,2021,07,27
140,"Lovely hotel, great stay","Absolutely loved our stay at The Langham. Beautiful hotel, well located for Westend. Staff were very accommodating and made sure our stay was everything we wanted it to be. 
The rooms are lovely. We had a deluxe room which was perfect for our stay. 
The spa facilities and swimming pool are great too.",5,2021,07,26
140,Poor Start but ended very well.,"This was our first visit to The Langham, and it was a wedding anniversary stay as a treat for the weekend. Staff on arrival (door and Reception) were lovely, and offered a glass of chilled sparkling wine, which was appreciated as it was very hot.
Allocated a room 616. very disappointed with this room. For the quality of this hotel we expected much more. It was small, quite basic, bare walls, small bathroom with a very poor shower that had very low water pressure. It honestly felt like we had been shoved in the back of the hotel!
However, on speaking to Harry England, Front Office Manager, he was superb, and very accommodating after a polite discussion, and allocated us a different room. Harry even let us view the room choices first. We choose room 443. It was a world away from the first room, and very much more what we were expecting of our stay. The room was superb! We cannot thank Mr England enough. Our stay from this point was wonderful.
Great cocktails in Artesian, breakfast to our room was wonderful.
Palm court service was amazing, food good.
The pool is also wonderful.
What made the stay extra special was the service and way we were treated by all the team at The Langham. Thankyou for a wonderful stay.
",5,2021,07,26
140,Couples staycation,"Absolutely brilliant hotel, the staff and everyone made you feel so welcome. The hotel room is absolutely gorgeous. We normally stop at the Dorchester but the wife want to try the Langham this time, the Langham was just as good as the DorchesterYet half the price. There is loads of shops pubs restaurants nearby what made it even better and will be deafly stopping here again.",5,2021,07,26
140,Great,Lovely stay just weren’t long enough. Staff were very nice and helpful and friendly. The attention we had was wonderful. Did not get around all the hotel as we had other agendas. Breakfast was really good.,5,2021,07,25
140,DISAPPOINTING STAY,"We stayed at the Langham Hotel in London in June to celebrate our anniversary. We telephoned beforehand to make sure the restaurant was open for afternoon tea, the cocktail bar was open etc. We were assured they were operating as normal so we went ahead with the booking. On arrival we were told that the restaurant was closed, no afternoon tea was available and the cocktail bar was closed. Being very disappointed we headed out to do some shopping. Once back at the hotel we thought lets go for a swim but no the pool was fully booked. We did complain that everything we booked the hotel for wasn’t available as they had promised. We ordered a black current and lemonade drink but the Langham Hotel didn’t have any black current. The highlight of the stay was Scotts Restaurant which was great. We were called by the manager on the day we were leaving, we were offered a 15 minute slot in the swimming pool, I guess this was to dip your toe in. We declined and by this time just wanted to go home even skipping breakfast. We were contacted by the hotel and offered a free upgrade if we spend more money to stay which we wont be doing anytime soon. On a positive note the staff were very friendly. All in all the worst experience we have had staying in a London hotel so far. Difficult times I know especially for hospitality but don't promise something you can’t deliver especially for someone’s special occasion.",1,2021,07,25
140,Didn’t want to go home,"Wow! Just back from a wonderful stay at The Langham. First time visiting and definitely won’t be the last! We were lucky enough to book the tower suite for my birthday & were upgraded to a one bedroom suite with a terrace. We ordered room service & ate on the terrace overlooking London. Before dinner we took advantage of the club lounge & enjoyed cocktails, champagne & canapés. Our glasses were never allowed to be empty & I didn’t even see them be topped up as the servers were so smooth - which could be dangerous for some!  We ate breakfast in the palm court & had I think possibly the nicest breakfast I’ve had in a hotel. 

The hotel is absolutely lovely but what really makes it special is the staff -  they were all so friendly & helpful they can’t do enough to help you enjoy your stay. My husband stupidly left a shirt in our room & It arrived at home  is special delivery the next day!

Thank you so much for making my birthday trip so memorable. We will be back soon! 

Book a stay here - you will not be disappointed.",5,2021,07,24
140,Fantastic Customer Service,"Fortunate to stay at this beautiful hotel. 
From our arrival  with the staff to greet us, to leaving, each and every member of staff were helpful and so cheery too.
Rooms were lovely, breakfast superb and all meals in the hotel very good.
Thankyou The Langham for a memorable stay.",5,2021,07,21
140,Hospitality at its finest,From the moment we arrived at The Langham we were treated like royalty. There was nothing that was too much trouble for the staff and they made the stay one of the most enjoyable we’ve ever had. The room was amazing and impeccably kept. We would 100% recommend the hotel to anyone . Thanks for looking after us everyone at The Langham,5,2021,07,18
140,Quite simply the best,"We arrived in The Langham in the afternoon the sun was shining and as was this hotel. We checked in Alex on the front desk couldn’t have been more helpful. As we booked on Amex FHR we got an upgrade to an executive room from a deluxe which was nice. (Note this does not give you club access). We checked into the room very pleasant had a few little maintenance issues like cracks and chips in doors and furniture. However the room was bright large and spacious. The bathroom was laid out in a spit formation shower head wasn’t very good it kept dripping lots of water the wrong way. Housekeeping was out of this world we just pressed the button when we wanted the room made up they went into every detail tidying things away for us just impeccable. We felt housekeeping needed mentioning as we forget the behind the scenes people working hard. This was a proper 5* service. 
Breakfast was good and good variety we had a few hiccups with orders being wrong and things not coming. They quickly remediated the issues. We had dinner in the Palm Court on the last night and it was amazing also the steak was by far the best I’ve eaten. Service was 10/10 and all the staff very  attentive my glass was never empty. 

I did not get to try the spa sadly with Covid things where all pre booked and time slots limited when I return I’ll try the spa.

Overall I’m totally delighted with the stay the Langham is top class we where not made to feel out of place, welcomed with a smile and constantly asking us if we needed anything. 

Thanks Langham for making our mini  honeymoon a joyful one.",5,2021,07,17
140,Amazing stay 5 star all round,"I can’t recommend this hotel highly enough. It has such a fine balance of modern amenities and old charm. 
Nothing was too much trouble for the helpful staff and the extras that come in the rooms from dental kits to bookmarks being left on top of your book whilst a turndown service is happening. 
Pool was lovely and fantastic to have a luxury little pool in the heart of London. 
The food in the restaurant was gorgeous and setting was equally as nice. 
If you are looking at a stay in London and you are deciding which one of the big names hotels to stay in, choose this one!",5,2021,07,17
140,Fantastic Stay and wonderful staff.,"We stayed for a weekend a couple of weeks ago and had a brilliant time.  Greeted by name by the doorman on arrival.  Not sure how he did that!  From arrival to departure it was brilliant stay.

We ended up in the Infinity Suite which was just brilliant.  Huge rooms and lovely amenities in the bathroom.  The chocolate orange slices provided were to die for.

Langham Lounge was outstanding.  Great service from all staff.  Champagne glass never empty.  Didn't manage to sample the food on offer as we were there at the wrong times.  We will rectify that on our next visit in September.  The manager in the lounge (cannot remember his name but he is from Korea or Vietnam - apologies I cannot remember).  He was just helpfulness personified.  Lovely member of staff.

Lovely breakfast in the lounge, best eggs benedicts ever tasted.  Congrats to the chef.

Now our favourite hotel in London.  Going again in September for a birthday visit, but unfortunately we won't be staying in the Infinity Suite.  Will have to manage with an Executive Room this time..........  1st World problems I know.

Thanks to all staff.  Mark and Simon Ruscoe-Romanov",5,2021,07,13
140,Excellent service,"It is worth staying in the club rooms. They provide excellent value and a nice hideaway. This was our sixth time staying and as always the room, service and food was wonderful. The langham is a hidden gem.",5,2021,07,12
140,return to  our favourite hotel,"Another return this time in difficult circumstances with Covid.  All Staff from the doorman at the outset to our departure  where phenomenal. there was a genuine felling of a real welcome. everything about the hotel is 5 star from the decor to the bathroom towels. lovely little touches ,such as fruit and chocolates in the room. Its a beautiful building in an excellent location but its staff are the true stars of this hotel",5,2021,07,07

140,Best hotel in london!,"Iv stayed in a few hotels in London but this is my number 1! We stayed mid week on a visit treating my 80 year old grandmother to a night away. We choose valet parking on arrival which was a breeze. May I say what fantastic staff they have running this! So friendly and welcoming helping my NaN in an out the car, taking our lugguage in we headed to reception again greeted by a very lovely man at the desk who was so warm and friendly. He was so nice an couldn’t do or offer me more. We ended up with a room upgrade! An a breakfast upgrade! He also saw I was pregnant an offered me extra water in the room an pregnancy pillow! I was so impressed! Headed up to the most fabulous room two double beds with a fantastic view! May I say the comfiest bed Iv slept in! We had a lovely note an a small homemade cake for my NaN waiting for us! We ate lunch in the restaurant again second to none service food was exceptional we were treated like royalty. We dined out that night as we had lunch there, again the service for our car was great right out front ready for us! Breakfast in the morning was again a real treat what a selection! It was 6*!! Smooth check out an can’t wait to return. Well done Lagham for top notch service and stay x",5,2021,07,04
140,Favourite London hotel,"My favourite London hotel by a country mile - and have stayed in some good ones!

Excellent location and room was brilliant. But what made the stay was the service which was superb all round - couldn’t pick one person out as everyone we dealt with with was excellent. 

Would certainly recommend and will definitely stay again. ",5,2021,07,03
140,Superb from start to finish.,"Fabulous stay at this beautiful hotel , extremely professional and friendly service from every member of staff.  

The hotel is immaculately maintained throughout 

Particularly enjoyed the club lounge making our stay in London a very sociable experience  meeting lots of new people",5,2021,07,02
140,Not sure this is 5 Star,"I would like to point out that this is my personal opinion.
Living in London all my life i have wanted to try some of the top rated hotels and this july booked the Langham Hotel.
A great hotel but:-
We had a few problems 
We were charged a ridiculous price for water in the Bar having brought 2 drinks 1 whiskey and one gin with mixers.
Also over priced but expected but shocked at the price of the bottle of water. We were not offered tap water which is perfectly safe in London.

Found the staff in the bar and restaurant not very helpful and slow.

Having stayed at the Ritz / Savoy & Dorchester recently 
I was able to compare the servis, quality and decor overall.

I would only give the Langham Hotel 4 Star rating.
Definitely not 5 Stars.

But this is a great hotel and we had a great time.
But will not return it is overated.

The swimming pool is amazing best thing about this Hotel.

140,Wedding Stay,"My Daughter stayed here the night before her Wedding as the reception was being held in the Hotel. We stayed the night of the Wedding and enjoyed the facilities during the day. We had a wonderful lunch and the and the food and drink at the reception were excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful and provided various additional nice touches as well the wonderful set up of the room.

We came for a special occasion and would not hesitate to visit again.",5,2021,06,30
140,Excellent,"From the moment I stepped onto the forecourt on arrival and then departure, the service was immaculate.  I was staying on my own, the quality and consideration of the staff did not let me feel awkward eating in the Palm Court Restaurant or drinking in the Artesian Bar.  The staff were what you would hope for in a quality Hotel. I'm not wealthy, famous, or a celebrity, but I felt special.  I extended my stay by an extra day, as I was very relaxed and felt very safe.",5,2021,06,29
140,Ok - let down by food,"Hotel is beautiful, there’s no doubt.  Room was lovely.  Food is where this hotel is let down.  Water served in the Palm Court was warm.  Same accompaniments to both fish and meat dishes which was disappointing.  Egg at breakfast was barely cooked.  White was very undercooked.  No excuses for these errors or choices. 
I wouldn’t rate it 5 star personally.  I wouldn’t rush back as I think we expect more from a 5 star London hotel experience and there are so many other hotels to choose from.",2,2021,06,29
140,So much attention to detail,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Langham hotel. We stayed in the tower Suite for one night (we wanted more but it was booked up)
On arrival, our children were immediately welcomed by some special gifts in our suite inclusive of a Langham teddy (which is still cherished now-and taken to school to show their friends) an umbrella, backpack and activity books. Our in room dining was second to none along with the service we received throughout our stay. We cannot wait for our next visit ❤️",5,2021,06,27
140,Very Good Service,"As expected, the service provided at The Langham is first class, from the concierge to reception, through to the restaurant staff.

We found The Langham a bit more relaxed and informal (in a good way) than some of London’s other great hotels.  Our room was perhaps not the largest, but it was faultless and the bathroom was spectacular.  Minor noise from the minibar but not enough to disturb sleep.

The bar is excellent and offers a large selection of delicious cocktails.

So why four stars?  The only letdown for us was breakfast.  First the wrong meal was brought out, then when eggs benedict was served the eggs were overcooked and not runny.  We ordered brown toast which we had to remind our waiter had been ordered.  When it arrived it was white, rather than brown bread.  These are minor points in the grand scheme of things but at this price the service should be perfect.",4,2021,06,15
140,Perfection,"The Langham would have to be the best hotel in London.
A true 5 star experience, everything from their staff to the rooms to the spa and dining is absolutely perfect.
I couldn’t have wished for anything more.
Positioned in a wonderful location, I can’t recommend this hotel highly enough and look forward to staying there again in the future.",5,2021,06,11
140,"Stylish hotel in London, lovely rooms! Best prawns ever!","Had three rooms for a birthday celebration! Hotel is beautiful but it doesn’t have a dramatic entrance it’s more subtle! The room was nice not the largest but ok for London, the bathroom though was large with separate walk in shower and bath, lots of toiletries too! housekeeping was very good, always cleaned nice and early and great turn down! Breakfast was tasty but service could be improved such as plates still on the table from fruit and porridge etc whilst trying to put down cooked breakfast! 
Had dinner in the Palm, wasn’t much atmosphere but it was quiet probably due to Covid, room is lovely though! Service was excellent! King prawns were amazing! 
We did have some issues with the rooms on arrival however these were sorted by the manager who offered us access to the club level which was wonderful!",4,2021,06,07
140,Perfect family break,"We booked the Langham last minute for half term as a family of 5, with 3 boys aged 9/7/3.

We were really grateful to be upgraded from a family room to 2 interconnecting rooms, this enabled us to get some much needed sleep. 

The Langham has a real understated charm, and the service is genuine and professional. 

We had a wonderful 3 days, and after the hustle and bustle of central London, the Langham is a real sanctuary to return to at the end of each day.

Unfortunately the swimming pool had no availability throughout our stay, but we were warned of this before we booked.

We hope to have started a family tradition and look forward to many more stays at this very special hotel.",5,2021,06,05
140,Convenient - enjoyed our stay,"The bar was great, room clean and comfortable and the staff accommodating and friendly. We ate in the Palm restaurant which was also good. We had a problem with one of our dishes which they quickly rectified by offering an alternative so no hesitation in recommending.",5,2021,06,03
140,Was so looking forward to staying here after saving up for my partners 30th.,Was so looking forward to staying here after saving up for my partners 30th. All restaurants closed apart from one you have afternoon tea in which had zero atmosphere. I’d expect for the price per room to have at least some biscuits or chocolates waiting for you on arrival.,2,2021,06,02
140,Welcome back to the best hotel ever,"As always the Langham does not disappoint. Lovely to see old faces and new. Afternoon tea at the Palm court, the Spa and pool, the Lounge all open and welcoming. Thank you again for a fabulous week. It is always a complete pleasure. Already planning our return cannot wait",5,2021,05,30
140,Home from home ,"So glad to be back here after many month of lockdown. Despite living only a stones throw from the hotel we chose The Langham as a perfect place for a family staycation. Firstly, the staff are so friendly and genuine. Nothing is too much trouble, and always service with a smile. The rooms are large and pure luxury. We stayed in a junior suite while easily accommodated our family. The room amenities are brilliant, one of the bast mini bars I’ve seen, including bottled negroni. The Club lounge is a real asset. Tremendous staff, delicious complimentary food offering throughout the day, and excellent drinks menu, all included with club rooms and suites. Especially enjoyed the breakfast and afternoon tea selection here, plus the free flowing Champagne. Such a relaxing space, and the staff so attentive to your needs...highly recommend treating yourself to the upgrade. The pool is great for families, though recommend you book in advance due to limited slots during these covid times. My wife had a massage treatment which she describes as one of the best she’s had. From the door staff to housekeeping and club lounge - all the staff here are exemplary. Whether on business or even a local on staycation, highly recommend this hotel. Truly five star. ",5,2021,05,27

140,Return visit after lockdown - was worth the wait !!!,"One of my favourite London hotels, top gym, great cocktail bar, traditional pub bolted on to the hotel but most of all the amazing club lounge well worth a visit
Visited for business and both myself and my client were thoroughly spoilt by the excellent and attentive club lounge staff members",5,2021,05,22
140,An experience to remember,"Delighted to return for afternoon tea but this time my expectations were exceeded, food and service more than excellent, thank you Francisco for guiding me in this magnificent tea pairing experience with each course, all in a very Covid-Safe environment . I recommend it to my friends and will be back for special occasions .",5,2021,05,22
140,Excellent customer service,First hotel stay after lockdown and it was perfect.  Every member of staff we came across was very professional.  Clearly they were delighted to be open again and they made us so welcome.  It was busy but always safe.  Amongst the best service we have had in London.,5,2021,05,21
140,Memorable Stay!,"Stayed here for Susan’s birthday treat just before December lockdown. We had booked an executive room (#602) and though the club area wasn’t open due to the pandemic we were still made to feel very welcome. We arrived early and as our room was ready we checked in. As we were unpacking a bottle of the Langham’s own brand champagne was delivered, a fantastic welcome! The room was spacious, simple and stylishly furnished with as you’d expect top quality fittings. There was a separate hall area with wardrobes, safe etc. The bathroom was well lit and featured top quality toiletries, a lighted mirror and a bath, big fluffy towels and robes. The toilet and shower were in separate cubicles with frosted glass doors. The beverage facilities included a nespresso machine with fresh milk in the mini bar. Comfort was very good, and we slept well. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. For example the slippers were a bit on the small side for us, so the concierge had extra pairs of a bigger size delivered. We opted for breakfast in our room, and it was a great success. The trolley and table it was delivered in had a hot compartment, so my full English was nice and fresh, the top quality ingredients were perfectly cooked, with 2 types of bacon, the streaky was deliciously crispy. Susan loved her salmon & scrambled eggs too. This grand old hotel is not just living on its reputation it still delivers great customer service, comfort and quality dining. ",5,2021,01,15
140,Loved it!!,It was an amazing stay!! Had a great time with my husband. We went to London for our baby moon. Really liked how they managed the hotel during the pandemic. The food was ok. I would have given 5 stars if the food was excellent. ,4,2021,01,02
140,Wonderful stay,"We loved staying here. In times of Covid it is important to feel properly protected and here you do. Everything is so completely sanitised and  everyone keeps great care to keep their distance.  Service is second to none. Stefano was wonderful.Our room was very comfortable, the beds are fabulous and everything just spotless. How good poached are is always telling and here they are right on as are the kippers and the eggs Benedict. We were here for a wedding and were nervous about being in London but honestly could not have had a more relaxed stay. We took advantage of in room dining which worked perfectly",5,2020,12,31
140,For Christmas shopping,"Stunningly beautiful 
Lovely Christmas touches
Excellent service 
Fabulous staff
COVID secure
Central location 
Good food
Home from home rooms with a good room service menu options to eat in room or palm court

140,"Luxury break in ""home away from home""","We just returned from our “post -second -lockdown – UK break”. 

COVID has changed everyone’s travel habits – including ours.

Looking online it was difficult to choose as usually we spend time abroad, so we are not very familiar with London hotels. 
We did the same just pre – second -lockdown in September (see my other review about Hilton) as we were so desperate to travel. Especially Safely travel! 

After some discussion and a telephone call we have chosen to stay in The Langton London. I can say now - It was a very good choice!

On arrival we were greeted by the friendly Portier. He took care of our bags; car and we were accompanied to reception for check in.  

Beautifully decorated Christmas trees, burning fireplace created a luxury, but cozy homely feeling.

Despite we have arrived few hours earlier before our check in time, our room was ready. Hotel contacted us few days before to check our estimated arrival time, though. 

Check in was literally few minutes, we been given some short instructions and some printed information about government changes on COVID. 
We were given 2 boxes of “safety equipment” – see photo – nicely wrapped mask, gloves and hand sanitizer. 
Bottles of sanitizers were located conveniently near every possible contact with surface – near lift/doors/toilets/entrance and etc. 
Needles to say hotel was sparkling clean.

Our little boy was allowed to pick a present from under the Christmas Tree! 
So thoughtful! 
Attention to the details; Smiling and welcoming Staff (with appropriate social distancing) made our stay very welcomed and pleasant.

Our room was spacious and sparkling clean. Good size bathroom and separate walk in shower. Nice Chuan toiletries and usual standard amenities – toothbrush, shaving pack, nail file, sewing kit and etc.

All items, which could have been used by previous guests – like a hair dryer, has been disinfected, put in the bag and secured with pink ribbon – you know no one touched them after cleaning. 
All surfaces had cards on advising that surfaces had been cleaned and disinfected 24 hours before.

We found a hand written personalized welcoming card with a bucket of Champagne and a box of biscuits on the table. Which was really sweet.

There were Nespresso machine in the room, bottle of milk and kettle for tea. There were 4 bottles of still water provided every day.
Only if being picky (!)– one small criticism we had - usually in the hotels like this tea in the room are some special brand, or at least leaf tea bags, but not ordinary twinnings tea.

We are odd guests and I need to apologize housekeeping as my husband is a little bit OCD about cleaning and has slight micro-phobia. 
He always disinfects surfaces himself on arrival and never allows anyone to do cleaning whilst we are in, so our room almost always has Do Not Disturb Sign ON. 
However, housekeeping was leaving cards about their attempted visits and on the afternoons they were arranging convenient time for us to visit for a change of towels, clear bins and restock our minibar and toiletries.

We have booked to stay in an executive room with a Club lounge access. 
Due to COVID guidance the Club lounge was closed, but we were provided with a credit, which we were allowed to spend in the restaurant/in room dining without any restrictions on time or day. 

We had all our meals in the main restaurant Palm Court. I can’t prize staff or kitchen enough. 
Service was great – first few days we were looked after by Nina and then following few days by Stefano – they both been great, remembered our preferences and were prompt and very accommodating. 

Food was great, simply delicious and an extremely good quality. 
Furthermore beautifully presented. 
Festive menu was overseen by Michael Roux Jr. and created by Executive Pastry Chef Andrew Gravett. 
It’s definitely worth a visit just for lunch/dinner if you are in London. 

The Langham, what is not very common in London, has a huge pool and SPA. 
Following COVID restrictions we have arranged early morning visit to the pool – 45min session early morning, it was limited for only session during the stay due to COVID, but we really enjoyed beautiful pool and fun splashing family time.

Check out was smooth without any major issues or delays. 
We would definitely be back again!",5,2020,12,12
140,Wedding at the Langam,We were to get married in London and as our previous stay was so enjoyable we decided to have our wedding breakfast and stay there again. It was stressful as we had a lockdown during preparations but they made it happen. Everything went to plan and I wouldn’t have changed a thing. The service was exemplary. Right from the moment you enter till you leave nothing is too much for them. The food was outstanding and my guests have said that hands down this is the best wedding they have been to. Can’t thank them enough for making my special day to memorable. (Dr Mrs Joshi-Lees) ,5,2020,12,12
140,Sublime,"From the moment we checked in until departure everything was perfect.
Efficient, polite staff were always on hand, and everything was of the highest standard.

We were upgraded to an executive room which was magnificent. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom large and well equipped with upmarket toiletries, 
We had a complimentary breakfast in the Palm Court on arrival which was unexpected but for which we were very grateful and had coffee there in a couple of occasions. 

The hotel is well positioned, opposite the BBC, and has a taxi rank outside. It is easy walking to Oxford Street.

Will definitely return and this was the best hotel stay we have ever had in London.",5,2020,12,10
140,belated Birthday visit,"Another great experience at this fine hotel. From arrival to departure we were made to feel special 
All staff took the time to welcome us and provide a 5 star service. We enjoyed the spa facilities, in room dining, afternoon tea etc. We had a great time and will be re visiting very soon.",5,2020,12,09
140,Wow!,"Everything about this hotel is 5 star my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here.  

Due to COVID it was quieter than usual with the hotel taking all the required safeguards to ensure both staff and guest were as safe as possible.

The room we had was fabulous with a great view of the London skyline, it was a pity that the Club was closed however the extras given which include the in room credit were great and allowed us to spend a couple of evenings in the equally fabulous Wigmore.  Staff and food here were great, my wife particularly enjoyed to cocktails!

We have stayed in a number of hotels in London over the years as love the city and always visit for my birthday each year.  The Langham showed how it should be done so will certainly be returning next year when hopefully the world will be a more normal place. ",5,2020,12,08
140,Birthday Treat,"My husband and I stayed just after lockdown was lifted for my birthday and had a wonderful stay at The Langham. All Tier 2 precautions were in place and the rooms were spotless which social distancing and masks wearing adhered to in all public areas. The Christmas decorations are beautiful and there is always someone on hand in the lobby to help with advice or just to have a few minutes of conversation. 

We were upgraded and the hotel sent up a beautiful fruit bowl and bottle of champagne as a birthday present. I really appreciated the handwritten note from Raquel welcoming us both to the hotel and offering birthday wishes. The hotel had even arranged to have rose petals strewn on the bed when we returned from dinner which was a lovely touch.

The team here really make the experience a fabulous one - the attention to detail and friendly service go to make this a very special place to stay and we look forward to returning.",5,2020,12,06
140,Cocooned in this wonderful hotel.,"My husband and I stayed at the Langham hotel in October and November to attend some necessary medical appointments.  It was complicated and daunting to say the least travelling and staying in London during  various stages of lockdown.  The Langham had taken every possible precaution over Covid had been made in an elegant and understated way - even sanitising our luggage. The front of house and reception staff are impeccably professional however kind and empathic too.  The lovely, welcoming front office manager Susann Greenberg ensures nothing is too much trouble and must be proud of her team 
 The rooms are elegant, spacious, spotless and superbly appointed.  Room service breakfast was faultless. 
Most importantly we felt safe, cocooned and cared for at a difficult time. Thank you ",5,2020,11,21
140,fabulous hotel - will return soon,for the duration of out stay the staff were faultless - the room lovely - very clean and spacious.  We had cocktails in the lounge - these were very tasty. Breakfast in the restaurant was nice - a large choice on the menu and a very attentive staff. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2020,11,11
140,Thieves,"The hotel took many transactions out of my account without authorisation and are proving difficult to refund the excess. The reception staff all said different things and lied to keep me happy then took extra charges from my account. One receptionist, Matteo, even left my luggage (suitcase and a cake) with another guest who I saw leaning over it whilst I waited in my taxi. I had to rush back and get them myself because he would rather attend to another guest than send for help with my luggage. Disappointed in my staycation, the only thing I enjoyed was the swimming pool. Won’t be going again.",2,2020,11,09
140,A memorable stay with great service,A big thank you to the team at The Langham for making our stay memorable.Very friendly and professional staff. I would recommend this hotel to any guest who values quality and excellent service. We look forward to staying again.,5,2020,11,05
140,"The most wonderful, relaxed stay at Langham - thank you!!","Where do we start!!!
Arrived at Langham having parked at Walthamstow Central TFL car park (£7 for every 24 hours!). We got a taxi to the hotel which took us an hour but it’s better to get the tube which is a 20 min direct tube to Oxford Circus. Then the hotel is 5 min walk from there. Location wise the hotel is spot on!

The check in was smooth with really friendly doormen and reception staff! As I needed to work, the speedy internet and in-room desk was the perfect set up I needed. My husband had pre-booked to use the pool so was able to use it for 40 mins all to himself - he felt safe and really relaxed after his swim! He also booked for the following morning too - would recommend booking it before your arrival.

We dined at Wigmore pub for a quick bite before our main dinner at Novikov - the Wigmore had nice relaxed atmosphere with a true pub feel and friendly staff.

We had a drink & desserts at the lounge area downstairs which was stunning - staff again to hand for anything and it was really relaxed. 

We had a Superior room with courtyard view (view wasn’t anything to look at so if you prefer a better view then you’ll need to request). 
The beds themselves were superrrrr comfortable! As parents we wanted to have a relaxing stay before the lockdown came into place, so we had a great lie in as the check out wasn’t until 12pm! We ordered an a la Carter breakfast to our room & we felt like royalty - it came at the exact time requested and really delicious! 

The bathroom itself was small but perfect and very clean. Being pregnant, I enjoyed a warm bath that night and it was very lovely too. All the essentials you would need were in the bathroom too.

We cannot wait to come back here again & would love to bring the kids and stay in the family room. 

Thank you to all the team for a great stay! See you on the other side of the lockdown :)

Mr Singh and Mrs Kaur ",5,2020,11,05
140,Another Wonderful Trip at this amazing Hotel,"What a wonderful hotel with staff who are truly amazing. We want to say a big thank you to Rodrigo at the front desk who went over and above from the moment we called the hotel regarding our booking. We had planned on staying at this magnificent hotel from Monday to Saturday but with the government’s lockdown rules from November the 5th this changed  our plans so we went Sunday to Wednesday.  Rodrigo dealt with all our queries in such a professional and friendly way, nothing was too much trouble. He has five stars from us on customer service and satisfaction; thank you Rodrigo. We had a lovely suite with breakfast in our room every day which was outstanding. We could use the pool this time with a booked  slot for just myself and my husband absolutely wonderful. A big thank you to Nicolas in the spa who organised this so efficiently.  We obviously had to cut short our stay but the three days we had here were just fabulous. This is the second time we have stayed here and we cannot wait to return. When the lockdown is finished we will definitely be back as we still haven’t spent time in the Artesian and The Landau.  The cleanliness, Covid awareness, staff, Palm Court, rooms truly beautiful. Thank you team, keep safe you are doing such a fantastic job. See you again soon xxxxx",5,2020,11,04
140,Birthday weekend,"A special thank you to Ian the doorman and Nicholas the spa attendant who were so lovely to my sister and I on my birthday weekend. They made us feel so special and are a big asset to the company. 

Beautiful hotel, great location and kind staff.

Only confusion was whether breakfast items were charged separately or continental menu was inclusive of the £30pp, I don’t think it’s clear on the menu and I think the waitress misunderstood my question. Had we have known it was all inclusive, we’d have had more variety from the menu for breakfast.

Still a hotel I’d revisit and also recommend to friends and family!",5,2020,11,03
140,Tops The Ritz by a country mile!,"Arrived 29.10.20 to Celebrate our 10th anniversary and a rebooked 50th birthday which was cancelled in April due to the coronavirus. Upon arrival at the hotel  we were greeted by the most welcoming Doorman and very efficient Reception staff - thank you Frederika and Rodrigo! The hotel pulled out the stops to make our stay extremely memorable and we will be back in a heartbeat, when life and finances allow. Despite the coronavirus there was still a kettle, mini bar and a Nespresso machine in the room. We stayed in The Ritz the night prior and our room had none of these facilities yet it was a much pricier! Ignore the hype of The Ritz and head to The Langham for a much more relaxed stay and it has a swimming pool too!",5,2020,11,03
140,Amazing hotel,"From the minute you arrive the concierge guys are just totally outstanding   
check in is amazing the guys are just fantastic
the whole experience from start to finish is above and beyond what you expect. ",5,2020,10,31
140,Best Hotel In London-Made Us Feel At Home,"My sister and I haven’t been able to get away on holiday this year due to COVID so decided to have a little mini break in London
From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome. Firstly by the fabulous doorman who took our bags for us and secondly and most importantly by Rodrigo on reception. He advised us of all the facilities and amenities the hotel had to offer and showed us around. He even called the spa to let us know we would be a little late (lots of traffic). 
We had a booked session in the spa which was nice and relaxing as we had it to ourself due to COVID restrictions. 
Later that evening we got dressed for dinner and we were welcomed but a wonderful man named Ian who was the doorman for the night. He showed us the best locations for lighting snd decor and helped us take some special photos of the evening. He went out of his way to help us and was so kind. 
The next morning we had a fantastic breakfast in the Palm Court restaurant which was delicious 
We checked out at 12pm and the hotel looked after our bags for us. A gentleman named Rashid helped us store our bags and was very helpful. Once shopping had finished we returned at 6pm awaiting a dinner reservation we had made at the Palm Court restaurant at 7:30. The lovely Rodrigo on reception even helped us find somewhere that we could get changed and ready.
That evening we had a fabulous dinner in the restaurant and was served by a beautiful lady called Hina who was so friendly and made us feel at home .
We loved the trip so much we have decided to go back regularly as a little treat as we left feeling so relaxed

Thank you to everyone at the Langham for making us feel so special, so welcome and so at home on our first little break since 2019

We can’t wait to return 😀",5,2020,10,30
140,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is very nicely decorated, and finished.
The dining experience was excellent, staff very attentive and pleasant.
Large comfortable bed with lovely linen.
Rooms well designed , decorated , and furnished.
If you are looking for a 5 star hotel,  in the Centre of London, that is affordable, look no further.",5,2020,10,26
140,Family staycation at Langham London,"Simply the best place in London. Exceptional service and consistently exceeds expectation. We had a lovely mini break with our two boys. The inter-connecting rooms worked really well and we also had the luxury of having the swimming pool to ourselves. Staff make this place so special. (And of course, the Afternoon Tea is a must!)",5,2020,10,25
140,Service par excellence!,"We had a short weekend stay at the Langham to celebrate a milestone birthday. Although we have previously dined and attended the Langham before, it was our first stay at the hotel.
We were made to feel very special from the moment we arrived to our departure the following day.
The quality of the service is exemplary, and on par with high end hotels we have visited across the world. Staff were friendly, attentive and always willing to help. Daniel the Concierge, Mattias on reception, Nina in the restaurant and Fadi the Guest Services Director all deserve a mention.
We stayed in an executive room which was clean, elegant and spacious. This included a free standing bath, separate shower and walk in wardrobe.
Although the club lounge was shut due to Covid restrictions, a generous £50 allowance per person was applied to use any of the dining options in the hotel.
We utlilised the swimming pool and spa during the stay and had exclusive use due to Covid restrictions.
Breakfast and the in room dining were of a very good standard.
Would we stay there again? Most definitely!",5,2020,10,23
140,Birthday weekend,"We just stayed for 2nights for my 40th Birthday weekend. Everything was supherb. The staff in reception, Artesian and the Wigmore were full of life and enthusiasm. And the entire hotel was very COVID-secure.",5,2020,10,21
140,Beyond amazing,"Sadly I’ve just checked out of what is by far the best hotel I have stayed inn In London and Europe.

Our room was just beautiful, the colour way and decor was classic and inviting and absolutely spotless! 
The housekeeping team really go above and beyond.

Such a warm welcome by the check inn host, I wish I had taken his name because he was just wonderful. My husband and I really appreciate your kind hospitality. 

If your inn london and need to stay anywhere it should be here!

",5,2020,10,17
140,"Fabulous, even in these strange times","We first stayed in The Langham a year ago to celebrate moving into Mayfair. Unfortunately the reason we were staying here again was to move out of Mayfair. Especially with Covid-19, we wanted a hotel where we would feel safe and we knew that the corridors, public spaces and particularly the rooms were spacious at the Langham. We arrived and checked in..greeted by the wonderful doorman who helped us with our luggage. What a fabulous guy he is! Our room was a corner room on the 4th floor and therefore had three huge windows and was just fantastic. A lovely bottle of champagne was there for us which was a really nice thought. We had booked dinner at the hotel in the Palm Court. A smallish menu but plenty of choice given the circumstances. There was a nice relaxed buzz in the restaurant and it felt very relaxing and nearly normal!...We had a fabulous nights sleep and the bathroom was just heavenly. We had breakfast the following morning which was delicious also and we then had to leave this beautiful hotel to fly to Malta. We pointed out how happy we were to be staying there again and we will make it our home from home hotel to stay in every time we come back to London which will be often as our daughter still lives there. Thank you for a lovely stay in difficult times, at no point did we feel unsafe which is so important.",5,2020,10,15
140,Staycation in London,Had a lovely anniversary stay with husband & our son. Team could not have been more helpful and friendly. Lovely little touches and could not made more of a fuss over our 2 year old son.  Lovely team in the spa and restaurants and welcome teams. We will be back!,5,2020,10,10
140,Safe In The Langham bubble.,"Had an amazing stay, safe & secure. Beautiful room in which we were upgraded for our anniversary with the surprise of a bottle of champagne.
The staff are all stars. The breakfast we had delivered to our room was out of this world, delicious.
Can’t wait to return for our 4th time.",5,2020,10,07
140,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"Having spent our last 2 wedding anniversaries at the Langham Hong Kong and being unable to travel there this year we decided to book the Langham London. Things didn't start well when we were notified a couple of days before arriving that the Club Lounge was closed. HOWEVER, I have to say that the management more than made up for this in other ways.

The staff delivered the usual impeccable Langham service and our Junior Suite was large, very comfortable and furnished to a very high standard. 
Due to Covid not all facilities are fully functioning, eg the pool is opened but must be pre-booked and only for a 40 minute session - however this really isn't the hotel's fault and I guess is a decent compromise in order to try and provide some sort of service.

All in all there are definite compromises in place due to Covid and as a guest it is worth remembering this, but my experience is that the Langham are doing their very best to deliver the best possible experience and we very much appreciated this.",5,2020,10,06
140,Fantastic hotel and the service was impeccable,"We stayed at the hotel on the 3rd October for a birthday celebration. The hotel did everything to make this a special occasion and more so under COVID measures. The professionalism  towards all safety measures during this time was superb and meticulous. The reception team especially Mattis was an absolute credit to the hotel and the high service levels they offer. The stay was faultless and I can not fault the hotel, the location, the service and the friendless and attentive staff. All aspects of this experience was 5 *",5,2020,10,06
140,Traditional grand London hotel in a great location.,"I enjoyed a short stay recently at the Langham in an executive room. The room was ready early when I arrived, which is always a nice surprise. The hotel has made a number of changes due to the current situation with Covid-19. The executive lounge was closed, however the hotel offer a number of other benefits for these guests as an alternative. During my stay only one of the hotels outlets was open- the Palm Court. I had dinner and breakfast in the Palm Court and both were nice experiences. 

The service from restaurant staff and the reception team was excellent. The room was nice and traditionally styled. The view was of the BBC building across the road. The only fault I could find was that the room had no bathtub, which was a bit of a surprise but as I was only there for a short stay wasn't a major issue. The shower had good pressure and was great. The room was next to some sort of storage or housekeeping room on the 4th floor and there was a fair amount of crashing and door slamming during the day, but not after hours. The room felt spacious and would probably be labelled a ""junior suite"" at some other properties. 

Overall an enjoyable stay and I look forward to returning when the hotel and city are back in full swing.",4,2020,10,05
140,Wonderful stay,"I find it hard to fault I’m this hotel which in comparison to other 5 star London hotels holds it own and is good value. Perfectly located for regent st and oxford st shopping and easy to get to. 
I blown away by the service from Jessica on reception who I spoke to the day before my arrival and met every single one of my requests in a professional, caring and genuine manner. This included booking dinner for me, early check in, spa booking, plus lots more. She really made our stay very special. 
The treatment in the spa was exemplary. The therapist really made me feel cared for and looked after. Although on the pricey side for a massage, it was well worth it. 
The artisan was a lovely setting for a cocktail and the food in Palm Court was wonderful. Although there was a mix up at breakfast with the wrong order and cold food, Jessica again was wonderful in sorting that out for us. Well done Jessica! You really made our stay perfect and can’t wait to come back. ",5,2020,10,03
140,100 wonderful nights,"I haven’t posted a review on Trip Advisor for sometime and realised recently when I started again that whilst I had thanked hotels and other venues directly over the recent past I had failed to mention them on Trip Advisor. I want to correct this immediately in connection with our various stays at the Langham in London where my wife and I stayed for approximately 100 nights in 2019 whilst our London home was refurbished. Here is an extract from my email to the Manager in November 2019 on our last stay.

“We are very fortunate to travel a lot and stay at beautiful hotels and to date we had always judged a hotel by the standards of the Four Seasons and Peninsula chains. After our stays with you we have recalibrated our view of what makes a great hotel and we will now use the London Langham as our benchmark and doubt that few, if any, will surpass the service levels we received.

We were made to feel at home from our first day with you when 2 porters and one of your guest service team arrived at our apartment in London on check in day to help move our luggage. It was so thoughtful and we immediately felt comfortable and so it continued during our many stays, including our pillow cases embroidered with our surname and our initialled bath robes, lovely touches which my wife especially loved.

It would be impossible to individually thank all the numerous staff members who make up your team, from the always smiling helpful men, braving the elements to welcome us out of our taxi, to the porters, housekeeping and others who look after your guests and your lovely building. We especially however loved our time in the Club Lounge and want to thank everyone there. We were really spoilt by the Club team. We had breakfast there every day and enjoyed our relaxing start to the day before doing battle with the builders nearby! 

We would like to thank the Guest Services team (and especially Mr Fadi Samhoun) who were always there for us, always helped, always resolved any issue immediately. Indeed many of our reservations were done via them and they ensured that we never had a problem, regardless of the issue. 

We will miss the breakfasts, the smiling faces and the  “welcome home” that your excellent team said to us every stay. We will be back. Why stay anywhere else when we have the best on our doorstep.....

Please thank everyone at the Langham from both of us.”",5,2020,10,03
140,"Lovely hotel, great service, room a bit tired","I am going to reluctantly rate the Langham as average , the service was great , very Covid aware , lovely building, high ceilings and a positive experience with all the staff. The room itself was a little bit tired (421) , carpet needs replacing and furniture a bit worn shall we say, the view was very average too. If you are going to sell yourself as the best which they were on many levels, then you need to get the details right.",3,2020,10,01
140,"A Relaxing, If Imperfect Stay","I've not stayed at The Langham for quite a few years and certainly not since the recent refurbishment, but opted to stay here instead of my usual haunts as the location was prefect. 

I stayed with my wife and we booked a Superior Double Room through Booking.com at a very reasonable £266, although I also added breakfast at £30 a head when I checked in. 

The hotel is famously imposing and one of London's Grand Dame Victorian splendours with an excellent location to Regent Street and Oxford Street. 

The welcome was friendly and Covid measures are very evident with everyone in masks and behind screens. It does make communication that bit more awkward but that's life right now. 

Our room was light and airy, and on the eighth floor, looking into the central core of the building. The view is of the building really but it's high enough to see plenty of sky. 

The room features plenty of features and as you'd expect for this class of hotel. The bathroom is marble with a 'P' shaped bath/shower, the bed was large and comfy and the room very quiet. The last part could be because the hotel is so empty right now, as all London hotels are, but these old Victorian piles are usually well insulated from sound intrusion. 

All good then, well, yes and no. There was a flickering bulb in the bathroom which was driving us nuts and so I asked at reception for it to be fixed when we left for an external dinner reservation. It wasn't fixed when we returned so after a bit of a faff, I pulled the bulb out. 

I was also woken up in the morning from the heavy rainfall outside which was creating a racket on the window sill. It was just water drips, but weirdly the noise of the rain dripping on the window sill was really loud. Not had that before. 

Breakfast was in the Palm Court which is a nice space and because we had the package we had a good choice of à la carte all for £30 ahead. Have to say though, the cooked breakfast was fine but where on planet reality do you get off charging £38 for sausage, bacon and eggs! 

Overall, we had a pleasant stay and as mentioned, this hotel is in a great location which is hard to beat, having said that, there were niggles, and I know there are better and grander in London than this where you don't have to take the light fittings apart!",4,2020,09,28
140,Perfect place to celebrate,"3rd stay here and it never disappoints.
Staying here at a time when COVID-19 precautions are in place was made very simple and easy by all staff implementing current procedures.
From check in to check out our whole experience here to celebrate our anniversary was made very special
Check-in: easy and bookings made for bar, swimming pool and restaurant. Gift box of mask, gloves and hand gel was nice. Staff very informative.
Room: upgraded to a Junior Suite. Lovely big room, huge comfy bed, settee & coffee table,  drinks area with free mini-bar stocked daily and a lovely bathroom too.
Room service: great choice of food and excellent quality too.
Artesian Bar: sublime cocktails and great mixologists.
Palm Court: quieter place to sit and sip drinks or have a meal
Swimming pool: had a 40 minute session just to ourselves. It was great to be in there on your own!
Old world courtesy done in a very modern way makes this hotel very special indeed. 
Can't wait to go back.",5,2020,09,28
140,A Perfect Hotel in the heart of London,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay and can not speak highly enough for the hotel and it’s staff.  We were given a room upgrade and a bottle of champagne for our anniversary treat which was a lovely gesture.
Booking in was very smooth and professional, every thing that was touched is sanitised so felt very safe.
Our junior suit was on the 9th floor and was lovely I can not fault a thing about our room or the service we received.
Breakfast was served in our room on both days and was on time hot and delicious, a perfect start to each day.
We ate in the Wigmore pub which again served lovely food and the staff went above and beyond to look after us.
This has now turned into our favourite London hotel and we will defiantly be returning, the new cooking school looked amazing and well worth attending.
This is a wonderful 5 star hotel, full of charm and wonderful staff, thank you so much to all who looked after us for 2 days we had an amazing break.",5,2020,09,23
140,A mixed bag,"This was my first stay at The Langham and as it came during the current COVID crisis there were some extenuating circumstances. To begin with the positives, the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful - I would say amongst the best I’ve come across. I ate once in the Palm Court restaurant which was proficient - unfortunately the Roux restaurant is still closed (due to reopen in January I believe) and also enjoyed a drink in the Artesian bar. There were a few disappointing things, however:

Room - okay so I had the standard double bedroom which came with a view of the hotel innards. The mattress was uncomfortable.  Actually I can’t say for sure what the mattress was like as it was covered with a ‘topper’ - this gives the feeling you are lying on top of a duvet so you can’t really sense the mattress but it’s usually used where the mattress is not of the best quality. The actual duvet was a winter one which was too hot for me. I set the air con at the lowest (18c) which made little difference, although I was able to open a window which helped. The reason for the heat I think was the towel rail in the bathroom which was burning hot (centrally controlled I believe). The pillows I also found poor. At one point (8.30am?) I called service, but there was no answer (I waited 30s), to see if they had alternative pillows. I didn’t bother following up as I was only staying 3 nights. It can become too much hassle (same reason I didn’t flag the flashing lamp on the desk - surely the housemaid can spot that the bulb needs replacing or something).

Swimming pool - far far too hot although this problem emerged generally in hotels in the last 20yrs as they cater to people who don’t swim but rather use the pool as a giant bath for themselves to sit in. 

Gym - nice but clearly the equipment was not selected by someone who actually works out in a gym. No bin (yes really I checked there should have been one and the lady wasn’t sure where it was) for all the wipes. I got one bottle of water but needed another one but the cabinet with the extra bottles was locked (no staff around at that point).

Most annoying thing was I had a friend popping over for a drink when we went to the Artesian bar we were told it was 10 mins for a table. On our own initiative, we said we would have a drink in Palm Court first. They said fine they will get us in 10 mins. In Palm Court we couldn’t get a cocktail but only wine or G&T. Strikes me as odd and a poor policy (numbers in the Artesian bar being limited due to Covid). Anyway 30 mins later I went to see if the table was free in the Artesian bar (yes it was). Anyway after drinks I wanted to get something to eat. It was 10.30pm and at Palm Court I was told that they were no longer serving food. I asked about room service but I was told it had finished. No solution was offered so off I wandered to find a takeaway. Seriously that is not good enough, Covid or no Covid, for a 5-star restaurant.

Finally on checking out I had to email a screenshot to show I had paid the bill as their system showed I had not (when I checked in it showed I had arrived from Thailand and had a MasterCard -neither is true). No issue with how this was dealt with - the staff member was very professional and did his job very well (not his fault the system is in error) but again this felt like the sort of issue you get with a 3 star hotel.",3,2020,09,21
140,Lovely spot in London,We stayed several nights in January. This hotel (as all the Langham) is exceptional. The attention to detail should be noted. We love the club level room and all of the wonderful staff who work there. The location of the hotel is perfect for walking that part of the city. Will return when we can!,5,2020,09,18
140,Beautiful Hotel,"My wife and I stayed yesterday for 1 night and it was outstanding.  Whilst i understand it’s still relatively quiet the hotel had a great feel about it. We felt extremely safe at all times and everywhere is immaculate clean. The bar was brilliant and almost back to how it was before yet still there was extreme safety measures in place. As always the staff were exemplary and professional however a special mention to Maria on reception who was very courteous. 

London needs people to co e back and I can’t think of anywhere better to stay.",5,2020,09,12
140,Fantastic hotel in a great location ,Stayed at this hotel for our ruby anniversary. Was not the trip we had planned as was originally meant to be on a safari. The hotel went above and beyond to make our stay special. Shame that a lot of the facilities were not open due to the current situation but we still had a really lovely time. I hope people start supporting these London hotels. I would highly recommend this one. We look forward to returning soon ,5,2020,09,09
140,UNIQUE REVIEW FOR A UNIQUE ONE OF ITS KIND 5++ STAR HOTEL,"I have visited London several times for work and I have stayed in almost all of its luxury hotels. My first stay in Langham a few years ago set a new unatched level hospitality excellence. !!! It was one of the best experiences I ever had as a business traveler among many other extravagant high end hotels around the world.
Last March I decided to take a leisure trip to London and relive Langham's opulent ambiance and warm hospitality. Unfortunately due to Covid outburst I had to cancel my visit and contact the reservations dept. for cancellaton procedures etc.
I am morally obligated to give another 5++ star review for the excellent communication and management of the issue by the guest relations representatives. All delegates showed an extremely high level of courtesy, training and flexibility. Thank you all and I look forward to visiting your hotel again.",5,2020,09,09
140,Fantastic Hotel,From start to finish this hotel was beautiful the room was stunning and I couldn't have picked a better hotel . This was a surprise trip and it definitely ticked all the boxes .The view was outstanding I would definitely stay again and it was worth the money without a doubt .,5,2020,09,06
140,This hotel doesn't miss a trick! Pure class all the way!,"This was my first stay at the Langham but it certainly won't be my last. Yes, it is a beautiful, historic property and that is certainly one of its draws, but it is the staff and service here that set the Langham apart from just about any other 5-star property at which I've stayed. I have my favorites but I can honestly say that the people at the Langham were hands down the most welcoming and friendly of any other in this country, on the continent, and in the U.S. A wonderful experience especially considering the state of the world right now!",5,2020,08,29
140,Place for a staycation - treat yourself ,"The staff are attentive, professional and friendly. As always. The standards and processes to keep clients safe at this time are flawless. The rooms are beautiful spacious and feel like a home from home. The internal decor and external architecture are exquisite. A number of the suits have outside terraces which is such a treat. Why go away? when the Langham is here and such a delight. With the whole of London on it’s door step, green spaces, history, shopping. I love the Langham. Thank you again for such a lovely break.",5,2020,08,28
140,5 star hotel with million star service,"My partner and I booked the Langham to make up for the fact we should have been getting married last weekend. From contacting the team over email, to reception, to the guy at the door and the bar staff every single person couldn't be nicer or more helpful. They truly know how to make you feel like a VIP. A big shout out to Sarah and the reception team who made our non wedding day extra special. The rooms are fabulous, the bar area is comfortable and spacious a treat in the middle of London.",5,2020,08,28
140,Well-located hotel,"Pros: Staff are very attentive and friendly. Each customer can get a hygiene pack which includes a pair of gloves, a face mask and a bottle of hand-wash gel. A bottle of champagne as welcome gift has been put in the room. Very thoughtful!  Room service is good, in-room dining experience very nice! The hotel located centrally in London and is perfect for shopping.

Cons: It’s an old 5-star hotel, some of hardware doesn’t work properly, such as the air-conditioner being too noisy, bed lamps flashing irregularly. The room size is relatively small but understandable given its location.",5,2020,08,19
140,Incredible service ,"This hotel really went above and beyond. We checked in last minute, and they showed us a variety of rooms to meet our needs. 

We wound up choosing a suite on the 9th floor, which was beautiful. It had views of London, a separate sitting area, an amazing bathtub and an incredibly comfortable bed.

Ian, at the front, was so helpful with everything we needed. 

We were even given a dog bed and a dog bowl for our small service animal who we were traveling with.

The service was exceptional across the board. 

The location is also ideal. It is less than a mile from Hyde Park, St. James Park and Regent Park, as well as many other attractions.

Oxford street (known for shopping) is a block or two away. 

I would definitely stay at this hotel again!

Ps. Their cheeseburger that they offer via room service is next level delicious. The Langham has some of the best room service food I’ve ever found at this property and their property in NY too. ",5,2020,08,12
140,Great staff & service,"Here last weekend & it was great ‐ ambience, service and staff. Very covid aware & everything clean. The location is spot on for the West End & Fitzrovia.We will go again, hopefully before the end of the summer.",5,2020,08,07
140,Absolutely fabulous,Stayed here recently and the whole experience was amazing. The hotel is beautiful and the staff exemplary. Because of covid we were issued with complimentary masks and gloves together with hand sanitiser. Everywhere was spotless. We dined in the room and the food was exceptional and breakfast the following morning was the best I'd had. This is the best hotel in London in my opinion.,5,2020,07,22
140,"Great break, very Covid aware","Decided to travel into London for the weekend and have lunch and dinner. London was very quiet but it was lovely.
The Langham team were fantastic. The room was lovely and clean. Breakfast served in the bedroom as the restaurant is closed. There is an honesty bar in the Palm Court which was nice.
From a Covid perspective we felt very safe. All employees wore face masks and were professional. There were Perspex screens in reception. All guests received a PPE kit with mask and pocket sanitizer bottle. Sanitizer stations throughout the hotel and additional face masks.

Will definitely return... even in this Covid environment.",5,2020,07,20
140,Great first experience after Covid,Our first hotel experience after lockdown and we are delighted that the Langham have everything sorted.  Plenty of hand sanitizer.  A well briefed team and still a great level of service.  Breakfast had to be taken in the room but we discovered we really enjoy this.  Thanks to the team for making this such a great stay.,5,2020,07,19
140,A class act as always,"We have just returned from a short stay at our favourite London hotel and are keen to let everyone know that the Langham Hotel continues to offer fantastic customer service and are raring to go! We did wonder what we might expect post lockdown, but we needn't have worried. Those staff who have returned to work are as professional and welcoming as ever with processes in place, right from arriving at the hotel, to ensure that health and safety is never compromised. Of course there are changes - the spa is shut and only the Wigmore is open for food and drink. However, the Palm Court is open with a small honesty bar and complimentary snacks and hot drinks plus there are always fabulously helpful staff around who are delighted to go the extra mile and do whatever they can to ensure you have an amazing stay. Breakfast is served in room right now though we did speak to the lovely Karina who arranged for us to select from room service yet eat with our small party in the Palm Court. Bedrooms and bathrooms are super clean, there's hand sanitiser throughout the hotel and check in staff could not have made our arrival any more welcoming despite mask wearing and necessary hygiene processes. This hotel, along with the UK's hospitality trade, need customers. Their staff have been trained and the very best of the staff are already back on duty and ready to ensure that you have a fantastic time. Please put the Langham at the top of your list for a visit - I am sure you won't regret it.",5,2020,07,15
140,The historic Langham,"Very good stay, the hotel location is perfect, bit far away from Regent Street, Oxford Street and Bond Street. The hotel is very historic, the executive rooms are recommended, breakfast is very delicious, very lovely lounge. The decor is a bit old, spooky even. Don’t get me wrong, I personally like those historic hotels. The rooms could be a bit small. The bathroom in my opinion is too big for small rooms. Just don’t like having so many mirrors in the rooms. Gives us chills",5,2020,05,10
140,Comfy,"First class service the staff were amazing and I was treated like Royalty 
Would definitely stay here again as it was comfy clean and quiet  staff couldn’t do enough to help even giving me advice on what to see 
👍🏿",5,2020,05,06
140,The historic Langham,"After choosing and choosing, I finally booked the trip to London in Langham. At Portland Place, next to the BBC, not far from the Queen's house, a few minute walk from Oxford Underground Station. Although the hotel is very historic, which I believe is one of the oldest hotels in London, all facilities and butler service are quite in place, and the details are very good. Breakfast and afternoon tea are very well known, not that many items to choose from, but the quality is quite good. Bathroom is way too big for small rooms. And so many mirrors in the room. It’d be even better if I could get a room with a better view. Some places in the hotel seem a bit spooky. Didn’t know it’s haunted until recently.",4,2020,04,11
140,First Class,"The Langham London is a must stay.My wife and I had an absolutely wonderful time for the two days we were there. The entire staff are very helpful and friendly not always the case in big cities.Location is very central with multiple restaurants and bars in close proximity.The afternoon tea is an absolute must, a little piano playing in the background really sets the tone.",5,2020,03,18
140,Home Away from Home,"Best service in a gorgeous hotel, the staff treated us like family and we did not want to leave!!  Love the location, the ambiance of the hotel is delightful and the world seems to be at your doorstep....delightful!",5,2020,03,18
140,Great location,Excellent location for seeing a show at the palladium - lovely lady on reception - comfortable room with tea complimentary water - spa very nice swim steam sauna - breakfast nice room but we did have building work going on - knives too blunt to cut sausage - staff should not say included in room rate as it was not included in mine hot food not hot,4,2020,03,17
140,Surprise 65th birthday,"From the moment we arrived to our departure we were met with the most helpful of staff, excellent room and facilities and fantastic selection of cocktails! And all of it a surprise to me. The decor and standard of cleanliness throughout was very good and would strongly recommend. Bit on the pricey side though",5,2020,03,15
140,Superb,"My daughter and I arrived at The Langham intending to stay one night but ended up staying an extra night because we enjoyed this hotel so much. Our “family” room was spacious and comfortable. I also liked their fitness center and the spacious lobby area. We very much enjoyed the hotel breakfast, as well as the afternoon tea. People were so nice and hospitable. When we first arrived at the hotel entrance, Ian welcomed us with a big smile and looked after us throughout our stay. Jairo took great care of us at breakfast, and Magdalena served us afternoon tea with graciousness and kindness. The Langham is a great hotel with wonderful service and hospitality.",5,2020,03,12
140,Excellent as ever,"Had a fantastic three days. Staff are exemplary from door staff,reception, room maids,restaurant staff to the baggage and door staff on our departure. Room was faultless location perfect. What more can I stay. Favourite hotel in London.",5,2020,03,11
140,Probably the finest Hotel in London,"The Langham Hotel defines, elegance, sophistication, outstanding customer service and truly world class gourmet food. Location is superb opposite the BBC and strategically located at the edge of the west end and Mayfair.",5,2020,03,11
140,Simply Superb Staycation,"Decided to stay in London for my boyfriend's birthday and chose this wonderful hotel. Although I had never stayed here before I had heard from many friends and colleagues that The Langham was the best hotel to stay in London for luxury, comfort and the highest standard of service. I wasn't disappointed. Checking-in was quick, friendly and super efficient, we were given a room on the 5th Floor. Room was large, bright, spacious and incredibly comfortable with every amenity you could ever need. Booking an Executive Room gave us access to the executive lounge ""The Langham Club Lounge"" on the 3rd floor, where you can relax, eat and drink, work, all in tranquil surroundings where we were looked after by the most amazing hospitality team, who made us feel so welcome and valued. For my boyfriend's birthday they even presented him with a cake...we were both surprised and delighted. Thank you so much for making a couple of days in London one of the most fabulous hotel experiences we've had. Management are doing a wonderful job employing and training such excellent team members.",5,2020,03,10
140,A Superb Grand Dame Of A Hotel,"This Hotel sits at the top of Portland Place opposite the BBC Broadcasting House and about equal distant from Regents Park and Oxford Circus.  The doorman are efficient and knowledgeable and well worth some time to talk too.  The hotel itself is discreet understated elegance as opposed to the in your face Savoy, which we prefer.  The rooms (we stayed in 428) were large enough and had everything you could need.  Try the hot chocolate from the room service - it is excellent.  

We will return.  Superb.",5,2020,03,09
140,Langham London weekend,"A great experience @Langham hotel in February 2020. This hotel provides exceptional service and rooms and very helpful and kind staff. The Langham provided us with a nice Deluxe room, which have an ambience of complete comfort and warmth. It was one of the few hotel rooms that I can feel comfortable to sit casually and read a book whilst the storms passed over London.",5,2020,03,08
140,Great place to be in London for businesss and leisure,I really enjoyed my time at the Langham. Great service and location. The hotel has a grandeur atmosphere. Do not forget to try the Artesian as it is always one of the top options in the city. Customer service is top notch.,5,2020,03,08
140,great stay at the langham,"I kid you not, this is my favourite hotel in London. Service is truly 5-star. The rooms are comfortable and furnished with everything required. Reaction times for anything we required brought up to the room were fairly quick. Definitely a place to go back. I’ve never eaten there, I’ve heard some good and bad things about the restaurants on site.",5,2020,03,08
140,Three nights at Langham,The Langham is for me one of the best hotels in London. A perfect location for those who need to move quickly around the city center and for traveling to the main airports. The personnel is very kind and professional and the room I've took (183) is perfect. Moreover the quality of the dining room and breakfast is of high level as for the restaurants in the hotel (Roux at the Landau and Aremisia). Langham is a must if you travel to London.,5,2020,03,07
140,The nicest most complete hotel in London,"The Langham is the perfect hotel. It has an inside pool great gym, excellent 3d floor for the Langham executive club serving the best breakfast by the sweetest staff.
Stayed 3 weeks September 2019 and during February. I will return for a third time. Superb location, staff 10/10, complete ♥️♥️♥️♥️",5,2020,03,01
140,Overnight stay,"This hotel is amazing, staff very friendly and helpful.  We had a superior room with a great view.  This is expensive accommodation but definitely worth a visit once in your life. Very close to amenities and lots of great shops. Would recommend.",5,2020,03,01
140,One night in the city,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome and special.
Our car was whisked away, our luggage taken and a warm welcome at reception. Our room was a lovely corner room overlooking the BBC studios, quiet and very very comfortable. A large room with a 7 foot bed, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. no fault at all with the room and amenities 

Lunch in the bar area was informal but special and then off to dinner at La Gavroche with Michel Roux

Breakfast was equally wonderful with fantastic service 

We were a little sad that we had only booked one night, guess we will have to come back again very soon 

Highly recommended",5,2020,02,26
140,Fantastic for lunch and breakfast,Highly recommend. Lunch menu is simple to choose but the tastes !! oh the tastes !! Love it here. Great venue near to the hustle and bustle of Oxford st. Not outrageous on the price front and you can try some really special dishes. Recommend the lunch set menu. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. And definitely not a tourist trap.,5,2020,02,21
140,Shopping and trrat,"If you are looking for a convenient spot for Oxford Street and a hotel that offers luxury and fantastic service then look no further. This hotel is one of my favourites in London. 
This is the first time I’ve stayed here solo. I don’t like eating alone the restaurant so I ordered room service- I wasn’t disappointed. Quick efficient service and great quality food. I will return here without a doubt. ",5,2020,02,21
140,5 star and more ,"Our first time at the Langham and it was great from start to finish, the service from the moment we arrived at the door was excellent and faultless, booking in was quick and easy then showed to our room by Skye who was an excellent host, on returning after a shopping trip a hand written note along with a cake and teddy for my daughter had been placed in the room which she loved, the room was of a great size and the beds very comfy, breakfast in the restaurants again excellent. We look forward to staying here again.",5,2020,02,20
140,"The Langham, London...what a place!","We have visited many times over the years and each visit just gets better and better. We had a club room which gives access to the luxurious Langham Club Lounge. Truly exceptional - open from breakfast until 10pm - complimentary food and drinks all day - including my favourite...Champagne! :)  

The best part are the staff - absolutely faultless. Cristina is truly amazing. We were looked after by everyone! Cristina, Philip, Larissa, Zaneta - I'm sorry if I've missed anyone but you are all fantastic. Each time we are made to feel special and a part of The Langham ""Family"".

Thank you as always, we'll be back. SOON.

I cannot recommend this enough. Please visit. You'll be bowled over.",5,2020,02,18
140,Our amazing stay at the Langham,"Wow is all I can say to sum it up. All staff were amazing we loved the quality and attentiveness. The hotel is so beautiful and we could not fault a thing. We love Bart and Daniel they were wonderful and funny. We will be back, it's also great for kids and families to. ",5,2020,02,17

Fantastic Hotel
Fantastic staff 
Fantastic rooms
It also has an amazing breakfast  and the best afternoon tea in London.",5,2020,02,17
140,A great stay,"We stayed at The Langham for the first time this weekend. We normally stay in smaller boutique style hotels, as we like the personal service. However, I was so impressed by the level of service that we received I felt I needed to write this review. 
We were checked in and out by Raquel Giner Aunon. Incredibly helpful and welcoming, and went over and above to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible- a credit to this wonderful hotel. 
Also I’d like to mention the bell boys and porters. Again, so helpful, with some humour thrown in, to make our stay even more enjoyable.
Housekeeping. Excellent. Rooms were spotless and the girls always so lovely and polite. 
The spa. super friendly and helpful. The pool is very small, so if it’s busy don’t expect to swim!!! Also the changing rooms rather small. I liked the idea of having flip flops or slippers and a robe in the lockers, with a few useful items too! The treatments I had were also very good, again the girls were both lovely!
The restaurants were the only slight disappointment. We didn’t get good service in either unfortunately. It was very busy, and I expect the staff were stretched. But, the staff were bordering on unfriendly and the service for our meal on the Saturday evening was incredibly slow. This could definitely be improved on! 
Again breakfast at Roux wasn’t great. Slow service and a bit chaotic. The food was ok, but I’ve had much better in other London hotels. 
But apart from our restaurant experience, the hotel was really very good. It’s a beautiful old building and feels very British. The beds are super comfy, the rooms and bathrooms spacious. But most of all the staff at the hotel make it that bit more special. 
If you are looking for a larger hotel with spa facilities, in a great location. I can definitely recommend The Langham.",5,2020,02,17
140,Birthday afternoon tea ,"We visited for afternoon tea for my birthday during the Christmas season and the Afternoon Tea was excellent. The Christmas decorations made the room and foyer feel glamorous and festive. The service was exemplary, we didn’t have to ask for anything as refills were bought regularly , lovely piano music playing, enough staff, all of whom were polite and efficient. Excellent food - we are far too much. 
Would recommend ",5,2020,02,16
140,Luxurious Langham,"Returned for another visit to this wonderful hotel.

Ideally located just off Oxford Street but away from hustle and bustle. 10 minutes walk from tube and there are always plenty taxis waiting outside or concierge can organise for you.

From the moment you walk up to the door you are made to feel special. Luggage Porters and Doormen are at hand and lead you to Reception.

Reception staff are warm and welcoming.

Rooms are exquisitely appointed, spotless and luxurious.

Service and facilities are first class. Can't wait to return again for more pampering",5,2020,02,16
140,Gets my valentine's vote ,"Swept off by the husband to a valentine's night if posh hotel and champagne tasting dinner. Spent the night at the Langham really for convenient situation rather than as a destination hotel. But actually it's really really lovely. Just THE most friendly and welcoming staff, could not do enough for you, great atmosphere makes you feel like it's a home from home, and excellent quality fixtures and fittings in the room. Lots of nice touches. Will be back next time deliberately heading for it rather than as an afterthought.  Highly recommended. ",5,2020,02,15
140,Upgrade disappointment ,"We arrived at the Langham today early and were offered an immediate availability on an upgraded executive room.(payable) we decided to stick with our booked room
Having got into the room and discovered that there were absolutely no facilities to eat a room service meal, we decided to opt for the upgrade  left the hotel and returned 4 hours later to occupy new executive room. 
This room in which I am currently sitting is not worthy of the title “executive” it is room 611 and would be better situated in a Travel Lodge than a 5 star London Hotel. We have stayed at The Langham many times before and usually love it. It is always our hotel of choice in London. 

At over £700/ night this is poor , as is the lack of information at check in about what is available to the executive room as additional benefits . A rushed quick over view from the receptionist, but nothing available in print. 
We have 2 nights here, for a special weekend and at the moment we may leave tomorrow after one night. ",1,2020,02,14
140,Amazing service,"My wife and I had a very enjoyable pre Christmas stay at the hotel. Everything was perfect especially the breakfast. However I did not leave a review until now. I few weeks ago we realised my wife may have left her dress in the room when we left as couldn’t find it. So, almost 3 months later, she rang the hotel who tracked it down. Sent a picture and it was duly identified/found. I collected it today with the reference number supplied and it is all packaged up in Langham bags and beautifully folded. A true sign of a quality hotel and the amazing service provided. Can’t recommend highly enough. Big thank you to the house keeping staff.",5,2020,02,11
140,A real 5 stars hotel!,"Beautiful installations/rooms, incredible service from everyone, great food and drinks, attention to detail; an amazing experience! Thank you all for everything! You made me feel like home! I had such a blast! ",5,2020,02,09
140,Wonderful 6 days.,As I have to use a walking frame the doormen were most helpful and careful when I enter the doors and use the stairs making it easy to go up and down the few steps with confidence as I prefer the little bit of exercise to the small lift.  The front desk and Concierge were most helpful and the Club Lounge service and food were excellent.,5,2020,02,09
140,Absolute Perfection,"This hotel was fabulous. The gym is fantastic. The attention to detail is fantastic in the room. The bed was super comfortable. The concierge recommended great restaurants, including a cute little Italian tapas restaurant that I ate at before going to Book of Mormon. The food at the hotel restaurant was quite nice too. I loved the cocktail bar.",5,2020,02,09
140,"Perfect hotel -- elegant, good location, quiet, great service, and delicious breakfast!","I loved my stay here. It would be hard to beat the Langham for a stay in London. The room was lovely, spacious, and comfortable. The service was impeccable in the room. The buffet breakfast was delicious -- I had the option of the a la carte breakfast but never chose it because the buffet was perfect and fast. Staff was always gracious and attentive. When I think back on my week in London I think very fondly of this hotel!",5,2020,02,09
140,Average,"Stayed at The Langham for one night to celebrate an anniversary. The staff were all excellent, the room was nice and the location is fantastic for exploring the city. 

However, we were really disappointed that the sauna / steamroom was out of action whilst we stayed and no one let us know, at time of booking or when we checked in. No compensation was offered despite the spa being a big part of why we booked this hotel. The pool area was open and was really nice, but the lack of communication about the spa being shut was not what you would expect from a 5* hotel.",3,2020,02,08
140,35th Anniversary,"We decided to stay at The Langham Hotel in Portland Place to celebrate our 35th Wedding anniversary. The Hotel is stunning inside and out and the service was exceptional. Our room was very nice, with a large bathroom and we were greeted with a Muffin and oranges in our room, compliments from The Langham.
We had a great stay and breakfast was wonderful.",4,2020,02,07
140,Perfect,"I can honestly say this hotel is amazing! Top notch! I visited with my sister and friend for a birthday celebration. From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic! The men on the door was so friendly, the staff on reception too. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was outstanding! The decor is beautiful and the hotel smells divine. We stayed in an executive room which entitled us to use the club facilities. This is the only thing we was disappointed with.  The new executive club lounge was closed due to refurbishment so was based in a small part of the hotel. That for me was the only downside, but again the service was fantastic and so was what was on offer. We would definitely come back to this hotel ",5,2020,02,06
140,Luxurious Langham London,"This superb hotel was worth every penny ...while the rates are high, the service, atmosphere and glorious rooms were exceptional.  The breakfast ...outstanding. We enjoyed “silver service” each morning. The “turn down” service was a welcome treat. We will be back.",5,2020,02,05
140,Great experience,"Excellent service, kind staff and good in-room dining. We had a problem with the extractor in our room, and the engineer came to solve the problem even if it was 10 pm. We also liked the food and services of the restaurant. Would recommend to family and friends. ",5,2020,02,05
140,"Memorable Stay At The Langham, London.","I booked two adjacent rooms for me and my three children (teens) for a fun mommy and kiddo getaway.  This is my children's first trip to the UK, and I plan nothing except for the hotel, as they tend to like to explore and do what they like.  The Langham was the perfect spot for us for its close proximity to shopping and dining.  Our rooms, although a bit small compared to rooms we've stayed at at other 5* hotels in Europe,  are very comfortable and has everything we needed.  

What made our stay memorable are the people who work at the Langham - they are truly marvelous and perfected the art of service.  From the staff at the entrance, front desk, concierge, house keeping to all the restaurant staff.  Everyone we encounter were friendly and yet not over bearing, eager to please and yet not intrusive.  We value privacy and relaxation, and we got both. The private hotel guests access from the Regent street was awesome, it made us feel like home as we can get in and out without having to go through the often busy main entrance.      

The room service, breakfast and dinner at both Roux at the Landau and Palm Court, are very good. We had a great stay and highly recommend the Langham, London.",5,2020,02,04
140,Cocktails ,"We popped into The Langham for a cocktail in The Artesian Bar after a friend advised it was a “must” whilst in London. It did not disappoint. 

The cocktails were fabulous, only to be outshone by the impeccable service. We were fortunate enough to be served by Adam and Julia. They were both delightful. Incredible ambassadors for The Langham. 

When we return to London we will definitely be staying at The Langham

Thank you from happy travelers from Newcastle, Australia ",5,2020,02,02
140,"Fantastic vegan menu, impeccable service","Why the vegan menu is separate i do not know: talk about hide your light under a bushel! I took my guests elsewhere the first night as i hadn’t thought to ask. The second night, glad i moaned as it was terrific, including delectable desserts Everyone is perfectly trained, attentive, they go the extra mile for you. So convenient to BBC studios!",5,2020,02,01
140,Luxury hotel. Will return,We loved our stay at this very luxurious hotel. Cannot fault the staff. It was a business visit and everything was provided for. All the necessary facilities were in place for ease. I couldn’t work the scanner and within minutes I was helped.,5,2020,01,31
140,Beautiful hotel,"Hotel is beautiful, rooms are very spacious, location of hotel is perfect, I used the spa for treatments it was beautiful very relaxing. I ordered room service which was lovely relaxing. I will definitely go back. ",5,2020,01,28

140,Wonderful Stay in LondonTown,"Enjoyed a long weekend at the hotel in January to visit friends and am so glad we chose the Langham! Triple rooms are not easy to find, and the ""Family"" room option was perfect for our needs. Spacious enough that we didn't feel crowded as 3 adults. Room service on point. Great location, fabulous cocktail bar, and wonderful staff. Cheers!",5,2020,01,22
140,Wonderful... As Always,"It is always great to come back to The Langham. It is a delightful place, and something of a home from home. The location is difficult to beat and the service is always top notch.The decorations for Christmas made what is a nice surrounding even nicer. As usual, we dined at Palm Court and it, too, was as good as ever. Great food and a nice atmosphere. Can't wait for the next visit!",5,2020,01,19
140,Disappointing !!!,"Disappointing !!! As soon as we arrived we were warned of the work at the spa, so the sauna and hammam closed and the gym moved to a small lounge, things that should be warned of customers when booking. Noise from the air conditioning in the room every hour waking us up at night. The elevators being broken down, we had to walk 15 min to access at the swimming pool.",3,2020,01,19
140,Family visit ,"My husband and I stayed at The Langham for 8 days. The location is fantastic, and the service we received from the staff was impeccable. I highly recommend this place. The concierge staff were amazing and very knowledgeable. They recommended several restaurants and they were fantastic. The breakfast buffet was exceptional. Although, everyone was nice at the restaurant, I like to especially mention Francesco at breakfast. He is a gem and took care of us. He is one step  of you and will remember every detail of your previous day order at breakfast... He will know if you had Almond milk with your oatmeal with a sprinkle of cinnamon. It’s attention to detail that makes your experience very especial. I like to also mention Ashlyn, I had sore feet from walking so much and I was inquiring about Salt from the spa. He offered to go to the store for me to get Espson salt on his own. An incredibly nice gesture. He came and dropped it off at my room after 20 minutes with no charge. Wow! Impressive. ",5,2020,01,19
140,Excellence,"The Langham London is in the prfect location for shopping, a lovely stroll to Regent's Park and all the attractions of Soho and Piccadilly Circus.

If you're adventurous take a stroll to Buckignham Palace, the theatre district and more.

Service and attention  to detail are impeccable.  From.the moment 
 you enter to the moment you check out.

Note: if you are a light sleeper request a room facing the court yard.",4,2020,01,18
140,Even better than expected,"All too often, I plan to write a glowing review about a travel experience but fail to do so...but not tonight. My husband and I arrived in London this morning on a trip we planned as a gift for our 82 year old parents. For many reasons, The Langham seemed to be the perfect hotel choice for the 4 of us, and it has already proven to be even better than we expected. 

We returned from a day of sightseeing - exhausted - and camped out in the Club. The food, drinks and service have been simply extraordinary. Drinks were topped off with a smile as well as that “extra” —as an example, my mention of how much my husband loved the cookies was followed moments later by Phillip bringing a box of cookies for us to take back to our room.

For any traveler looking for a comfortable home away from home in London, I’d suggest you look no further and choose the Langham.",5,2020,01,18
140,Afternoon tea was a delight!,A great couple of hours spent in a beautiful classy environment with excellent service. Food was delicious and tea was very tasty. We weren’t rushed and were offered more sandwiches. Variety of interesting fillings. Got a pistachio treat to take away with us and were offered scones to take away too. Great time. ,5,2020,01,16
140,Excellent ,"Always a pleasure staying in The Langham. Excellent service, pleasant staff, superb facilities. The hotel is finished to the highest standard. Breakfast offering vegan options, excellent bar service. 
Look forward to to our next stay! ",5,2020,01,12
140,Not just a pretty face this hotel has the best staff in London!,Staff in this hotel make the stay everything you’d imagine from a fairy tail experience. The rooms are perfect the food and the staff. I make sure I stay in a club room and they aren’t the cheapest but they are the best value for money. Your drinks and food are included and your wines and sinned with friendly lovely staff. ,5,2020,01,12
140,I really recommend the hotel,"It was really amazing!! The atention was really good, and very clean. I really recomend this hotel 
The spa was good: the swimming pool was cold, something that disappointed me because outside was really cold, but is really quiet and pacefully.
The room was great, an amaxing from the room, and the personal was amazing.
The location also amazing.
",4,2020,01,12
140,Just excellent ,"Stayed here in a recent short break to London, not been for a while, but very pleased to go back.
Booked an upgrade and everything was great with the Langham club being especially enjoyable with excellent service from start to finish.
Difficult to stay anywhere else in London really",5,2020,01,12
140,Best customer service,"We visited this hotel just after Christmas. My wife was so in love with their Christmas decorations, all very nicely done. Staff was impeccable as well as super friendly and approachable. My wife received a very nice surprise after our visit, a special thanks for this goes out to ms Sylvie Tsiampis.",5,2020,01,09
140,Could be better,"The breakfast service was extremely slow. I had a terrible wait staff who did not refill my coffee, who removed my cutlery by telling me he was refreshing it and not returning, not informing me of my other options for breakfast which I found out only after breakfast. 

The bathroom was a tad small and hence uncomfortable.  There was no separate shower stall and to climb into the rather high bath tub for a shower each time was inconvenient. 

My big thanks to Greg who was the bright spark in my visit. He chauffeured me to Mayfair and kept me laughing with his wisecracks and jokes.  He was extremely personable and the best thing I remember about the hotel. ",3,2020,01,09
140,Weekend Visit,"Recently visited The Langham for my wife’s birthday and what a lovely hotel this is. The welcome from the porters outside was nice, all the way throughout check in. Laura showed us to our room and was very polite and professional.
The hotel room was spacious and the restaurant and bars are great. We had a lovely drink in the bar and the food at Roux for dinner and breakfast was exceptional. The hotel even left a cake and fruit for my wife’s birthday

The only points for feedback would be

1. Would be nice if the pool was adults only. It’s quite small and not overly relaxing when kids are shouting and jumping in constantly

2. Restaurant need to check their offers on their own website as we mentioned the offer to 3 members of staff and were then still presented the wrong menu twice and the bill was still incorrect

3. A discount for the restaurants was posted to our room after we had left for the evening, rendering it useless. If the hotel has a discount it should be given on check in for guests to use. 
",5,2020,01,09
140,Still our favorite city hotel in London,"I stayed here a few years ago and returned after spending the previous weekend at Claridges. I've been trying to decide which hotel in London is the best. The Dorchester is also excellent but not located conveniently to the tube. This hotel has a great location 3 blocks from Oxford Circus and there is a Marks and Spencers pretty close to this hotel so you don't have to go all the way to Marble Arch. 
We had two connecting rooms, and one of them was an upgrade to an executive corner suite so the set up is really nice. What doesn't work here is that the building is sprawling and it takes about 5 minutes just to get to the gym or the pool if you are staying in this part of the hotel. Those facilities are excellent though.
Second hand smoke was a problem for me in one of the rooms and I had to move myself to the second room to avoid it. It took about half an hour for our luggage to arrive in the room; it was damaged during the transfer. The hotel did not deny it and replaced the luggage which was quite nice. Although the hotel asked me when we would arrive, we had to wait a good hour for the second room to be ready, which was after 4pm. They wouldn't give me an extra hour to check out so it works one way but not the other.
We like the buffet breakfasts and eating in the palm court is pretty, with a good amount of music going on during the evenings. We had dinner there; portions were small but the prices were not that high either.
If you are traveling at a time when there is a discount on the connecting room, Claridge's is priced pretty competitively with the Langham. Otherwise, the Langham is a much better value for money. Which property I like better I can't tell because right now Claridge's spa and athletic facilities are under renovation. Claridge's location is also excellent but in a different part of Mayfair closer to Marble Arch. It is a bit more personal of a place there. So it's pretty close between the two properties. They are both so far best of show that i know of in London. Also, to be fair, we were at this hotel during the week between Christmas and New Years and it is was at full occupancy; it's hard to run a good show when it's a total zoo all around you and I think they did a decent job of dealing with it.",5,2020,01,08
140,Heavenly,"If you are looking to travel in style and luxury - stay in this hotel. To say this is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in is truly an understatement. First of all it is located in the middle of everything, conveniently close and certainly walking distance. The lobby, rooms, and staff are extraordinary. The check in process was seamless and the overall stay was memorable. I will definitely return.",5,2020,01,07
140,Excellent trip,This hotel is very classy and very good service provid. All services is very fast . dinning table in clean and classic designing. Room is very clean and very big. All food items are very testy and healthy.,5,2020,01,07
140,Worth to stay if you can afford,"Good location, just few minutes walk to oxford street, bond street for late shopping, and off the main busy road.
The front desk quite helpful and been warmly welcomed on arrival, luggage been delivered to the room as well.
A quite nice size room with all modern equipment and deco, very quite in the room you can't hear any noise.
In house restaurant quite nice, we are lazy used here for most of our meals, and very satisfied.
Full breakfast quite standard but all good and fresh, especially the sausages, good taste.
I will come back , will recommend it.",5,2020,01,05
140,Perfection!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Langham and had a truly memorable stay.

We had booked an executive room which was light, spacious and immaculately clean with all the amenities you could possibly require. As it was my Husbands birthday they had also provided champagne and a cake for him which was a lovely touch.

We had the pleasure of having Club access which was a league above any I have had the privelge of visiting in the past. A warm and professional greeting from Christina who was so friendly and helpful throughout our stay. She dealt with any queries we had promptly. All of the team were smiley and friendly throughout our whole stay. The afternoon tea and evening canapés were delicious as we're the cocktails and champagne on offer all day. The whole place created a calming environment after a busy day in London. 

We will be sure to book the Langham on our next visit to London.",5,2020,01,05
140,The best Afternoon Tea ever!,"We enjoyed the Festive Afternoon Tea at The Palm Court at The Langham. The food was wonderful, especially the brioche bun with truffled Brie. The service was excellent. I can thoroughly recommend it to everyone who loves life’s little luxuries. ",5,2020,01,04
140,Outstanding,Outstanding Service across the board. The location of this property is also exceptional. Spa and pool plus for major city. Highly recommend. Restaurants A+++.  Request exterior rooms and higher floors.,5,2020,01,04
140,Excellent Stay at an Excellent Property,"I stayed here for a 5 day sojourn in London during the Christmas break. The hotel was exactly what we expected from a 5 star property (with some minor exceptions which I allude to below). 

The room was well equipped with a Nespresso machine, hot water pot for tea making and all the plush amenities like bathrobes, luxury towels and toiletries. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well, especially Victor and Marios at the front desk. They go out of their way to help you with anything and everything. The Palm Court is a terrific place for tea time and we enjoyed that on two occasions. The location is also great as it is walking distance to restaurants in Marylebone and Fitzrovia and shopping in Mayfair. 

All said, this is a true 5 star experience. The minor issues were the breakfast and its staff. We had breakfast in the Landau restaurant which is a great room. The offerings were not very extensive and we expected more from a 5 star property. Plus, the staff in the Landau was very sloppy, rushed and frenetic. They couldn't get an order of coffee right on more than one occasion and requests for a glass of water and fork seemed like tall orders. 

The other issue was the turn down service and house keeping which was inconsistent and not reliable. On our last day, the housekeeper came to our room at 10am to clean and we asked her to return at noon when we would be out.  The room was never cleaned that day. Requests for extra shampoo and soap at turn down fell on deaf ears.

Despite these minor issues, Langham was an excellent choice I would still come back.",5,2020,01,01
140,Great Location and Service,"Two stays in October separated by an excursion to Cornwall. First room was nice and quiet. On the second stay, had some inconsiderate guests upstairs, dropping luggage, moving heavy things after midnight. Had to request room change the next day. Could still hear upstairs guest in the new room but at least not after midnight. The great service was from the staff at Roux. We wanted the Healthy Breakfast from the Room Service Menu which was not on Roux's menu. Not a problem. They brought out what we wanted. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Especially Marzena and Mariana. I think the service here is what distinguishes this place. Property could use some updating. Hence the four stars rating.",4,2020,01,01
140,Great location,"Travelling from Asia for a long  weekend to soak up the Christmas atmosphere & see a couple of shows. Lovely pretty hotel & staff on arrival helpful & cheerful. Cannot comment on food as we like to explore our options, thou did enjoy a nice glass of champagne in the bar thou staff were rather slower for service in this area. Room was lovely and quiet thou for us the beds are too hot with such heavy thick bed toppers and duvets and we both have had better sleeps, hence why the four stars, so next time we will request to have them removed and a lighter duvet. Definitely will return thou as very good location for us and we enjoyed the Langham Hotel luxury feel.",4,2019,12,31
140,Great Location ,This hotel is in a great location especially for shopping. Staff were all very friendly and professional. We were very kindly upgraded when we checked in. The room was very spacious but the bathroom was so tiny and had no bath. The decor was lovely and beds were very comfortable with clean crisp linen. Breakfast was buffet style and had a good assortment. ,5,2019,12,30
140,Festive Afternoon Tea,Had an amazing Festive Afternoon Tea with a glass of champagne.  The service was on point together with the food explanations.  The food was absolutely delicious and the attention to detail was outstanding.  We were given a Christmas Pudding to take home which was superb.,5,2019,12,30
140,Captures the Christmas feel perfectly,"My wife and I visited for one night in December.  I don’t think I’ve been to a hotel that so perfectly captures the feel of Christmas.  I have stayed before at other times of year and it was excellent then too.

Location - perfect for Oxford street shopping and socializing.  Very near Oxford Circus tube so connects easily to other areas in London.

Room - excellent, large by central London standards and well decorated.  Feels British and traditional but upmarket.  Bathroom huge and with heated floor.  Large and comfortable bed. 

Food - breakfast was excellent, not a huge selection but all tasted wonderful.  Dinner at Roux a bit of a disappointment, a small menu for a place of such reputation and the food was good but nothing to write home about.  

Service - first class, clearly a well run proper 5* hotel.  The staff were attentive, polite and helpful.  

Overall - if you are disappointed with The Langham then I haven’t been anywhere that will satisfy you.  Highly recommended.  ",5,2019,12,30
140,Langham lives up to its reputation!,The rooms could use a bit of touch up but Langham is still a gorgeous historical hotel. There is that Langham signature pink and sweet scent that greets you upon arrival. The staff are more than helpful. When we first arrived we were put in a room next to some sort of mechanical room which was a bit noisy. Marco at the front desk moved me that same day to a higher floor and another room which I really appreciated. It is small gestures like this that really makes the five-star experience. Langham is very well-located but slightly tucked away so you are not overwhelmed by the crowds on Regent and Oxford streets. ,5,2019,12,29
140,"The Langham, beyond exceptional","An exceptional experience. The trip was to celebrate my parents' Diamond Wedding Anniversary, although the hotel were not made aware of this prior to my arrival. Chatting as we checked in, I was asked if we were in town for shopping or a show, so I explained about the anniversary. The staff made the visit a truly memorable experience for my parents. I cannot praise them highly enough, it was way beyond the realms of just doing a job",5,2019,12,27
140,Very good,"We enjoyed this classy hotel
Nice location near Regent street , Oxford Street and Bond Street. Nice clean room , the hotel has a choice of restaurants and a lively bar with good atmosphere 
Recommended",4,2019,12,25
140,Festive afternoon high tea,"The Langham was voted best afternoon tea in 2018, so we had to pay a visit.
The booking confirmation phone call asked if it was a special occasion, we said yes and received an extra congratulationary treat.
The room was pleasantly decorated with an excellent piano accompaniment in the back ground.
The finger sandwiches were very good with seconds if you wanted them.
The savoury course of scallop was very tasty.
Cakes and more cakes followed by scones with 2 types of jam. 
We settled on the Langham brand of tea 
Take home bags are provided for anything you cannot consume at the time.
Staff are excellent, knowledgeable about the food and teas, attentive without being intrusive.
Certainly gets our vote as the best, so go and enjoy yourselves",5,2019,12,24
140,Perfection,"The occasion was a 60th Wedding Anniversary, the happy couple and my partner and I.  
Everyone from the reception to the restaurant were amazing, going well beyond anyone's expectations to ensure this special couple enjoyed themselves.
The attention to detail, kindest and warmth shown was exceptional on this once in a lifetime occasion.
The rooms were to a high standard and provided everything anyone could ask for. 
The Christmas decorations were tasteful and jaw droppingly beautiful, creating a magical atmosphere of happiness.
This hotel has something truly special and is a considerable cut above the rest. 
I cannot thank enough all of the staff who made such an effort, they were a class act.",5,2019,12,22
140,Amazing Afternoon Tea (egg free),My family booked an afternoon tea at the Langham for our wedding anniversary. We told the hotel about our dietary requirements. We had an amazing service and unforgettable tea. There were several lovely sweet treats made without eggs which was amazing. I would go there again any time if I have a chance as the experience is amazing. I have been to other very famous hotels for a afternoon tea but this one tops them all to date. Totally recommend the experience.,5,2019,12,22
140,Delicious...,"We visited the Palm Court on Saturday  21st December for the festive afternoon tea,  what an excellent experience food was delicious service was impeccable, would definitely recommend a visit. Suitable for all ages.  ",5,2019,12,22
140,One of the BEST hotels in the world,"We went for three nights mid-December and were so impressed with the hotel and staff.  First Faisel at the Front Desk is truly a gem, he is so kind and caring.  All the staff was wonderful from the doorman, to those in the restaurants, all just amazing. Location is great easy to walk to so many locations in Central London.  Breakfast in the Palm or Landau terrific, the menu essentially the same just different ambience and sense of formality.  Choices whether from Buffet to menu are excellent.  The room was maybe slightly small but completely comfortable. Nespresso machine very useful and still water refreshed each day. Internet work well.  Overall I have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world and this is truly phenomenal.",5,2019,12,21
140,Afternoon Tea,"Amazing!!!! Best experience for Afternoon Tea bar none, classy yet relaxed atmosphere made you feel at home from the minute we arrived.
This was a birthday treat for my partner and we were both blown away by the place, great service, fantastic food and made to feel like royalty without being pretentious and snobby. We had the champagne festive menu and it was stunning.
If you are looking for Afternoon Tea in London definitely go to The Langham",5,2019,12,17
140,Excellent stay,"The rooms were great, everything you needed, we had a standard room but this was really large with excellent bathroom soaps and shampoos. The really great thing about this hotel is the service. Nothing to much trouble",5,2019,12,17
140,Couldn't ask for more,"Everything was perfect - great location, beautiful hotel, comfortable clean rooms, great service and welcoming staff.
God is in the small details and they understand it at the Langham. 
We will come back, for sure! ",5,2019,12,16
140,Christmas Favourite,"We stay here as a family as our warm up to Christmas every year and it’s just great. The beds are the comfiest ever, the staff are great, I can’t think of any negatives!

The location is ideal so after a day Christmas shopping you can head back to relax with a mulled wine..",5,2019,12,16
140,Just Wonderful..,"Stunning building, amazing staff, classic interior and decorated for Christmas with such elegance. One of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. Obviously not a cheap hotel, but for a treat it is a must to at least try once. Unfortunately didn't have time to try the bars/ restaurant in the hotel, but they did look amazing. Will certainly look to stay again. ",5,2019,12,15
140,This is good and is very good ,"Stayed as a guest with previous company, the hotel was dressed for Christmas with a lovely setting of Christmas trees as you enter.

The hotel is certainly 5 star the staff are amazing and so are the rooms. 

We had a lovely evening in the bar and again staff could not do enough for us rearranging tables and making extra space 

It’s expensive but you expect that and also look out for TV stars as BBC centre is opposite 

Great stay and great hotel ",5,2019,12,15
140,Believe all the 5* reviews ,"Sometimes reviews can be a little unhelpful, particularly the ones with a never ending steam of gushing compliments ...... however in the case of the Langham, every compliment is well merited and deserved.

To avoid repetition you already know what a classy, elegant place this is. You also know how good the staff are. The thing that we noticed was that the staff all seemed genuinely happy. 

For those who have run large businesses this is a hard thing to achieve. Well done to everyone at the Langham ...... London’s no 1 hotel ??

",5,2019,12,13
140,Nice and professional housekeeping ,"Hi there,
I was staying in room 634 and want to write some words:
When you are dealing with housekeeping service,  customer satisfaction is the most important thing. Working in a hotel requires good housekeeping and customer service and that’s what I found in Langham hotel.
I want to recommend 6th floor staff, Violeta room attendant and Salvatore the floor supervisor. They really clean my room every day and look after their guest in such a nice way and by keeping having a perfect communication with us.
I just want to say thanks to them two and thanks for you care and to make our stay memorable.",5,2019,12,13
140,Couldn't recommend this hotel more!,"If you're looking for a relaxing stay, in the center of a busy and bustling city (paradoxical...I know!), The Langham is the place to go! The staff were fabulous, really attentive and helpful, the rooms were super comfortable and clean, nicely decorated and the breakfast was incredible! We visited during the Xmas period so there was lots of beautiful decorations around the hotel, and mulled wine on tap outside (where you can grab a taxi). 

10/10 we will definitely be returning! Thank you to all those at The Langham who made our stay an absolute pleasure.",5,2019,12,12
140,London’s best hotel,"Another fabulous stay at this gorgeous hotel, never been at Christmas time before so it was great to see their Christmas decorations, it’s like a fairy tale. They have the most amazing people to attend to your every need, Eleonora, our guest service agent, was exceptional, finding us our favourite room and making sure we were happy (could not have been happier) and Marcin, our concierge, could not have been more helpful with our destinations and transport.

Our only disappointment is that they no longer make amazing cocktails with all the smoke and mirrors in the Artesian bar but instead going for a more unpretentious cocktail menu that you can get in any cocktail bar.

You really have to experience this hotel for yourself to understand how fabulous it is and there is not enough room here to thank everyone involved, can’t wait to return next year.",5,2019,12,12
140,"Luxury surroundings, with 1st class service","We had a great anniversary stay- we were treated like royalty, and were upgraded to a fabulous room with champagne and Chocolates.
Top notch dining,in Roux at the Landau, and cocktails in the famous Artesian bar. First class service and surroundings.",5,2019,12,11
140,"Classy, centrally located, luxury hotel.","The Langham is a high profile, luxury hotel in central London with a deserved reputation for sumptuous living. This was the first time we have stayed at the Langham. We've stayed at a few other high profile London Hotels and the Langham is up there with the best. It has an understated charm and opulence and, like the best of its peers, sets about its business with minimum fuss. The public areas are pristine and so too are the rooms with plenty of thoughtful touches (every light switch has a name so you know what it does!). The staff are approachable, knowledgeable and eager to help but otherwise unobtrusive. The restaurants befit a 5 star luxury hotel in the centre of town; a location which is hard to beat. Best value is the executive lounge which really adds a nice touch offering a haven from the busy London streets and all day food and drink.",5,2019,12,09
140,Faultless,"This is the perfect hotel - what really sets it apart is the service.  All the staff were brilliant - courteous, friendly, unpretentious.   We had a room which gave us access to the Club Lounge - we checked in there which was effortless.  There was any kind of drink you'd like - champagne, wine, spirits, beers, cocktails and the staff didn't hesitate to offer a drink to you.  You could opt for breakfast there as well as afternoon tea and canapés.

Loved the hotel and would definitely re-visit.",5,2019,12,09
140,Special Birthday Afternoon Tea,The Langham was beautifully decorated for Christmas and made our visit even more special. Our family group was made to feel welcome and with children in the party we were all treated and served warmly and professionally. The food was excellent and beautifully presented and the children had their own special themed tea party plates.,5,2019,12,08
140,Beautiful hotel,"This time of year I always bring my girls into London and as a treat we stay in a nice hotel. Over the years we have been fortunate to stay in most and this one for some reason stayed off the radar. It’s beautiful, clean (standard rooms a bit small) and the staff are all helpful. Will stay again and would recommend. Priced much better than similar. Corinthia wanted £800 a night these guys £500. I really can’t see why you would pay more. If you want a treat especially over the festive period and a walk to the shops The Langham is the one! ",4,2019,12,08
140,No loyalty at the Langham London,"Stayed a few times at the Langham New York (which is amazing) and as an 1865 member I thought I’d stay in London as the benefits were great.  Although I emailed twice to confirm my membership number it was never added to my booking so missed out on the room upgrade and additional amenities! Also annoying that they kept referring to me as Ms and not Mr. 

Room was definitely not worth nearly £500 for a Friday night. The view, directly of a building in touching distance and also a building site wasn’t what I’d expected for the money. 

Bed wasn’t particular that comfortable either, felt I was sleeping in someone else’s indentation. 

Extremely disappointed considering how much it cost. I only stayed due to the loyalty program. I could have got cheaper and better elsewhere for sure! 

I’ll just stick to the Langham New York in future. ",2,2019,12,07
140,Anniversary Trip,The Langham London was everything we had hoped it would be. Classic and elegant yet welcoming and comfortable. Marci in Guest Services was very helpful before our trip with answering questions and making us feel welcome long before we arrived. Her gesture of a welcome note and treats made us feel special on our 20th wedding anniversary. The hotel is in a great location...close to tons of shopping and the Tube yet far enough away from the main hustle that it is quiet. The bars and restaurants at the Langham are great. Bartenders are attentive at Artesian and the backroom at the Wigmore is cozy with tasty bar food. The lobby was tastefully decorated for the holidays and we could not have asked for more. Our Junior Suite was more than enough room and had a great view of the Eye and skyline. Perfect getaway!,5,2019,12,04
140,Disappointed in my room,A room with no view but I didn’t mind too much as i was staying over after my daughter’s wedding party there. I did mind however getting a mattress where i could feel the indentation of a body. I wonder how old it must be to dip so far in!,3,2019,12,02
140,Superb festive afternoon tea,"We booked for the festive afternoon tea on Sunday afternoon and were certainly not disappointed. The ambience was lovely, with beautiful Christmas trees and a range of music played on the grand piano by a talented pianist. 
The food itself was divine, with festive sandwiches, pastries, cakes, scones and a huge list of available teas. The attention to detail was exquisite, with everything made to perfection. We were asked about allergies and offered alternatives if necessary. When we were full, the uneaten cakes/scones were carefully packaged for us to take home in a beautiful pink bag.
The hotel is gorgeous and everything is such high quality. We made our way to the restroom and loved the tranquility and opulence throughout the hotel.
The staff were all very friendly, professional and attentive...even giving us a small stand to put our handbags on beside the table. 
I highly recommend this afternoon tea experience and will definitely be back at The Langham when I’m next in London.
",5,2019,12,02
140,Excellent Location and Very comfortable,"I spent a weekend at the hotel with friends before a week of work in London. Excellent hotel. The staff was very attentive. Very comfortable rooms and spacious bathroom, with lots of counter space. The breakfast in the main room is outstanding. Worth including in your day rate. Just at the top of Regent street, very close to lots of shops and restaurants too. excellent location. It was expensive but worth it.",5,2019,11,30
140,Spacious Suite & lovely staff,"I was on business in London and the client kindly booked me into the Langham. 

I thought it to be a lovely hotel with very friendly happy staff, the room was immaculate with the most incredible bath/bathroom. Highly recommended, will return.",5,2019,11,28
140,Do not stay w family,"We booked a standard room not knowing you can’t fit more than 2 people.   For over $600 a night - you get a very tiny, view less room where you can barely walk past the bed.   If you need accommodation for a family - you should be booking deluxe rooms at over $1000 a night (with hardly more space - room for a cot and throw the second child in bed w you!).  Not impressed.",3,2019,11,26
140,Not to the Langham standard ,"We absolutely love staying at the Langham chain, but unfortunately the Langham in London just did not cut it, considering it was the original Langham. You would expect them to have everything on point, but it comes down to the small things, our bathroom, had the good old fashioned water system where if someone was in the bath or shower another person could not turn any other tap on or the person washing would get either scalded or frozen. The food unfortunately was just not up to scratch. In all areas. Wrong meals arriving, undercooked pasta. Snotty poached eggs. And no option of baked beans for traditional English, it’s simple stuff that a hotel like the Langham should be getting right. And I know it is very much 3rd world problems but when you are paying £450 + a night you expect the simplest of things to be right. And these issues where not just on 1 occasion but throughout our stay. having stayed at the the Langham in Sydney and also in New York. We where blower away with these 2 locations. They where utterly flawless, but the Langham London... I am afraid not. ",2,2019,11,26
140,Attentive staff.,"I was on business in the area and the client kindly booked us into the Langham. A lovely hotel with very attentive staff, the room was immaculate with great facilities. Highly recommended, will return.",5,2019,11,25
140,Impeccable service delivered with warmth,"After pleasant previous experience at Langham NYC and Shanghai, I chose Langham London for my recent week-long visit. It has exceeded my expectations, which were already very high to start with.
Hotel staff are very international, which fits London's cosmopolitan image and Langham's global presence. The high level of professionalism and consistency of good service are truly impressive. It's heart-warming to see genuine smiles from hotel staff.
The club lounge is a great place to relax. Food is excellent and service very attentive. Special thanks to Selina, Cristina, Vitalis, Cindy, Melissa and Hoi, among others, who have pampered us so well.
Very delicious food at both hotel restaurants. I would highly recommend Landau, where I find service still one notch better. 
I've got good sightseeing/logistics advice from Brian at the concierge. What a true gentleman! Alex is also such a joyful and sincere gent that I look forward to saying ""ciao"" again to him.",5,2019,11,25
140,"Best food , service","First when we arrived the hotel , we went to have a cocktail at the bar before adjourning for dinner . 

Nice ambience at the bar , many people there and we were served promptly. When we were about to finish our drinks , we noticed other tables had nibbles like a bowl of mixed nuts but we didn’t . We spoke to the manager or supervisor at the bar . He was so apologetic and he said , the cocktails we had were given to us complimentary . He said, it  was their mistake that they didn’t pay attention to our table . How sweet was that!? He made us feel important. Very professional, he knows customer service . Ace!

So we went to Palm Court to have our dinner . Reservation was made for 7:30 pm. The moment we went to the restaurant, at the door we were greeted with a warm hello and smiles from the host at the door and he took our coats and introduced us to the manager of the restaurant . His name is Noli , from The Philippines.  Then there was the waiter Matt, Jordan and supervisor Nina . All were extremely wonderful to their guests/ customers. Very professional, they were good at their job. Very passionate and professional. Service were done with finesse . 

Our set dinner at £40 each included only one glass of champagne each . But we were treated like VIPs, we had bottomless champagne!  Dinner from start to dessert  in the end with two glasses of Baileys were exquisite. Compliments to the chef / chefs , food was super delicious, plating of the food was top class ! 

At the end of our dinner before we left , we were given complimentary tins ( beautiful tins) of special English tea that they served during high tea. 

That evening was OUR evening from pre drinks at the bar to dinner. 

We left The Langham feeling on top of the world . 

Thumbs up to the staff mentioned at London Langham Hotel . 

Do go and experience what we experienced. Everyone was treated special , no double standards . Tip top !",5,2019,11,24
140,Friday dinner ,"I have been to the Langham many times mainly for business meetings and a coffee or lunch. All good.
This was my first dinner as the hosted a Chaine and OMGD fine dining and wine event. Fantastic food and wine.
Service first class.
Well done to all.",5,2019,11,24
140,"Excellent location, great service","Visiting for business. Anything I say will be less. From the check-in to the check out- everything was excellent. 

The check-in was flawless- from walking in to the room - maybe 5 minutes, tops. I came much earlier than the check-in time and was immediately provided a room.

The room was relatively large considering it was London. The washroom pretty spacious too.

The service is excellent. From the person at the door, to the service in the restaurants (went to 3), to anyone one encountered, the service was just amazing.

The best thing about this place is the location. It is right in the middle of everything but still isn't. Just off Oxford Street- within few minutes walking distance to almost everything. Even by car everything is pretty near.

Would love to come back.",5,2019,11,23
140,Best hotel in London,We’ve been to London numerous times and this is the place to stay!! Everyone at the hotel went out of their way to make our stay special. We have stayed at other 5 star hotels and nothing comes close to the service at the Langham. The staff made all the difference in the world!,5,2019,11,19
140,Prime Location For a Bit of Opulence,"Located opposite the broadcasting home of the BBC and a short walk to Oxford Circus, this place is ideally sited for a short, yet interesting walk to a lot of great places in London.  We prefer to stay above ground as much as possible when in London, so walking to where we want to be is no problem to us. It's only a brisk ten minutes, on foot, to Carnaby Street, Soho, and the shops on Regents and Oxford Street. We walked for twenty five minutes down to Whitehall and Westminster Abbey early one morning and it would be criminal to miss all of that historic architecture while zooming around in a metal tube underground. 
Enough of travel, the hotel itself is as opulent and as extravagant as you might expect, given the price point of a lot of the rooms and suites.  Appropriately attired friendly and efficient doormen usher you under the arched facade and through the modern glass revolving doors and in to the marble reception areas. The staff were attentive and friendly at the desk and we were quickly in our room.  The room was well appointed, as we say, with all the usually luxurious comforts at hand.  We were out and about so much that we didn't use the full extent of the hotel facilities, but I am sure they were all well appointed too.  The bar drinks menu was a little low on beer choice and a bit fancy (ahem..pricey) for my simple tastes, but we didn't stay long before bed was screaming from the 6th floor after a Saturday night about town.        ",4,2019,11,18
140,Lovely Place! ,Such a lovely 21st birthday stay here. All the staff are so polite and welcoming! This hotel oozes luxury. I can’t wait to come back one day. They made my birthday so special and memorable.. So much attention to detail and beautiful! ,5,2019,11,15
140,Excellent stay!,Our family of five stayed four nights at this hotel. We had two rooms on the club level..... we could not have had a better experience! The staff went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. The food and drinks offered are the best we’ve ever had for a club level. The rooms were well appointed and the location was perfect.... we could walk to restaurants and shops. If we needed to go further there was always a taxi waiting. Amazing hotel made even better by all the friendly and wonderful staff. When we return to London we will definitely be returning to the Langham.,5,2019,11,14
140,Delightful visit ,"I made an attempt, in the midst of a time of considerable stress, to make a special trip for my wife which was, I’m happy to say, a great success. This was thanks in large part to the warmth and beauty of this hotel, and to the exceptional personal attention of Ms Liu. During our stay The Langham felt more like a family home than the impressive institution it is. ",5,2019,11,14
140,Excellent family stay,"We stayed three nights at the Langham and were extremely happy! The location is excellent and property well kept up. Two further things made our stay exceptional: Approach with children and quality of staff. Langham London is very receptive to children with dedicated check-in, activity booklet including treasure hunt, special slippers & robe also for the little ones, etc. We found this extremely welcoming and we felt very welcome to stay there as a family -- with atmosphere still being of a calm adults hotel. The staff was also very competent and friendly, always ready to help and willing to have casual chat.",5,2019,11,14
140,Fantastic and a Memorable Stay!!’,"I wish I had the option of giving 7 stars to this hotel!! The service and hospitality is unreal- something we never experience anywhere in the world! We had a great room- 729- spacious and comfortable! The Club Lounge is easily the best in the world! Its huge and they make you feel so important and take care of your every need- no hotel in London can match this!
Fadi and his team made our stay special- because we were celebrating my birthday! And they gave me a gift apart from the Champagne and the cake! Thanks so much!!
Superb Stay!",5,2019,11,12
140,A grand oasis in the heart of London.,"This was our 8th time at the Langham, and it never fails to impress.  The beauty, comfort, security and service is just top notch in every category.  Tastefully decorated, amazingly comfortable beds in quiet rooms with wonderful views.  It is really hard to beat.  ",5,2019,11,11
140,Weekend break,"We have stayed at The Langham before and loved it both times. The service is excellent and the staff are all extremely friendly helpful. The rooms are great - best nights sleep in a long time.
Having access to the Club Lounge just makes the stay that bit more special. Will be staying on our next trip to London.",5,2019,11,11
140,Classic 5 Star hotel in beautiful location with absolutely excellent servis,"I recently came to London with my daughter for prolongated girls weekend. We were recommended The Langham London hotel and it exceeded every our expectations. The room was beautiful, nicely furnished and big, the lounge on 3rd floor had great breakfast and delicious afternoon snack/wine and cheese (and champagne 🥂) complimentary selection. We definitely will come back!",5,2019,11,10
140,Always looking forward to come back,"Third time that I stayed in langham hotel and I am always impressed from the excellent service and friendly staff, the aesthetics of all areas, the room size and comfort, the perfect location and great bar and breakfast area ",5,2019,11,10
140,"The classics remain unchanged, even improving!","The hotel is located at the crossroads of Portland Pl and Langham Pl, in the Marylebone area. Directly opposite the entrance are the BBC Broadcasting House and All Souls Church. This is one of the largest and best known traditional-style grand hotels in London.
      Almost eight years have passed since I last stayed at this hotel. Surprisingly, the hotel has not changed much. The same wonderful service. Cozy rooms. It feels like home.
      During the time that I was not here, the hotel opened a wonderful SPA with a beautiful swimming pool.
      You always want to come back to such hotels.",5,2019,11,10
140,Perfect afternoon tea as always,"So far this is my first class place I go for afternoon tea. I invite important people in my life. Family, friends and loved ones. And for last 10 years the Langham never let me down. Everyone is soo impressed and happy with the food, service, atmosphere....amazing. Everytime I go there are new menu, new idea, new way of serving afternoon tea. Every season is sooo different and beautiful. It is FOR SURE NUMBER ONE in London. It is A MUST to go.",5,2019,11,09
140,Mum's birthday treat ,"Just had afternoon tea in Palm Court of the Langham Hotel. What a special place. Beautiful throughout, fabulous ambience, excellent afternoon tea with service that's second to none. Thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon and finished with a wander down Regent Street. ",5,2019,11,09
140,"Amazing hotel, exceptional service","This hotel blew me away. I booked a girl’s trip to London with my mother and boy, did the Langham knock it out of the park. From the moment we checked in, until our departure, the service and experience were exceptional. Hats off to Daniel, the bellman. He is delightful and a true professional. The Club access is one of the best I’ve ever experienced and worth the indulgence. The staff in the Langham Club are friendly and very professional. The guest rooms are well appointed, comfortable and very clean. The food was wonderful. I honestly can’t say enough about the Langham; it’s an amazing hotel with 5 star service.",5,2019,11,06
140,Fabulous,"Beautiful place to stay in London on Regent Street, close to everything. Be sure to book an Executive Room to take advantage of the Langham Club facilities, it’s fabulous. The rooms were divine, the mattresses outstanding, beautiful linen. Bathroom was also well laid out with luxe condiments. We were there for four days, the service was second to none.",5,2019,11,05
140,The Luxurious Langham London," 
What a stunning building from the outside, it’s very grand as soon as you approach the entrance.

I was greeted before I’d even got to the rotating doors by a very smartly dressed gentleman who took my suitcase for me and this then made its way to my room ready for when I arrived there. I went to the main reception area and was then advised that as I had Club Level access that I could go to the Club Lounge on the 3rd floor to check in there. I was taken up to this area by the Guest Manager Selina who also gave me a very brief tour of the restaurants and bars on the ground level before heading up.

I was then greeted in the Club Lounge by the ever so helpful Ani who arranged my check in and showed me the private lounge area and went through the perks of Club Level and things that I could do in there (mainly lots of eating and drinking!) I was shown to my room by Cindy who was incredible and really helped make my stay, she was just so attentive and friendly. Cindy had got a map of London for me, marked where the Langham was, gave me a theatre guide as well and took a real interest in the things that I had planned for my few days.

The room itself was incredible, this was a Deluxe room so I can only imagine what the other rooms are like! The hotel are very much for supporting local businesses as in my room were 2 fresh apples from Brogdale Farm in Kent, I loved to see this! After 10 minutes of being in my room I was greeted with a phone call to make sure that I had settled and if I needed anything then to let them know!

All of the staff that I met were amazing and friendly it didn’t feel forced or just part of their job, they new my name and showed a real interest in me. Nothing was too much trouble and the service provided was faultless.

The Club Level is worth upgrading to or this does come as part of some room packages automatically! The service is 5* in the Club Lounge, it is either table service or you are free to help yourself to food or drinks. It is a very relaxed and quiet area, it is open until 10pm and I did quite a lot of my work from here whilst sipping on a soya latte! In this area breakfast was served, there were samples of the afternoon tea between 2:30 – 5pm and then between 5:30 – 8pm canapes were served. The food was just stunning, there was a huge selection with the breakfast, there was a menu for fresh foods or there were enough selections laid out for you to choose.

With the sample of afternoon tea, it was like having an actual afternoon tea, it was a scrummy selection of mini cakes, you could actually request some finger sandwiches separately which I did and didn’t regret it (my waist line did though!) The canapes in the evening were more like a small selection buffet of yummy foods, they had a tasty soup and a mouthwatering mushroom quiche, along with freshly made humous and a meat and cheese selection, whats not to enjoy! I can imagine if you want to go to London but not fussed on the sightseeing side of it then you could quite happily stay at the Langham and not need to leave as everything you need is actually there under the one roof.

I did experience the swimming pool, it is where the old vaults used to be (an old bank), it is amazing in there, could have spent all day there and there is a steam room actually in the men's changing rooms!

The pictures are a good example of what I ate and they don’t do the food enough justice really, the food is 1st class! I was truly spoilt rotten in the club lounge. I love my afternoon teas and never had one on this scale/level before, I didn’t want to come home! You don’t need to stay there to experience the afternoon tea though as you can book in just for this if you are ever in London or want to give this as a gift to someone.

Had a cheeky mojito, glass of champagne and G&T whilst in there as well! The biggest surprise in my eyes was how much of a family hotel it is, kids happily playing in the swimming pool and children also allowed in the club lounge. The kids were treated with as much respect by the staff as the parents and the staff new the kids on a first name basis so a very personal service for the whole family!

Even though the hotel is huge, once inside you forget how big it is, it is very quiet and relaxing.

I have never experienced service like I have at the Langham, I wish it went higher than 5* as they deserve more, needless to say, I shall return!
",5,2019,11,04
140,Excellent hotel for central London,"I have stayed at the Langham over the past 5 years. I find it excellent. Nice room sizes, excellent service, good gym, excellent breakfasts, and very good restaurant. Can walk to many things and close to tube. Also, bar is good for a drink. Overall, it has become my favorite London hotel",5,2019,11,03
140,Lunch at Palm Court Restaurant in the Langham Hotel,"What a wonderful place to enjoy a first rate meal in very plush surrounds. The food prepared by chef #budiono (Indonesian) was authentic, delicious and frankly quite incredible - all 3 courses.
The Palm Court us a beautiful and plush and a very relaxed place. It's clean, tidy and welcoming. The staff made the experience all the more enjoyable. 
The Langham is close to Oxford Circus underground station (5 minutes walk), liads of buses pass in close proximity and better still, there is a taxi rank right outside. 
Absolutely love the place and can't recommend it highly enough. 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿

......and chef #Budiono's meals really are to die for.",5,2019,11,03
140,Perfect start to finish,Great service from start to finish. Club lounge worth every penny will be returning in the future especially around Christmas time. Great location for shopping and seeing the rest of London. Breakfast was faultless,5,2019,11,03
140,Langham Club Lounge  - A London must,"After three weeks of travel, this was my final destination before flying home. The London Langham was a bucket list item after staying at the Hong Kong one. 

I was greeted by their delicious signature scent, which I purchased immediately and a surprise upgrade to a suite - so huge I wandered about in amazement for the first ten minutes. 

Service from door to Club Lounge is immaculate with all needs anticipated - and I'm a professional psychic! They knew what I needed before I need it. The staff better stay in hospitality, otherwise I'll be out of a job as a clairvoyant.
",5,2019,10,31
140,Excellent and comfortable stay.....,"We stayed at The Langham for the first time last week with our two teenage children (we had interconnecting Superior Rooms) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very comfortable although the bed (as other reviews have mentioned) was too soft for me and I did end up waking early each morning with back ache. However, my husband did not mind it, so it is a matter of personal preference I suppose! We had breakfast twice in the Landau restaurant (a la carte) and once in the Palm Court (buffet). We did prefer the Landau which was more comfortable (we were given a low table in Palm Court and found ourselves bending down to eat our food). The food was excellent. The service was very good too. We did not have use of the Club Lounge but we were so busy exploring London that I don’t think we would have had time to use the facilities there anyway. The service by the chambermaids was excellent (we had mistakenly left the ‘do not disturb’ button on in the room and thus when we returned to the rooms, they had not been cleaned). However, just 5 minutes after turning button off, the ladies appeared at our door to start cleaning (in the afternoon!) - we were most impressed and grateful for this personal service! We will definitely stay here again when we visit London again especially as it is so close to the shopping area of Regent Street!",4,2019,10,30
140,Above and Beyond,"From the moment I booked this hotel, I felt that they cared about your stay and I had direct contact with Melanie from front of house who was extremely efficient and personable, ensuring all was in order. Once we arrived, we were treated to a spectacular service.  We had booked a suite and we were welcomed back from our previous stay by Annie, who was professional, efficient and friendly throughout a seamless private check in.  

Our room was pure luxury with exceptional attention to detail.  It was spacious with beautiful features.

We then spent some time in The Langham Lounge, where Monica acknowledged my partners birthday and ensured that we had all that we wanted.  Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, I want to give a special mention to Hoi, who delivered a faultless service, going above and beyond what you would expect.  He was friendly without being intrusive and even personally made us our favourite cocktails.

This is a very special hotel and we will be coming back time and time again.  Thank you for treating us to the amazing Langham service which leaves other London hotels trailing behind.",5,2019,10,30
140,"Highly impressive, luxurious and also very friendly","We often stay in London for the weekend (despite only living 20 miles away) and have spent time in many of the city's top 5 star hotels. Until this last weekend we had somehow missed the Langham - what a mistake.

We LOVED this hotel and it's definitely our favourite in West London (with the splendid Four Seasons Trinity Square holding up standards East):
1) Service. Everyone here - without exception - is on point and very courteous, keen to please and super-helpful and SMILEY. An absolutely charming doorman got us off to the right start (Massoud? he was from Algeria and we had a long chat about how lucky we are to live in England), followed by a lovely young woman on reception who escorted us to the Club Lounge to check us in;
2) Club Lounge. This is one of the  very best Club Lounges I have ever experienced, rivalling my two all-time favourites at a couple of Ritz Carltons - in Naples and Grand Cayman.The space is excellent (very large) with very good food offerings and plenty of obliging and responsive service. Personally I wish some parents would control their little children in there at breakfast but one cannot blame the hotel for this (just irritating parents who can't manage their own kids);
3) Suites: We had a good-sized suite with an excellent bathroom. Quite ""art deco"" in style it was large and well-appointed with entirely separate ""his and hers"" basins (which I prefer) and loads of enormous fluffy towels and plenty of toiletries. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel blissfully quiet (we were on the top floor).
4) Location: If you want to be West, this is in a great location. Opposite the BBC in Portland Place, in a quiet little corner, but a stone's throw from Oxford and Regent Streets, theatreland etc. We were dining with friends at Emilia (great food at Bonhams off Brook St - a mere 8 mins walk).
5) Style. For tourists especially, I think this hotel epitomises the luxe and style that many hanker after when visiting the capital with all its history. There are acres of marble, pillars, high ceilings, grand rooms and of course one of the city's best bars! This trip I did not eat at the Roux at the Landau but I hear it's providing some good cooking and I will definitely try it next time (already planning a treat weekend for my in-laws as a new year pick-me-up).
Compliments to all staff (and to the management) for achieving this quality and consistency of service.",5,2019,10,28
140,"Stylish, spotless, welcoming",Stylish room but also very practical. The room was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished with extremely comfortable beds. The staff were friendly and professional. Beautiful pool. We were made to feel very welcome indeed. The location is excellent,5,2019,10,28
140,HOSPITALITY AT ITS BEST,"We stayed here for our honeymoon. Well, we found our favorite hotel of all time!
The level of service is almost unbelievable!! But it’s real. From being greeted at the door (great guys) to the housekeeping staff (incredibly sweet) and everyone in between. One extraordinary touch of this hotel was the Guest Services Agent, Anna. After check-in, she greeted us and guided/oriented us around the hotel and our room. Every time we went to the lobby or had a question she was there, smiling and so genuinely happy to help and make our stay superb! Almost seemed like our personal hostess. The room..oh the room. Didn’t ever want to leave. The hotel scent.. yes I had to get a reed diffuser for my home. The spa/pool...Amazing! Too many things to mention. Lastly, Andrea at the Bar..A great bartender that not only knew his stuff but knew how to make his customers smile and have fun! But what else to expect from one the the top 50 bars in the WORLD!!
If you choose to this hotel, you will love it! 
We want to stay at another Langham in the US..but honestly, already dreaming about our next trip to The Langham, London!!!!! THANK YOU for such a wonderful stay, for the friendliness and I’d say, perfecting the hospitality industry!! ",5,2019,10,24
140,Amazing hotel in central London,"Superb hotel with 5 star service. Special shoutout to Mattia, the front service staff supervisor for his attentiveness to service excellence and likewise to Jozsef who was from the in room dining team. Impeccable service from both of them that went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable. ",5,2019,10,23
140,"Super Hotel, Service, Location & People","This is our No1 hotel when in London. It never disappoints and just gets better each time we visit.
On our latest visit we took advantage of the Club Lounge which is available to those booking Executive rooms and above. A great area to sit, chat, read and rest with all drinks and buffet food included. The staff are so attentive and pleasant and nothing is too much trouble.
Brilliant hotel.
",5,2019,10,21
140,Relaxing break,"We had an issue when we arrived with there being a double booking for our massages that were booked in advance but not followed up by Chuan Body + Soul, which left me very disappointed indeed, as this was our special weekend to try and completely relax during an extremely stressful period in our lives.  Fortunately, your Acting Langham Club Manager, Ani Tihova was exemplary in every way and resolved our situation, which subsequently lead to a wonderful weekend which we intend to repeat at your hotel, as it did not spoil the experience that was second to none and ALL of the staff were superb.",5,2019,10,21
140,Small guest rooms,"I have stayed at the LondonLangham for several years. While a standard room is small, the staff is professional and the location is convenient. Before my recent trip, I emailed the hotel  in advance to confirm my room would be in the main building (the hotel annex is a maze to get to) and requested  one of the larger standard rooms because I was in town for a week and had a lot of clothes due to multiple events. The rooms sizes vary widely! 

When I checked into my room, #308, it was very small, claustrophobic in fact, but it wasn’t until I unpacked that I realized there was no room for clothes in the dresser because it contained a mini refrigerator, drinking glasses and a tea set.  Typically there is a small alcove near the entrance for beverages and the fridge but this room didn’t have one.  To top it off the closet was half the size.  I tried to change my room a few times, but the hotel staff said there was nothing available and they really didn’t seem to care.  They offered no solutions. I asked if the fridge and glasses could be moved, and was told no.  They took me seriously when I checked out an hour after I arrived.  I’m in a beautiful room another hotel with a lot of closet and drawer space. And the staff and location are even better!

140,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here for a girls trip in October and booked an executive room. Upon check in we were given a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite which was a lovely surprise. This is a hotel full of class and old school special touches. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are well appointed. The team in the executive lounge are happy to help if you have any queries or require assistance. The executive lounge / rooms are definitely value for money as you can have your breakfast in either the lounge or in 2 alternative restaurants. During the day you can have champagne or drinks on tap in the executive lounge and can also have a selection of afternoon tea goodies. At night they have snacks on too. We ordered room service which was also great, although I think the room service menu could have a little more variety. We will definitely be back. ",5,2019,10,19
140,"Everything was ok, but for the sleep - awful mattresses.",I could not fell asleep - too soft. I slept 3 nights 4 hours a night. And felt the whole day ruined completely. I don’t know why they don’t care about this aspect - the best way would be to purchase medium softness matresses ,4,2019,10,19
140,A lovely looking place,"My cousins from Austria  came to stay with me and wanted to take me out. I chosen the Palm Court Restaurant at the Langham and sent them the book a table email. I used to entertain our clients for afternoon tea there  when I used to work in Margaret Street and my brother and his family stayed there a few years ago for a week and loved the food.They booked and when we arrived we were told there is no booking. My cousin shown them the confirmation on his mobile and they said aha it is the Palm Court you are booked for. We were seated in the lobby and a charming young men came and asked us to give him a minute. When he returned he told us that the Palm Court was booked for a private function and they could not reach my cousin to cancel. Of course not he was in London and no longer in Vienna. He offered us a table in the bar by the window plus a complimentary glass of Champagne, we agreed. We were brought little fold up chairs for our hand bags a first for us the starched napkin was placed on our lap. In all one of the best services we ever had in any of the places we went to. Two of us had the chicken pate as a starter which was very good, one had the mackerel which was not to her taste and repeated on her. The Ox Cheeks where ok, but small was tender and juicy not a patch on the ones I had on the Gherkin I am a fan of the Le  Gavroche and Waterside Inn and the  thought being Michael Roux the food would be perfect. The Creme caramel was different from any other the sweet with the berries and ice cream was very mediocre the water ice was superb but the pastry was stale. What we liked was the Champagne, the olive  oil mixed with ground olives which was served with the bread, the way a mould was put in the creamed potatoes to hold the gravy , the pate and most of all the service. The bar was very loud and it was hard to make a conversation, the place was dark and I had to hold the candle over the menu to be able to read it. The staff did its best . The Ladies looked super and was very clean.",4,2019,10,18
140,"Really nice stay, would recommend","Stayed here a few weeks ago for a night with my husband. The stay was very nice, room is a good size and spotlessly clean. The bed was super comfortable and would have easily stayed another night if we could. The view wasn't great, we were looking into a courtyard but didn't spoil anything. All interior areas of the hotel are beautiful. We had dinner at the Palm Court which is one of the hotels restaurants, on entering was worried it would be a bit stuffy but was actually a lovely, relaxed atmosphere and the pianist is a really nice touch. We had a lovely Iralyan waitress I think her name was Anna who treated us very well and made the dinner very enjoyable. Food was good but to be honest wouldnt come back just on the food alone but for the whole experience. Only negatives were the toilet is quite a walk from the dining area, not really a negative but its a little smaller than  I imagined. Would definitely come back for a dinner/lunch and would recommend a stay if you can. Breakfast was also really nice we ate in the room and the mini plate warmer under the room service tables is great idea as it means your breakfast stays hot.",5,2019,10,17
140,What's not to like!,"Such an amazing hotel from start to finish.

We booked to celebrate our wedding anniversary & husband's birthday too.Arrived at 9.15am to leave bag in concierge but to our surprise our room was ready so was greeted at check-in with champagne and upgraded to a Junior Suite. 

Room - beautifully presented, extremely large comfy bed, 2 seater sofa & chair, desk space, TV with all sky channels & a bathroom the size of a lot of hotel single rooms! Looked out to the front of the hotel towards the BBC building & the other side with views of other iconic London skyline.

The Club Lounge - this is a must for anyone staying at this hotel. Staff are fabulous and make for such a relaxed atmosphere. Drinks & cocktails list is very good and various food throughout the day (breakfast, afternoon cream tea, evening buffet/canapes) all of exceptional quality with a chef on hand too. A great place just to sit & unwind.

Spa & swimming pool - unfortunately we didn't have time to use these but they looked very good & plenty of people were using these services. That's one for our next stay for sure.

The hotel decor is traditional without being ""old"" and the ambience of this hotel is very relaxed and welcoming but at the same time you know your in a 5star hotel.

Would we stay here again - in a heartbeat. We have stayed in many London hotels & this is now my favourite.",5,2019,10,16
140,"grogeous hotel, great location","we had the pleasure of staying at the langham for a weekend to watch the chicago bears play at tottenham. we stayed on the club level, in two junior suites. the club level is beyond wonderful. the staff is impeccably trained and efficient. no request went unfulfilled. the food was fantastic. the rooms are well appointed and noise free. we were sad to leave and we will absolutely stay here when in london. having stayed at the four seasons, the berkeley, the connaught and the taj that says everything!",5,2019,10,15
140,Just incredible,"It's been almost one year since my family and I stayed at the Langham London and I still think about it! I think this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. We stayed on the Club Level which made everything so much easier, and the staff there went above and beyond. It's a great location near Regent Street and we loved walking around and looking at all of the Christmas displays. Really made our trip for me, and just writing this review is making me want to go back.",5,2019,10,15
140,Simply the best,"The best staff, the best bars, food and rooms.  Beautiful decor, high level of comfort and excellent food.  Central location, great outlook of London skyline. Nothing was too much trouble and we were treated with friendly courtesy by all staff. ",5,2019,10,14
140,Outstanding Hotel,"Stayed two separate times within a fortnight. Both rooms were clean, beds comfortable, good wi-fi access and most importantly very quiet.  Had a good night sleep all 3 nights.  Customer service was timely, very friendly and helpful at main reception, concierge and porters.  Breakfast buffet was just OK but would recommend the a la carte option; the staff were much friendlier as well.  Hotel is well located with a short walk to Oxford Circus station and a 15 minute walk to the West End.  Will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,13
140,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic hotel in a beautiful historic building and an outstanding location, close to Regent Street and main shopping areas. The decoration and details in lobby, common areas, bar and restaurants is top notch, rooms are also comfortable and tastefully decorated.  Service is absolutely outstanding with friendly and extremely professional employees in the front desk and restaurants, who are mindful about details to ensure a great customer experience. Special mention to Rodrigo at the reception, who was friendly, professional and very helpful. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to enjoy the SPA and pool, look forward to returning to the Langham as without a doubt this is a top option for London.",5,2019,10,13
140,The best Hotel experience o had  in london,"Amazing service. I stayed for 4 nights and every day was a perfect day.  I enjoyed the club: they always know your name, always smiling and offering help.
Each and every employee  did the best to make you feel good . ",5,2019,10,13
140,The 'gold standard' with charm and all round excellence,"The Langham has always made every experience fabulous...the location adds to the charm of the magnificent building with its unique ambiance and professional staff. 
Drinks or dinner and drinks, having a special weekend away (and making time to visit the shops or London sites that are a hop and a skip away) or arranging dinner following on from a scientific meeting for a large group with individual tastes, the Langham has always proven to be a memorable. I look forward to my next excuse to be there!",5,2019,10,11
140,Warm Elegance in Great Location,"The Langham has these pluses: (i) great rooms, (ii) a feeling of brightness, (iii) genuinely nice people from Raquel at the reception to the sweet guys in Roux at Landau, (iv) terrific breakfast [avocado yay], [v] good location -- Regent St. is pretty much just there but the hotel is just on top of the hustle and bustle; three minutes walk to Oxford Circus Station, five minutes walk to Soho, ten minutes walk to the British Museum, and [vi] I like the company color -- an elegant pink!",5,2019,10,10
140,Heritage Modern Hotel with Best Location,"One of the best located hotel in the heart of London. It is a 5 minute walk to Regent Street and a 12 minute walk to Selfridges. So very centrally located.

Friendly staff, but the reception is not at the guest receiving area. Therefore, recognition of guests when they pass by is absent. Guest love being recognised and addressed by name.

Rooms are a bit small but well maintained. I would recommend the xx63 series of rooms which are more spacious and well located.

Restaurants within the hotel are just 2 and therefore the limited food options, but the choice of food outside is so wide that you don't need more eating at the hotel.

Breakfast spread is very good, especially the 'Whisky Soaked Salmon slices' which are heavenly.

One of the best hotels that I have used and I highly recommend it.",4,2019,10,09
140,Best way to experience London !,"The Langham is the best way to truly experience what London has to offer! The entire staff are extremely professional and very polite, always willing to assist with any questions. This property is a luxury five star hotel for many reasons but it's the staff that really makes a difference. From the doorman welcoming to the very efficient front desk staff, to the housekeeping staff etc.... Everyone is so friendly ! We stayed at this hotel for a week while touring all the great places that London has to offer but it won't have been as enjoyable  if we didn't stay at The Langham.It made are trip so memorable. The restaurants were excellent including the terrific breakfasts we had each morning. The Palm's afternoon tea was without a doubt the best treat while visiting London. Cheers to the chefs and staff for an excellent experience.",5,2019,10,05
140,The gold standard for all 5 star luxury hotels .....,"Our entire group was grateful for an early check-in at The Langham. It is the gold standard for all 5 star luxury hotels. It is built in the traditional style of grand London hotels. I do not know how the doormen can survive in their handsome wool suits with bowler hats in the 90 degree temps that London was experiencing that week, but each of us was greeted with a smile and a helping hand with our luggage.

The public spaces in the hotel are simply beautiful. But the beauty was not limited to the lobby and dining rooms. Our bedroom was very quiet and truly luxurious with amazing comfortable beds. I can’t remember a place where I slept any better than our three nights at The Langham.",5,2019,10,01
140,Luxurious every step of the way.,"From the moment you arrive and are met by the friendly, professional and courteous porters,  to the welcoming and expert front desk staff, you feel welcomed and valued. 
The hotel is beautiful in both decoration, ambiance and calm. 
The rooms are luxurious, pristine and have everything you could need. The beds & pillows are particularly comfortable. The rooms are quiet making for an excellent sleep. 
Each recommendation from the concierge was spot on. This is a hotel that is above the norm in both luxury,  comfort,  convenient location, superb professional staff (who can not do enough for you )  in a wonderful location in London. Room cleaning staff and turn down service are excellent.",5,2019,09,30
140,Afternoon tea,"Visited on Saturday as a birthday treat for my mum and to try and help cheer us up following the sad loss of my Dad. The staff at the Langham are exceptional, we were made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. The service and attention to detail was superb. The Palm court restaurant is tastefully furnished, the quality and amount of food is good. Particular thanks to Stefan the assistant manager and Ashley the lovely northern bell boy for their kindness, complimentary champagne and room spray, unexpected but much appreciated touches that made our afternoon at the Langham even more enjoyable and memorable.",5,2019,09,30
140,Fantastic stay,"The staff, from Concierge to the restaurants, were attentive and helpful at all times. The club lounge was exceptional - the food was amazing, staff were very friendly and the evening drinks were fabulous; the champagne is a must-try. I would highly recommend anyone who plans to stay here to purchase the club access, it is definitely worth it and don’t let the price deter you. The room was brightly-lit and spacious, which had a subtle luxurious yet comfortable atmosphere. The housekeeping staff were very attentive and tidied the room sparkling clean. Definitely a fine hotel that exceeds expectations and deserves the praise it receives.",5,2019,09,24
140,Christmas wonderland,"We've just booked our stay at the Langham over Christmas and I realised I've never written a review! We always choose this place for Christmas. A family with two children, we find it brings just the right amount of magic during that time of the year. The lovely decorations and tall Christmas trees around make our little ones jump with excitement while we indulge in the luxurious spin of it. 5 stars always.",5,2019,09,24
140,Excellent visit ,"As usual such an excellent hotel.we in joy very much    The facility  of the hotel.the room is spacious every thing  was for our satisfaction.
But above all  the service and     Specially the care and attention off Monica how made our visit  unique 
Thank you",5,2019,09,21
140,Another wonderful visit,"We visited again this week to attend a west end show, from pulling up outside you are looked after incredibly well from all the staff you encounter you could not fault a thing.
The rooms and the food are 1st class and the lovely Cristina Puca is a treasure! 
Many thanks once again.",5,2019,09,21
140,MEANT TO BE !,"Initially we were booked into the Four Seasons but due to being ripped off by Amoma.com ( now in liquidation) we had to find another hotel pronto. We didn't realise it was London fashion week and most of the central hotels were fully booked but luckily there was availailability so quickly reserved a room. What can I say apart from amazing service  from the guy on reception to the lady who showed us to our room. Lots of little extras plus a gift to take home. Not forgetting the doormen and concierges, all so friendly and genuine in their greetings.Would love to return.",5,2019,09,20
140,Truly Absolute Perfection,"My wife and I have high standards and the Langham exceeded them in every way.  The hotel is exquisite - the entrance, the lobby, the public rooms, the bedrooms.   The location is ideal for all sightseeing in London.   The staff is the most well-trained staff I have ever seen - from the doormen to the bellmen to the front desk to the concierge to the club to the room service.   The rooms are immaculate, beautiful, comfortable, roomy and very quiet.   The club, which we had access to, is gorgeous with spectacularly good food and unbelievable service (including a shoutout to Cyndy and Elena who were so helpful.    If I could rate the hotel a 10 in every category I would.  I couldn't consider staying anywhere else in London.  It was simply perfect!",5,2019,09,18
140,L'age Dor,I felt like a member of the Tsar's court.  The staff was beyond reproach. The rooms   were out of Downton Abbey. The bathrooms were stunning! The area around the hotel was hopping. You could get all your meals and treats at no extra cost in some circumstances. The views from the upper level rooms are both useful to get oriented and fascinating. I 'll go back!,5,2019,09,16
140,"Fantasic Vist , This Hotel Only Gets Better","Rooms in The Langham Club are beyond reproach and the staff could not be more attentative and helpfull in particular ; Cyndy, Zaneta, Cristina,Rodica, Ivan, Hoi, Vitalis , Irena & Larisa. The Doormen cannot help you enough with your travel arrangements and are so courteous. We are returning in November and has become our number 1 hotel in London, its situation is ideal for Regent Street and Convent Garden .",5,2019,09,16
140,A birthday weekend,"We had afternoon tea at the Langham yesterday, as part of our weekend to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We stayed at the hotel a few times so we know what to expect, and it didn't let us down in any way.  We were greeted really well at the Palm Court desk and shown to our table, even though we were a little early.  All tables were occupied so their timings must be extremely well managed, like everything else :)
Super tea and my favourite little pink bag to take home the cakes we couldn't finish.
Excellent service as always and really nice food.  Great selection of tea as well and more/or a change if you wanted it.",5,2019,09,16
140,Amazingly wonderful !!!,"Truly a 5 star hotel everything about the hotel from people, service, rooms and especially the Artesian bar inside the hotel was really wonderful!!  Excellent afternoon tea and amazing scones!!Beautiful place!!",5,2019,09,15
140,Nice staff but not worth the price,"Pros: staff were very nice and friendly.
Cons: no power sockets or usb charging points near the bed. In this day and age this is a must and for being a 5 star hotel unacceptable. Phones need to be plugged in and charged overnight and in reach for a pre-bed browse and to turn off the morning alarm. Also the bath tub plug was broken and both pillows were way too thick my head was craned and uncomfortable. Perhaps I'm nitpicking but for the steep price these things should be perfect.",3,2019,09,15
140,Wedding night stay,"Should have posted this 2 years ago - we stayed at the langham for two nights post wedding. My husband and I believe this is the best accommodation we have ever stayed in. From the start of our check in to the end of our stay ALL the staff knew our names and congratulated us (no body knows how they do that?!) 
We stayed in the executive suit that included breaky, drinks and nibbles (don't be fooled! 'The nibbles' You could live off this grub!) 

Reason for writing a review 2 years later is because we are on our anniversary and are reminiscing of this beautiful hotel. 

I would stay/live here anytime if I could! 

Get in! 7star service and accommodation!",5,2019,09,10
140,Just a GEM,"The Hotel is amazing under a umbrella of a great Team of Peoples 

From the Waiter go the Top it’s truly truly Hospitality

They keep the fact that we as customers are important in terms of genuine care and sincerity ",5,2019,09,10
140,"Undoubtedly, the highest","The Langham London always tries to be the best, which gives us more than just a luxury hotel.
Even if a small problem occurs, it will be fixed perfectly.
If you are going to use The Langham, you will feel comfortable from the point of reservation even until after your check-out.",5,2019,09,09
140,Perfect,"This hotel must be one of my favourite hotels in London we come here at least once a month just to be together and time away from busy life ,  it never disappoints the room is beautiful and elegant ,  if you’re fortunate to be able to book at club level  The service is impeccable  if you ever need anything if you can find Christine she is amazing and will make sure your trip feels all your expectations .",5,2019,09,09

140,Strangely 7 comfortable...sorry...overall a little austere..,"Sorry, but you don’t need 3 porters/ bellmen and an additional 3 people “screening” people loitering in the lobby (that’s how it felt) when all you want is a quiet space for a glass of wine and a chat. 

Mr/Mrs manager, suggest you try mystery shopping at the Royal Horse-guards lobby to see what you’ re up-against for a much warmer welcome, plush seating, undisturbed space to wait, chat, relax. 

It all felt a bit cramped, a design and ambiance challenge. And constant up-sellout by bar staff. 😢",3,2019,09,07
140,A Quintessential London Afternoon Tea,"A very posh and elegant afternoon tea at the Palm Court.  Palm Court is a small restaurant, so the servers are very professional and attentive.  Reservations are recommended.  Our server was super attentive and hammed it up for my husband and daughter, who ate up the whole experience.  The food was exceptional and plentiful.  We didn't leave hungry.  The ambiance with champagne bubbles and live piano music was relaxing.  Palm Court has a superb selection of teas.  As a non-tea drinker, my husband still talks about the delicious blend of Silk Road tea.    For a special occasion high tea, this is an unforgettable experience.",5,2019,09,07
140,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Have just come back from afternoon tea at The Langham.  Best afternoon tea ,treated like royalty and the food was wonderful. The staff are so attentive but not intrusive.  This is a special place and we cannot wait to come back",5,2019,09,07
140,Exquisite afternoon tea,Had an excellent experience of the afternoon high tea in the Palm Court. Lovely ambiance and atmosphere with a live pianist playing throughout. Friendly and welcoming staff all who looked after your every need. Visited with my husband as part of our wedding anniversary celebrations and so pleased we did. Would definitely recommend as a place to celebrate a special occasion with family or friends. ,5,2019,09,06
140,Always a fabulous experience!,"I bring all of my clients here for business meetings - and the incredible experience. The staff in the Club Lounge (particularly Zaneta and Hoi) are incredibly friendly and always go above and beyond to make my stays here, fantastic. 
The hotel is lovely and the rooms are nice with great views across central London- but it really is the staff that keep most of the customers coming back. They're friendly, have a great attitude and always remember you! Little touches that go a long way.",5,2019,09,06
140,Every aspect of my stay was perfect,"The location is great.  close to the BBC.  A short walk to the river,  A short walk to Regent street.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  The restaurant and bar were offered great food and drink and the service was warm and efficient.",5,2019,09,04
140,Fantastic,"Amazing, awesome, exceptional.  This hotel has the best customer service.  Everyone was friendly and courteous.   I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  This is a true 5 star hotel with the service to match.  The location is excellent, right near the Oxford Circus but not with the noise.",5,2019,09,03
140,Outstanding. Best hotel ever!,"We travel a huge amount, Singapore, the US, Europe, the Maldives, Canada etc and we were looking for a fab hotel for one night in  London to celebrate moving back to Mayfair so we booked the Langham.

From the minute we walked thru the door, it was incredible. Every member of staff were superb and very friendly. The Artisan bar is a delight with delicious seaweed nibbles. Beautiful wines and cocktails. The room was a delight, huge with a huge bathroom with walk in shower. Bed linen out of this world. The pool in the basement swung it for us, we were the only people in it and it felt like we were in a different galaxy. So relaxing and so calming. We didnt hear any noise during the night at all compared to most london hotels where you do hear other guests in corridors, here it was silent !

We both think it was the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we cannot wait to go back even tho we will be living just around the corner.

Thank you for a wonderful wonderful stay.",5,2019,09,02
140,Absolutely gorgeous detail and amazing tea time,"If I could give a place 6 stars, the Langham would get it. The location can not be outdone and the staff were amazing. Pleasant, kind, funny, and caring people around every corner. You could live in this hotel for years and not see every single amazing detail put into it. The tea time was fabulous, one of the best in London. the simplicity of it was the best luxury. My family and I got the once in a life time chance to try a tea that may only be available for a few more years. This is the place to be, do not miss the Langham.",5,2019,08,30
140,Excelent ,"Great service  
Great design and attention to every detail 

Super centrally located  

Breakfast was in a very beautiful hall, 

Attentive Staff all the time available offering help  

I would definitely recommend  
",5,2019,08,27
140,Spacious family room and excellent location,"Never expected it to be difficult to find a room for sleep of 2 adults and 2 young children around hotels in central London in August, and the Langham offered just the ideal type of room to us.

Except for a relatively small bathroom comparing with the size of the room and number of occupants that it houses, everything ranging from the beds, pillows and other amenities were well in very good condition.

The hotel itself was within easy reach from the busy tourist area yet offered a tranquil environment (except revving of supercars/bikes probably by patrons of the hotel during the late hours for one or two evenings) which enabled our family to take good rest after our outings. 

As with other hotels operated in old buildings, one would expect relatively less effect sound proof and we heard sound from the corridor created by other non attentive patrons such as loud banging on their doors upon closing, but fortunately we managed to fall into deep sleep quickly afterwards. 

The gym was surprisingly comprehensive given its relatively small space and one can get some serious workouts in there to shake off some fat after days of full meals. 

Did not manage to visit the bar (which is always packed and filled with laughters and chats) nor did we try their afternoon tea. See if we have the chance to do so next time. Perhaps we should also visit the spa for treatment after outings too.

",4,2019,08,26
140,Deserves 6 stars,"My husband and I stayed at the langham for six nights during July 2019. We chose The Langham after we read the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. I think that there are no enough words to describe our experience at The Langham. First, the receptionists are very kind and professional.  The concierge team is great, so professional and very helpful. They recommended us great restaurants and places to visit especially Mr. Kamal who took care personally of everything we needed. The breakfast at the Palm Court was awesome and so the team. The waiters were so kind and always smiling. The room was so clean and the amenities were great. 
The location is superb. 
This is our hotel in London. 
Good for you, The Langham team.

140,AWESOME+!,"Meant to review this hotel earlier.  The Langham is one of the most wonderful properties at which I have had the pleasure of staying.  You get what you pay for.  Service is impeccable without being stuffy.  The lady at the table next to us in the restaurant had a purse with nowhere to go and, poof, a tiny valet tray appeared for her purse.  The amenities box in our room had pretty much everything we could ever need, and more.  Room was fully cleaned twice each day.  The waiter at afternoon tea simply smiled when the big eater in our party ordered a fourth serving of dessert.  The list goes on...  the Langham truly is one of the top hotels anywhere.",5,2019,08,26
140,Our 4th wedding anniversary!,"I’m so glad that we chose The Langham to get married in, because it gives us a great reason to return for an amazing treat!! From arriving at the door to the reception staff and beyond, everyone is incredible! So helpful and kind, but what really comes across is the fact that the staff all seem so happy and genuinely want to work in this establishment!.  The spa was wonderful as was the incredible breakfast in the Landau.  As always the Artesian was an amazing experience and thank you so much Anton for recreating our wedding cocktails for us! We also have to mention The Wigmore and the wonderful staff there.  Please don’t ever stop doing the ham croquettas and the chips with the Bloody Mary salt! Sooooo good!! 

All in all, a most wonderful experience yet again and we are counting the days to return again.  Thank you.",5,2019,08,25
140,Pamper Yourselves with this Soothing Oasis of Luxury,"This hotel doesn't leave a stone unturned in seeking the absolute, total comfort of its guests. Location is a pleasure, on a quiet corner close to the best shopping (too close). Friendly, helpful, highly professional staff in every area. Knowledgeable concierges. Guest room is completely quiet for a good night's sleep, important to know when you're near the city center. Rooms and baths are thoughtfully equipped with every detail imaginable for a guest's peaceful enjoyment.  Other hoteliers could take a lesson.  Room attendants deserve special mention. They seem to be invisible, but how nice to return tired after an active day and see untidy shoes neatly arranged, messy items straightened out. The entire hotel is spotlessly clean. Some hotel bars are kind of dead, but not here and no wonder--drinks are awesome, staff so nice, so it's a happening place as the evening wears on. In a city where hotel competition is brutal, this is one of the best.",5,2019,08,25
140,Warning: the most unbelievable and attentive staff in the world and an unbelievably incredible experience.,"From the time we arrived we were in the midst of luxury and more importantly totally surrounded by the happiest and most caring and attentive staff I have ever experienced in the world.

The Hotel  is in a most central location, safe, with security and staffed by wonderful, professional and incredible staff whose aim is to make your day the happiest possible.

We stayed on a club floor and the staff in the club (Ani, Fady, Christina, Hoi, Ivan, Mirko, Vlad and Valerie) were the most responsive and professional that I have encountered with no challenge a problem. 

The cleanliness and beauty of the rooms needs also to be experienced and whilst not cheap you get what you pay for and more.

An incredible experience and something that the Langham in Hong Kong should be modelled on as this Hotel is significantly better than the Hong Kong Hotel

Would thoroughly recommend to any traveller.",5,2019,08,24
140,"Exceptional and outstanding service! After 30 years of visiting London, this hotel is #1","Good rooms, good beds and pillows. Excellent showers with very good water pressure. 6 large towels per day for 2 people, very good maid services, very clean. 

Have been visiting London yearly for 30+ years, past 10 years only 5* hotels, and this hotel has by far the best service! 
Extremely helpful and friendly doormen held the taxi doors for us on arrival and departure, always had a smile and a friendly greeting. They were always there to help with taxis, luggage, directions, and always very welcoming. 

 Every staff member we met asked us if there was anything they could do for us, always with a smile. There was always staff on call on each floor. We got fresh fruit delivered (for free) every afternoon, to our room. Free water bottles every day, unlimited refills. 
We felt like the staff genuinely cared about us, we felt welcomed and most of all we felt seen and we felt like VIPs! The bar staff was also very friendly and attentive, great drinks and great atmosphere in the main bar. Lovely place for drinks or tea, and people watching. 
I have never experienced service at this level before. Compared with other 5* hotels including Claridges, this was outstanding and an experience like no other. 
We celebrated a Birthday during our stay and got free drinks and free cake delivered too our room, staff wishing happy Birthday and making it such a wonderful day. 

The rooms were completely quiet, no noise from outside and we could not hear anything from other rooms. 

The rooms and the location is great, but the service is truly exceptional!",5,2019,08,24
140,LUXURY TO THE MAX,"Recently stayed for 6 nights at this wonderful luxury property.  Being a Travel Agent, i had a lot to choose from, but the Langham seemed to be our first choice.  From the valet, doorman, front desk, concierge to restaurant personnel, you could not have asked for more. If something was not right, it was fixed.  Felt very safe walking in the evening to restaurants, and shops were close by. Great location. Rooms adequate size by European standards. Everyday a little box of local fruit in the room. We were also greeting on the first night with a bottle of wine in the room.  The cleanliness of the hotel, impeccable.  I highly recommend the Langham Club.  Service, food, drink plentiful, beyond luxurious.  Staff went above and beyond.  I am sorry I am home,but the fond memories of that hotel will last forever.  Very easy sell to my clients that want EXCEPTIONAL.",5,2019,08,22
140,My New Favorite Hotel (Move over Four Seasons),"I recently stayed here with my daughter for a wonderful week in London. The Langham was exceptional in all areas. From the greetings of the valet, the helpfulness of the Spa Staff, to the wonderful Staff in the Club, it literally felt like a home away from home after a full day of sight seeing. I highly recommend the Club as the delicious food and afternoon champagne were especially appreciated after 8 hours of walking around. A special shout out to Ivan and Vitalis in the Club who were truly delightful to us during our week long stay. The location was great for us. Great stores and restaurants close by, the tube station a 5 minute walk, and a quick taxi to most sites. I I also recommend a reservation at Sketch restaurant a 5-10 minute walk away, great food and incredible surroundings. ",5,2019,08,21
140,Excellent Hotel (Location and Staff),The Langham Hotel is located at the north of oxford circus on the extension of the Regent st. Excellent location for shoppers and easy access to buses and london metro. The staff members were friendly and very professional the room was fully equipped and super clean. I truly enjoyed my stay there and strongly recommend. Also the hotel has a Fully equipped gym and a swimming pool. ,5,2019,08,19
140,The Best Afternoon Tea in London ,"Absolutely the best afternoon tea we have ever had.  The food was truly superb, the service outstanding.  They even give you a cake to take home.  You must give this hotel a try.  I have already booked to return in December.",5,2019,08,19
140,Anniversary treat,"Stayed one night whilst visiting London for our silver wedding celebrations.
The Langham is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff are so professional and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. We were given room 845 on the top floor with breathtaking views of London.
It was an absolute delight to stay at the Langham and I wouldn't hesitate to return. ",5,2019,08,19
140,Memorable Stay,"My sister, generously treated me to 2 nights at The Langham to celebrate my birthday.  We have previously stayed here before, and like the previous times, we were not disappointed. 

The staff at The Langham appear to go above and beyond their duties to make guests feel valued and welcomed, comfortable and looked after.  The staff appear genuinely interested in their guests and remember guests preferences, etc.  The staff team present as a cohesive and supportive team whose main objective is to provide excellent service. They present as genuinely nice people who like people.",5,2019,08,16
140,Amazing hotel,"My husband gave me this as a birthday present this year in August, beautiful hotel, the rooms were nice and spacious, staff were fantastic, they gave me strawberries and a slice of cake in the room for my birthday which was a nice touch. The breakfast was amazing so much choice and everything fresh. Everyone from entering the hotel until you leave really look after you, highly recommend this hotel and so near shops cafes and restaurants. Also has a spare and swimming pool area although the steam room and sauna are separate in the ladies and gentlemen changing rooms",5,2019,08,15
140,Old World Charm With Unsurpassed Service,"My wife and I recently stayed at The Langham London for the third time in 5 years and have added another great memory to our family celebrations. Four years ago we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary at The Langham and this year it was the highlight of my wife's 75th birthday. We mentioned the celebrations in advance of our visit and could not have been more pleased with the reception we received upon our arrival. An excellent bottle of Champagne together with chocolates and fresh strawberries greeted our arrival in a spacious room with an excellent view of the London skyline. The hotel staff, especially at the Langham Club, brought service, courtesy and friendliness to a whole new level. The Concierge staff organized outstanding seats (center aisle stalls) for 3 West End plays at very short notice. This hotel has maintained its iconic status for opulent service for over 100 years which is a tribute to the outstanding management over the years. Every staff member we met made us feel like we were the only guests at the hotel. This is truly one of the best hotels in London and we would highly recommend a stay at the Langham London for any special celebration. Do let them know in advance and enjoy the pampering!",5,2019,08,12
140,Afternoon Tea at The Langham,"Note:  Review is only for Afternoon Tea

While on a visit to London my husband and I thought it would be proper to take our five year old daughter to afternoon tea.

Given that this is not common were we are from, we weren't sure what to expect.  Of course I wanted to get all fancy, but the husband and daughter were not so inclined.  Whatever, it didn't really matter.

The Langham was our choice because they had some special offerings for littles.  And boy did they exceed expectations.  Their offerings for adults were simple and tasty.  The display put on for our daughter was delightful!  Sandwiches shaped like puzzle pieces, a desert tray with an ocean theme that you could decorate yourself.  Lovely strawberry tea, that was tasty and caffeine free! Plus, a book of the child's choosing to take home.

I never really loved scones.  In the US, where I am from, they are often hard and tasteless.  The Langham, however, has a delightfully flavored scone that is to die for!  Thankfully they let us take a few home, because after the sandwiches, and other offerings, we were stuffed!

The room was beautiful, with a large faux willow in the center.  The surroundings were pretty and completely elegant.  

The staff was amazing. From the very friendly hostess, to our server, everyone was happy to see us.  

I wouldn't hesitate to go back again for another tea next time we are in town!",5,2019,08,12
140,A London Gem,"Everything at The Langham is superb which is why we always return.
In particular the rooms are always inviting and the staff are brilliant,great service but not over the top
we usually use the Palm Court Restaurant where our chosen meals have always been excellent
Thank you",5,2019,08,11
140,Outstanding hotel,"This is the best hotel we stayed during our two week trip through United Kingdom. The room was spacious, and service was outstanding. Breakfasts were outstanding with so many choices, and this was the only hotel where I didn’t need to get everything. For example, if I needed orange juice, they got the orange juice for me. In other hotels, I was pointed to where orange juice was. During our high tea, staff went out of their way to provide us with vegan sandwiches and other delicacies. During our dinner, the chef even made and served us two Indian items, puri and cauliflower bajjis. I was expecting a nice Indian vegetarian dinner, but I was hugely disappointed.  After we made our reservations, we got a call from Gate1 asking whether we would prefer a Indian vegetarian or Jain meal. We requested an Indian vegetarian meal, but we didn’t get that meal. I am still not sure what really happened, and the incident did leave a bitter taste in our mouth on an otherwise outstanding stay.",5,2019,08,10
140,"Fantastic, friendly staff, great ambiance and cocktails!","My friend and I popped by here for a quick drink and ended up staying a couple hours because the staff was just fantastic. So friendly, polite, knowledgeable and the bartenders make GREAT cocktails. Thanks to William in particular who was just great. Made our night, thanks!",5,2019,08,10
140,Average 5 star. ,"The Langham is apparently 5 star and on arrival the pomp and splendor being greeted by the liveried staff on arrival was quite enjoyable. 
The entrance and amenities were average as was the room but maybe a bit small for my liking as was the bathroom. I find cupboards and lighting could do with more clever thinking as both are inadequate. Lighting could work on dimmers. 
Electrical plugs could also be upgraded to accommodate USB points.  
There is an executive lounge where you are able to get breakfast and a few other perks if you qualify to use those amenities. 
I was so underwhelmed by the restaurant but that is probably my fault as I thought Michel Roux Jnr would have a more imaginative tasting menu. 
There are probably many other 5 star facilities to choose from so each needs to keep their finger on the pulse and not rely on reputation alone. I am sure all the tourists will continue to love the Langham. ",3,2019,08,09
140,Classic Luxury London Hotel & Then Some!,"We greatly enjoyed our stay in June for three nights! We usually stay at the Corinthia but decided to try the Langham based on a friend's recent experience. We were hesitant because we love the location of the Corinthia but gave it a try. Upon arrival we had a minor issue with our reservation which normally would not have bothered me but we had arrived from an overnight flight from Africa and I was running on no sleep. The reception staff member I was dealing with did not understand the issue with the check in but a manager came out and took over. She went above and beyond to rectify the mistake (on the hotel's part) and even went so far as to settle me in the Club Lounge with a charger for my phone and a cup of tea! Her attention was much appreciated and in the end they did not just correct the mistake but upgraded the room category so we had a lovely connecting set of rooms with our teenage children that had a beautiful living room in between.
The location turned out to be great - within a short walk to Piccadilly and Mayfair and most other areas we like to walk around. When we needed to go further it was only a short cab ride.
The Club Lounge is a must! I highly recommend booking a room with Club access. You can request to add it for 90 pounds a day if you book a room that does not include it but it is not guaranteed to be available. It was beyond worth the room type we had booked. The service is insane - the food and drink excellent - the atmosphere such a treat after a long day of walking London. We spent a lot of time there and it was truly one of the highlights of our stay!
I would not hesitate recommending the Langham for your next stay in London!!",5,2019,08,07
140,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service",I stayed at The Langham for four nights. The service is A+ and the hotel is updated and very comfortable. The staff is on top of it and there was never a delay with requests and the room was always cleaned immediately when we would leave in the morning. The food at the hotel is excellent; I loved their breakfast assortment. They also have bikes you can easily check out which was nice. They pay attention to the details and it made the stay much more enjoyable. I would definitely stay there again and recommend the hotel.,5,2019,08,07
140,Langham leisure,"Great staff, lovely facilities, nice room, good but not exceptional breakfast. Gluten free options adequate but expectations would be higher. Bistro not really commensurate with rest of the hotel. Staff are the jewel",4,2019,08,07
140,Top of the Line Service ,Wonderful stay from the first minute to the last. The room was clean and well kept and good sized. The service was impeccable and the staff made us feel at home. The food was excellent even when ordering from room service. We really can’t wait for our return.,5,2019,08,06
140,excellent as usual but whats happened to the cocktails,we stay here regular as it is right location and top class..it had become famous for its cocktails and we took along some friends for her birthday as she loves cocktails...however they have changed them now to a boring drink in a boring glass..not up to your high standards you set in the past...im sure this will effect your trade..we would now look elsewhere as you have taken away something we come to your hotel to enjoy....hotel is great and staff fantastic...,5,2019,08,06
140,Seems they hire WC’s by the hour...,"Will add a note or two regards the hotel but overriding impressions were pretty shocking. Used ladies WC just after checking out to be met with pretty obvious signs that these toilets had an alternative use. The last thing you want to hear when taking your five year old daughter to the loo is a mans obvious groans of pleasure in the next cubicle.. utterly repulsive

Would love to say great staff... however clearly disappointed that staff turn a blind eye to certain ‘goings on’.... stayed in spacious, well appointed room although  not the most comfortable of beds.. I sleep on somnus and the Langham falls far short of what I’d expect in this price range. If you want quintessentially British this is for you, harpist, pianist..  not the best vibe but perfect if your looking for tawdry hookup..",2,2019,08,04
140,London's finest,"I stay in London frequently and recently made this my new 'home away from home'. Having stayed at most of London's hotels I can say with confidence this is consistently the best. Service is impeccable, of the very highest standard, attentive, intimate and yet not intrusive. The hotel facilities are top draw, particularly the restaurants and bar, and the pool and spa are stunning. The rooms are beautifully furnished and appointed, very much in keeping with the period nature of the hotel, but unlike many hotels, they are not overly fussy or dated. The service at The Club is truly second to none. I would not hesitate in recommending The Langham, to anyone that has the budget, including the most discerning of travellers.",5,2019,07,31
140,Perfect stay at the The Langham,"We won a competition to stay in this gorgeous hotel and it by far exceeded our expectations. The hotel and staff were outstanding, courteous, helpful and friendly which made our stay fantastic. The hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were immaculate with perfect little complimentary gifts and snacks. The High tea is highly recommended with delicious food and plentiful portions of a very high quality. W.e will remember this trip forever very fondly",5,2019,07,31
140,Perfection,"Afternoon tea.  Wonderful.  Elegance at its best.  Firstly, selection of sandwiches, followed by pastries and finally scones with clotted cream and jam.  Dietary requirements and allergies catered for.  We also chose three different blend teas to drink.  An experience well worth trying.",5,2019,07,31
140,Beautiful Hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a long weekend at the Langham.

The service is second to none.

Our room was stunning with little treats left for us, bed was very comfortable and very clean and well stocked Bathroom.

Hotel bar was very nice with good quality cocktails, drinks and bar food.

The breakfast was the best quality hotel breakfast I’ve had, the choice is not enormous but ample.

No one can do enough for you.

140,Staff is Brilliant,"Rooms are way too small, hard to get a room-service tray in.  But the staff is absolutely top notch in every respect.

140,Small rooms,"Clean hotel. Filled with tourists and business people.  In Mayfair, Regent street. Shopping everywhere.   Small rooms.  Nicely appointed, but really, really small.  Everyone nice.  We ate in Roux, expensive, which you would expect but they had an adventurous menu.  Quiet.",4,2019,07,25
140,Lovely tea room to visit with friends,We came here for a fancy high tea experience and were not disappointed. The food and service were both outstanding. The tea is served in the palm court.  A bit pricey but worth it as a once-in-a lifetime treat!,5,2019,07,23
140,A must stay when in London!!!,"This is a beautiful hotel right in the heart of London. It has a beautiful open foyer, palm court all with exceptional service. I could not recommend this hotel enough. I was staying for a conference and had booked a standard room. The room was spacious, well appointed the bed was very comfortable. I was very impressed they had managed to build a pool in such an historical building.

it really is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of city life - you can spend all day exploring/conferencing and retreat into the sanctuary of the hotel.

The staff are always on hand to assist with anything. Check in was an absolute pleasure with wonderful staff; my room was not available at time of check in as I had arrived from an early morning flight. This was not a drama and a couple of hours later received a call saying it was now available.

The restaurant and bar offerings were also delightful with staff equally as wonderful there; with a very attentive level of service that was not intrusive.

Could not rate this highly enough and when in London will be back!",5,2019,07,22
140,Langham London,A beautiful hotel in the Maryleboe section of London. Well appointed rooms and great service. It is a litle pricey but well worth it. There is a terrific modern pub attached to the hotel and a wonderful restaurant too.,5,2019,07,21
140,Beyond Expectations!,"We booked the Langham with high expectations, as it has received tremendous reviews and came highly recommended. However, The Langham exceeded our expectations ten-fold. The staff to guest ratio is outstanding, friendly and professional faces were always available to meet our every need. The restaurants and bars within were all fantastic, as well as, the hotels amenities. The overall vibe of The Langham has an unmatched positive energy. We look forward to returning in the near future!",5,2019,07,18
140,"If You Go To London, Staying at the Langham is A MUST!!!!","I have stayed at many places in London over the years, but the quality and service of The Langham keeps me coming back. The staff really goes above and beyond to make you feel special and welcome.

Ian the doorman, is a true gem of this hotel. He gave some amazing recommendations and was so engaging and sweet. Every time we arrived back seeing his smile made us smile and we felt as though we were coming home. Not many properties offer you that home feeling.

We had included breakfast and the breakfast at Roux at the Landau was the perfect way to start our day. The staff here, especially the hostess and manager were lovely to interact with every morning, and any special request we had they happily accommodated us. They have some many delicious choices at the buffet and you can order off a menu too! 

We enjoyed pre dinner cocktails every night at Palm Court, what a great atmosphere to kick off an evening. The cocktails were SPOT on and if I only knew the little crackers they serve you to enjoy with your drinks I would be on cloud nine. (They were the most delicious cracker I have ever had).

The Spa is a wonderful quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of London and if you need the most spectacular massage of your like ask for Nikita. She was just a pleasure and melted all of my stress away after long plane ride.

Housekeeping and turn down service were impeccable as always.

If you visit London, staying at The Langham is a must. Truly a luxury 5 star hotel and experience.

140,6 Stars ,"What’s is there to not like about this place. My wife and I have just spent another few days staying in this beautiful hotel. The location is perfect and the building has a classic feel yet with a modern twist, and it is always impeccably clean and well maintained. We like the Club rooms which come with access to the Club lounge, providing a beautiful area for everything from private check-in, breakfast, all day snacks, to a space that you simply can have a quite drink and chill for a while, all with instant friendly and personal service. However, what really makes the Langham special, is it’s people! The staff are amazing,  making you genuinely feel welcome throughout your stay. The Club Lounge led by Christina and her team- Janet and Annie to name a few are fantastic, always ready to help, always smiling and clearly very passionate about their job. To be honest, this can be felt throughout the whole hotel, no matter where you meet a member of staff -front door, waiting staff, housekeeping, they all go out of their way to make your stay very special. We have stayed in several other 5star London hotels, but this is definitely our favourite and we now don’t consider anywhere else. It’s all about the experience you get, and as I’ve said, this comes from the people. Well done to the Management and Staff of the Langham- can’t wait to go back. ",5,2019,07,17
140,This is what a hotel should be like ,"If you want to experience a great hotel and be treated as all hotels should treat people this is the place to come.  

From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated with consummate respect.  

The rooms are excellent. Good sizes, immaculately clean, well equipped and excellent facilities.  

The restaurant facilities are exceptional. 

The stand out feature though is the team.  Hotels of this quality exist because of the team and the leadership culture.  

In my book this is the best hotel we have ever used in London.  Please check our reviews because we have stayed at an awful lot of hotels.  As past regulars of the Cafe Royal and the Wellsley I can honestly say the Langham is a good grade above them.   

Well done to the entire team and a special thank you for the customer culture.  It’s exemplary. ",5,2019,07,17
140,Great hotel not to miss.,"Best hotel in London in terms of food, location and services. Do not miss the breakfast here as this is one of the best in the world in terms of quality and services.

Four school friends all celebrating our 50th Birthdays with afternoon tea - wonderful experience from the minute we arrived - cheeky G&T in the Artesian Bar followed by relaxed elegance in The Palm Court.  The food, ambience and staff made this one of the loveliest afternoons - it’s not cheap but we had a bottle of rose champagne - why not I say!!! Money well spent for such a fab experience - will definitely be going back - thank you to all the staff at The Langham 5* plus.",5,2019,07,14

140,Recent Stay at The Langham-Highly Recommend,"The Langham is first class. It fits the definition of a grand hotel. I really hope to return next time in London. I know more about which room I would like. The location is just superb. Walkable to or from so many restaurants, shops, Apple, Bose, just about any shop and several museums and galleries where I had several events. Friends and family appreciated the location as well.   I found an hour each day to walk the distance (tremendous hotel) to the Chuan Spa for the pool and had a terrific massage. What a welcome respite. I enjoyed the breakfast everyday, and the espresso in my room. The beds are seriously comfortable. I must have a large bathroom with a long bathtub and The Langham did not disappoint. Several people at the Langham went the extra mile for me. Always with excellent service and a can do approach. The management is excellent!",5,2019,07,07
140,Vanilla flavoured classic luxury,"This is hard to rate as they do everything right & yet there's just nothing to shout home about except being in Central London in a 5 star luxury hotel. Immediately on arrival you know you are in safe hands with the polite & respectful uniformed door staff who assist and usher you in. Ironically we did have a problem as our room wasn't ready after the 3pm check in time but I had already been informed we were being upgraded and they provided a voucher for drinks in the bar or Palm Court our choice while we waited (45 minutes) so I'm not complaining as it was handled very professionally & apologetically without inconveniencing us.
The suite was in the Regent Wing which is quite a lengthy complex walk from the main lobby on the other side of the hotel. It is where you'll want to be if the swimming pool or spa are a major attraction for you. It was a beautifully appointed bedroom room, lounge & bathroom & surprisingly quiet & peaceful for central London. 
Our stay was fabulous don't get me wrong but there is a blandness here where everything is perfect & yet nothing stands out as exceptional. For instance out of 11 gins on offer, 9 are all major names available in every supermarket at double figures a pop. The designer toiletries 'Chuan' are all in plain white packaging which is not very inspiring or special. The afternoon tea was lovely and yet nothing stood out as something that would bring you back to do it again.
If you just want 5 star luxury pampering this is it, if you want to be 'wowed' by something special or unusual this unfortunately isn't it as London does have everything, so very vanilla.",5,2019,07,06

140,Perfection,"I recently treated my husband to a night at the Langham to celebrate his 50th birthday. I would like to add that staying at a hotel of this calibre is a one off for us and it took a lot of pennies to be saved in order that we could do so but it was worth every last one. 
We stayed in a standard room but paid the extra for club access. The hotel in itself is absolutely amazing and from the minute you step through the doors, you are made to feel very special. We were taken to a separate check in reception within the club room and were provided with a lovely cold glass of champagne. The club room is beautiful, they have managed to pull off the air of being relaxed but luxurious without the edge of snobbiness. There was afternoon tea and later canapes to enjoy with the free flowing champagne that was handed out by the very attentive staff. We were escorted to our room (843) and were amazed to find that it was a corner room with 5 huge windows overlooking All Souls church outside. It was perfect. We also found a bottle of champagne in the room and a note to my husband wishing him a happy birthday. Both my husband and i have been completely blown away by not only the beautiful surroundings of the Langham but also the service by the staff there. Every single staff member greeted us with a smile and were all very engaging. A special mention to Valerie and Ivan in the club lounge, both were very attentive and it was lovely speaking to them both over the duration of our stay. 
This hotel has really spoilt any other hotel experience for us, and i would urge anyone who has the opportunity to stay there to do so, you will not be disappointed. The Langham has a special place in our hearts, so much so that we have booked up again for one night in January!!",5,2019,07,04
140,Lovely every moment of the stay,"From the moment you arrive s a guest of the Langham, you feel special.  Every staff member is pleasant, impeccably dressed, professional, lovely and simply nice!.  The hotel is very pretty in all public areas as well as the hotel rooms. Excellent restaurant and bar.  We borrowed The Langham bikes one day for a long ride through parks and throughout London on excellent street bike lanes.

London has several five-star hotels - choose carefully.  The Langham is a sure bet every time.",5,2019,07,04
140,Luxury at a great location!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this landmark hotel. The service is impeccable with friendly and knowledgable staff, the beds are super comfortable and the rooms are quiet but the best part was the location! Within walking distance to so much that London has to offer. 
The price was high but not unreasonable and well worth it.",5,2019,07,03
140,Superb,"The Langham is an outstanding hotel. I have enjoyed several stays there & each experience is superb. It’s very conveniently located in central London, has great facilities & the staff are welcoming and professional. 

I look forward to visiting again & would recommend the hotel to family and business travelers.",5,2019,07,03
140,Beautiful afternoon tea,"We visited for a very special afternoon tea and we are so happy we did! Everything about our visit was very special, from the china to the food and the tea, everything was spectacular. Great service and highly recommended.",5,2019,07,02
140,Excellent place,"Nice room, cleaned, quite and perfect reciption. Marco the receptionist is very helpful. We’ve asked for another room with a view and he was very cooperative. Oh yes, perfect breakfast as well. We really enjoyed our stay",5,2019,07,02
140,Excellent Afternoon Tea + Service,"We often go to Artesian for drinks and are accustomed to the excellent service at the Langham so decided to try the Afternoon Tea for my good friends 30th Birthday. As usual, it did disappoint. The selection was beautifully presented with creative twists on classics that were absolutely delicious. The service was exceptional- i'd like to especially thank our hostess Aysha who was welcoming, kind (in spite of our many questions) and refreshingly knowledgeable. She gave us a great table and looked after us brilliantly, as did our waiter. Will definitely return. Thank you",5,2019,07,01
140,Fab Afternoon Tea,"Perfect from start to finish in every way. Delicious afternoon tea. Wide range of drinks and food. Warm atmosphere and beautiful surroundings.  The staff are attentive and welcoming, without being over the top. Like the fact there is a relaxed dress code. ",5,2019,06,29
140,"Warm, caring staff and a fabulous Club Lounge","I spent hours on TripAdvisor researching London hotels and ultimately picked The Langham because it has a great Club Lounge and because travelers' reviews about the service and staff were passionately positive. There seemed to be such a feeling of warmth for the staff. Well, those reviews were right. The room and Club Lounge were great, and everything seemed top-notch and not showing any wear. The staff, though... wow. From the housekeepers to lobby staff, concierge, valet ... everyone had a smile, asked about my day, and consistently offered to help. It felt like I was in someone's home, and as a solo traveler, that feeling of welcome was very nice. I can't wait to return and would especially recommend the hotel to those who may be nervous travelers or on their own. You'll feel comfortable as soon as you get there.",5,2019,06,27
140,Charming luxury hotel in the heart of London,"Our room was ready when we arrived, but the personalized trinkets inside the room (like the letter) were addressed to someone else. Apart from that, I had a lovely one-night stay at The Langham, which is conveniently located almost right next to Oxford street. The room was small but elegant, and had a Victorian charm to it. Bed was crazy soft and comfortable. On my way out, I bumped into a woman and her cute little yorkie in the elevator, and I remember because I was so (pleasantly!) surprised to see dogs on such an elegant property. Apparently, they allow dogs on certain floors.

I also really enjoyed my cocktails & conversation with the bartenders at Artesian, the bar downstairs. I recommend getting a drink there before heading out for dinner!",4,2019,06,25
140,WHAT A WONDERFUL HOTEL ,"Fortunate to have a 3 night stay in a Junior Suite at The Langham.

Gratifyingly glorious, satisfyingly sumptuous and deliciously decadent only scratches the surface when describing this amazing hotel. 

Nothing was too much trouble for the hotels dedicated staff even when our extended family turned up for breakfast the staff in The Club Lounge went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate us and to the manager I would say “Whatever you pay your staff, it’s certainly not enough” from the fantastic guys who operate within Concierge to Servers, Front Desk and Maids all are deserving of praise. 

A simple “Thank You” somehow never seems enough but safe to say our brief stay at The Langham will live long in our memory. 

Thank you.

",5,2019,06,24
140,Perfectly Fine Hotel,"The Langham Hotel itself is an older building, but the rooms were perfectly nice.  Ours was pretty small and, disappointingly, had just one window that faced an ugly interior courtyard, but I’m sure they have exterior-facing rooms, too, if you pay more.  The bed had one of the lumpiest mattresses I’ve ever encountered (my wife liked it, I didn’t).  Staff service was friendly from the bell stand to the front desk.  We never ate in the restaurant, though they promote it as if it’s something special and it may well be.

Located not far from Oxford Circus, there are plenty of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.  O.C. is also a major tube stop and there are plenty of buses going different directions from there, as well.

From the hotel, it’s an easy walk northward up past a few embassies to Regent’s Park (which is one of my favorites), the London Zoo, and (just a little bit farther) Primrose Hill for a nice view looking back at the London skyline. Walk westward about 10 blocks or so and you’ll reach Hyde Park.  The Mayfair area is nearby (southwest) and full of expensive stores if you’re into that.  Soho is east.  You may as well take the tube or a bus if you’re going anywhere else, though London is all quite walkable as long as you have time and an umbrella.

In summary, this was not an inexpensive stay, but a perfectly pleasant one.",5,2019,06,24
140,Afternoon to tea to die for,"Absolutely faultless. Other hotels should have their staff trained here. They are exceptional, attentive without being obsequious, knowledgable and I’ve never felt so welcomed. 
The afternoon tea whilst expensive was truly delicious and we left with boxes as way too much to eat in one sitting. ",5,2019,06,23
140,Perfect in every single way. ,"I stayed at the Langham for a short business trip and I cannot begin to explain how perfect this hotel is. From the location of the hotel, to the service, to the staff, everything and everyone is perfect. Having said that, the most amazing and perfect part of my stay is the club lounge and I would like to discuss this a bit more. The staff in the club lounge are phenomenal and make you feel like you’re family and at home. Cristina is an incredible host, with so much warmth and kindness and always has a wonderful smile on her face. Monica, Zaneta, and Irena are wonderful as well and are so welcoming. The club lounge team have the service figured out so well, it makes you want to keep coming back. If anyone is planning a trip to London, I would highly recommend you book in advance and make sure you get a executive room with club access. It is 10000% worth it and it will be nothing short of a very incredible and memorable stay. 

THANK YOU LANGHAM LONDON!!!! ",5,2019,06,22
140,Langham Visit,"Had an wonderful experience at Langham London. Good location, great customer service , nice people and amenities etc.,  Would love to visit again if I get a chance. Highly recommended , worth for the money",5,2019,06,21
140,Untouchable! ,"Although expensive, The Langham is worth every, single penny. 
Stayed with a friend who’d visited from NYC. 
I cannot stress how helpful the staff are, how excellently decorated or how clean this hotel is - and that’s not to mention the sumptuous beds, well stocked bar and comfy slippers etc etc etc. 
Staying there was an absolute delight! ",5,2019,06,20
140,Our second stay in the Langham Hotel London,"We arrived here around 2pm.
We checked in and were sent to our rooms.
We had two twin rooms booked.
One room was fine on the 4th floor.
The other room was on the second floor.
Our window opened out onto a massive air conditioning system/structure.
I could not believe my eyes or my ears.
How could I even think of relaxing in such a room! 
Such an amazing hotel having such rooms.
Long story short, this was not my idea of staying in the Langham London.
I went back to the reception desk and complained.
I asked for another room. After discussions and a long wait we finally got an alternative room on the 4th floor. The lady at the reception got a bit snippy, even haughty. She could not really understand why I wanted another room.
Hello!!! Sorry!!! Langham Hotel!!!
How can they even offer such rooms to guests.
It is beyond my comprehension.
Anyway, all is well that ends well.
The three days were very pleasant.
Great location. Very clean bedroom. Very efficient service. Excellent food in the restaurants.
But all to be expected at the langham!!!
Just those rooms on the second floor looking out onto this massive air conditioning construction - a nightmare....",4,2019,06,19
140,Elegance and Style ,"What a wonderful great hotel. Everything about this hotel from its location to its magnificent rooms to its wonderful restaurant and the phenomenal wine list, although you would need a kings ransom to afford the Petrus and Romanee Conti makes this place one of our favorites. Preferred this location to that of the Dorchester ad the Park Lane hotels..",5,2019,06,19
140,Faultless,"Perfect overnight stay whilst seeing a show in London, the decor and ambience are beautiful and the food was lovely , but what is even more outstanding are the amazing staff, they are all so friendly and literally go above and beyond , yes it’s expensive but a wonderful treat , thank you Langham and the wonderful people who work there for making our stay perfect . ",5,2019,06,18
140,Birthday surprise,"The Langham is just the perfect place to dine the welcome into the restaurant plus the decor ambiance along with the low key music being played in the background is just perfect 
We were served by an amazing lady who served complimentary starters great presentation with amazing detail.
The main meal particularly the lamb was probably the best lamb I have ever tasted.  Deserts and coffee were superb everything was perfect complimented by a surprise birthday cake. Attention to detail is everything @ the Langham I recommend it",5,2019,06,16
140,Simply Spectacular.  Exceeded all expectations.  ,"I start every review with who I am and my credentials.  I am a 34 year old entrepreneur, lawyer, and financier.  I have been to over 100 countries and stayed in huts, hostels, magnificent estates, and everything in between.  This is brass tax truth.  I don’t try to justify money I have spent by writing a feel good review.  

The Langham is a jewel in London.  Perfectly located right on the border of Mayfair and Marylebone, it is the ideal, and reasonably priced,  location for the finance business oriented traveler to stay.  I might add, however, that is exceedingly pleasant regardless of your planned activity since it is just a short hop to Westminster historical sites as well.  

But once you check into your comfy room, have some tea in the great room, a few drinks at the bar, or at the wigmore nearby...and you may not want to leave the area.  I stayed in an executive king room on the 8th floor which was excellent.  It had everything a business traveler expects and then some.  Fantastically comfortable and spacious.  The Breakfast buffet in the morning is phenomenal.  I especially recommend the whiskey cured salmon

The service at all times, from all departments, was WORLD CLASS.  Special thanks to Brian at concierge for some great restaurant recs.  

My only constructive criticism is REPLACE the key system.  Bad electronic keys are such an easy thing to fix and it is very frustrating when your keys stop working and you have to get new ones.  

The Langham is growing on me as my new favorite chain.  The one in Chicago was spectacular as well.  The flagship here in London better helps me understand why.

Great hotel!  Five stars all around...included for value!  ",5,2019,06,16
140,AWESOME,"We chose The Langham as the starting point of our holiday. It was without doubt a truly 5+star establishment
The service at The Langham is perfect, every staff member that you interact with are friendly with a ‘nothing is too much’ attitude. The consistency of the service at The Langham really does cement it’s place above its London competitors. 
The hotel itself is obviously lovely with delicious food and everything you need in the room. 
Thanks to Mr Stefano (Manager of Palm Court)  for what you ve done for us 

We felt like we belonged there!

Definitely recommend it to anyone and will certainly go back for another visit
Mike and LORIS ",5,2019,06,16
140,Afternoon tea,"Perfection on a plate. The Langham have mastered the portions, flavours and size of the delight afternoon  tea can be when created  with the diners palette in mind. The sandwich’s are plentiful, tasty and a good variety, the sweet delights are delectable, delicate morsels of yummy pastries, finally the scones are soft, warm and bite size portions to finish off the experience. Beautifully designed boxes are available should you have a bite left over and wish to take it home. 
The staff were polite, helpful and always nearby to be of service. 
You will not be disappointed.",5,2019,06,15
140,Beautiful classic London hotel ,"It’s been a few years since I stayed at this classic London hotel, but every time I’ve stayed there the service is impeccable. Every staff  member is focused on providing that special British service, from the doormen in top hats and tails to the front desk staff who are warm and friendly.

I haven’t had tea there but have stayed at the Langham in Hong Kong, and they every detail is focused in. If you can afford it this is an exceptional place to stay. 

(The bar didn’t live up to expectations on my last stay but it’s a beautiful classic London hotel bar and worth a look.)",5,2019,06,15
140,E.Cleary,"We have just spent 7nights at The Langham London for a business / pleasure trip. From the moment of arrival nothing was too much trouble for the Staff. Every single staff member was friendly, polite, intuitive and very very helpful. The room was beautifully appointed and serviced several times a day. This was carried out in the most subtle manner so as not to be an issue for guests. The staff focuses on developing a connection with their guests in order to make every part of our stay as wonderful as possible . The pool and spa facilities are incredible. We dined daily for breakfast at the award winning Roux at the Landau , meals were perfect and service was quick and seamless allowing us to get on with our day. Dining there in the evening was also wonderful. The location of the Langham is perfect but the staff and their expertise most definitely make the experience one that is luxurious and memorable. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,06,14
140,Just as you’d expect from a Langham Hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of staying 4 nights in London at this hotel.  We booked the entry level room and was not disappointed.  We had everything we required, water bottles daily, coffee machine, slippers, robes etc.  This hotel is located perfectly if you like to shop and be within walking distance to all main attractions.  Marylebone is a beautiful area with boutiques cafes in an upscale area, we loved walking around exploring, drinking coffees at various cafes. The Langham Hotel has become a world wide favourite for us and we have never been disappointed.  We will stay there again when we return to London next.  ",5,2019,06,14
140,Luxurious grand hotel,"The Langham London is superb. Wonderful position. The staff make you feel very welcome. The Executive Room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable, ensuring a good night’s sleep. The marble bathroom excellent with separate shower and bath. The staff at the Langham club were wonderful. The breakfast perfect, as were afternoon teas and evening hors d'oeuvres. It is nice to see that the grand historic Langham has been so beautiful restored and now provides luxurious accommodation and service to its guests.",5,2019,06,14
140,Beautiful property,"We were very impressed with this wonderful hotel on our recent trip to London.  We were upgraded to a larger, more spacious room---huge by European standards.  The club level is well worth the extra money as the breakfast, afternoon tea, hors doevers and drinks for cocktail hour and dessert and cordials are all included.  Plus, the staff are so incredibly helpful with suggestions for shopping, dinners, etc.  They are all trained to the highest standard.  We will definitely stay here in the future.",5,2019,06,11
140,Lovely stay,"Took my team here for afternoon tea to celebrate the end of a major project and then I stayed overnight. i have reduced mobility at the moment so wanted a room with a walk in shower (rather than a shower over bath). The reception staff could not have been more helpful and eventually assigned me a fully accessible room which was great. Tea was fantastic - the palm Court staff looked after us all magnificently and my overnight stay was a joy. Lovely hotel, lovely staff, lovely food and drink - couldn't fault it.",5,2019,06,11
140,Beautiful hotel with amazing decoration,"The hotel has an amazing location especially when you need to go on foot at places near this area. The building and the decoration is beautiful, I think I can still smell the perfume or roses all around the property. The only minor is the front desk agents and the waiters at the breakfast. Front desk should be more attentive to guests needs and for sure quicker, took them 30 minutes and 3 phone calls  to collect my bags for a room change. The breakfast waiters should be a little more friendly, and to be able to explain better to the guests how they can order. Overall was a very good experience and probably we would choose to come back.",5,2019,06,09
140,Family Weekend Visit ,"This weekend marked our seventieth stay at the Langham Hotel as a family. 

I could write endlessly about my experience at the Langham on a personal and business basis. 
 
Suffice it to say it is simply the finest hotel myself, my family and other business colleagues have frequented in London. 

The location, quality of rooms, restaurants, ambience, service and the demeanour, approach and attention to detail of the entire staff, not just to us but everyone, puts the Langham in its own league of excellence. 

Whether for business or pleasure you cannot pick a finer hotel in London for your stay.

140,Great Stay in London,Had a pretty much near prefect holiday in London and my accommodations at the Langham added to my enjoyable experience. Highly recommend for a luxury top hotel.  Was named one of London's top hotel by Forbes Magazine so I appreciated what I figured  would be an unbiased review.  The Langham lived up to all expectations,5,2019,06,07
140,Can't wait to go back.,"Choosing a hotel in London is complicated. It's a big town and you'd like to stay where you intend to play because walking is out of the question, and taking taxis (or the Underground) is time consuming and boring. On the other hand, staying in the middle of all the action can be overwhelming- noisy and agitating. Your answer is the Langham. Accessible to shopping, the Theatre district, great museums, outstanding restaurants, and yet the street outside your window could likely be empty after nine o'clock. Great restaurent, a lively bar with interesting menu, and staff that knows how to make you relax and feel at home without being intrusive. We stayed at the club level and enjoyed an extra touch of service and relaxation. Highly recommend it.",5,2019,06,05
140,Exceeded all expectations,"A wonderful, wonderful stay - everything was perfect - the check-in, the room, housekeeping, the location, the cocktails, the spa. We could not have anticipated such a great experience - the attention detail was phenomenal. We cannot wait to go back!",5,2019,06,04
140,An amazing experience at The Langham,"My wife and I booked the Langham on a whim. We expected it would be great but really had no idea just how wonderful it would be. 10 days later and we are still talking about it and figuring out how we get that signature Langham scent for our apartment! We added the club lounge to our booking and am very glad we did - it's an unparalleled experience (at least for me!). As others have said - totally unpretentious, just the best kind of attentive service. The staff are helpful, warm, charismatic but also very discrete and professional. Special mention in this regard to Cyndy Apalisok at the Lounge who was absolutely fantastic.",5,2019,06,03
140,Perfect,"Can’t fault this place at all. Very much as good as the HK version. Exceptional front desk service (early check in too) and without boring you with specifics; solved an absurd problem discreetly for us (thank you Raquel!).

Our room was in the newer wing; very clean and well appointed. Very quiet. Comfortable bed. Nice touches like the valet tray placed by the bed. 

All the staff (Palm Court, Bar and Lobby) were polite and helpful. 

Location is to the north of Oxford Street, so a little away from the shopping and touristy hotspots but still an easy walk or cab ride to most things. Missed out on the Spa...so next time.",5,2019,06,02
140,Langham - That Little bit of Luxury,"We have had three overnight stays at the Langham and each one has made us feel very special. The staff cannot do enough for us to ensure we have the perfect stay. From the minute we arrive, we experience a luxury that takes us away from normality for a few hours.",5,2019,06,01
140,Exceptional Hotel and service.,"This hotel is exceptional in all levels. Location was great. Lounges were fantastic. All details were on point. Bed was fantastic after a long day of walking and touring. 

Staff were courteous and detailed. 

In room products were exceptional. ",5,2019,05,30

140,Langham London,"We have just spent ten days at the wonderful London Langham Hotel. We paid the extra & enjoyed access to the Executive Lounge which was a real treat! The staff there (we presume) are hand-picked by management because without exception they were all fantastic! While our room & the hotel facilities are all five star, it is the staff at this hotel that make it stand out from other 5 star establishments. They are welcoming, friendly & professional. They go out of their way to ensure you’re having a great time & that all your needs are met. We are already looking forward to a return visit!",5,2019,05,27

140,Average with poor breakfast,"It was nice but when you are spending this sort of money there are other hotels to look at. After the Tv documentary, we were excited to visit. But I think you have to be rockstar famous to be appreciated.   Breakfast was poor, (Bad B&B) limited choice and hot food was warm. Staff at breakfast not interested, had to chase for service. Breakfast buffet was cleared away while we were eating, so couldn't go back for extras.  As a five star hotel it was OK, clean, shiny, but won't be back. ",3,2019,05,25
140,"Still my fav hotel, anywhere","we last stayed here in 2014.  were not disappointed to stay here again.  the service as you would expect is warm, friendly and swift, the decor wonderful and facilities superb.  The rooms are a good size (we had the Superior - which despite its name is the standard) with all of the in room options you'd expect of a hotel at this level, and we made use of them.  you come to expect free coffee, but no instant rubbish here; Nespresso with a choice of 3 (or 2 real ones if you discount decaf) flavours and 2 pods per, refreshed twice a day.  The housekeeping is superb, once in the morning and again in the when turning down the room in the evening.  Every thing is cleaned tidied and folded.  Then you have the beds.  Be warned DO NOT lay down on the beds if you plan to go out after, you will not want to get up.  The beds in this hotel are superb to the point that you just do not want to get up. they do however leave me disappointed that having just spent a few thousand pounds on a new mattress at home a hotel bed is more comfy.  Good work, The Langham.",5,2019,05,25
140,A Great Experience,"There is little to criticize with this hotel - great staff, wonderful rooms and excellent food. Highly recommended. In particular the Roux restaurant, where the food really does live up to Roux's reputation.",5,2019,05,24
140,Must stay if u wish to experience one of the best Hospatility ,"Established in 1865 and still maintains the legacy of the great Hospatility and warmth.

The Club Lounge sets the standard for other hotels - top notch facilities, service and through-the-day food for all tastes - a blissful oasis of calm and charm for busy travellers.",5,2019,05,23
140,Afternoon Tea in the Palm Court,"My daughter and I love an afternoon tea & have been lucky enough to visit some of the amazing 5* London hotels. This one comes in our top 3! We had cocktails in the Artizan Bar first, and were then escorted to find our table in the Palm Court. The service was exactly what you would expect and more. Our waiter Max deserves a mention, he was the difference between a good afternoon tea and an exceptional one. The sandwiches, tea & cakes are obviously important, but the service is what makes it a 5* experience. We thoroughly enjoyed the decor, pianist, waiters & waitresses (the female uniforms are so pretty & timeless!), along with the divine sandwiches, scones, cakes & tea; all refillable if you have room! We had to box up a few of our cakes & were very happy with our lovely pink Langham paper bag!! Thank you all, it’s no wonder you won your accolade in 2018! ",5,2019,05,22
140,We’ve been staying here frequently for a decade for good reason.,"This is a welcoming hotel with attentive staff. It feels like a home from home. The rooms are sumptuous and the food is great. We do the executive lounge which is good value for money; including breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner canapés. I like to help myself to the buffet. There are very friendly wait staff who also bring à la carte. The atmosphere is conducive for sitting and working or for catching up with friends. We are very well looked after by the senior butler Cristina Puca. We have been lucky a few times with complimentary upgrades to suites that feel very luxurious. We have been coming to The Langham since 2009 and highly recommend it to couples, singles and business travellers.",5,2019,05,22
140,Top class service in complete luxury,This was our third stay here and we are always impressed with the welcome we receive and the personal attention to our requirements. Every member of staff gives impeccable service and the attention to detail is marvellous.  We especially like the Langham club which gives guests an oasis of calm a stone’s throw from Oxford Circus,5,2019,05,22
140,Trip of a life time at the Langham,"I took my step daughter to London for the first time for her college graduation.  I had several reservations at competing hotels in the area but at the end chose the Langham and I am so happy I did!  The location and beauty of the property stand on its own but importantly, the staff and the experience really made it the trip of a life time for my step daughter.  I know she will never forget it and I will cherish how overwhelmed with joy she was during our stay.  Thank you to the Langham!",5,2019,05,21
140,Excellent stay,"Stayed here with my significant other for 2 nights. Nothing to complain here, will likely be my new “go to” hotel when in London: very nice property, very friendly staff, nice rooms, quiet, good location walking distance to oxford circus and many restaurants in Soho, Mayfair as well as Marleybone. Close to Regent’s Park which is beautiful.

That said, depending on what you are planning to do while in London the location might be sub-optimal, but of course, given the vast area of London, that is the case for every London hotel.

Already booked our next stay here again so will definitely be back.",5,2019,05,20
140,Wonderful Service,"I am a very frequent visitor to London but have never stayed at the Langham, typically opting for hotels more centrally located to Mayfair.  This current stay, however, has made me a convert, particularly because the service has really been a cut above what I experience at most other high-end London hotels - it really seems as though the staff enjoys working in hospitality.  They've made a sufficient impact on my stay that I just cancelled a different booking for a return trip and re-booked at the Langham.",5,2019,05,20
140,The best hotel in London,"The is hotel has no flaws. Best quality, location, employees, best value for the money and just a GREAT experience. Highly recommend. The best bathrooms of any hotel I have visited. Magnificent building inside and out.",5,2019,05,20
140,Beautiful!,"Stayed here last night for my husband’s birthday - wow!
The staff and service are amazing! So friendly and make your stay feel really special! Beautiful hotel and rooms and it’s hard to believe you are a few minutes walk from Oxford Street as the rooms are so quiet.
The staff bend over backward to welcome you, fantastic! Worth every penny! 
The Wigmore Pub that is attached to the hotel is highly recommended too with lovely staff.",5,2019,05,19
140,60th birthday surprise,"We have just stayed here for 2 nights for my 60th birthday and it was superb. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi - Danny the doorman greeted us friendly and warm and took our bags. Love the professional and friendly staff. Lovely warm,charming hotel. Excellent facilities. Surprise birthday cake in the room upon arrival. Superior room was well worth the £500 per night. Great bar and restaurant and the wigmoore pub next door were we watched the f a cup. Great toiletries and little gifts. Will definitely return. We adored the big photo books and all the beautiful flowers in reception .",5,2019,05,19
140,Exceptional - as always!,"The service at The Langham is perfect, every staff member that you interact with are friendly with a ‘nothing is too much’ attitude. The consistency of the service at The Langham really does cement it’s place above its London competitors. 
The hotel itself is obviously lovely with delicious food and everything you need in the room. 
Thank you, Mr Khan.",5,2019,05,18
140,What an experience,"From the time I arrived until I left I felt special. The rooms, food, amenities and service is just amazing. When you are in London definitely a place to stay. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are very spacious. This is a exception for London Centre. ",5,2019,05,17
140,Birthday treat for my daughter,"My daughter enjoyed her birthday treat immensely  Best present ever. Staff, room and facilities were excellent. 

We felt like we belonged there!

Definitely recommend it to anyone and will certainly go back for another visit!",5,2019,05,16
140,First class Hotel,"We chose The Langham as the starting point of our holiday. It was without doubt a truly 5+star establishment.
All the staff were welcoming and the room was to die for, it was absolutely spectacular.
The hotel is perfectly place to enable a wander to shopping and dining precincts.
If you want to treat yourself to real luxury then this is the hotel for you.",5,2019,05,15
140,Best stay ever in London,"Prefect will be the best way to describe our 4 days at the Langham London.
From the reception to the rooms facilities,providing you all you need especial with the Nespreso cafe machine and an excellent bed, the food and the excellent breakfast and the 100% services that all the staff of the hotel provide.
We had the impression we are the most important guest of the hotel, great services and great location too 
Highly recommendat",5,2019,05,13
140,Edyta Beharry,We spend one night for my Birthday....My partner book me this lovely hotel...was the best time and Ivan look after us perfect. Monika make us stay extra longa to be more happy. Thanks a lot to everyone ... One the best hotel in UK....My Birthday was so special...Edyta and Tony,5,2019,05,12
140,Excellent executive lounge,"We stayed here at a weekend whilst my daughter attended an event. I'm not into shopping despite the location being right next to Oxford street and wanted somewhere with a good executive lounge to while away some time - I wasn't disappointed! The staff in the lounge were excellent, and there were plenty of them. I didn't have to wait for anything and my glass was topped up with Champagne (Perrier-Jouet) seemingly continuously. Breakfast was superb, as was the afternoon tea and evening canapes / bar service. It's not cheap, but the lounge makes the extra for an executive room worthwhile. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The only thing I would have liked better is a better pool - going for a swim in the pool is somewhat perfunctory rather than pleasurable, though it is warm. Still, not that many hotels in London have one at all.",5,2019,05,11
140,"5 Star Service, 5 Star Accommodations ","From the moment our cabby arrived from Paddington station to the hotel, the bellmen and reception staff were welcoming, warm, and exhibited the highest caliber of professionalism. 

(Note- We splurged for Club Floor access - and if you can afford it, you WILL NOT be disappointed)

From the check-in desk we were quickly escorted by a staff member, Laura, who made sure to give us a private check-in through the Langham Club. Impeccably decorated with fresh flowers in its entryway, we were directed by Ani who helped us with all of our check-in needs, including a refreshing, cold glass of champagne for each of us. Cheers to a great start! 

We were escorted to our room by Ani who showed us the room’s amenities. She even helped get me change for 100 pounds from reception so I wouldn’t have to make the trip myself. 

The room was amazing, expertly designed with impeccable taste. The king bed was perfectly dressed with a beautiful wood desk directly across and an adjustable big-screen TV with any channel you might need. 

Every single detail of the room was meant to impress and provide any comfort of home. Including the host options for power outlets in case you forgot an adapter. 

Room service, cleaning service, etc were top notch and unbelievably quick. 

Kieran overheard (in a completely respectful way) that we were interested in a late checkout, and took it upon himself to update our room details on his own. Very helpful. 

Irena, Pietro, and Vitalis made brunch, canapés, and afternoon tea (all included with the club floor access) memorable. They would do all they could to serve any need or request, including making dinner reservations for us at Palm Court the very same night we requested it. And all requests (big or small) were met with a warm smile. 

I would undoubtedly recommend The Langham London as the best hotel in the city, possibly in any major city I’ve visited. ",5,2019,05,10
140,Best hotel in London,"Best of the best hotels there is and Kieren is absolutely bloody amazing !! All the restaurants along with the pub and cocktail bar are truly special places. The employees are top of the tops ... honestly I’ve stayed in The Langham in London repeatedly, never a bad stay. ENJOY !!",5,2019,05,10
140,Amazing,"Such a beautiful place nothing to much trouble.
Hospitality amazing even the door men were Fantastic and very helpful.
Janet in club was brilliant.
Food in the Le roux was beautiful and the staff were brilliant.",5,2019,05,10
140,Service and comfort to a new level,"I was visiting The Langham on Regent Street in London with my family staying four nights. This time I booked an executive room with access to the club lounge. I must say that almost Everything was to our satisfaction. The attention to details was impressive. An example was that the bathrobe for our six-year-old daughter fitted perfectly. Beds where very comfortable, food including breakfast was excellent and all staff was very helpful and with no arrogant or bad attitude that is common these days. The only exception was the younger concierge that probably had a bad day.
We used the pool in the lower basement with pleasure. At arrival our room had a faulty air condition. We almost immediately got a new and even better room. The Langham also provided us with a pushchair for our daughter, so we didn’t need to bring our own. Finally, our stay at the Langham was very nice and we will certainly consider returning next time in London. Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,09
140,Afternoon Tea in the Palm Court,"We had a lovely afternoon tea at the Langham. It was set at the same price as almost all other London Afternoon teas. The staff were lovely and we enjoyed the whole experience. Our only comment is being very British but having eaten smart afternoon teas in various places in UK and well known venues abroad we felt this was not 100% traditional. The sandwiches were good and interesting, but the scones were cooked in a mould so were a slightly odd shape and a little fine in terms of crumb. The cakes were not really traditional a little too ' after dinner ' sweets than teatime cakes - very nice but not quite what we would expect.  The food was predominantly served on small plates to you, although there was a  plate stack I think this was a space thing, but not quite the select what you want of a plate experience I think is traditional A nice touch was the small cake to take home in a lovely box - but it was not a great patisserie  experience. As I say staff were wonderful, selection of different teas great and you could have as many sandwiches and as you wanted unlimited ta and you could change blend with the portions. I certainly would not hesitate to say it is a nice place but if you only ever have one afternoon tea this is not as authentic as I expected given they say they started the trend.",4,2019,05,08
140,Never disappoints,"We have stayed here on average about 60 nights over the last 12 months and it has become a home from home for us. We always choose a club room (aka executive room) and the bedrooms are always comfortable and luxurious. For us the draw is the excellent club lounge: staff are always friendly and inviting, and the snacks and drinks are delicious. It’s also a place to have a quiet breakfast as if you were at home. We shall continue to enjoy our regular visits over the coming year too: my only gripe is that in June/ July they are operating a minimum stay of 5 nights to book an executive room which I hope they will review as I suspect it may put people off. Super hotel with super staff. ",5,2019,05,08
140,Pretty in pink,"We all neglect self care and kindness. If you need to be in the capital for business or pleasure, with friends, family or flying solo The Langham will ensure you leave feeling better than when you arrived. ",5,2019,05,06
140,Reviewing Roux only ,"We had a business dinner at the Roux and it was truly outstanding. From the service to the menu choices to the presentation and finally the taste, Roux exceeded my expectations for a upscale hotel standard. It is nicely located in the Langham Hotel and along with the sister cocktail bar, Artesian, are actually the standouts compared to the Langham rooms
",5,2019,05,05
140,"Excellent food and service from waiters, lovely atmosphere","I went with friends yesterday, what amazing food, very well prepared and cooked with lots of flavour. The waiters were attentive and polite and the service was very good, the waiters are lovely. They went out of their way for us, including serving birthday cake at the end and although we booked via a third party they didn't treat us any differently from anyone ordering Ala carte, which was refreshing as this doesn't happen very often. Pleasant music, great decor. I will definitely go again.",5,2019,05,04
140,Truly Exceptional Service with a Warm Heart,"Great service at a 5 star hotel is not unusual, but when that service is delivered by every single member of staff with a genuiness and warmth of heart at every interaction it is memorable.  The Langham is now our preferred hotel in London.",5,2019,05,04
140,Good property for price,"3rd or 4th stay at hotel. Rooms can vary a lot as in most older hotels. However, everything was in good condition and staff was friendly if a little busy. 
Mostly a business hotel form the dress and demeanor in lobby.we preferred to take our breakfasts at Roux as we did not care for the low tables at Palm Court. Had afternoon tea in our roo  one afternoon and it was great. Would not hesitate to return if the price is right.",5,2019,05,02
140,Unrivalled service,"I cannot say enough of good things about this hotel.

From the arrival experience to the welcome's to the checkin experience the food the staff are all fantastic.
The staff are the most approachable hotel staff I have come across, very personal and down to earth.",5,2019,05,02
140,One of the Best In London,Beautifully decorated which is important.  The staff is completely on the ball.  The food is excellent...they just don’t miss a trick.  A little bit like Rodney Dangerfield...they ”don’t get enough respect!!,5,2019,05,01
140,Splendour & Service,"Have recently stayed five nights in a deluxe room at the Regent Wing, which has been completely refurbished, spacious, bright, clean and super comfy, with all amenities in top shape. The Langham is very impressive; the architecture, history, tradition and above all, the staff and the level of service which were far beyond any past experience. Despite its huge premises, the Langham felt like a boutique hotel, where they know your name, and any request or question is attended to immediately, with a smile.

We had enough time to experience the SPA, the Palm Court, Landau restaurant, breakfast and room service. All great ! Excellent location for shops/cafes/restaurants, and a 3-minute walk from Oxford Circus tube station.

Will be happy to return soon :)",5,2019,04,29
140,"Great Location, Great Service, Amazing Building","The hotel is in the perfect location for a London shopping experience.  The architecture and décor is absolutely amazing.  The rooms are large for London and the service is top notch.

A couple of tips:
The buffet breakfast is very limited and not great value
The valet parking take your car to Q-Park Oxford Street which is 200m walk so consider booking this directly",5,2019,04,29
140,Special and perfect,"We stayed at the Langham for 5 days. We booked 3 rooms for the whole family.
Overall - it is perfectly located, only minutes walk from Reagent st., Oxford Circus and the street, yet nestled in a cosy and very quite spot.
We did not have the time to enjoy the full capacity of opportunities the hotel offers , such as the spa, or pool, or even breakfast, as we were more busy touring the costs.
But the overall feeling, kindness and efficiency of the staff and the grandness of the rooms made our stay very pleasant and comfortable.
And even the fact that one of the rooms we reserved was not ready only almost an hour after our arrival (well into the afternoon and past check-in time) was dealt very kindly with the front desk, with immediate free refreshing coffee and cake in the bar, and a full upgrade to all the three rooms as soon as they had the opportunity to do so, two days later .
Thank you Langham for making our stay such a memorable one. ",5,2019,04,27
140,Exceptional stay,"From start to finish our recent stay at the Langham exceeded our expectations. Our room, as well as the public spaces, were beautiful but the truly special feature of this hotel is the staff. The service was simply outstanding. We were fortunate to have reserved a room with club benefits. This is the best club experience that we have encountered at any hotel. We especially appreciated Cristina and Janet at the Club desk, all of the servers in the Club, and Paolo at Palm Court. 

Just one example of the staff going beyond their duties...we checked into the hotel late evening and arrived at the Wigmore for a light dinner at 10pm to find the kitchen had just closed. A kind employee of the Wigmore contacted all the other restaurant venues and learned that the kitchen at Palm Court was still serving. She generously offered to walk us to the restaurant as it requires walking outside the building and we were unfamiliar with the hotel as we had only checked in minutes earlier. Unfortunately I did not get her name but we are so grateful to her for her kindness.

I will be returning to London in a few weeks to visit with my daughter and I have now booked us into the Langham. After this trip there is nowhere else I would want to stay in town, we have been thoroughly spoiled!

140,Langham London Executive Room,"We wanted to do something extra special to celebrate our wedding anniversary and our first trip to London. We reserved an Executive Room with Langham Club Lounge privileges. The Langham London ended up being perfect for what we were looking for. The staff was attentive and helpful. We were concerned about arriving early from Heathrow, but our luggage was whisked away. We had a snack and went exploring, and when we our room was ready, our luggage was there waiting for us. The location was ideal with the Tube near by and landmarks within walking distance. Our room was bright and comfortable for relaxing when we were exhausted from being tourists. The Langham Club Lounge was convenient, not only for the breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and evening canapés, but also for reading an assortment of international newspapers while housekeeping or turndown service were in our room. A wide assortment of amenities (toiletries, postcards, and bookmarks) was useful. A food allergy was readily accommodated. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and look forward to returning!  ",5,2019,04,25
140,The best,"Had a wonderful stay at The Langham London. Great location in Regent Street close the park and Oxford Circus
, beautiful hotel, delightful food and exceptional service all around. especially  from Fadi Samhoun, Director Guest Relations, an absolute gentleman. ",5,2019,04,24
140,Excellent private dining,I've dined @ several hotels in this part of the market over the past couple of years and put the Langham @ number two in my list.  l am always impressed by the discrete service which is of the highest order while the meals are well balanced and hit the spot perfectly.,5,2019,04,24
140,Probably the best hotel I stayed in London,"We travel to London at least 4 times a year and stayed in many, but many hotels. 
This time we decided to try the Langham. What a great decision !!!!
The quality, kindness and professionalism of the service was beyond excellent, the rooms were great and the afternoon tea was also superb.
Most probably the Langham will become our first choice for our next trip to London.
Excellent job in every single respect. what a great hotel
Congratulations",5,2019,04,23
140,Memorable Experience,"My sister and I spent the Easter bank holiday at The Langham Hotel.  From our initial arrival at the door to our departure, the experience was wonderful.  We felt very welcomed, genuinely valued, were looked after impeccably and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

We had the pleasure of using the club lounge where the cocktails and food were a culinary delight, service impeccable and the staff were generous, attentive and friendly.

Our room, one bedroom suite, was absolutely beautiful.  It was elegant, inviting, intoxicating and comfortable.  The attention  to detail such as; the fresh flowers, books and toiletries were a welcome bonus.

The swimming pool was beautiful.  The temperature was warm, the depth was just right for confident swimmers, learners and children and, again, the facilities and toiletries in the spa were excellent.

My sister and I ate in The Roux and Palm Court for dinner.  The service and food in both restaurants was exceptional. I have very specific dietary requirements and the staff in The Roux ensured that I had a bespoke menu to cater to my needs.  I was extremely grateful for their care and consideration.  I had plenty of choice and the food was truly exceptional.",5,2019,04,23
140,Wonderful stay,"From the moment you step in the hotel, you just feel like being spoiled because all the staffs providing excellent customer service. The location is good that walking distance to Regent Park, shopping area, and 4 mins walk to Oxford Circus station. 
Definitely my first choice to stay if coming back to London. 

Thanks to the Langham team to make our trip unforgettable. ",5,2019,04,22
140,Superb as usual!,"Just got home after a two night stay at the fabulous Langham Hotel, London. We return every year to celebrate our Civil Partnership anniversary (2012). This was the seventh anniversary and from the champagne and cake in the room to welcome us back, through to our departure this morning, the Hotel and staff were superb!. This Hotel is sophisticated elegance but without the stuffiness and pretention of similar standard hotels in London. The front desk staff (Rodrigo and team, as well as Alfonso) were charming and quick to check us in, even giving us a small gift for the occasion.  We had dinner at the Roux Landau restaurant on the Saturday evening - the tasting menu and wine pairing were exceptional, every course and each glass of wine divine. Breakfast at the Hotel has everything you could possibly want.  We used the swimming pool on this visit and it was a great way to unwind having walked miles around London on the Sunday.

I cannot say enough good things about this Hotel and its staff. It is truly our favourite Hotel in London and I know that we will be coming back year on year.",5,2019,04,22
140,Palm Court - Easter Weekend Afternoon Tea,"This was the first time we have visited for afternoon tea. The experience was very enjoyable, however we did have to pay extra due to Easter Weekend (we were informed of this prior to arrival). 

The tea was served in Palm Court which was a beautiful room. I particulary enjoyed the live pianist, very relaxing. Service was excellent. The sandwiches were tasty (option to have more after first serving), some of the cakes we liked more than others. Scones, clotted cream and jams were satisfactory.

Great selection of teas and you can try as many as you like. 

You are provided with a lovely pink Langham bag to take home with any leftovers. 

",5,2019,04,22
140,Langham,"Our stay at Langham April 2019. 
Fantastic Hotel we had a superior twin room whilst a little small had all the amenities anyone could ask for we had a great weekend. A big thank you to all the staff nothing was to much trouble. The location of the hotel was perfect for all our needs. ",5,2019,04,22
140,Sure to impress,"Excellent place to stay in central london.
Caring at a cost of course
Breakfast menu needs to be upgraded to reflect guest ethnicity and choices
You may feel underwhelmed if you are travelling from Asian region and have Expereince of 5 stars. Of course the standard are keeping with high cost and low care western world but that’s a different story..
All level staff highly trained and professional
Came across a hotel after a long time which doesn’t dictate how many towels to use to save environment.",4,2019,04,20
140,I wish there were more than 5 stars to give,"I had expected a good service with the location and cost of this hotel, but my stay was more than I could have hoped for. Totally beyond expectations. 

Everything about this hotel makes you feel special, important and comfortable. Check in was fast and pleasant, with the staff taking extra care to point out the facilities and hotel details. The room was larger than expected for a standard room, and the bathroom was luxurious, with heated floor tiles and excellent water pressure. 

We went for pre-dinner drinks in Artesan, which was relaxing and comfortable. The staff were quick to respond, service was fast, and the snack and drink quality and variety was amazing. 

Breakfast in Roux At The Landau was another level altogether, and I won’t be forgetting it any time soon. 

I hope to stay at The Langham every time I’m in London, but if that was my only opportunity then I will be satisfied with a fantastic stay. ",5,2019,04,19
140,Everything you want in a hotel,"Very nice and comfortable , staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Room was very nice and big. Value for the money And location is great .

140,My lost bag,"The first day here after a tough 8 weeks in Egypt I lost my backpack. My passport, my cash and my life.... this hotel is not only a great hotel, but when a guest is in dire straights the whole hotel rallies around. 

I heard “have we gotten the bag back?” From bellman, bartenders, concierge staff and front desk staff.... I’m serious these people didn’t know me but cared about me. 

On the hotel side, it’s all 5 stars. Beds, bath, amenities, location, food and bar. The greatest. And the staff? Wondrous. 

I sadly had moved hotels as my bag was returned after I got an emergency passport. But the care I received will be with me forever. Thank you all!!!",5,2019,04,18
140,Afternoon tea,Well I booked this in the back of watching Nigel Havers doing a review of the Langham hotel and it stated that this was the first hotel to do afternoon tea so I booked this for my friends birthday... One thing make sure you do not eat prior as this is the first afternoon tea I've been too with my husband and friends where they have been so full when leaving..lol.. the sandwiches were plentiful and they will keep coming until you have had enough then we had a choice from the menu as we had booked high tea of a few options of which we had chosen the Brie quiche and OMG it was amazing Tea is plentiful and served on and in wedge wood China ...we also had a glass of champagne then came the sweet stuff which in miniature in size are very filling and of exceptional tastes for everyone's choice we hadn't even got to the scones 🙈.. so the service is impeccable and they even give you a stool for your bag to sit on next to you and staff are very attentive and informative of the items they are putting in front of you the ambience is very cozy and comfortable and in good taste . Once you can't eat no more they then come over and box up any scones or pastries that you would like to take and put them in there signature pink bag for you to take home also with a surprise chocolate cake inside boxed 🍰I woul definitely recommend The Langham Hotel as one of the best Afternoon Teas I have ever had and I have been to a lot of hotels well done you made my friends day with the personal birthday cake too,5,2019,04,15
140,our favorite in London,"We've been here three times. The experience has been great as always. Check-in is efficient. Room is spacious and quiet at sleep time:) Spa is comfortable but remember to book several days in advance. Also, the staff are all very friendly and helpful from the doorman, receptionist and butlers. I would particularly thank Ani for assisting us in many aspects during our stay. oh and the location is the best!!
I will always choose Langham every time I am back in London.
Executive room or above would be better when making the reservation",5,2019,04,15
140,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Went here with a Travelzoo afternoon tea voucher and had a really lovely time. Were treated really well, exceptional service and really nice food. I would definitely recommend and am hoping to return here for dinner at some point soon.",5,2019,04,15

140,The Langham - London,I recently spent two nights at The Langham in London with my wife and son. I have to say everything about the place was superb. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and the various restaurants and bars catered for our every need. I would also strongly recommend the Executive Club,5,2019,04,13
140,"Very warm stuffs, very good breakfast ","This is the third time I stay in Langham. Staffs are so nice and welcome, Breakfast is very tasty.

However, Gym is a little bit far away and difficult to find.( I stay at the old building this time).

I will definitely come back again.",4,2019,04,13
140,Afternoon Tea- like a fairytale!,"Me and my family went for a lovely afternoon tea at the Langham Hotel. The food was exquisite and so was the decor, the service was AMAZING! we were constantly being attended to and never left hungry! The was a fabulous selection of teas and cocktails, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic! We had a lovely time!",5,2019,04,12
140,Bad start but ended being a great stay,"I stayed here for 3 nights and one of this nights was my birthday. My first night was horrible. I had told them two weeks prior to arrival that it was my birthday and I would like a room with a nice view. I arrived late at about 8pm due to my flight arrival. I checked in and was allocated a room which had a strong cigarette smell. The staff member that had shown me to my room said let’s allocate you a new room. I said yes definitely. She was amazingly helpful. The next room I was allocated had the worst view you could think, chewing gum attached to the bathroom mirror. Plus dust everywhere. I called asking for a new room with at least a better view as it’s my birthday and they were informed of this 2 weeks ago and they said for my room category the hotel was booked out and I could take the cigarette room. No way was I going to take that. For a non-smoker who gets asthma from smoke no way would I be able to be in that room. The next morning I called very angry I asked for a new room, I told them that I’ve had a horrible experience and it’s my birthday. I asked for an upgrade, they called me back within minutes and gave me an upgrade to an executive room. It’s an amazing room. 
The service going forward was amazing. If you can afford it go for an executive room. It’s great. Large and very comfortable. So 1 night wan not good and the remaining 2 were amazing. The first 2 photos are if the horrible room. The rest are of my executive room.",4,2019,04,11
140,Posh hotel poor service,"They charged us twice for the room. Once prepaid then duplicated the payment on arrival when they should have only been taking a damages refundable deposit. They also charged us for breakfast on checkin and then again duplicated this payment. All in all £420 down with no such apology, just a statement of we will refund in 3 working days. Had we have not noticed would they just have taken the money and not told anyone? This was a birthday surprise turned nightmare!",1,2019,04,10
140,5 star service,If you are looking to be pampered and your every need met even before you knew you needed something then the Langham is the place for you.  Rooms are well appointed and exceptionally quiet.  Staff is by far the best that I have ever experienced.  I don't know if it is the the politeness of the British on top of all of the amenities that made this a brilliant stay for us!  By far the best experience we have ever had in a hotel.,5,2019,04,09
140,Amazing experience ,"We were fortunate enough to stay here for four nights. The staff was exceptional. Everyone was smiling, polite, and accommodating. The executive lounge was beyond anything I have experienced. The servers and other staff made sure you had anything you asked of them. The suggestions by the staff for activities and restaurants were right on point. The location is fabulous. Easy walk to the tube or bus stops. Could not be happier with our stay!",5,2019,04,08
140,Don't hesitate to book the Langham London,"Top notch accommodations and Service, location is the best you can walk to a myriad of shops, eateries, bars, museums, parks, you name it. It's a beautiful hotel also close to Buckingham Palace, and Big Ben.",5,2019,04,08
140,Lovely weekend stay,"Beautiful hotel just off the centre of commerce in London. Yet the area around feels calm and spacious. Lovely greeting at reception. Straight forward check-in. Room was spacious, clean and luxurious. Best cocktail bar I've been to was at Artesian. Afternoon tea at Palm Court was delicious and we were given all the time to indulge. Check-out was simple and porters fetched our bags.",5,2019,04,08
140,English Hospitality!,"We stayed this past week at the Langham Hotel in London and found it to be an extremely top notch facility in every way. Their attention to the finest detail is outstanding as is their housekeeping staff and serving staff in the restaurants. After long days walking through London seeing the sites, the bed was luxurious and inviting. We slept like rocks, literally! The Club Lounge was also fantastic and the serving staff was the most polite and accommodating in my experience. When in London again we shall make a point of staying at the Langham.",5,2019,04,08
140,BEST STAY EVER!,"The staff at the Langham, London goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is a pleasant one.  They have exceeded my expectations. When I needed more towels, coffee, water, a new TV remote- all were immediately brought up. Even a large room service order was only 30 min to get to us. In our private club area, they were attentive for breakfast, and snacks even remembering my choice of coffee and wine. Check in staff noticed on our passports that we were celebrating a 10th birthday and my son was surprised with a cake and card, Great moment for him.  Best Hotel Stay ever.",5,2019,04,08
140,Amazing,"I stayed for one night with my wife to celebrate a birthday. What an amazing hotel in a fantastic location.
The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from oxford street tube station and directly opposite the bbc. 

All of the staff were so attentive and couldn’t do enough for us. The staff made us feel so relaxed and didn’t make us feel inferior as we weren’t as posh as some of there usual customers.

Breakfast in palm court restaurant is £28pp if reserved the night before (£38pp on the day). However for this you get a very fine luxury buffet selection. 

Is this hotel 4 times better than a premier inn as the price suggests? No, however it is amazing! if cost is no object it is a real treat and worth every penny! 

Thank you",5,2019,04,07
140,An excellent Awards do,"They hosted an awards do I was attending and as a treat we stayed there. The room was lovely if not fairly tricky to find in a maze of corridors, I suppose that’s fairly standard for a large hotel.
The bed is always a sticking point but this was one of the best. The event itself was held in a lovely split level room, the canapés and drinks reception was hosted by nice friendly staff. On checkout my wife mentioned how nice the pens were (pink gilded) and was promptly given a few, a lovely touch.",5,2019,04,07
140,Langham London,My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Langham. It was our first time but felt right at home. Everyone was exceptionally helpful and kind! Anything we needed was at our finger tips. The pool and spa were very nice. The restaurants were fantastic. Another thing was the location...it was amazing. In the middle of everything. Also there were so many beautiful roses that it actually made the hotel smell like a garden in spring. Loved it here. Would highly recommend it!,5,2019,04,06
140,Always great to be here,"I love Langham hotel, stayed here few times and have never been disappointed.
Just the beds are not sooo comfortable but everything else is just amazing.
However every time I asked them about a better bed they changed it for me straight away.
Great job Langham team!",5,2019,04,06
140,Afternoon Tea,"An amazing afternoon tea for Mother’s Day with my daughter, plentiful sandwiches scones and cakes, which were replenished without delay.
Staff are above and beyond the most attentive and polite I have experienced after many afternoon teas in various establishments. On par with, or even better than the Ritz!!
The atmosphere is wonderful and very grand and even had little tables for your handbag!!!!
I would highly recommend and will definitely be returning as soon as I can!
Thank you to The Langham and their wonderful staff !!",5,2019,04,01
140,Mothering Sunday afternoon tea,"My daughter took us for afternoon tea to celebrate Mothering Sunday (her first after having a daughter last year) and to celebrate her sisters and dads birthday . It was a lovely gift. The room was beautiful, the staff looked after us so well. The afternoon was fantastic (love the Langham celebration tea ) the food was delicious and presented so beautifully, and  we were presented with a lovely gift upon leaving. A Mothering Sunday we will never forget",5,2019,03,31
140,Classic luxury,"Beauty abounds in the architecture in London wherever you look. The Langham London is a magnificent example and centrally located near Fitzrovia and Marylebone. And yet there is no stuffiness, warmth and hospitality exudes from every staff member. The rooms are beautiful and quiet and every need is met.",5,2019,03,31
140,Pure luxury,My husband and I stayed for two nights in a deluxe room in this beautiful hotel as part of my 60th (ugh!) birthday celebrations and everyone and everything at The Langham made it perfect. The service is second to none. Every possible comfort is provided and there's not a single thing I would change. A huge thank you to each and every member of staff who went out of their way to make our weekend truly memorable.,5,2019,03,25
140,"Afternoon tea with the family, including three generations","Lovely afternoon tea to celebrate one year olds first birthday. Overall the experience was relaxed, welcoming and tasty. The sandwiches were delicious especially the chicken, which was enjoyed by all from one year old to seventy (+) year olds. The scones were fabulous and warm, we had mixed opinions on the jams. By the time the patisseries arrived we were all very full, which may have hampered our final delights. We found that the cakes looked good but were not up to the same standard as the sandwiches or scones. They tasted a little bland and the same. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful and we had a great spot in the Palm Court. I would recommend this place as child friendly and relaxed, however if I were going for afternoon tea without children I would prefer the Ritz afternoon tea. Which seems a bit more special, with there strict dress code, atmosphere and I can't fault the Ritz on their food. Although the dress code for The Langham is smart casual, we saw people in trainers, casual jeans and t-shirts, which for me reduces the special vibe of going for afternoon tea in a top London hotel.",4,2019,03,23
140,Exceptional service and experience!,"I felt compelled to write a review to compliment the staff of The Langham London where my family stayed for four days over spring break.  Specifically wanted to thank Lourdes who emailed me in advance of arrival to ask for my kids ages and arranged an little treat for them in the room upon arrival...it made their day!  Many other little things but want to mention the Artesian bar in the hotel which was absolutely amazing from the service, to the atmosphere and most importantly drinks which are based on a truly innovative premise.  Also the breakfast brunch is awesome.  Up till last week I would have said the the Chicago Langham is the best but I’m not so sure about that anymore.  You will not regret a stay at this hotel.",5,2019,03,23
140,London in Style,"I have stayed here before but it is worth another review as it continues to set a standard far above other hotels that claim to be 5 stars. The location is excellent and a short walk to the intersection of Regent Street and Oxford Street so a Shopping Heaven! From there it's an easy stroll into SOHO and down trendy Carnaby Street into the West End for a Show! We saw Les Miserables, which was an incredible performance and well worth the night out!",5,2019,03,21
140,A home away from home,"I stayed at the Langham for one night each on 2 separate occasions 2 weeks apart. On my return the 2nd time, everyone greeted me by name, and seemed genuinely pleased to see me again. My flight arrived at 0630am and I had requested an early check-in prior to a midday appointment... I got an email confirming that won’t be a problem, and true to their word, my room was ready when I arrived at 0800hrs. 
Interestingly, they remembered everything i liked from my previous visit. The ambience of the hotel is luxurious but relaxed. Every nook and cranny is spotlessly clean. The decor is modern in a classic, timeless way. The room temperature was cool just the way I like it, the bed was comfortable with cool, cotton bed linen that drapes and hugs like a warm, snug cuddle. The shower water pressure was excellently massaging. I had welcoming sparkling water with the most appetising bite sized desserts. I didn’t feel like going out to dinner in the evening, but wanted some Chinese; Daniel the Concierge on duty recommended a place he knew, he took my order, and though the place didn’t do deliveries, he sent a porter to pick up my dinner and had it sent up to me as inroom dining. Breakfast is a lovely spread and again, the server remembered I liked hot chocolate and freshly squeezed juice( 2 weeks later... how is that possible???)
I can’t not mention Faisal by name... and Barak the doorman... everyone discreetly but lovingly and efficiently worked seamlessly to pamper and spoil me. From check-in to check-out, it was perfect hospitality at its best. I’ll be back. I feel I have a London family who’ve adopted me as their own...",5,2019,03,19
140,Amazing Stay,"Centrally located, walking distance to Oxford Street , friendly , efficient, attentive staff, Comfortable bed, A great dining experience place. Have not visited Chuan Spa but have heard many great things.",5,2019,03,19
140,Excellence throughout every fibre of this hotel -,"The Langham, London, is entirely deserving of the word 'excellence'. The team, their diligence and attitude, their attention to every possible detail, their desire to exceed and impart personal service at every juncture. This is an excellent business, achieving a standard by which every other 5-star establishment must be measured. We have stayed with The Langham upon several occasions now, and have previously been 'regulars' at The Savoy, Cafe Royal and Royal Horseguards upon many occasions [each of which has much to commend them] and must underline that The Langham stands several heads and shoulders above them as a genuine comprehensively 'quality' experience. May I particularly highlight two people, amongst the broad team involved at The Langham who all deserve praise, in particular: Olivia Abba, and Pardeep Gill. Both embody the standards and qualities of the hotel brilliantly. Thank you.",5,2019,03,19
140,Superb. Everything was perfect.,"Superb hotel which is expected at this price point. Excellent location in the heart of London and situated exactly where you want to start exploring the city from, just steps from the tube station. Very comfy beds and luxurious robes. I can't think of one bad thing about this hotel, it was perfection.",5,2019,03,18
140,Always awesome ,"Service bar none, I can never find a thing to criticise, the staff are attentive, professional and friendly. The rooms are beautiful spacious and feel like a home from home. The club is a god send, snacks and drinks to keep going all day. Generally the internal decor and external architecture are exquisite. ",5,2019,03,18
140,Not doing the name justice,"After staying at the Langham in Hong Kong (recent business trip) I decided to treat my partner to a long weekend at the Langham for our anniversary.

We arrived at the hotel shortly after 3pm on Friday (checkin supposedly from 3pm according to their website) and, on hearing that we were visiting for our anniversary we were asked to wait whilst an “upgraded” room was made ready for us. We were taken to the Atrium bar and offered a complementary drink each. After forty minutes, we ordered a second drink and just as we started to enjoy them, our checkin clerk appeared with a “customer relationship manager” in toe to take us to our room. It was now nearly four and we had skipped lunch expecting to have a snack prior to settling into our room. Timing not perfect but OK these things happen. We finished our drinks at our leisure and asked for the bill, the bar tried to charge us for 4 drinks despite being offered a complementary round due to the wait for our room. I pointed out to the barman the situation and after some to-ing and fro-ing to check my story, presented a new bill for only the extra round. 

We were shown to a room which I was surprised to find we had been “upgraded” to, as it was remarkably basic compared to the Langham Hong Kong and we were provided by a somewhat pedantic “tour” of the air conditioning controls, the television and so on. Really nothing in the room that warranted a tour. 

During our stay we discovered our “upgraded” room (182) adjacent to the lift used to gain access to the spa and the Wigmore pub. Whilst you may think this convenient, let me tell you it is anything but. The walls are paper thin so at pub closing time, our sleep was disturbed on both Sunday and Monday mornings at the very small hours by noisy revellers using the lift to gain access to their rooms. Our sleep was again disturbed each morning at the slightly healthier 6/7AM by the gym bunnies heading down for their morning workouts. Coupled with the proximity of the room to the underground line running beneath the hotel, we barely had a solid nights sleep throughout our 3 night stay. I should also mention the view from our upgraded room being the local branch of a well known London sushi bar. I struggle to imagine if this is the standard of “upgrade” what our ~£320/night “basic” (Double Superior) room might’ve been like.

The hotel was clearly busy on Saturday night as our breakfast on Sunday morning at the Landau restaurant (which we were sent to as the Palm buffet was too full) was so delayed that we nearly missed our lunch appointment! My eggs Benedict was cold, the eggs completely solid and my partners omelette was also dry and cold. At least espresso based drinks are available (again, slow and cold on this particular Sunday) unlike the very weak cafetière coffee in the Palm restaurant.

Along with the above we found our bed very soft/tired with a large firm ridge running down the middle, hardly what we had in mind for our anniversary!

A gift of a celebration cake was a nice, unsolicited gesture and one does not like to complain about gifts but to my mind, a small lemon drizzle cake really isn’t something I’d ask for as an anniversary celebration.

I had written these issues down and hoped to speak to someone about them at checking this morning (Monday) but the checkin/out desk was so busy that I conducted the checkout in the middle of the reception room and wasn’t even asked how our stay was by the gentlemen assisting me.

This hotel’s brand, and price bracket, sets an expectation of perfection but unfortunately, the hotel fell far below this on our anniversary. Such a shame as the Hong Kong Langham is much more well equipped with in room technology like airplay TVs, and has a broader range of hot, fresh food available in it’s outstanding restaurants.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the Langham London and we shan’t be returning.

140,Absolutely brilliant!,"Hi all

I've spent a night in this hotel thanks to my boss and I have to say this hotel is just brilliant. The staff were helpful and kind  the breakfast was amazing. It id a very posh and expensive hotel tough but it would worth to try.

140,Satisfied Customer,"The Langham, London!

I keep coming back here ... because of your location, beautiful spaces, rooms and ambience in general. WiFi is perfect everywhere in the hotel👊. 

Your staff are simply out of this world, with their genuine and yet so natural hospitality and warmth, especially Rodrigo at check in 🙌. 

You just blew my mind though, with this incident, amongst several other impeccable customer service. I saw this book☝️that I liked and wanted a personal copy. But it had a note inside that read “Please enjoy this book whilst you are in residence at the hotel. Should you wish to purchase your own copy, this can be purchased from the Reception Desk.”😏. 

So I went downstairs to buy one, and asked them to charge my account for it, and send the book to my room, as I was stepping out of the hotel.

Only to get back to my room to see this lovely note (swipe to read) from Marius Bocys, the ASSISTANT Housekeeping Manager.

Now, note that Marius is ASSISTANT ... not even The Housekeeping Manager). That is proof of a Culture of giving the customer an Unforgettable EXPERIENCE 👌

Thank you.

140,Perfect family trip ❤️,"My husband and I wanted to take our baby on his first trip to London. Arthur was 7 months old and I was still feeding so we wanted a really nice family hotel. 
Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely chap who took us to The Langham Club, my husband had upgraded us when booking, although he didn’t know what this provided! It provides a VIP concierge service, it’s a big lounge with free food and drink throughout the day. The room is stunning and as it was Christmas it was full of Christmas trees! The vibe is really chilled and has lots of natural light which is lovely. When we arrived I needed to give my baby some food, he was new to food at the time and I bought some pouches. The kind staff warmed the pouch and provided relevant cutlery etc! It was quite messy but they were so so helpful. 
My husband had to leave for an hour so I stayed and then we met him for lunch at Claridges. The langham were so helpful in getting us safely back downstairs and into a taxi. 
After lunch we came back to the hotel and got into our room. The room was vast! They had left a gorgeous John Lewis changing mat and all brand new Johnson’s baby products and a gorgeous new Hamley’s Christmas bear for Arthur to take home as a lovely memory. It was all a lovely touch. 
We met our in-laws in the Langham Club and had a few drinks before we said goodbye to them and headed back to the room. We decided to order room service and a film and it was really relaxing. The food was fantastic and housekeeping were so sweet with Arthur. 
The cot they provided was quite small but our boy is very long! 
The beds were comfy and the pillows were top notch! 
The next morning we went to the Palm Court for breakfast. The staff were fantastic in finding us a corner table so I could feed and relax with Arthur. We enjoyed a long leisurely breakfast together. I love breakfast and the omelettes and coffee were spot on. 
Just before we left I needed to feed Arthur and I did so in reception, the concierge came over and offered me some water. I thought this was so kind. Thank you! 
All of the staff at the hotel and in the Langham club were lovely and we cannot wait to return next Christmas for our next family London stay :) 
Thank you Langham for making it so memorable xx",5,2019,03,16
140,Valentine's trip,"we went there for Valentines

room's where amazing

staff really nice 

we were lucky enough to stay in a room that came with the club lounge included - this was well worth it - great setting and we got truly spoilt",5,2019,03,16

140,Old World Charm,"Langham London cannot be faulted. It is understated yet oozes charm and old world style. 

The service is top notch, rooms impeccable with top quality amenities and all the services you could need (24 hour room service, spa, high quality hotel gym etc).

The location is brilliant - very central (I walked to theatres, London Eye, regent and bond streets etc)  yet also in a really quiet location.

Highly recommend a club room (access to executive lounge) makes the world of difference.",5,2019,03,13
140,Amazing stay!,"I've been quite fortunate to have experienced quite a few five-star luxury hotels and resorts in more than thirty countries and the Langham earned a top place on my list. The hotel is beautiful, the location is superb for access and shopping, the spa and nightly swim is amazing but beyond that is the genuine care from each and every member of their staff to create special moments. I was traveling alone with my two children and they surprised them with a few of their favorite things and so many details that would make any young traveler feel special and at home in London from the bathrobes, slippers to the books in the restaurant or even when staff members delighted them with their favorite treats in the club... what can I say besides the Langham is an experience in its own right, a destination within a destination! It's not just a hotel, its an experience! Loved it and can't wait to visit again.",5,2019,03,11
140,Perfect loaction for shopping,"Fantastic service and nice, friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable beds and nice rooms. Great breakfast and good food. Perfect location in the heart of the city. The room service menu is varied and good. The ""gym and the spa/pool"" are are also very nice. We can highly recommend The Langham.",4,2019,03,11
140,The Best location for shopping loved the Club level,"The Langham London is a well known five star hotel in London. I gave it 4 stars because the rooms are a bit smaller than other 5 stars in London and the plugs are old, so using electronics is a problem for 2 Americans with lots of cameras and laptops! The service is top notch and the restaurant is world class. The club lounge is fabulous and well worth it. The best thing about the Langham is the location. Close to the best shopping and walking distance to most major monuments. Christmas shopping is so fun in London! Overall the theme is an experiential. It’s a grand dame of a hotel and a nice visit.",4,2019,03,07
140,Convenient  quiet and great staff,"Just returned from a 3 night stay in london.
Langham accommodated my early arrival , allowing me to get set up before my afternoon business meetings.

Well appointed rooms, solid bed and good air.  

Will make it a point to stay there when I return later this month.",5,2019,03,04

140,Incredible Hotel,"I chose to book a weekend break away for my partners 40th Birthday at the Langham London as we had such a nice experience at the Langham Sydney. 
I didn't think London could top our experience but it was the made extra special by all the fabulous staff and their exceptional customer service.
From the start staff were warm and welcoming and nothing seemed too much for them. We were overwhelmed by the kindness and genuine warmth from ALL the staff at Langham London, from the Doorman who welcomed us into the hotel, the room keepers who tidied and prepared our room beautifully, to the guest service agents and club receptionist / butler.  
I would like to specifically thank Laura Palacio for organising our welcome juice and cake (a lovely touch), but the person who made our time unforgettable was CRISTINA PUCA. She was a delight to interact with from the very start and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and special. It was sad that we only booked 2 nights as we had such a lovely time.

The customer service is the best we have experience and we have stayed in many hotels around the world (Qualia in Australia wasn't a patch on the staff at Langham London).

Highly recommend the one bedroom apartment, we had room, Room 745. 

Thanks for making our stay so special. ",5,2019,02,28

140,Always feel at home @TheLangham,"Once again it was a great experience staying here. Every member of staff, go that extra mile for you.

140,Best 5 star Hotel in London,My Wife and I booked into the Langham Hotel for Valentines day. From the moment we arrived at the entrance we were made to feel welcome. The floral display in reception and the fragrance was incredible. We were escorted to the Club Lounge to check in. The Club Lounge facility is the finest we have experienced and the service sublime. We were offered a glass of champagne before being shown to our complimentary upgraded executive room. We had a wonderful day and evening the whole experience was made so much more due to the attentiveness of the staff. We have stayed in many 5 star Hotels all over the world and the Langham remains our favourite.,5,2019,02,21
140,Fantastic,"We were first shown to room in the main tower and we thought room was small. We were shown same executive room in renovated Regent  wing and with the layout, it was way bigger. Please opt for the breakfast.Its to die for . We still speak about the breakfast  since our departure . We were supposed to stay 5 nights. We cancelled our other hotel and stayed 7 more nights. Location is brilliant as well. Service was A plus plus all around. Only problem, please opt for higher floors in Regent Wing if you are a light sleeper. The train can be heard on lower floor. Lastly, we have seen major gyms with less equipment. This is by far the most equipped Hotel gym we have visited in Europe. We will see you soon. Bravo !!!",5,2019,02,20

140,Exceptional ,"I booked the Langham as a birthday treat for my sister and I can confidently say that the service right from reservations through to departure was spectacular. Prior to arrival I received a couple of emails asking if I had any requests. All questions were answered promptly.
When checking in, I found the staff to be very helpful and polite and they made you feel as if no request would be too much to ask.
The room was clean and well presented. I liked the small details such as the cords on the hair dryer and iron being tied with pink ribbons.
My sister found a card and cake waiting for her in the room, which I thought with very thoughtful.
Every single member of staff we encountered while walking around the hotel stopped to ask if we were enjoying our stay and to wish us a good day.
ROUX at Landau was amazing. The staff and the food were exceptional.
Big thank you to everyone at the hotel for make our stay memorable. I will definitely be coming back! ",5,2019,02,20

140,A wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel,"We stayed two nights in February for at weekend break, our first time at The Langham. Every staff member we had contact with was extremely friendly and service minded. The room was beautifully decorated, the bed and bedding was amazing - slept wonderfully both nights.

We had Afternoon Tea at the Palm Court - which was very enjoyable. Quality of tea and food was topnotch. 

I can highly recommend this wonderful hotel. Can't wait to visit again in the future!",5,2019,02,13
140,What a disaster!!!  Deserves negative stars.,"We so looked forward to this visit, we thought this would be the highlight of our hotels on this trip.   When we arrived, the doorman asked if we had stayed before.   We told him not at this Langham but at the Langham in Chicago which was amazing.   He said “Well, this is THE Langham and you will love our beautiful hotel.”. Adding to the high expectations...

Check-in was efficient with the staff there again saying how much we’d love their hotel.   We headed off to room 210.  Along the hall we eight steep steps we needed to use to get to our room....nice.   When we entered the old, small and dreary room, my wife said “This is Fawlty  Towers.”.  Little did we know.

In checking out the room, we discovered the following:   our window facing another building across the small alley, a shower that was added to a ridiculously tall bathtub (really, who takes baths in these, replace with stalls!), and a small refrigerator with motion sensing automatic charging products.  I paid 2,500GBP for four nights, you provide one coke can’s width worth of space for personal items, and want to nickel and dime me to buy your stuff!   Oh, I should mention that a small tuft of hair fell onto the floor when I opened the refrigerator.   I dream of Fawlty Towers versus THE Langham.

We went down to the front-desk to express our repulsion at the hair, the staff apologized and said they’d take care of it (as well as adjusting the clock radio which was hours off).

When we returned from dinner, we discovered that a dining cart completely blocked our lovely stairwell with food and drink thrown about the cart.   THE Langham!  I called downstairs to let them know, the person who answered asked me if it was in front of our door.  As I was explaining that it was blocking the hallway at the steps, he hung up on me!

The next morning brought a routine that was repeated every single morning, guests letting the doors slam (maybe THE Langham could afford those felt sound dappeners to put on the doors).  Then housekeeping would leave their room... SLAM, enter a guestroom... SLAM....exit the guest room....SLAM... ad naseum.  But, there was worse to come, MUCH worse.  The housekeeping would clean the room next to our bed, she apparently pulled the beds out to change them, and then slammed them back to the wall causing our headboards to slam against our heads.   EVERY SINGLE MORNING without fail, must have been twin beds cause we got it twice EVERY SINGLE MORNING ...  and, every single morning a manager (except the last morning,  apparently, they tired of me and left the front desk all on their own) would apologize, indicate that they would (had) spoken with housekeeping and that it wouldn’t happen again.   THE Langham was nothing if not consistent, every morning we risked broken necks.

Ok, stuff that would have made the hotel ok except for the things that made it horrible.  Location is good (maybe except for the homeless camp at the church across the street or were those tents THE Langham’s superior rooms?) and the food was good.

GM, don’t bother with the standard offers of ‘trying us again’ or contacting you directly.   We were there four nights, had serious issues we reported on six or seven occasions and you didn’t contact me then.

I would never come back here.   Travellers, you shouldn’t either.

Oh, by the way, when guests request a black London meter cab to travel to Heathrow, staff should do that instead of a dodgy cab that charged 100 GBP flat.  Nice closing touch to remember THE Langham by.",1,2019,02,12
140,Perfect stay ,"I stayed here (for the 7th time) for a weekend with friends over from France. From the moment we checked in (thank you for the upgrade) we were very well looked after, car parked, bags taken, shown to room, all in a really quick time. Before I had asked the concierge to book me a table at the Roux (fantastic eatery at the hotel) for 10 people which was done so effortlessly. The artesian bar is one of the best I have been in from all over the world.. and fitting a table for 10 was done again effortlessly even though they were busy! 

The is a timeless hotel, not hustle and bustle like many london hotels, but quiet and the decor and rooms are top grade! The spa is worth a visit along with the fitness room and pool. I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel... if you can, check it out next time you are in london! The staff really make your stay! They are excellent all round! ",5,2019,02,11
140,A special place,The reason why I return so many times to this wonderful hotel is the quality of the staff and their warm welcome. The Club facilities are excellent and the hotel is a stylish oasis in the heart of London's West End.,5,2019,02,11
140,A good experience - with reservations,"Finishing up this review after the TripAdvisor “cooling off” period has expired.  This review relates to two stays (of two weeks each) in October 2018 and February 2019.  Hopefully it is specific and helpful.

An overall good experience both stays at the Langham.  During the October stay my Executive Suite upgraded to a One Bedroom Suite half way through the trip.  No upgrade on the second trip (I hold Voyager status in the hotel’s 1865 Club which promises upgrades if available at the time of checkin.  More on that below) and I was in an Executive Suite the entire two weeks in February. 

Checkin was handled well both times.  After a bit of a fumble on the second trip regarding which expenses would be put on which credit card (not the hotel’s fault) they seemed to double up the reserved charges on my card (reserved, not actually charged) but no real disaster - just a small irritant.  After querying the issue at the front desk I received the furrowed brow “I think I see what has happened” response from the clerk but never really received that reassuring, clear indication that the issue had been happily resolved.

The Executive Suite is a good sized open plan room with a very good desk, good seating area and excellent-sized, comfortable bed.  The One Bedroom Suite is a very good, large layout although the useable space in the bathroom seems less than in the Executive Suite.  In any event, very good rooms - excellent size and layout - nicely appointed and in my view good value at that price for London.

Included on both trips was access to the Club Lounge and that is very worthwhile.  Whilst my work schedule on the second trip meant I used the Club less, it remains a very good option and well justified.  The extraordinarily competent and attentive Hoi runs off his feet to keep guests happy.  His level of service is so high that when he is not on duty it is most apparent.  Hoi is one of those employees who should be cloned.  I cannot commend him highly enough.  He alone is worth staying at the Langham!

I also hosted business lunches and dinners in the Palm Court restaurant on both trips and was very pleased by both the service and food.  Recommended as well.

Now, finally, tips on the hotel’s 1865 Club and Voyager status (the highest practical level an ordinary traveller achieves).  The promised upgrade “if available” is a bit of a dangerous thing for the hotel - let me explain.  So for a total of about 28 days’ stay (over the last two visits), I received 4 nights of upgrade.  The polite explanation I received from management was that it is simply very difficult to grant the upgrade for so long a stay.  The irritant arises however when I searched for available rooms on the website (on both trips) and one bedroom suites are on offer for that entire time (on both trips) - but did not offered as the upgrade.  So one can only conclude that rooms are available, but just not for the upgrade.  If the suites were not available online, I’d certainly get it (you can’t upgrade to a room already occupied) but the empty rooms are there - presumably just held in reserve in case of a walk-in.  I fully appreciate my stays tend to be longer, but are not those exactly the type of guests the hotel wants to attract and keep?  So, what does all that mean in practical terms?  I can only conclude that the upgrades promised for Voyager status are illusory or perhaps just rare - or at least they are in my case.  I do like the Langham, but as a result from now on will not book for longer stays if only to try to meet the hotel’s criteria and increase my chances of an upgrade.  I will thus reduce my long stays and limit my future stays to 3 or 4 nights at a time - I will then shift back over to The Lanesborough or The Goring (where I often stay, still visit and feel very welcomed) for the balance of my long stays.  Not my first choice but that is the natural result of being guided by and reactive to the policies of the hotel.

So, see you next time, Hoi - only just for far fewer nights at a time!",4,2019,02,11
140,Exquisite afternoon tea at The Langham,"We visited The Langham for Afternoon Tea with family and had high hopes. We were not disappointed! 

Choosing the Wedgewood afternoon teas, the adults enjoyed various courses of amusé bouchés, finely cut sandwiches, petit fours, scones and a selection of cakes and pastries, along with wonderful Champagne. Truly divine! 

The children in our party had the Hamleys afternoon teas, which featured jigsaw shaped sandwiches, fruit and chocolate dipping pots, along with a multitude of other treats and were even presented with a Hamleys teddy bear. 

Staff were attentive and helpful and the surroundings of the main dining room were as decadent and stunning as you’d expect from such a landmark hotel such as The Langham. An exquisite afternoon tea.",5,2019,02,09
140,Love the Langham !!!,"Love the Langham !! 
Amazing suites and rooms and the food at the restaurant is mind blowing. Must visit.
Super luxury hotel and food. 
Best location as you are on oxford street and walking distance from tube station . 
Best ever !",5,2019,02,07
140,Another visit here,This is the great hotel. It is very hard to miss anything essential. It has this nice oldish flavour when you feel welcomed right away. The real service is something that for example the Americans can just dream about.,5,2019,02,07
140,Service beyond compare in historic and lux surroundings,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Langham in mid-December and I couldn't have been happier. First of all, the hotel itself is just GORGEOUS and manages to be both historic and modern simultaneously. Secondly, the whole hotel was decorated up for Christmas by the folks at my favorite store, Liberty, which just added an extra polish to this already stunning place. Third, the service here is impeccable and the real reason to stay.

Upon check-in, my personal concierge gave me a tour of the buildings and walked me to my room in the Regent Wing. The room was gorgeously appointed in soft tones and smelled lovely. Unfortunately, there was a strange beeping coming from the bathroom (speaker?) and we couldn't figure out how to make it stop. My personal concierge took me back downstairs and we found a new room for me in the main building. While this room wasn't as modern from a decor perspective, the bathroom was incredible! It was all marble, huge and had a separate shower and soaking tub. I was also on the top floor with a view of London.

Every person I encountered at the hotel—servers, doormen, bell hops, hosts/hostesses—were all utterly top notch and ready with a smile and service. The bed was heavenly and the room very quiet. There is also a really interesting coffee table book in the room about the history of the Langham! My only complaint was that there is this cool speaker in the bathroom that plays whatever is on the television, but it had been blown out and was very distorted and crackly. It's such a cool idea, but I just wish it had worked better.

It's right on Regent Street, so handily close to Liberty, Top Shop, H&M, etc. In addition, the bar in the Langham, Artesian, serves incredible cocktails and has won ""best bar in the world"" accolades. Artesian even has some hi-fi scientific ice that melts slower in your drink!

The Langham is in my top 10 hotels of all time.",5,2019,02,06
140,Warmest welcome as usual.,"In our current uncertain world the Langham in London never disappoints and the 'Club' experience with the large executive rooms is the perfect way to appreciate the 'home away from home' experience best if it's within the budget. Since we first found the hotel in 2004 we have not stayed anywhere else in London. Over many visits the experience has always been of the highest level and the same warm welcome seems to be extended to all guests irrespective of apparent status. Indeed I would say that the super friendly service is the hotels USP. Great food and luxury is all very nice but it is the feeling of being genuinely welcome, and in our case as repeat visitors part of a family, that is really special. The Club experience is particularly special as it is here that you get the time to really engage with the staff in the spacious comfortable space with the tipple of your choice. On this visit in the height of winter all the outlets were full and buzzy and a particular nod must go to the Landau who despite being full provided us with a memorable meal served without delay. There are too many friends to pick out in this review although new staff seem to immediately fit in to the 'Langham way' which is a testament to the standards of the Hotel. I would add criticisms if I had any but i haven't and even the breakfast bread which I have been complaining about for ages is now sorted.",5,2019,02,05
140,Great all around hotel in London,"Location right by the BBC was excellent for walking and using the Underground from Oxford Circus. Service from all the staff, especially the Concierge was superb. Great breakfast and wonderful bar. I would definitely stay again when in London.",5,2019,02,05
140,Deserves every one of their 5 stars,"I’ve had the great fortune to have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels around the world and this is definitely the creme de la creme. Incredibly attentive staff, super comfy bed and wonderful amenities in the room and rest of the hotel. I honestly couldn’t find fault with one thing which is quite unusual for me, just because I have such high expectations. Keep it up!",5,2019,02,04
140,Late evening Drinks,Friends were staying here and after dinner we went back and had some late night drinks. Lovely place to people watch and enjoy a good chat.  Very busy but staff were able to find us a table very quickly and got us some drinks in reasonable time.,4,2019,02,04

140,Very highly recommended,"When we first stayed at the Langham, we were so impressed by the stunning architecture and interior design upon arrival. However, as other guests have commented, it was the team at the hotel, who always go above and beyond, and have an impeccable eye for detail, that really made our stay memorable. We're already planning to return and would highly recommend the Langham to anyone.",5,2019,02,04
140,"Great location, friendly staff beautiful frangrance",We stayed here for two days in Dec 2017. The location is superb with easy access to the best shops in London. The hotel staff were friendly. The bedroom was comfortable but not the roomiest we’ve had. The food both for breakfast and dinner was excellent as was the service. The bar was busy and atmospheric.  As you enter the lobby you are greeted with a relaxing scent. Well worth a visit.,5,2019,02,04
140,Once again a LOVELY stay,"I love it in here, Everything is fantastic about it. The small details that make your stay to be FABULOUS. But what it makes The Langham unique is not the building itself is the people that work in the Hotel. I said this before is like being at home, and they make you feel at home...this time I decided to stay for another 5 days...so if you are coming and reading this. Please be sure that you are going to be looked after by the fantastic team that makes The Langham so special for me.  CONGRATULATIONS",5,2019,02,01
140,"Wonderful week, thank you!","We just returned home from a week in a one bedroom suite, 445, great room! The hotel’s location was perfect for us, lots of fun activities around the city. We were treated with kindness and warmth by everyone, and the Langham Lounge was especially superb. Thank you everyone for giving us a really special week, see you again soon...",5,2019,02,01
140,Pricey but worth it,"Charming London vibe, incredible service, exactly what we would expect from a nice London hotel. Great location with an easy walk to Oxford and Regent street shopping districts and tube stations. Lots of great places to dine nearby, the in house restaurants were also very nice, albeit expensive. We loved our stay here! ",5,2019,01,31
140,Top Quality ,"I stayed at The Langham for a couple of nights and it was one of the best hotel I’ve ever been. Everything was perfect, from the check-in with the lovely Federica to the check-out with the super nice Rodrigo. 
Room was big and very clean, breakfast  and the afternoon tea were amazing experiences. The staff was perfect, lovely and kind. I’ll definitely stay again. ",5,2019,01,31
140,Extraordinary stay ,"We are just returning from a 3-nights half private/half business stay at The Langham in London and it has been a wonderful stay, from the beautiful and exclusive interior, the coziest bed, the central location in London, the super delicious breakfast, excellent drinks recommendations at the bar to the very helpful and friendly staff. We always felt very welcomed, it was never stiff, due to the authentic and warmhearted hospitality that we experienced. That is real luxury.

Apart from the wonderful team, my highlight was the The Langham bookmark which was placed on my book on the nighttable from the housekeeping team. It is all about the details.

Thank you The Langham-team!",5,2019,01,31
140,Pure Class,"This is the second time visiting this iconic hotel and restaurant 
Firstly .. the staff both in the hotel and the restaurant are amazing. We were upgraded to a suite with no extra charge as last time on my birthday the flowers went to the wrong room. We didn’t expect this as on that previous occasion the staff quickly remedied the problem even adding a complimentary bottle of champagne. 

This time my partner had flowers put in the room and the hotel added the extra touch of a cake and birthday card!! 
Attention to detail in this hotel is spot on. You feel looked after and nothing is too much trouble. 

Our evening meal was amazing and cooked to perfection .. I had the most beautiful coconut desert with a chocolate wafer ... I dream about this desert every day!! But for me I had forgoton my glasses and couldn’t read the menu..... even this wasn’t a problem. Our waiter suggested some glasses they had in the restaurant.. I assumed some that had been left behind ... Oh no they actually have a sectioned tray that was presented to me with a selection of different strength reading glasses !! I was blown away and also very grateful !! 

The following morning our breakfast was buffet style and thank God no dreadful toast machine!! 
There was a vast selection of cheeses, cold meats pastries, muffins etc along with a cooked breakfast option which although buffet style was very hot. 

We will definitely be going back as this is both mine and my partners favourite London Hotel we would highly recommend a visit.",5,2019,01,30
140,Langham hotel London,Service throughout this hotel was superb. My wife and I stayed in an executive suite which was beyond perfect and the staff in the Lounge were absolutely amazing in their care of guests. We will be returning in the very near future.,5,2019,01,29
140,Afternoon Tea Palm Court,"My friend & I had afternoon tea here yesterday & it was the most wonderful experience. 
I think the staff are mind-readers because they anticipate your every need!! My cup of tea seemed to fill itself, cakes appeared on the stand as if by magic, & extra sandwiches were offered just as I was thinking 'I'd like another one of those'.
Stefano was our waiter, & he was fantastic. All the staff from Stefano, to reception, &the chap standing outside, were so genuinely friendly & obviously enjoy working there.
The whole experience was so relaxed but very special. 
The best afternoon tea I've experienced. 
Thankyou Langham!",5,2019,01,28
140,The only place to stay in London!,"A fantastic Hotel, from check in to check out. Great rooms, great service and wonderful food and drinks in the various places on offer, I loved the gym and the location is perfect, very central but very quiet at the same time, all in all our NEW home from home in London.",5,2019,01,28
140,Keeps getting better and better!,"Just back from our fourth stay and, as my friend said, it keeps surpassing expectations.  Having had to delay due to very ill son, we were ready to be  pampered and we were from arrival to reluctantly leaving. The interior design is stunning, elegant, light airy with beautiful displays of yellow tulips hitting an early spring note. The club lounge is a wonderful, calm retreat. The club Food and drink all generously supplied and just right. Lunch first in the Wigmore was buzzy and delicious, do try the fab snack menu. 
   Touching gestures and warm, genuine staff make the difference here. It wouldn’t matter how beautiful the design is without them and they truly make the stay special. Thank you again to the lovely Frank, Marci and all the club team. Our visits are truly the highlight of our year. I promise you will never regret treating yourself to a stay. ",5,2019,01,27
140,The Langham London,An elegant and great hotel.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The room is cosy and comfortable.  The food is very delicious.  The location is very convenient.  There's always a taxi outside the hotel.,5,2019,01,27
140,Beautiful Hotel,"This is an amazing place to stay! Check in was very welcoming, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the entrance is grand, and smells devine. The room is lovely and has every comfort you need and the hotel sent up a complimentary cake, as this was a birthday weekend get away.

Overall, the hotel is simply  luxurious, staff are great and the hotel is in an ideal location. We will most definitely be returning. ",5,2019,01,27
140,Welcome to The Club ,"First impressions count for everything and having just checked in to a Club room here at The Langham I can say with sincerity this place is fantastic. The room is a delight, with fabulous views of the BBC studios and wider Regents Street from room 537. Every amenity you could wish for, every comfort you could crave are all here. Nice spacious room design too.

We arrived early as my wife was booked in for a treatment at the Chuan Spa. Upon checking in we were given a very warm welcome at the front desk and escorted to the Club lounge for private check-in. Given we were much earlier than the standard check-in time we were offered breakfast a nice chilled glass of champagne before heading off to the Spa. The Club lounge is something very special, lots of comfy seating areas, fabulous artwork, roaring fires, a library area and a butlers pantry serving breakfast, afternoon tea and canapés. What’s more special is the fact they serve complimentary alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages all day long, champagne included. Certainly a facility to savour and enjoy, and absolutely worth the extra to upgrade. 

The Chuan Spa is a little dainty but absolutely perfect. A fully equipped gym, relaxing pool area, and treatment rooms. 

While the facilities are second to none, with the hotel at the height of luxury, what makes the difference here are the staff. From the front desk, the Club lounge through to the Spa, everyone is incredibly warm and welcoming. The biggest asset of this hotel by far are the people. 

",5,2019,01,26
140,* Absolutely Wonderful Stay *,"We stayed at the Langham for a birthday getaway and it truly exceeded my expectations!!

The highlights were: 
- the executive room - which was very spacious, clean and had lots of thoughtful touches.
- The Artesian bar which made wonderful cocktails and had a nice atmosphere
- the staff - they were all very friendly, professional and were always happy to offer even more than what we asked for. 
- the Club Lounge where we were able to make the most of food and drinks, relax and have a wonderful afternoon tea.

The Director of Sales - Middle East, Ahmed Metwally, looked after us from start to finish. He was attentive, ensured that our check-in was seamless and that our needs were always met. His communication was efficient and he never left us with unanswered questions. He helped make our trip so special and I only have praise for him. 

I would rate this as one of the best hotels that I have stayed, in London - you truly get what you pay for and feel extra special staying in these luxurious surroundings.",5,2019,01,24

140,Just how it should be!,"We stayed in two deluxe rooms for a night in December just after Christmas. The service in the hotel was faultless. Just what you'd expect from a hotel of this standard and yet more friendly than some of it's rivals. We were very impressed, 

Our rooms were comfortable. The bathrooms were spacious and the beds luxurious. We were able to sleep soundly at night and with breakfast & newspapers delivered the room the next morning it made for a very relaxing stay.

We ate at the Landau Restaurant in the evening and were very pleasantly surprised that they were able to cater for our son who is only 3 years old. He very much enjoyed his spaghetti! Thank you chefs! and thank you to the Maitre'd for his quick thinking in whisking my son's order to the kitchen, ahead of ours, to ensure the table was kept calm and that we could all enjoy our meal together. Needless to say the food was excellent.

140,Stunning,"Absolutely brilliant, a true high class hotel from the time you get outside to the time you leave. The friendliness and peofessionality of the staff must be an example for other hotels to strive for. The room was large and bright.

140,Best hotel in the world,"I decided after this visit that The Langham London is my favourite hotel in the world. I have been fortunate enough to travel a fair amount. I do not say the best in the world lightly!

I took my sister here for two nights to give her a break and a little luxury. The Langham team delivered what I hoped for, a special treat, and more. A minor hiccup with the set up of one room but dealt with perfectly and all sorted out with no hassle to me.

What I love most about this hotel are the people that work there. Authentic and genuine care and service at every step. Personalised, nothing is too much trouble. From the doormen to housekeeping to the pub and the bar to the team in the Club Lounge, every single interaction was perfect and made us feel like special and appreciated guests. 

The property itself is lovely. Low key, beautiful decor and somewhat understated. The Langham manages to retain its sense of “Britishness” and avoids the bling several other famous London hotels have fallen prey to to please some extremely wealthy foreign guests. Executive rooms are spacious, beautiful design and colours and I enjoy the bath, as well as the shower and toilet behind separate doors.

My biggest thanks and appreciation go to Ani in the club lounge. Firstly, this lounge sets the Langham apart from all other hotels. A calm and beautiful respite from busy London, amazing drinks and food, and a wonderful team. Many of this team are the same as on each of my four visits over the past few years which is both reassuring and wonderful. Ani looked after us so well and truly made this visit special. Greetings by name, checking in to ensure everything was to our satisfaction, elegant conversation and making sure I was able to give my sister the treat I wanted it to be. Thank you so very much Ani, you are one in a million!

I love the Langham London and cannot wait to find an excuse to come again. A little tricky as I live 30 minutes away but I’ll work on it!

It’s the people that make the single biggest difference in a luxury hotel and the Langham team are simply world class and the very very best.

My favourite hotel in the world.

140,"Love, love, love! Traditional English luxury with a contempoary twist at it's best!","From the moment I arrived at this hotel I fell in love. Filled with English tradition with a modern twist and decor that highlights its architectural details in a contemporary way. The staff are attentive, polite and friendly, nothing is ever a problem. The hotel feels luxurious with its beautiful decor and stunning floral displays.  

Fantastic central London location with everything right on your doorstep.

I stay in a lot of hotels due to work but what I loved about this one is the decor and the little details. Items with subtle pink and gold branding, amazingly comfy beds, the turndown service, floral displays - I would have loved to seen it at Christmas.

On the first day we had lunch at Roux at Landau, the service was fantastic and delicious. In the evening I attended an event in the ballroom which was lovely and the good divine for a large scale event. The next morning, breakfast in the Palm Court, great selection with true traditional English style service. 

Unfortunately did not have time to use the spa but I heard good reports from those that did. Hope to return one day to experience it.",5,2019,01,12
140,Exceptional Afternoon,"I attended a function at The Langham just before Christmas and had a wonderful lunch and afternoon.
A great welcome from the doorman when I arrived and the entrance and reception areas were beautifully decorated with Christmas trees and ornaments.
During the welcome drinks, the staff were polite and friendly and made sure your glass was topped up with whatever you were drinking.
The function room used for the lunch looked amazing, again all the tables  were beautifully decorated, including a vase of stunning festive flowers . The three courses were delicious and all the waiting staff very attentative to your needs.
A wonderful afternoon in a fsbuliyx location. I would definitely visit this hotel again.",5,2019,01,07
140,Always such a great place.,"The staff are just lovely at this venue. They are delightfully funny and friendly. They will really go out of their way. We love coming here time and time again. Great place for either afternoon tea, dinner or just drinks in the bar.",5,2019,01,06
140,combined birthday treat ,"outstanding! absolutely fantastic hotel with amazing genuinely helpful, attentive and friendly staff. 
we only stayed one night with our son who is disabled for a joint birthday treat and can’t wait to return for a longer stay. we stayed in a junior suite that gave us access to the very chilled, luxurious club level, which i would highly recommend. a big thanks to all the staff up there, especially Ben Monica & Janet who were so lovely to our little boy ",5,2019,01,06
140,"Elegance and Luxury, Perfectly Situated","I once spent a month in a hotel roughly the size of the Langham.  I was relocating to a new city; I checked into the hotel every Monday evening and out every Friday morning.  No staff member ever greeted me by name or indicated a glimmer of recognition that I was regularly in residence.  I relate that long-ago experience because, at the Langham, my wife and I are regularly greeted by name by multiple members the staff. We are in the fifth day of a week-long stay.  We could stay forever.
The Langham is exquisite.  Everything looks as though it has been freshly and tastefully decorated.  Our room, a 'superior double' isn't huge but it suits the needs of two people on vacation.  The staff, though, is the greatest strength (as it should be at any hotel).
The Langham is perfectly situated for someone who loves art and history.  The National Gallery, the British Museum, and the British Library are all 20-minute walks from the front entry.  Regent Street is at your feet.  The neighborhoods (Fitzrovia and Marleybone) are residential and filled with restaurants and small shops (and without the nosebleed prices of areas such as Knightsbridge).
Is it expensive?  Yes.  Is it worth it?  Also, yes.",5,2019,01,06
140,Wonderful New Year's in London - Terrific Hotel!,"After a bit of a bumpy start....trying to get three rooms in London for my family over New Year's weekend, I actually got a personal phone call in New York from Olivia, the head of reservations, who made it all come together for my family.  We have been to London many times, but this was our first stay at the Langham.  My wife was celebrating a milestone birthday and the hotel really went to great lengths to make sure that our stay was special.  The rooms were exceptionally comfortable and well appointed, high tea in the hotel is an experience no one should miss, and the hotel bar is a really fun scene (especially on New Year's Eve!).  Can't wait until our next stay.  Thanks for making this one so special!  Happy New Year.",5,2019,01,04
140,Majestic hotel in the heart of london ,"We spent a wonderful New year's vacation on the beautiful Langham hotel.

At the check in we've being transferred to the private lounge where the check in process held, we offered champagne, coffee and treats, staff was extremely nice and friendly.

We got an upgrade to a one bedroom suite, suite 250 is a one bedroom suite but in fact it's a specious 3 rooms suite, one room is formal dining room, one is a living room and one is a master bedroom.

All beautifully done with a chic decor, old charm, high ceilings but all the modern gadgets.

Turn down service is done right.

Service is amazing.

And location is near all the shopping streets but still tucked away in a quiet street.

We will be back.",5,2019,01,04
140,Langham: London Unsurpassed!,"Just off the back of a week’s stay, this time with my kids and not on business. Honestly it was a perfect stay. I love the fact that they know you and make a point of knowing you at the Langham. No snobbery no pretensions just pure down to earth hospitality. Having stayed at my fair share of London hotels over the years, I am now solidly convinced that the Langham is a legitimate standout. Why unsurpassed? The consistency of service, the consistency of quality food, the location in the heart of everything and the overall value. My kids are a tough crowd and they were blown away by the stay. Thank you to the Langham crew. See you again soon. ",5,2019,01,02

140,Langham Visit December 2018,"Final visit to the Langham for business and pleasure on 14th December, one of many made in 2018. 

From the doormen onwards the greetings and level of service are simply exemplary. 

Whether for business or pleasure the Langham is one of the finest and most personal hotels I have ever visited. Booking a club room or suite is a must, as the club lounge is a haven of tranquility to be relished. 

For dining the Roux and Palm Court are simply superb. 

My thanks to Bob, Zoe, Fadi and the entire team for such an enjoyable year at one of my favourite hotels in the world. 

This is a capital city five star hotel that simply does not feel like some you find in so many major cities.

Looking forward to returning in 2019.",5,2018,12,28
140,Just about perfect.,What can you say about this hotel that hasn't already been said. This was our 2nd visit and this time for a pre Christmas break. It's all about the superb service. It's unusual to find a large hotel where so many members of staff remember your name. The club lounge and the staff were outstanding and in particular Cyndy Divinagracia Apalisok needs a special mention as she was always on hand to rescue us when we needed it. See you again.,5,2018,12,27
140,Fabulous time at The Langham,Had a wonderful time at The Langham with my family. The service was first class and the rooms had everything you could want.  We were celebrating my daughters 18th and my husbands 50th Birthday and the  hotel made it very special. We had access to the Club Lounge which I would highly recommend.  We look forward to returning.,5,2018,12,23
140,A perfect pre- Christmas break,"Just back from our annual visit to the Langham. A perfect venue for getting in the Christmas spirit and ideally located for the theatres, Intenational Horse Show and shopping. 
The staff were as ever most polite, friendly and helpful.
A quiet location but seconds away from the hubbub of the West End.
We’ll be back next Christmas if not before!",5,2018,12,22
140,Excellent hotel,This is our 4th time staying at the Langham and we cannot fault it.  A wonderful hotel with friendly and efficient staff.  A real treat for us to wind down after a busy year.  The Christmas decorations are just beautiful.,5,2018,12,22
140,Holiday shopping in London,"Stayed a few days at the Langham Hotel whilst shopping for the holidays and visiting friends. This hotel offered a convenient location to shopping at Oxford Circus and the Marylebone high street.  Hotel was bright and airy, also offering a lovely bar and restaurant.  There’s also a spa and gym.  Water pressure in their showers are amazing!! I know it’s a strange thing to notice, but I do. Would definitely recommend this hotel!! ",5,2018,12,22

140,Culmination of a Wonderful Trip,"We celebrated both our 80th birthdays by staying 10 nights in the Club Lounge at this wonderful hotel. Check in on a separate floor in the most brilliant room. Total elegance with furnishings,  food and drinks of the highest quality. Our room was as expected of a 5 star hotel with nothing lacking.  Views in the distance to the Eye, Shard and Parliament. Complimentary breakfast available in the lounge as was afternoon tea and drinks from 5 till 7.  The staff here we totally professional especially Christina, Cyndy, Pietro and Denied for our room service. Dinner in the Palm Court but found the service very ordinary and the lighting near impossible to read the menu. A word of warning if using a travel card . It is better to have the card actually charged, rather than having a ""block"" put on it.   All in all it was a most wonderful stay.",5,2018,12,18
140,Beautiful Hotel,"My very first time i stayed for just one night with my cousin in march,amazing place so overwhelmed , it's just stunning. the bedroom was lovely Staff are friendly and very helpful. i have enjoyed my time very much at this hotel.",5,2018,12,17

140,Exquisite as Always!..,"Our 3rd stay in Executive Room at beautiful Langham Hotel. Arrived early, booked in by Cyndy and Christina then enjoyed gorgeous Champagne breakfast. Looked after so well by the team including Hoi, Frankie, Larissa, Annie and others. Food and drinks plentiful and chef made me a plate of my favourite turkey sandwiches. We enjoyed every minute. Room beautiful and very spacious. Every bit of our stay was pure luxury. The staff are always highly professional and genuinely want to ensure you have the best stay ever. The Langham remains our top ever hotel. Will be returning for two nights in April as one is just not enough.. ",5,2018,12,17
140,Pure Elegance,"We stayed at The Langham for 3 nights in mid November and thoroughly enjoyed the experience . Not only did they have a great doorman (dressed to the nine's) all staff were excellent.  The room was large and very spacious. The location, just up Regent Street from Oxford Circus, is very central to all London attractions . Overall impression of the hotel was excellent.",5,2018,12,16
140,Party,"Beautiful hotel in great location near regent/Oxford Street
Expensive, but for 5 star hotel in central London, it's what you'd expect.
The rooms are adequately sized, but with everything you need ( other that a shoe buffer!). There is a real nice quality feel to all the rooms.
It is a bit of a maze getting to your room depending on what number you are in, lots of corridors to get lost in!
Very comfy bed.
£9 for half a litre of water is ridiculous though.
Really nice quality breakfast.
",4,2018,12,16
140,stay at the langham,"Fabulous stay at this hotel. Great location,  and the staff were fabulous. Excellent food served by very efficient staff. One downside dreadful pillow that prevented a good nights sleep but will not stop me returning",5,2018,12,11
140,The place to stay in London,"After trying several five star hotels in London this one is the final choice. For the first time in 10 years I booked the same hotel again as no other hotels combines so well the excellent location, beautiful architecture, health spa, but most of all a fantastic staff.  I would recommend to book the executive room as you then have access to the executive lounge that is simply superb.",5,2018,12,09
140,Fantastic,"We spent 3 nights at the hotel
We enjoyed it very much. The junior suite we stayed in was large warm and welcoming. Staying at that sort of a room enabled us to enjoy the fantastic hospitality of the executive lounge with drinks and bites during most of the day a real advantage and fun.
We had an issue with a suite we got upon our arrival which did not satisfy our needs and cretirya but when we involved the manager on duty everything was solved to our most satisfaction.",5,2018,12,09
140,Absolutely super afternoon tea,"Amazing service, food and experience here with our daughter for afternoon tea.  Totally delicious sandwiches, scones to die for and we even got a cake to take home with us.  My daughter was asked to choose a complimentary reading book.  Staff were so friendly and accommodating despite there being a mix up with our booking at the start.  The a la carte menu beckoned but we couldn’t manag it!",5,2018,12,08
140,Exceptional Experience ,"Our whole experience from booking, arrival, lunch, cocktails and everything in between our whole stay was an absolute joy. Well done the Langham. The level of service was superb.  We will be back! Thank you 😊 ",5,2018,12,06

140,Wonderful Night,"The Langham and the staff are exceptional - we have always had lovely stays at the Langham. They recently added the Wigmore Pub and because we couldn't get a table at the cocktail bar we went there - we all loved it - table service, we could watch the football, great cocktails and the food is exceptional - recommend the cheese toastie.",5,2018,12,03
140,Amazing afternoon tea ,"Visited The Langham for afternoon
Tea.  Wonderful service provided by all staff, very attentive to our needs.  Food replenished if needed Beautiful Piano & Cello playing Christmas music.  Goody bag to take home. ",5,2018,12,02
140,Best hotel experience in London!,"I have been to London several times and have stayed in a lot of different “so-so” hotels, but our experience at The Langham was definitely above and beyond any expectations! The hotel itself is gorgeous with great food options, including a couple of nice restaurants, a great cocktail bar and a more traditional Pub. I also experienced the High Tea one day which was fabulous! The staff couldn’t be nicer and the location is unbeatable if you’re looking for site seeing as well as the best shopping in London! Also super close to the Oxford Circus Tube. An unforgettable experience!",5,2018,12,02
140,Indulgent,"Booked a trip to the Harry Potter studio and decided to stay over, the original plan was to drive and stay overnight in St Albans. 
In the end I decided to catch the train and stop in London, so needed a hotel, now I’m sure I could have found a cheap place to stop for one night but that’s just not me. I like nice hotels even though I can’t always afford them, I’ll spend what I can for a little bit of luxury.
The hotel is exquisite and the staff are welcoming and polite without being too pompous or stuffy, which was a worry. The room was comfy and clean, possibly a little too noisy with being on a lower floor and overlooking the Grey Goose festive garden, some noise from our neighbours too. 
Lovely breakfast, a little disappointed to not be able to get a meal in the Wigmore as it was full. Overall a lovely hotel, with great staff!",4,2018,12,02
140,Amazing as Always ,Just back from an amazing few nights for a special occasion at The Langham. Always welcomed by the staff in The Langham Club as a friend and nothing is ever to much trouble for them to keep you happy or they surprise your with something. Had a lovely suite on the 8th Floor with great views across London skyline. You can’t ask for anything more from this Hotel and it’s Amazing Staff!! Strongly recommend “Tjr Langham Martini”,5,2018,12,01
140,Everything from everything,"This hotel is centrally located and has everything.
Fine and professional service. A team willing to help all.
Spacious rooms. Bathroom with walk-in shower and bathtub.
Breakfast is very good.
5 min walk from Oxford Street - what more do you need?",5,2018,12,01
140,Exceptional service started from the Bellman to all the staff  members.,From the moment we arrived we were greeted by helpful bellman and the staff inside were so  attentive. The rooms were clean and lots of perks like water bottles and fruit baskets every night along with treats every day. ,5,2018,11,30
140,Lovin the Langham Lounge!,"My family and I had the pleasure of staying at the Langham in London for 3 nights recently.  As a starter the staff is exceptional and were happy to meet our every needs.  The concierge desk had good ideas on how to get around the city and attractions to see and at what times to see them in order to avoid crowds and traffic.  We were there with our 10 year old son largely to see the sights and getting those small details right make a big difference in how much you can do in day and how to best avoid inconveniences.  For our trip that all made a big difference and kept things running smoothly. 

The location is very central and we ended up taking Uber to most of our venues.  Additionally, we were walking distance from major high streets with restaurants and any shops you might need. 

We were fortunate to indulge in the Langham Club Service at the hotel.  That meant separate VIP check in and  access to a lounge with a stocked coffee and liquor bar as well as snacks and big comfy chairs with newspapers and Wi-Fi.  Also included at the club was an inclusive breakfast and private concierge.  We used the facility to plan our day with local knowledge over breakfast and again at the end of the afternoon to relax and do some research on our next day.  For us the Club was a valuable resource again with top notch people at your service and lots of perks which we felt were well worth the upgrade.

Our room was very nice, appointed in traditional British fashion and a decent amount of room.  Linens and toiletries were top notch with lots of closet space.  A sizeable desk provided a work space for the bit of work we needed to attend to .   We really lacked for nothing.

The hotel has 4 restaurants and very good room service. We used room service a couple times and the promise of dinner in under 30 minutes was always met with very nice service and quality food.  We did not dine at any of their other restaurants but we did look at each of the rooms and menus.  One was a pub style venue and the others more proper fine dining establishments. 

In a nut shell, ultra-top notch service, good location and great rooms.  I would recommend the hotel to business and/or vacation travelers.",5,2018,11,28
140,Good hotel ,Stayed with family during a golfing vacation in England. They hotel kindly allowed us to store our golf bags before check in which was very helpful. The hotel has a very nice bar that everyone should frequent and the breakfast offered was good. The rooms were adequate; however our room had a few flies or insects that were buzzing especially in the light fixtures so that was a bit disturbing especially during the night times. Overall a good stay ,4,2018,11,28
140,Afternoon Tea,"Visited with my daughter who lives in Singapore and she had Gluten Free which she said it was the best Gluten Free Afternoon Tea she has ever had and said the bread was so good she could not believe it was Gluten Free.
The staff were so attentive and very informative about the food. The surrounding were beautiful with a pianist playing lovely music in the background.
I look forward to visiting this venue again.",5,2018,11,25
140,Wow! Exquisite!! ,"This was a real treat for my husband and I and some friends but I can’t believe how amazing the whole experience was. The food, drinks and service was out of this world and we have never experienced such a superb breakfast. Rooms, staff and decor is all fantastic and 1 night is simply not long enough. It is a stones throw to Oxford street shops but I wish we had longer to simply enjoy the hotel facilities. Well done to everyone at the Langham we will be returning next year. ",5,2018,11,25
140,Wonderful! ,"Best hotel in London. Fabulous service from the second we parked up outside. The doorman were lovely and so helpful, our room was ready early, they held our car for us for 40 mins as we had an appointment at the Portland as I was giving birth there the following day. 
Room service was the best hotel room service I’ve had anywhere, it arrived hot and fast which is unusual. The bathroom is lovely and big, so space for my husband to shower whilst I bathed. 
When leaving they came with a Langham teddy gift and everyone wished us luck with the birth. It left us feeling like valued customers. I really recommend this hotel. 
The afternoon tea was so lovely with music playing. ",5,2018,11,24
140,Another quality experience.,"This is the second time i have stayed at The Langham within 12 months. The reason i returned was because of the friendliness of the staff in particular Cristina, and all her colleagues who work in the Club lounge. Everyone is friendly, professional warm and genuine. You won't be disappointed.",5,2018,11,22
140,Great location,"Langham is well situated especially if you want to shop in London. The room was comfortable and clean. The bed, linens and amenities were great.  The service was consistently very good. I would stay at this hotel again if I returned to London. The concierge was excellent and went above and beyond to book great restaurants. ",4,2018,11,22
140,grand style,"grand style hotel in a great location- close to underground station oxford circle, very comfortable and quiet room, extremely helpful and friendly staff, nice hotel bar to come home to after a day of sightseeing",5,2018,11,21
140,Disappointing Stay,"Beautiful well situated hotel, and very tastefully decorated. Beds are very comfortable, and rooms are clean. Staff are very friendly, especially the door staff. Breakfast at Roux at the Landau was lovely, there were a variety of yoghurts / fresh fruit / pastries to choose from and also a good selection of cooked breakfasts. We did have an issue with the television which kept turning itself on and off, we reported this to the reception before leaving for the evening, and the issue was addressed whilst we were out which was very good.

However, the downfall seems to be the lack of availability for tables for guests at the bar . restaurant. On Saturday evening we decided to head back to the hotel for about 23:30, choosing to have a drink at the hotel bar rather than staying out. When we got to the hotel we stood outside the bar at the entrance waiting to be seen to by a member of staff, this did not happen, despite several walking straight past us, so we had to approach them to see if we had to queue / wait for a table. We were told the bar was full and we would have to wait out in the lobby until a table became available! This is something I have never experienced at a hotel before.

We have since learnt after speaking to other guests that they experienced the same issue and it is a problem the hotel are well aware of. Perhaps paying hotel guests should be prioritised over outside guests choosing to have a drink at the hotel bar. Palm Court was also closed / closing so we were left with no alternative but to go back out of the hotel and enjoy a drink elsewhere.

This was also the case for breakfast in the morning, all tables were full and we were told to just 'take a seat' and wait, with absolutely no indication of how long this would be.

The elevators were also very small, there are signs to say they accommodate 8 people but this would be a very tight squeeze. You often had a long wait for elevators when leaving your room to bring you down to the lobby.

It is a beautiful hotel but unfortunately not somewhere I would choose to stay again in the near future.",3,2018,11,19
140,Classy,Elegant and stately.  Good location. Very Comfortable.  The included breakfast is very generous. Hotel is near major shopping area and lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Langham hotel has lots of character and y pi u can see the attention to detail throughout. ,5,2018,11,19
140,beautiful,"this hotel is beautiful, very close to the city and lots to do. our only problem was we didnt have enough time to do everything we wanted!!!! the concierge and young members of staff are exceptional! would definitely return.",5,2018,11,16
140,exceptional stay,our stay at the langham was exceptional - the room was very nice - comfy bed - big bathroom - staff were helpful and friendly - the bar area is lovley and the spa and pool are equally as good. location of the hotel is right in the heart of London ,5,2018,11,14
140,Excellent in all aspects.....,"What an extraordinary experience, this is not 
Our first time and definitely will come again,
This is our preferred hotel in London, staying 
At the lounge floor is great , good complimentary bar, drinks and finger food. 
The rooms are well designed , the hotel two
Excellent bars are must to visit bars. All staff 
From bell gays through reception and lounge 
Receptionist are extraordinary. ",5,2018,11,14
140,Why stay anywhere else?,"We enjoy The Langham in Chicago, so we were excited to try the one in London. The location is great and the service top notch. It’s one of the most comfortable beds ever and the linens were divine. The heated towel rack was a nice touch as well.  ",5,2018,11,13
140,Birthday,"What a beautiful hotel, staff go above and beyond. Have no complaints, it was my two best friends birthday and the staff surprised us with a lovely little dessert to our hotel room! It’s always the little things. From arrival and checking out every staff member had amazing world class customer service and the gentleman at front of house looked very smart and are so kind! Big thanks to Laura who helped us out with the best places to go in London and being so lovely! Very convenient location and very beautiful, thank you! ",5,2018,11,12
140,Luxury in the centre of London.,"Very convenient for shops and sights. Shower was excellent, as was the bathroom and bed. Breakfast was wonderful with personal attention to our requests. So central, surrounded by cafes, restaurants and Oxford Street shops, as well as easy access to Carnaby Street and the British Museum, and of course very near the underground ",5,2018,11,12
140,FAB U LAS,"Time out London. Yet another great deal. Do not miss this, beautiful setting great
 Hotel , food was good for the three course meal. Braised ox cheek a must 
Relaxed atmosphere. We were with friends ,but great for couples.",5,2018,11,12
140,Again a great experience,"I stayed again with some friends in The Langham which can be qualified a THE Hotel in London. Great atmosphere as it is a top class English style hotel with a modern touch. The staff is ""invisible"" but if you need something it only takes a second before a person kindly offers his/her help. Top! 
Food or drinks!? With in-house restaurants, the best cocktail bar in town and their latest asset The Wigmore bar you don't have to go out. :-)
With the room I suggest also to book the club lounge. A exclusive lounge area with additional privileges where you will be treated as queen Elesabeth enjoying champagne, cocktails.
I used the swimming area but for those who really want to relax the SPA looked very attempting. Maybe next time because I will come back to this fantastic hotel in the middle of London with all the shops and nightlife on walking distance.",5,2018,11,12
140,Truly a 5 star experience ,"I feel like Milennials my age always use the word ""experience"" in such an offhand and ubiquitous way, but it really is true that people are less likely to shell out money for ""things"" and more likely to be willing to spend for an ""experience"". And then Instagram it fastidiously, of course. At any rate the Langham is more than just a hotel, it's an experience. From the moment you arrive with the doormen cheerfully calling out their hello's everything is part of the experience; the faint floral scent drifting over the palatial lobby; the complimentary espresso while you wait to check in; the tinkling piano notes resonating down the marble halls.

Well at any rate an experience is more than just the size of the room (quite large in the regent wing) or the breakfast (we didn't miss a single one) - it is the sum of many small but thorough details, like the expansive hotel room amenities, the espresso machine in the room, the bottled water ready on your bedside table after turn down surface, the fresh servings of fruit in the rooms, and the real honeycomb served at breakfast. I also really appreciated even the most minute of details, like this adorable Langham Hotel bookmark left in my room on my book. It was such a thoughtful gesture I was so touched! 

We booked everything through the concierge; our Harry Potter Studio Tour tickets, tickets to the Football game, even tickets to Hamilton! They also had excellent recommendations for restaurants in the area - they recommended Chotto Matte to us, a Peruvian/Japanese fusion that was to die for. And also afternoon tea at Sketch, the most eccentric place I've ever been in. Definitely recommend both options for a stay in this area. Speaking of the area, via Pokemon Go I walked all throughout Regent st and found many hidden gems; the area is full of unique side streets like Kingsly and Carnaby st, decked out in Bohemian rhapsody lyrics and lights - for the record, Pokemon is probably the best way to explore a city on foot. This hotel is a phenomenal location for shopping and walking around, as my wallet and overweight suitcase can attest. There's a Boots not even 2 minutes away, as well as a Tesco Express.

Anyway you can always tell how great a hotel is by measurement of failure, so I'll speak about that as well. My parents are overzealous New England Patriots season ticket holders who will burst into flames at the mere thought of missing a game, god forbid, so they asked the hotel to set up an HDMI cord to stream it on the TV. Due to country blocking nonsense they weren't able to see the game, but you had never seen a more dedicated group of people working tirelessly for American football. They were so apologetic about it even though it of course wasn't their fault, we sincerely felt bad for making them go through the trouble. (For the record, the Patriots got trounced anyhow so we didn't miss much.) My step dad is the most persnickety guest in the entire existence of mankind's history so the fact that he loved this place so much really speaks volumes. To him the level of service is the most important aspect of a hotel and the people working here really floored him. 

Unfortunately we leave today, but the Langham Hotel has rooted out the Taj, the Mandarin and all the Marriot and Starwood hotels combined in our hearts, so the next time we hop the pond I'm sure we'll be back here. Even Voldy had a good time!

140,Top class hotel 5*,We celebrated our 20 year wedding anniversary here. What an amazing hotel. They thought of everything. There is so many staff around who are all so friendly and helpful. We got upgraded to a deluxe room and it was gorgeous. 5* quality. Would 100% recommend this to anyone. The use of the house jaguar was great! Felt like a millionaire for the evening!,5,2018,11,12
140,The usual wonderful experience,"A warm welcome back was waiting for me at The Langham again. Attentive, yet unobtrusive, service in the club lounge. Room was as lovely as ever with great views on three sides this time. Nice touches on my birthday.",5,2018,11,10
140,Lovely hotel,"The Langham is one of those places that you always feel that you should treat yourself to at least once but sometimes fear to in case you are disappointed.  Don’t be, for me it lives up to what you think it should be.

We had a room on the 8th floor which was part of an offer.  That said it was very spacious and very quiet.  It afforded that sense of luxury that you expect.

The welcome was excellent and the explanations of the options available to us was clear.

We had an included breakfast in the Michael Roux restaurant.  This is definitely to be recommended if you like a classic English breakfast.

If you have that chance - go for it!",5,2018,11,10
140,"Delightfully enchanting hotel, perfect location. ","What a wonderful experience at the Langham. From the minute we arrived to the moment we walked out the door. The staff were all so attentive and more than happy to assist with any requests. We've stayed at a few 5* hotels around the world and we fell in the with everything about this hotel. Beautiful building, it's history is amazing, it's reputation is impressive and the bed, well.... memorably, one of the best nights sleeps we've both had in a while. Those blackout curtains certainly help.

The room was of ample size, luxurious, comfortable, offers excellent facilities, the mini bar well stocked and the Nespresso machine is a nice touch. 

One thing that stood out was the exquisite aroma of roses the moment you enter the lobby. It just hits you in the face and it smells so wonderful. 

Part of the reason for picking the Langham was location, location, location. It's perfectly placed and in walking distance of Oxford/Regent Street. 

Breakfast, we ate at Roux at the Landau. My honest opinion is perhaps a little pricey but worth the money when you taste the food. The OJ tasted so fresh, the eggs and salmon were delicious and the service, as you'd expect, excellent. My slight gripe was the wait time due to it being a busy morning. Seemed the place to be for a business breakfast and for guests. 

All in all a very memorable stay. We would recommend to anyone considering staying here. Thank you.",5,2018,11,08
140,Amazing location and the best choice!,"One of the best and most accessible location, attentive service, friendly staff, clean rooms as well as lavatories.
You easily reach to your destinations from The Langham.
Ask for Alex at the Artesian Bar... the best one of all!
Highly recommended!",5,2018,11,08
140,Stunning as always great service,"Entrance foyer has a wonderful ambience. Staff are always helpful and discreet.
We were in luxurious suites.
Great service and food as always.
Enjoyed a few drinks at the bar
Close to everywhere and transport.",4,2018,11,02
140,It doesn't get any better than this!,"This hotel far exceeded expectations.  The moment you enter, you are greeted by charming staff and a total elegance.  We booked a Junior Suite which was spectacular with high ceilings and a wonderful bathroom.  This room gave us access to the Club Lounge, where nothing was too much trouble, you had free flowing drinks and nibbles.  The staff were hugely attentive without being intrusive and are a real asset to the hotel.

I can't praise this hotel enough and i am so glad that I chose it, as I was pondering at one stage between this one and another top hotel in London, but from now on this will be at the very top of my list.",5,2018,11,02
140,Beautiful luxury in my favourite hotel ,"As soon as you enter the Langham you walk into that incredible scent and the tremendous Art Deco (I think!) styling. This time we stayed in a large suite which was beautiful and had every conceivable thing you wanted, including a Dyson hairdryer. We were able to have breakfast in the club lounge, which was also delicious and the service attentive. 
Downstairs is my favourite bar in the world, Artesian. 
If I have one downside to the Langham it is that the pool is tricky to get to despite the many signs that try to help. It is an epic journey to get there. 
In the Langham I am always reminded of Holly in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. You can’t imagine anything bad happening inside the Langham",5,2018,11,01
140,Great motel,"My husband and I had a quick trip to London and spent 2 nights at the Langham, which was great. The staff here are super friendly, cheery and professional, some luxury places can be a bit over the top , but here they were just great. The motel is divine, after being greeted with a friendly smile, you walk into the beautiful smell of fresh roses that are everywhere. The room itself is lovely, very spacious, with a very comfy bed and pillows and big fluffy towels. They have a club, which we went to each afternoon, where they served drinks and a great selections, of cheeses, meats, dips, breads, chocolates etc. certainly a nice way to go and relax after a day out and about. We ate at 2 of the places at the motel, the Wigmore, which was pub style and very relaxed for an easy dinner. We also ate at palm court, which was like a nice restaurant, with lovey food and great service. We also tried out the gym, which had plenty of options of cardio equipment, free weights, wt machines, ropes, kettlebells and medicine balls, all perfect for a good workout. One bit of advice while staying there, is take good note of where your room is, as if you go off wandering to the wigmore, gym, club etc, and using different lifts and stairs, then there is many corridors and it can get a little confusing but you do get used to it. Overall our stay was amazing and would highly recommend this luxury motel.",5,2018,10,31
140,Disappointing,"We stayed here on a package deal with concert tickets and were not that impressed to be honest.
I was expecting a much more luxurious experience and am sad to say this hotel wasn't in my opinion worth the money.

The bar serving cocktails was very crowded and noisy with really loud music and the seating was not very comfortable. We were not that impressed with the cocktails that we had either- they were overpriced and had no wow factor at all. 
We ate a meal in the lounge area, which was again very noisy with music playing and our group could barely hear each other speaking. After eating we ordered some Baileys and went in search of somewhere a bit quiter to sit and relax and enjoy our drinks. We couldn't find anywhere to sit and were told that we would have to go back to the lounge area.

The room we stayed in was comfortable, no complaints there but breakfast the following morning was a long wait for our order, with barely any service as we kept having to call on our waiter to give us tea and coffee. Our food when it arrived after a 45 minute wait was cold and all of us had to send it back.

This is somewhere I probably would not go back to",3,2018,10,29
140,A Classy Place for a Classy City,"Thank you to everyone who made our stay so great.  From the moment we walked through the doors through to check-out, every one of the staff were friendly and helpful.  Rooms are well appointed, beds very comfy, and the location centrally located.  Small detail, but I thought the shower was pretty excellent.  Silly, I know.  Appreciated the nightly turn-down service.  Lots of charging options for electronics, which is a nice touch.  Highly recommend.  Again, thanks to the staff for everything.",5,2018,10,29
140,"Affordable Luxury, amazing stay","Celebrated husbands birthday in London and loved the Langham so much that we hardly wanted to get out and see the sights! The club floor team made us feel like celebrities and the afternoon team and evening glasses of Perrier Jouet were a treat. We loved the pool and spa facilities and had an afternoon bike ride through Regents Park. All in all, a memorable stay and as because of the people as the beautiful hotel. Totally loved it.",5,2018,10,28
140,Excellent hotel at a great location,From start to end we had an amazing experience at this property.  Very friendly and helpful staff. The executive lounge had great amenities and snacks. The also house some very good restaurants and bar in the property.,5,2018,10,28
140,Fabulous stay at the hotel with an amazing customer oriented staff!,"This hotel is wonderful.  From the time we checked in for our 'Girls Weekend' until we checked out the staff could not have done enough to make our stay perfect in every way!  The rooms are well appointed and lack for nothing, the lobby restaurant and third floor lounge are wonderful, the Bar and main Restaurants are excellent and elegant!  A special call out to every member of the Concierge desk - you are WORLD CLASS and the best!!  Huge thank you for a fabulous trip and I can't wait to return to the Hotel!",5,2018,10,24
140,General comments,"i have stayed at the Langham over the past  20 years as it is a home away from home.
you become friends with the staff who are always friendly and happy to assist.
the quality of the beds and linen are world class.
Club lounge affords good selection of food and snacks(well worth it)not to mention good business facilities.
Artesian Bar buzzing again worth a visit.
high tea is an experience ,I believe there are 3 sittings now need to book.
centrally located and a 5 minute walk to Oxford Circus , 10 minutes to Regent Park. 
5 star ",5,2018,10,24
140,Superb 5* Hotel - Don't Bother Staying Elsewhere,"We have stayed at The Langham several times and it has always been a great experience. When in London our hotels of choice are either The Langham or The Savoy but following our latest stay we have decided that going forward it will always be The Langham.The rooms are beautifully decorated, clean with lavish interiors.The staff are excellent, polite and attentive.If you stay in an Executive room or above you get to use the Club Lounge which is a great place to relax, have a drink and something to eat away from the hustle and bustle. On this occasion we were served by a waiter called Hoi. Pleasant and polite, he couldn't do enough for us. Lovely guy.We had breakfast at the Roux and it was as excellent as always. Great hotel.",5,2018,10,22
140,Luxury in a great location,"This is a wonderful luxury hotel in London. We stayed in a larger room with club lounge access. The food and beverage in the lounge were exceptional, including the wines available. The entire staff could not have been more friendly. The room was well appointed and very comfortable. The hotel location is very convenient. Very close to tons of shopping. Five minutes walk to Oxford Circus Underground with access to three different tube lines for great access throughout the city, The hotel is classy but not stuffy. Expensive but a nice splurge for any visit to London.",5,2018,10,21
140,Perfect stay ,Myself and 2 colleagues stayed at the hotel for an event we had nearby. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. We were taken upstairs to a private check in where we were shown the club lounge and all it has to offer. It works similar to the Ritz properties in that if you book a particular level of room you have access to the lounge where you can have a drink and sample food. It's highly recommended. Our suite was beautifully appointed with everything you could need to make your stay comfortable. Sadly we didn't get an opportunity to access the swimming pool but are already planning a visit for leisure in the near future. Thanks for a perfect stay!,5,2018,10,21
140,Luxury and posh,The environment within hotel seems to be leaning on due to its design and expensive things to be around. If you are not used to stay at the hotels of the same class you would feel yourself uncomfortable.,5,2018,10,18
140,Nice hotel but service standards could be better,"We visited for my partners 50th birthday weekend and were really looking forward to staying at the Langham. As I say in all my hotel reviews I’ve stayed at 5 stars across the world so it takes a lot to impress me.

It is fair to say that the physical aspects of this 5 star hotel lived up to expectation with the room and its facilities clearly to a high standard. We had everything you would expect and a very quiet room as requested.

The issue is that the quality of service from the staff was off the pace at times. 

We walked into the hotel past at least three male staff and no one engaged us or offered to help us with our large cases. One man was actually on his phone texting or emailing someone. 

The receptionist while talkative actually provided no useful information at all ie where one could take breakfast and what time. The basics you get at most 4 star hotels. We were essentially dismissed as they served the next customer.

I had asked for a surprise to be placed in the room as it was my partners birthday - there was a mistake with it and I told guest services when they did a routine phone check. It took a couple of attempts before the member of staff understood my point and whilst a verbal apology was offered it was clear they didn’t understand the gravity of what I was saying.

At breakfast the Resturant was clearly under staffed. Our waiter was running around all over the place but this meant we waited patiently to place our order. This would be understandable at a 4 star but not a 5 star when you expect the highest levels of service and the right staffing levels. Lots of people standing around looking pretty but not actually serving or clearing.

The best interaction was on check out when the receptionist was clearly used to working in a high end hotel, was engaging and helpful.

I will probably visit the Langham again to give it the benefit of the doubt but only once. 

In the end it’s the service you are paying for at these iconic hotels as they really need to ensure the staff are up to it.

The problem I have in grading this place is that it is better than average but not really very good. It is better than just good so I’ve gone with 4 stars or very good. Hope that makes sense.",4,2018,10,17
140,Perfect London escape,We surprised my son with a trip to London for his 8th Birthday and The Lanham was the perfect choice. We had a lovely time and used the Club extensively for breakfast and afternoon tea between visits throughout the city. The room was comfortable and large enough to accommodate my son in a roll away bed. Artesian had great cocktails and the large dining room was a lovely place to have breakfast. ,5,2018,10,16
140,"Wow,great room and service",The Langham hotel in London USA magnificent place. The rooms and common areas are beautiful The breakfast can be in a full service or partial service buffer. Both wonderful. The concierge staff was outstanding never steering us wrong. A great hotel to stay in,5,2018,10,16
140,A lovely stay,"We were very suprised when we got there. the videos/photos you find online on behalf of the hotel, or of travelers don’t do it justice. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the amazing smell and sense of calm. 

I would have given it five stars, but when we got there we were asked if we wanted to be in the “Regent Wing”. Not knowing, we said it was fine. The front desk told us it was recently remodeled and the rooms were bigger, so it sounded perfect. After only one night we asked to please switch rooms. It was so noisy, you get all of the traffic sounds from the street below you, and the room is so dark. The bed seemed to be some older piece of furniture that was upholstered m, a bit lumpy and hard and the layout of the room was awkward. The bathroom had an older shower that you had to step up into (like with the plastic bases from the 90’s) and being 5 months pregnant found it a bit uncomfortable, and dark, since the bathroom didn’t have any windows. 

As soon as we were switched to the main building our whole experience changed! The bedroom we were placed in had a magnificent view, lots of light both in the bedroom and bathroom. Gorgeous light colors in the decor. We were so comfortable we barely wanted to leave the room. 

The breakfast in the tea room is a bit poor, but the breakfast at Roux at the Landau was fantastic. We preferred this buffet/table service, and had breakfast there every day. 

Our next visit we would definitely stay there, but knowing now, we would ask to be in the main building. 

They had the cutest teddy bear for us upon arrival, as we were celebrating our pregnancy.

140,Best Hotel in London!,"The Langham Hotel is the best I’ve ever seen in London! Top service,friendly staff always clean and every pound worth! Never had such a service in London before! We will come back again thanks for everything!",5,2018,10,15
140,Superb Hotel,"Hotel incredible, staff amazing, location fantastic! Everything about the place was great . The rooms are comfy and are well equipped, while also maintaining the charm of the historic building. Location is superb",5,2018,10,15
140,Lovely hotel; warm and helpful staff,"The hotel is charming; beautiful decor, plenty of staff to assist and who were always willing to help.  The hotel is extremely clean, elevators were efficient and rooms were comfortable, attractive and clean.  Housekeeping does a lovely job, and the nightly turndown service was very nice.  We booked a family room and the first night there was another family above us with a child who felt the need to jump around every 3 hours.  When I told the front desk, I was provided a new room immediately and this was no longer an issue.  Concierge was extremely helpful.  The only thing that would have brought this hotel up a notch was an afternoon tea or mingling for the guests.  The lobby is a little broken up, small sitting areas to the left and right, check-in out of the way (nice feature) but we've stayed in a few Auberge properties and small details like a small tea for the hotel are just really nice touches that go a long way.  Overall a great property and wonderful stay.",4,2018,10,15
140,Glamorous surroundings that charmed.,The public areas are exceptional. The service seemless - the aftenoon tea was delightful but the bar snacks prooved a little lacking in choice and  served slow. The staff were well trained and helpful.,4,2018,10,13
140,"Food was excellent as the service was too,nothing was too much trouble for the staff.The pianist played lovely tunes.","We arrived for lunch in the Palm Court restaurant,although we did not have a booking we were shown a table almost immediately and our luggage was taken as we were not staying at the hotel.The food was extremely tasty and was served when we required it.
I would recommend this restaurant and one of the best that I have eaten in and I have eaten in many hotel restaurants and none come close to this one.I am very keen to book a room here in the near future and am looking forward to doing so.",5,2018,10,09
140,Servant's Quarter of Downton Abbey,"When you walk into the Langham, it is grand indeed.  We were there over the Christmas holiday and the lobby and downstairs facilities were magnificent--akin to the grandness you would expect from a Downtown Abbey-esque building.  From the awe-inspiring architecture, to the décor and down to the cute pink suits some of the staff wore, entering the Langham was a sight to behold and was every bit of a five star experience, but the lobby and the common facilities is where that five star ends.  We reserved the entry level room and when we walked in, we were appalled.  There appeared to be what may have been a blood stain on the curtain, the bed mattress had caved in on itself and there was hair in the tub. I used Downtown Abbey as an analogy, but I doubt seriously, even Mr. Carsen would have tolerated a room in the servant's quarter in such a state.  The staff member who came to view the room, said she was disappointed and surprised.  Later, the staff came by with a list of rooms in the same category to choose from and had us wander around the hotel to inspect them ourselves (it was around midnight and I was not feeling well).  

I debated a 2 or 3 star rating, but as a five star hotel the Langham must be held to a higher standard.  The staff did try to make amends and was kind enough to send me a hot tea, because they knew I was fighting a cold/flu. But I'm still perplexed as to the Langham's rating on trip advisor.  I can only assume that the higher level rooms are the antithesis of our room.  I find myself avoiding Langham hotels when booking in other cities, which is why I was compelled to write this review.  I value the tripadvisor ratings and use them frequently and it is only fair that I provide a review of our experience, which was less than stellar. In summary, the common area is magnificent and five star all the way, the entry level room was abysmal, and the staff was above average, but a five star hotel has to be excellent in all of those categories.  The Langham was not.",2,2018,10,08
140,"Great location, great service, breakfast to improve","Location is perfect
Lobby is stunning. Bedroom very comfortable . Customer care on high level. You feel welcomed and recognized.
The pub is top for last beer 😁
One point to improve: breakfast is simply too prohibitely expensive. Expresso and coffee is simply awfull😖😖. 
",4,2018,10,08
140,Incompetent front desk. ,"Couldn’t believe it but our room was not ready when we checked in.  Front desk treated it like this was standard operating procedure for a five star hotel.   Small things continued to go wrong.  We needed to get the air conditioning fixed.  When they brought an additional luggage rack , they didn’t bother to ask if they could put the suitcase on it.  Staff seemed untrained for that level of hotel.... just saying. ",1,2018,10,07
140,Best Afternoon Tea with the sweetest waiter Matt,"Wow, afternoon tea today was the best I’ve ever had, and I’ve been to quite a few. The best thing about afternoon tea has to be the service. Attentive and informative. I have to say Matt went the extra mile for us, and made our friends from Malaysia feel very special. He handled our table with elegance and humour! Matt was brilliant, a real sweet guy! I would recommend a visit here for the amazing experience and if you get Matt serving you it is an added bonus! A credit to Langham’s! ",5,2018,10,07
140,Worth staying at.,"Stayed here for four days on business with my partner and generally speaking have to say I like it given the prices of London hotels in comparison to the level of quality and standard here.

We availed ourselves of the Club lounge where all the drinks and nibbles were included and have to say the staff were excellent, polite and courteous.

Did not get the chance to use the pool etc as time was tight for us with business and plus the fact it was a bit of a hike from our rooms but all in all a very good and high standard for the price given it is a high-end London hotel.

Only gripe here is we had to wait for rather a long time at one f the restaurants for dinner as they were rather busy.

Only negative about this hotel is the shower was never much better than tepid heat.

Did mention this and was told it would be looked into but found out from one of the staff that it is an ongoing issue with the hotel.

End of the day, clean rooms GREAT mega size beds, good customer service.

Will stay again but will get a room closer to the pool and hopefully closer to the hot water feed for the shower.",4,2018,10,05
140,Great experience,"Definitely worth a visit on your own or business partners. For any purpose, great service provided and superb care of customers. Delighted to stay here and will be back here soon for sure. Definitely recommend.",5,2018,10,04
140,Langham London,"The Langham London is a great old ho.tel close to the West End of London.  It is a very high end and relatively expensive hotel with 24 hour room service and several great restaurants and bars.  The front desk staff is amazing and the Concierge is second to none.  If you are looking for an old word elegant 5 Star experience in London, then the Langham is the place for you. ",5,2018,10,03
140,Great Hotel ,"Had a wonderful time in this gorgeous hotel. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Beds and linens were comfortable. Our only remark would be not to stay in the lower floors of the regents wing. Room was dark and noisy, however upon hearing our concerns we were moved to the 5th floor of the main building and enjoyed our stay immensely. Will return ",5,2018,10,03
140,Tony,"Definitely one of the best customer service ever , i need to mention Concierg,doormans was fabulous.
I liked the juice they put outside, I actually missed that place hope soon i will go again because they make me feel like family",5,2018,10,02
140,A Very Impressive Hotel,"The Langham is a beautiful old hotel originally built in 1865 and renovated in recent years. The rooms that serve meals are lovely - the lobby is tasteful - and the rooms themselves are comfortable and immaculate. But what we found most striking was how good the service was. From Mate' at the front desk, who checked us in and welcomed us at 11pm to the concierage who cheerfully helped us with everything to the woman who cleaned our room to the wait staff for breakfast - all were not only competent but kind and friendly. It was a pleasure to stay there.",5,2018,10,02
140,Beautiful property,"Beautiful hotel in a great location to visit London. The rooms are small but luxuriously decorated and the breakfast was excellent, albeit pricey (but hey, it's the Langham - hardly a surprise).

My one and only complain was how bad the in-room Wi-Fi was. One expects a hotel of this caliber to have better connection for their guests.

Other than that, all great.",5,2018,10,02
140,Excellent stay at a beautiful hotel.,"This was our first visit to The Langham London. We were extremely pleased with everything. The staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs. Our executive room was faultless it had more than we required. Complimentary toiletries were the best I have ever had. Nice little touches such as slippers and robes. We will certainly stay at the Langham again and have already recommended to friends.
We were in London to celebrate my sons birthday and we are still in ore of our Langham experience. We will be back.",5,2018,10,01
140,Best hotel in London,"We stayed for eight days in a deluxe room (701). This is my third stay at the Langham, and the hotel continues to meet the highest standards of quality and service. If the location works for you, I don't think there's a better place to stay in London.

The Langham is located at the intersection of Soho, Mayfair, Marylebone and Fitzrovia.  It is a five minute walk to Oxford Circus, from where you can take the tube to virtually anywhere in London in 20 minutes.  There were always cabs waiting outside the hotel, and it never took us longer than 5 minutes to get an Uber.

Our room was spacious (certainly by European standards), very well appointed, and well maintained. It had a large bathroom with a separate tub and shower.  There was a big window that could be opened (although not fully), so we had plenty of natural light, a view out over Marylebone and Mayfair, and fresh air when we wanted it.  The bed was comfortable, all of the electronics and lighting switches worked, and the room was clean.  The flat-screen TV had all of the local channels.  Housekeeping showed up twice daily like clockwork and kept our room neat and clean for the entirety of our stay.  

Service throughout our stay was great and prompt, and it seemed like the hotel always went the extra mile to ensure we were happy.  The hotel honored our early check-in request (which we made ahead of time).  Food at the restaurant and in-room dining were both great. The fitness club was also very well equipped, and the pool is quite large and great for doing laps (it was shockingly empty every time I went).  Drinks at the bar (Artesian) were delicious, and the bar was usually pretty full right up until closing. 

Wifi was a bit spotty at times, maybe something that needs to be looked into, but it worked well for the most part. I'll certainly be staying again on my next trip.",5,2018,09,30
140,Great location and good service,"We stayed here for a weekend and the hotel lived up to its brand. Service was impeccable, the rooms were clean with good amenities. The only area we thought needed improvement was the business centre. This is an open area and lacks privacy. The printers did not quite link up to the computers and did not come across as being user friendly. There was also no attending staff and we had a little trouble trying to scan some documents. ",4,2018,09,28
140,A Gorgeous and Classic London Hotel,"This hotel feels like total luxury throughout. The staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming, the rooms are lovely, and the location could not be better. Worth every penny to stay there. They also have an excellent bar with bartenders who make high quality cocktails. I can't imagine NOT staying at The Langham on my next visit to London!",5,2018,09,25
140,Great Service from this Luxury Hotel,"Treated the family to 2 rooms this weekend..what truly great service from  all the staff.  Nothing was too much trouble from walking us to our room, recommending a great tapas restaurant to the doorman standing out in the rain to get us a taxi. It's truly a 5 star hotel , although the cocktail bar prices also reflect this. Had one of our best nights sleeps and would return again without question.",5,2018,09,24
140,50th birthday treat night ,"My husband booked us here as we have stayed in many many hotels in London and like to try other ones that come highly recommended. We weren’t disappointed! This hotel has it all. Fantastic location and a beautiful building, high quality rooms, fantastic bar and by far the best service we have had for a very long time. I only wish we had told them it was my 50th! 
We will return here. We really appreciate good service and this hotel is the best we have ever received in London and is up there with some of the best we have received around the world. ",5,2018,09,23
140,Good location however rooms are old,"Services are excellent and the location is nice, few minutes of walk to underground. Few touristic attraction in walk distances. Room was allocated facing the main roads and slightly noisy. Rooms are quite old although the reception mentioned the rooms were renovated. ",5,2018,09,22
140,"Lovely, friendly hotel","Stayed here just one night. Very comfortable and clean. Staff were all very helpful. Room was very comfortable with a well stocked minibar, a little expensive fir some of the items. Had breakfast in my room it was wonderful. Would recommend if you want peace, quiet and pampering.",5,2018,09,22
140,"Fabulous location, wonderful service.",A one night stay at this wonderful hotel was definitely not long enough! The room was classical decorated and a great size. Immaculately clean and the staff were very helpful. Make sure you also try the high tea! ,5,2018,09,21
140,Great stay,"We had a minor issue when checking in but, that’s when Babtiste Bas, the client relation manager stepped in. She took  charge and. diffused the situation immediately by taking charge. She took us to the bar, and asked the hostess to take care or us while she took care of things. She returned a while later and asked to start all over again : she then said Welcome to the Langham and took us to our room. In the room we had a bottle of Perrier Jolliet champagne and delish fresh fruit. 
She certainly is a big asset to this organization. In the concierge desk: Martin and Sebastian were a great help with tour reservations and restaurant recommendations. 
The hotel has a great location, the breakfast service is very good in all the restaurants but, Reoux (?) menu was the best. The service, however was excellent in all the restaurants. One regret was the formal restaurant was closed Sunday and Monday. Our room in the second floor was somewhat small but, very comfortable with all the amenities that one expects from a 5 star hotel. All being said, what makes this hotel what it is, is the staff, their concern for the guest and to be as helpful as they can be.  ",5,2018,09,21
140,Amazing Stay,"Let me start this review with few inputs for the hotel management:
- Clearly tell the guests about the operational hours of all the restaurants for breakfast (they have 3 restos, if I'm not mistaken). I was late to my appointment because I waited at the wrong restaurant for breakfast. Later when I was finally at the right resto, I only had 10 mins to eat. The staffs were very kind tho, they offered me to-go breakfast but sadly I had no more time to wait.
- The housekeeping time. Maybe I was also at fault for not knowing the usual housekeeping hours at 5-star hotels in London (?) but I was very surprised finding my door was locked at 9 pm when I returned from sightseeing. The cleaning staff couldn't speak English well so she didn't explain to me in details. Only after contacting the receptionist, they explained to me that 9 pm is normal for housekeeping service. That's a big surprise for me though. I mean, I clearly don't want my door to be knocked at 9 pm when all I want is rest. Hahaha.

Finally, the things I love about Langham. EVERYTHING. The location was great, very reachable from underground station. They have McDonald's nearby which is great when you're hungry at night. The breakfast menu at the main restaurant (in front of main entrance) was amazing. The staffs were really helpful and giving me the best service they could.",5,2018,09,20
140,A+ in all regards,"I stayed here for two nights while attending a conference.   Service is exceptional - check-in, conceirge, front desk, club, etc.    Rooms are a nice size and well laid out.  AC and water pressure were both good.   The gym is well equipped.

I recommend and would stay here again.",5,2018,09,19
140,Stay at Langham,Excellent - will definitely return - Everyone there was so friendly and the hotel is gorgeous. The renovation truly shows. Check in was seamless and we were a little early and our room wasn't ready and they bought us all drinks in their lounge. ,5,2018,09,19
140,Best afternoon tea in London!,"Had afternoon tea as a birthday treat with my family and it will be something I will remember forever. We received such a warm welcome from all the staff who were all so attentive and friendly too. The hotel was opulent and the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, no stuffiness or snobbery here! My eight year old daughter was catered for just as much as the adults and her sandwiches arrived in the shape of jigsaw puzzles and her dessert arrived in a way she could construct it herself complete with a chefs hat and a cuddly Hamleys teddy bear to take home. As it was my birthday Alex our waiter surprised me with a birthday cake curtesy of the hotel which was so lovely. If that wasn't enough as we were leaving Alex presented me with a caddy of Langham blended tea to take home! An amazing experience I would thoroughly recommend",5,2018,09,19
140,Beautiful property in the heart of London!,"This hotel is located in the best spot in town; on the doorstep of Oxford/Regent St but hidden away from all the noise. Afternoon tea was super, and we enjoyed cocktails in the bar as well. Breakfast at the Langham is a real treat, not to be missed. The dining room, the service, and the food are fantastic. My only negative about the hotel is size of the room. For the price tag, I expect even a small bit more (to have space for large suitcases at least), but this didn't spoil our stay and we have booked to return again to the Langham in December this year.",5,2018,09,19
140,Fantastic experience,"We wanted to try this hotel eventhough over in our budget but we stayed her for two nights and no Regrets, it was amazing, the hotel decors, ornaments, lighting is of top class. The bar served nice cocktails with  relax Ambiance yet busy place. The room was great with all amenities we needed. The location of the hotel is so central next to shopping street and shopping mall. Was great service and we are glad we tried. Wish to come again but must save up alittle bit.",5,2018,09,17
140,A Timeless Treasure,Our stay was an absolute delight  The room was spacious and well appointed  The staff was gracious and attentive to our needs. They went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed for a pleasant stay.  A very convenient location close to tube    stations and shopping. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,09,16
140,Afternoon Tea  in the Palm Court,"My niece and I spent a relaxing afternoon enjoying a magnificent Afternoon Tea in the Palm Court. After enjoying at least 20  High Teas every part of this Afternoon Tea was 5 star. The delicious sandwiches, melt in your mouth scones and multi element desserts went well with our pots of English breakfast and 150 year Anniversary tea. Our waiter Alex provided exemplary attentive service and went beyond when he found out I was visiting from Australia.  A perfect afternoon.",5,2018,09,16
140,"Overpriced (fancy location and lobby, rooms are old and dingy)","I stayed here for business in February 2017. I'm sure our company chose the cheapest rooms for us but the room was tiny, and old fashioned (=dark and small) and extremely noisy, you could hear all the sound from the street below. I felt it was overpriced for the value although it is a very nice location and I understand it is a historic property.",3,2018,09,15
140,Exquisite,"My partner took me to this hotel as a birthday treat. It is sheer British luxury!
A traditional and cosy bedroom, big bathroom and the staff wait on you hand and foot. We enjoyed bubbles in the room and complimentary chocolates, and a hand written card from the management to welcome us.

Breakfast you can choose from two restaurants and the food choice is brilliant and tastes fantastic. Was a wonderful treat and would love the chance to stay here again.",5,2018,09,12
140,Great hotel in the center of London,Great hotel in central location with very friendly and professional staff. Inner courtyard views nothing like as good as rooms with external street view. Have used the hotel many times and will use it again. Breakfast at La Roux is excellent and team outside who greet and help with transport and luggage are exceptional ,5,2018,09,12
140,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"My daughter booked afternoon tea for me as a birthday treat.
On arrival we went to the bar first and sat and enjoyed a drink before going into the lounge for our tea. 
We were shown to our table which was in a lovely position near the pianist.  Our waitress was very friendly and told us all about what the tea consisted of and different options. We started with a glass of champagne which was perfectly chilled. The sandwiches were delicious and the cakes and scones beautiful and we both chose Jasmine tea which was constantly re filled. I was given a chocolate mouse cake with a candle and Happy Birthday written on the plate which was a lovely surprise.
I have to say we couldn’t manage to eat all the cakes so they were packed in lovely pink boxes for us to take home.
This was probably the best afternoon tea I have had ... everything was perfect ... great food and staff who provided excellent service in a warm friendly manner. 
It isn’t the cheapest tea but in this case you pay for what you get and I would certainly love to visit again one day. 

",5,2018,09,11
140,"Comfortable hotel , well located and good service","Good Location, complimented by a very good service team, especially Rodrigo at check in. Rooms and bathrooms were comfortable and house keeping did a good job to keep the areas neat and tidy during our stay. In room amenities and hotel facilities were very good too.
Wifi throughout the hotel was good. Pool, steam and sauna were in great condition and staff in those areas was very helpful too.
Tea at the Palm Court was great experience, Alan was very helpful.
Our room was located opposite a housekeeping service area so the mornings were noisy. I'd recommend to avoid if you're planning on sleeping beyond 9am.",5,2018,09,11
140,Very good experience,"The Lanesborough and The Goring had filled up and British Airways had a connection to the hotel through their frequent flyer programme, so I gave the Langham a try.

Overall a very good experience with helpful staff.  The bar does not reflect the same “woody old world” atmosphere of the Lanesborough’s or The Goring’s equivalents, but for what it is, it is very good.

The room was clean and comfortable and always serviced daily to a high level.  Lacking the personal touches of the Lanesborough and the Goring (staff and doormen not greeting you by name, etc) but having repeatedly stayed at the other hotels perhaps that expectation is unrealistic for a first stay.

Convenient and close to Regent Street shops and Harley Street clinics.

Overall a good experience and one which I will repeat in October 2018 for 10 days to further compare.",4,2018,09,10
140,Perfection,"This is by far a hotel that can be described in one word  ""Perfection"".  From the welcoming doorman to the front desk registration staff, to the valet, to the concierge, everyone was over the top professional, friendly, accommodating, sincere and caring about our stay.  The exquisite room, the guest service, the spa, the dining and late night lounge and music could only be described again in one word ""Perfection"".   ",5,2018,09,10
140,Wonderful all-around experience,"We have been to an anniversary retreat in London (for the 4th time), and by a mile, this had been the best stay.
I can't emphasize enough how professional and welcoming each staff member is. The room was comfortable and well decorated. Breakfast was rich and tasty. The location is absolutely great, being so close to everything and to a metro station, the entire London experience is at your disposal.
We will come back, I can assure you.",5,2018,09,10
140,"Friendly, efficient and very centrally located","We chose the Langham because of its central location (in the heart of London's West End shopping mecca), its facilities (including a spa with 16m long indoor pool and fitness facilities) plus the convenience of in-house eateries. We found all of this plus a few positives we hadn't anticipated - namely, a 'best practice' pre-arrival e-Mail exchange, universally friendly and helpful staff (incidentally, exclusively non-native English speakers) and efficiency at every turn. So, why not the full five points?
1. We found the beds to be too soft and, since this hotel is otherwise so good, a choice of matress stiffness would have been appreciated
2. There were no reading lamps by our bedside. Further, we were unable to extinguish fully the one (dimmable) bedside light there was
3. Good as the hotel pre-information was, it failed to point out that those guests intending to use the spa extensively should locate in the Regent Wing (the closest and most convenient access point).
We're confident the sheer professionalism of The Langham will address these points quickly and that, the next time we come, we can award the full five points. Viator Coloniae",4,2018,09,08
140,"One of the best in London, must stay. ","I stayed in The Langham during one of my business trips and it was the best experience I had in any hotel. The Langham is luxurious, the restaurants and bars are great, it’s location in the heart of London is very convenient, the service is excellent, the staff are friendly, very helpful, accommodating and courteous. I needed a small meeting room on a very short and last minute notice and the staff were able to accommodate a meeting room for me and my guests. I highly recommend it for your next trip to London. ",5,2018,09,03
140,Christmas treat (better late than never) - continues to be superb,"This visit was part of our Christmas present to our son and daughter in law. As ever the hotel and staff exceeded expectations with the levels of service and quality. If you can push yourself to book (executive?) suites, I thoroughly recommend it; it adds the executive club to the experience, offering quality wine, dainty food, terrific service and comfort to an already thoroughly luxurious treat. The Langham remains firmly in the top two of our favourite hotels - world class...",5,2018,09,03
140,Spa break,"My daughter booked a spa day so I decided as a treat we’d stay the night.

The spa was gorgeous and we enjoyed our massage and facial. The facilities are excellent.

Perfect location for Oxford and Regent Street shopping all within walking distance.

The Christmas decorations were beautiful.

The cocktail bar was busy but great atmosphere and decor.",5,2018,09,03
140,Romantic Luxury Trip,"Our stay at The Langham in London was the best vacation stay to date. This hotel is above and beyond. It starts with the staff that is so welcoming and inviting. Our server Joana in the restaurant where we had our daily English Breakfast was a dream. She was so great to talk with and really made our stay and meals heavenly. The restaurant is so beautiful. The food (made to order is preferred) is delicious. The hotel is gorgeous. And the location in Central London is minutes away from Liberty London and all the Shopping you dream of doing. Raquel was also amazing at the concierge and started out trip beautifully. The room was also dreamy and comfortable. Ahhhh that bed is amazing! All in all, 10 stars",5,2018,09,01
140,Perfect,"From the time you step in the door with personalized scent filling the entrance and beautiful pink roses everywhere I definitely will be back. Service is outstanding and food was lovely, more options/ variety on menu would be good in restaurants and room service. Room was excellent and bed was very comfortable. Will be back. The spa massage was amazing and my therapist was excellent.",5,2018,08,29
140,excellent service,"I represent a VIP client that visits London several times a year. We have been in ALL of the top hotels there. This was the first time we tried The Langham. My client reported that everything was perfect--the rooms, the food, the atmosphere, and the service. We had special Kosher requests for dining, and many particular needs for observing the Sabbath. The hotel and staff were completely accommodating on all accounts and met every single need with professionalism, Thank you!",5,2018,08,29
140,Excellent ,"Excellent hôtel with great service. The room is spacious, the breakfast is delicious and the staff is always there to help you. Lovely stay close to plenty shopping places. Looking forward to come back !!! ",5,2018,08,27
140,Few nights at Langham London,"One of the best hotels in London. Great service, the restaurant and one of the highlights is the breakfast room with the most amazing buffet. If you are staying at this hotel make sure to ask for a Portland place view :)",5,2018,08,27
140,Delightful children’s afternoon tea,"We visited the Langham Palm court for afternoon tea to celebrate my daughter’s third birthday and it truly was the highlight of our trip to London. After an iffy start where my daughter accidentally knocked over and broke a champagne glass it quickly became the most wonderful experience. The staff made us feel so welcome and relaxed. The children’s Hamleys afternoon tea was beautifully presented and delicious. Eloise was especially taken with the jigsaw shaped sandwiches. The adults afternoon tea was equally delicious. The staff knew it was Eloise’s third birthday and made it so special even playing happy birthday on the grand piano and bringing her the most gorgeous rose shaped birthday mousse cake that looked like something out of beauty and the beast. She was over the moon. Getting to take home a hamleys teddy bear was another lovely treat. It really was an afternoon to remember, thank you..",5,2018,08,27
140,Beautiful hotel!,"We spent one night here. The hotel is stunning, all public areas were beautifully decorated and clean with a calm atmosphere. All staff we met were helpful and friendly.

The location is perfect and our room was well appointed and comfortable. Plenty of toiletries and towels with an excellent turn down service.

We didn’t use the bar or  restaurant facilities on this occasion but hope to return.",5,2018,08,26
140,2 Night Break,"Stayed at the Langham a good 10 years ago & was extremely excited to return as it was a real treat staying here.

We had a a warm welcome from the receptionist & shown to our room, which I have to say was extremely small, but had everything you could possible need in there.

We had drinks in the bar, which were served by lovely attentive staff & had a great atmosphere.

We had breakfast on the morning we left, I would have to say that is what let the stay down for me... we were shown to our table. But unfortunately the staff who were working that morning found more interest in laughing and joking amongst them selfs than seeing to the guests having breakfast, for me staying in this type of establishment I would expect more professionalism.

Also on checking out as I was sat waiting for my car , the receptionist was having a conversation with someone who needed to pay more of deposit ? The phonecall was blunt & to the point and then after she put the phone down it was obvious she was not best pleased so much so her colleague had to rub her arm and tell her to calm down... again ? Not what you would expect ?

All in all I feel the start of my stay was wonderful  but I left with a slight sour taste in my mouth ? 
I would just expect more professionalism than what I experienced.  ",3,2018,08,26
140,My Fab one night stay,"For my third trip to London, my shortest trip, I stayed at the Langham. Situated on Oxford street and walking distance to most high end shops and good restaurants , I am glad I decided to stay the night here. The decor and interiors of the hotel is elegant and classy. The lovely lady who checked us in (and checked us out) at the reservation was so kind and understanding. I was with my mum, we stayed at a standard queen sized bed room. By the time we arrived to our room, it was already turned down for the evening. Everything in the room was neat, orderly and yet so cosy. We had breakfast at the Roux, amazing service and amazing food. 
It was a short stay and I am definitely coming back to stay here the next time I am in town.",5,2018,08,24
140,Langham I Love You!,"At last a London hotel that really pushed all my right buttons.

Upon arrival I was skillfully and smoothly assisted first by the doormen and then the receptionist. These people really knew how to do their jobs - well done to management for training and retaining such great staff!

My Executive Room had good light and even a glimpse of the London skyline, on the seventh floor. A good size of room with a very pleasing bathroom. The shower gushed deluvian amounts of lovely warm water. Everything was well-maintained.

The Executive Club was on a completely different level to a Hilton! Great quality food and drink. Worth the money. More free champagne sir? 

The Langham Bar was busy, but the lady in charge was very good at sorting things out and we snagged a table almost immediately. Excellent booze. Had a lovely Armagnac and some fun cocktails. Good place for people watching. And thank heavens there was no blaring music.

I managed to get my room at a good price and felt I got great value for my money.

I loved everything about The Langham and hope to return.",5,2018,08,22
140,Lovely Place for a Quick Getaway,"This review is long overdue. We were there in February. The Langham is a fantastic property that is centrally located to everything in London. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Yes, the rooms are small but hey it's London. We particularly loved the breakfast in the club lounge. English Breakfast Tea was to die for. Undoubtedly, the best we have ever had anywhere in the world. Also, we got to meet James Cromwell, an amazing actor, in the lounge. A lovely human being. I look forward to staying at the Langham in the near future. ",5,2018,08,22
140,Top class hotel,"This hotel is really one of the best hotels i have stayed in around the world, everything is just perfect the location,cleanliness,services everything is excellent.This hitel will be my first choice in my future visits.",5,2018,08,22
140,Dinner,"This was our first visit . We came on Saturday evening for an early dinner. We were not disappointed. The restaurant staff were second to none. The meal ,from start to finish was a tastebuds delight .",5,2018,08,20
140,Fantastic for families,"We just returned from four nights at the Langham in August 2018. We stayed in a ""family room"" which was spacious enough to comfortably accommodate our family of five. We arrived to a table full of complimentary treats - a fruit bowl which was replenished daily (apples, plums, bananas, grapes, peaches, a few things I have never had before) - an adorable Langham teddy bear and golden rubber ducky for my youngest, plus tons of chocolates and sweets and snacks for the older kids. The whole staff was extremely kind and helpful, from the doormen to the reception to the restaurant staff. Breakfast at the Roux was sumptuous - heartbreakingly perfect pastries, eggs, cappuccinos, etc. etc. The hotel is centrally located - Regent's Park is a short walk away and perfect for children with multiple playgrounds, a children's boating pond, etc. The British Museum is also close by, as are the shops of Oxford Street and Regent's Street, the theater district, etc. We walked everywhere and loved coming home every evening to our home away from home - can't wait to return!",5,2018,08,19
140,Amazing,"This was our precruise hotel chosen by Regent cruise line. We stayed several days before our cruise.
The hotel is beautiful; the foyer area, the hallways, our room and especially the Palm Court restaurant.  Exceptionally clean, everywhere.
Five star service from everyone, the front door staff, the cleaning staff, restaurant staff.
Special thanks to Raquel at the front desk who went the extra mile to get us a handicap room.   Everyone we met had a big smile and a kind word.
My mother walks slowly and with a cane. She was treated with the utmost patience
by everyone.
We had several  meals in the Palm Court. Very good selection for the buffet breakfast and the dinners were very good.  No need was unmet, no coffee cup unfilled.
I would not hesitate to return.",5,2018,08,18
140,Fabulous!,"This luxurious hotel, is one of the finest places we’ve ever stayed in. The service was top-notch ,and even by the front door and taxi stand ,was a refrigerator with bottles of water and an ice tea dispenser each and every day. It was incredibly hot outside, and they catered to our needs daily. Hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms beautifully appointed and bedding extremely comfortable. I noticed when we first arrived, guests and obviously returning guests, were being greeted like old friends by the staff. I understand why, because I would go back again in a second. ",5,2018,08,16
140,Great hotel ,The Langham is a fantastic hotel. A bit pricey but also high quality. Rooms are large and clean. The service great. Good restaurants and 24 hour gym. The location is of course magnificent close to shopping and sightseeing. ,4,2018,08,16
140,"Luxurious hotel, they went over and above my expectations!","I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights, Luxurious room style, felt very comfortable, big bed with lots of pillows, bathroom with plenty of room and fully equipped. Delicious breakfast with luxurious presentation. Amazing personnel and concierge staff, excellent location next to Oxford Street and all the best places in London. 
It is also near to the nightlife but at the same time in a quiet area where you can stay away from the chaos of London. Thank you all for your great service.",5,2018,08,15
140,Fantastic Hotel - Amazing Service,"We stayed here for a surprise weekend for the other half on her birthday.  This place is fabulous - absolutely luxurious; great breakfast;  staff are very attentive and nothing is too much trouble.

the rooms are fantastic, spacious and has everything you need.",5,2018,08,13
140,Fantastic Stay at a Magnificent Hotel,Beautiful hotel with exceptional service.  Every interaction with every Langham employee made us feel like the only guests in the hotel.  Great location within walking distance of shopping and the tube.  The rooms were nicely sized and beautiful.  The breakfast buffet was one of the highlights of our stay - phenomenal personalized service from the staff.  Nice pool to unwind in after a day of sightseeing.  Will definitely return to the Langham on our next visit to London.,5,2018,08,12
140,Afternoon tea,"We were celebrating a significant anniversary with a trip to the theatre preceded by afternoon tea at The Palm Court.  Excellent service throughout from reception to the table, including taking our wet umbrellas of off us.  A calm and relaxing ambience with a pianist playing in the background an eclectic mix of songs old and new.  From a set menu, we had a selection of sandwiches, pastries and scones with a choice of teas to accompany each course.  This was followed by a small cake, which we hadn't the room for, so they kindly boxed it up for us!  We were delightfully surprised when they presented us with a mousse which, regrettably, we couldn't do justice but was delicious nonetheless.  An absolute treat in an oasis of quiet provides a wonderful restorative from the bustle of Oxford Street.",5,2018,08,10
140,Ultimate in Luxury and service!,"Great location! Walking distance to great restaurants. The hotel is not rivaled in service. There isn't anything you can't ask of the concierge or staff, that they won't assist or accommodate. The rooms are just beautiful, quiet, and comfortable.",5,2018,08,09
140,Excellent service and location,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay. The Palm restaurant was very good and we loved the staff and drinks at the Artesian bar. From reception, security, and restaurant servers to management - service was excellent. The rooms were very comfortable. We had booked two connecting rooms via Expedia and there was a miscommunication. Expedia only requested adjoining rooms. Not to worry - management worked it out for my family of four. Only dings were the tub and sink that didn't drain properly (but it was fixed immediately upon reporting), the weird shower half door which left water everywhere (but this is a common problem across all of Europe - not sure why they hate shower doors or curtains :), and no simple, buffet or continental breakfast included. However, I have since purchased a Nepresso machine after enjoying Nepresso daily in the room. While the porters were extremely friendly, we also had an issue with our departure to the airport. The porter highly recommended a car over the tube/train - said it would be quicker on a Sunday and cost roughly the same. Turns out it took longer and cost us over $150 more :( Nonetheless, we would happily stay there again but always take the train and tube. It's a good location with great coffee and juice shops nearby (Paul and Joe and the Juice) and close to the Tube. Kids loved the pool too.",5,2018,08,09
140,Even for a critic like me this was very good indeed !!,"My wife and I are very prolific travellers and are fortunate to be able to experience most of the top end hotel operators. We have stayed away from Langham for several years due to a very unsatisfactory experience in one of their hotels across the other side of the world.
 
For my wife’s birthday this year we were looking for a hotel in Marylebone/Mayfair as most of the events we were attending were in this area. Looking at the map of hotels The Langham jumped out as being ideally situated, with consistently excellent reviews. So, despite our previous experiences with the group we decided to go for it !

Things didn’t start well, with some not very good handling of my initial enquiries. As a result I asked for the situation to be escalated. I am glad I did. I was connected to Lourdes, the Guest Relations Manager, who from that moment on was truly outstanding.

We had booked a 1 Bedroom Suite for 2 nights. On arrival we had been upgraded to the 1 Bedroom Residence, which was larger, had a very nice kitchen area, and great views across to the BBC building, Post Office (Telecom ?) Tower and All Souls Church.

The suites - and perhaps the rest of the rooms -  and the corridors & public areas appear to have had a quite recent upgrade/refurb and are in really great shape.  

Throughout the stay my wife’s birthday was noted several times. Lourdes had even arranged for our favourite English ‘Champagne’ – Nyetimber – to be made available (complimentary) for us in the Club Lounge and our room. Now that is truly 'over and above' service.

The Club Lounge is a great facility, and dependent on one’s needs, is well worth upgrading to. Whilst the F&B selection isn’t quite up to the best RitzCarlton/Four Seasons Clubs, it is still a classy place. The lounge itself is very pleasant and relaxing and the food served, whilst not being particularly extensive, is of a high quality. The complimentary wine selection is also pretty good.(I tried plenty - purely for research purposes you understand ;-) )

It is worth noting that if the breakfast provided in the lounge is a little limited for one's needs then breakfast can be taken in the main restaurants at no extra charge. 

All of the staff we met within the hotel are genuinely charming, but the Club Lounge team are truly delightful. Also Lourdes, the Guest Relations Manager is outstanding – I do hope the hotel knows how very fortunate they are to have her.

Would we stay again – yes, subject to our location needs The Langham would be our hotel of choice in this part of London, and if our wallets/credit cards can stand it, access to the Club Lounge is a must !

I am the first to admit that I can at times be very critical when it comes to hotels & restaurants. I have to say though that the couple for nights we spent in The Langham were very enjoyable indeed.

PS - note to Manager - sort the Hotel Car situation out - the service is vastly inferior to our experiences with the other hotel groups I have mentioned !",5,2018,08,06
140,Location and luxury - ticks the right boxes ,"My mother and I decided to visit London for a weekend (without young children or husbands) and chose the hotel as we were looking for somewhere which stood out from other hotels and I think we found it. The hotel is in a fantastic location, tucked away at the end of Regent Street and has a welcoming ‘feel’. 

The decor is attractive and consistent across the hotel: Palm Court is very pretty and offers afternoon tea as well as standard lunch/dinner times. 

We waited in the Artisan Bar while our room was finalised (we were a bit early) which was ok for coffee and would be gorgeous for evening drinks. 

Over the weekend any requests were met very quickly and generously (additional slippers in alternative sizes/ extra toiletries) and the room was quiet and well considered. Rooms have toiletries, a safe, a Nespresso and capsules, tea making facilities, note pads, pens and slippers/gowns. Sadly no shortbread (Only eaten in hotels when it’s placed with the teacups!) 

We used the spa area for swimming and the sauna and steam room but not the treatments. This was effortless - no locker coins, flip flops, towels, toiletries - combs, dental kits etc - I just needed a swim suit and face moisturiser. The pool itself was quiet on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, and easily accommodated Lane swimming and relaxing. 

As a side (but important) note, the hotel were very quick to address a concern about afternoon tea (separately reviewed) and very informative and generous in rectifying it. 

We found staff in every area (spa/reception/cleaning) approachable and friendly. Separately, my mother and I enjoy visiting new locations and hotels but we have planned to make this at least an annual Summer visit as it was so enjoyable. 

",5,2018,08,06
140,"The Langham, London - good but not great ","In town for a party, and we were  looking forward to our 3 night stay.
The Langham in London is a beautiful property. The rooms are lovely and the dining and reception areas are wonderful. 
The location can not be beaten! The service is a low point. Kind of surly and curt. And this was consistent - from front desk to waiters. The bell hops were the friendliest and most helpful. 
The dining is great. Breakfast is especially lovely and the dining room is gorgeous. 
Saying that, we had booked though Amex FHR and the front desk totally messed up our bill at checkout and it took three attempts for the front desk to correctly remove the FHR property credit. 
This may be our unique experience and I am sure there are plenty of guests who love this hotel. For us, there are other options in London that we prefer and would return to. ",3,2018,08,05
140,Amazing hotel,"Stayed for one night with my mother in law for a gift we had won in a prize draw. 
What an experience, from the moment we arrived the service was outstanding from every single person we come across. 
The actual hotel itself is huge and lavish. The location is perfect for everything, and the room very comfortable. We loved having a cocktail in the gin garden and breakfast in la roux restaurant was delicious. 
Given the chance I would love to return with my husband so he can experience a truly amazing hotel. ",5,2018,08,04
140,Show off Luxury,"I travel +100 days per year and usually stays at 5 star hotels.When in London i prefer The Milestone. But this time I decided for The Langham.
The Langham is lavishly but somewhat generic designed hotel. My room was quite big to be in London. And the SPA/gym was fine.

However, the service are not up to other five star hotels and cannot compete with The Milestone lacking in Personal touch and genuine feeling. The crowd and guests are more of the show off type and new money than taste and class. This is also something than can be felt in the atmosphere. The Langham feels more like Moscow or Dubai than London.

If you are up for a generic luxury hotel with new money feel you should go for The Langham.",4,2018,08,03
140,Amazing Hotel,"On my regular trips to London I finally found the perfect Hotel.
Rooms like everywhere in London are relatively small but overall nice and practical.  One improvement would be a shower instead of the bathtub, which is a bit steep to climb in.
The amazing thing is the friendly service and the breakfast.
Staff wherever you see them seem to go out of there way to help you. Even if a glitch up occurs the hotel immediately will rectify it and apologise.
Breakfast is absolutely great, as it is served in 2 locations, its never crowded. No feeling of being squeezed. The quality of the a la carte breakfast is very nice. All served by  helpful nice people who can remember your choices from the second day. Will be back again",5,2018,08,02
140,Lovely Hotel,"What a great hotel this is, great service, great food and in a great location.I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a nice hotel in London. Its location for Central London is ideal, close to the main shopping places.",4,2018,08,02
140,Birthday Cocktails,"Nice stay at the Langham. Classy hotel in a central location with excellent celebrity restaurant tacked on and its own adjoining pub. Welcoming reception, but room was a mile away down winding corridors and 2 elevators. Adjoining room door so we could hear our neighbours plus no fresh milk in fridge spoilt it somewhat, but amazing cocktail lounge helped to recover a star for this review. Would stay again but ask for better room location and try more cocktails.",4,2018,08,01
140,Nice hotel in the centre ,"We stayed in the Langham Hotel for a weekend in July. The location of the hotel is perfect, close to shops and sights. 

The hotel is nicely decorated, well kept. 

The room we had was nice although on a smaller side. The bed was comfortable. 

The service was ok although we were a bit disappointed by a couple of things. We would expect more attention from this kind of hotel, e.g. the receptionist  just gave us the key without  any explanations about the hotel, we had to ask to get basic info.  The similar thing happened at breakfast which seemed to be half buffet style and half a la carte which we were not aware. It was not a big deal, just a bit of disappointment.

",4,2018,07,31
140,At Portland Place,"For this price and its reputation (top notch in Shanghai), I was a little bit disappointed.

Requests (restaurant bookings, change in room nights) through emails before arrival were great but upon checking in we were faced with all foreign staff with foreign-English accent.  I understand that they’re there because of the international clients and I have nothing again (nor for) foreign staffs but from my experience with other 5 star hotels, good English should be a priority.

Why? 
Because 2 of our rooms were “up graded” but only one was charged additional amount of almost 100£. The reason for the upgrade was because they were full!  It’s not our fault so why did we have to pay extra and why did we only have to pay for one room and not the other?!!
And when we requested twin beds for all our rooms (total of 3 rooms), the receptionist said she will make sure of it.

We didn’t get it!

The next day we requested again (to another foreign staff) and we were again assured that it will be done (even after I emphasized that it’s 1 bed at the moment), he said that the house keeper can separate the beds into 2 beds.

Again when we returned at night, we didn’t get it!!!  We tried to rationalize the reason, it’s either the receptionists didn’t know that the hotel doesn’t offer twin beds or they didn’t proceed with the request (at both times there weren’t any queue).

The luggage collection upon check out took about 20 mins.  

Some staff were friendly, not all.

The rooms were nice and clean with sufficient amenities.   Had coffee machine but then most 4 stars hotels in Europe has one too so.....

Room service food were great!!! Swift and tasty.

The location is great too though my sister witness a women being mugged (bag snatched) right outside the hotel.",2,2018,07,31
140,One of the best hotels I've been to,"I've had my fair share of stays in 5-star hotels and I have to say the Langham is up there with the best of them. I love the decor of the rooms and the bed was so incredibly comfortable it was actually a struggle to wake up in the morning. I love the location of the hotel which is minutes from the busy Oxford street yet it don't feel all of it's hustle. 
Breakfast was amazing and all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.",5,2018,07,30
140,Almost a five star..,"Check in was seamless, lovely personnel greeted us and made us feel welcome. One of the staff members showed us up to our room and gave us tips on where to go shopping, etc. We booked a family room, which was very spacious for our family of four.

The room is a little old, the carpet is worn in some areas. The bathroom is fairly comfortable. Quality of towels need to be improved, some are worn or have stains.

We booked through fine hotels so breakfast was included. We ate at the Palm Court every morning during our stay. It truly was a lovely breakfast and the personnel were amazing. Specifically, I want to compliment Edily and Matt, who were so kind and attentive. The bartender at Palm Court made fresh juices for my daughter every morning. I’m sorry I didn’t get his name because he was so kind. I would also like to compliment the concierge for helping us with dinner reservations.

The location of the hotel is very nice, with many shops and restaurants nearby. I can’t give this hotel a 5 because I feel like the rooms need to be tidied up considering how much you are paying per night.",4,2018,07,30
140,Average,"The staff was extraordinary nice, helpfull and cared a lot about the hotel guests. But there were some issues with the room and the hotel itself. The make up mirror in the bathroom was not mounted properly, the plastic handle for the curtains was broken and sometimes there were stains and small holes in the bed sheets. The spa is wonderfull and a pleasure to use but it was very far away from our room and every time the London underground passed by you could feel vibrations and there were some tiles missing at the pool. One escalator was out of service as well and the air conditioning didn't cool the room sufficient.",3,2018,07,28
140,Langham Hotel,I love this hotel it is my second visit to The Langham Hotel the service is fantastic the rooms are gorgeous and the Langham Lounge package with food and drink available at all times was great and the staff are so attentive. My mum is in a wheelchair and they were so helpful nothing was to much trouble. Thank you Langham we will definitely come back for a third visit!  ,5,2018,07,27
140,"Great location and facilities, but small rooms.","We stayed at the Langham for 4 nights to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary.  We had booked through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts and had high expectations for our stay.  One of the perks was supposed to be a complimentary room upgrade, and unfortunately this wasn't available for the first two nights of our stay.  Worse, there were rooms available at a couple of room levels above ours, but the hotel policy wouldn't permit them to upgrade us (in contrast at our hotels in both Berlin and Istanbul, we were upgraded multiple levels above our original bookings without any concern).  The room we were assigned was fairly small, and the shower didn't have a full enclosure causing water to leak out all over the floor.  The bed was also a bit soft for our tastes.  On the positive side, the breakfast was wonderful as was the high tea (which was apparently originated here at this hotel).  We really enjoyed the scones, sandwiches, and selection of fine teas offered.  The room service menu was expansive and the service was great as was the food quality.  The hotel fitness center and spa facilities were also top notch.  The location of the hotel was really great, just a quick stroll to the Oxford Circus underground station and the shopping all around, including Carnaby Place and the stores on Regent and Oxford streets.  Overall, while disappointed with the unusually stingy upgrade policy, our stay was very pleasant and enjoyable overall.",4,2018,07,23
140,Nick60,"5* luxury is a given. You are pushed to find fault here. I took ny wife for our anniversary and was completely satisfied. Thank you London Langham., we will come again. We went onto the Palladium to see the King and I plus had afternoon tea. It was very special.",4,2018,07,23
140,One night stay,"Excellent hotel.. 
Staff to be proud of
Every little detail was though about
Roux at the Landau was all it was meant to be.... room was very comfortable. Bathroom was excellent. Lovely pool in basement. Would stay there again when in London",5,2018,07,23
140,Staff not professional - Good facilities ,"There are no enough staff, the facilities is good. The gym staff is rude the lobby has not much varieties. The rooms are well equipped and room service was fast. The concierge never answers the phone, they are always busy.",3,2018,07,23
140,Pure Luxury,We stayed at The Langham for 2 nights as a surprise for my Mums 70th Birthday. The room was fantastic and the beds were so comfortable. The service provided was 5 star from the reception staff to the doormen and all the staff at The Roux. My mum had a fantastic time.,5,2018,07,22
140,Excellent Luxury Hotel,"We stayed at the Langham, highly recommend the hotel, excellent staff, nothing too much trouble. Lovely rooms, spotless clean and well appointed with air conditioning.  Lovely bathrooms, robes and slippers.  We have an executive room which allowed access to the Club Lounge that was excellent.  The swimming pool and health spa lovely and a well equipped gym. Highly recommended London hotel.",5,2018,07,22
140,Incredible disappointment,"We have been very disappointed with our stay for a number of reasons. We booked a junior suite with access to the club lounge. We arrived at 1.30pm knowing that check in was 3pm but thought we’d ask just in case. We were told our room wasn’t ready which was fine, we figured we could go to the club for a cup of tea and wait. We had chosen the Langham because it bills itself as a dog friendly hotel however it’s about as dog unfriendly as it gets. Dogs aren’t allowed in the lounge we were told, not just the part where food is but anywhere at all, so we couldn’t wait there. They aren’t allowed in the restaurants or anywhere else either. The guaranteed check in time of 3pm came and went and we were told it would be another 30 mins. It ended up being an hour past the guaranteed check in time. 

If you are planning to come with a dog, expect to pay £70 per night for the dog. We’ve stayed with our dog in luxury hotels in the US, UK and around Europe and this is double the price we’ve paid anywhere else and it doesn’t get you anything at all. No dog bowls, bed or treats. We always bring our own anyway but it’s somewhat unbelievable that the price is so high without any of the things every other hotel provides when they charge for a dog.

The air conditioning wasn’t working when we finally got into our room, or if it was it was so weak we couldn’t notice. The floors and ceilings don’t seem to be insulated so you can here the footsteps and movements of everyone above you and to either side. There are only two small lifts for all guests and they use them to transport luggage as well so expect a long wait. We took to walking down 6 floors instead.

I’d suggest you give this a hotel a wide berth, especially as there are many other great options in London.",1,2018,07,22
140,Suite Life at The Langham London,"Having stayed at The Langham before I was excited to see what my return experience would be like. Would they remember me? Would they know what my favourite room is? 
The answer to both was yes. I thoroughly enjoy coming back to The Langham, from the moment you arrive up until the moment you leave, it truly feels as if it's all about you (well it is after all, right? Ha!) 

With a bottle of my favourite champagne as mentioned, in a fleeting comment when I departed last time, was eagerly awaiting my arrival. I absolutely love the personal touches, the preferred fruit (another passing comment which had been noted). 

I thoroughly enjoyed the exclusive lounge access which is only available for use when booking particular rooms, where I enjoyed endless complimentary champagne and other food which was available for your enjoyment.

I love how peaceful and calm this hotel is, not to mention the decor throughout. Wonderful staff and an extremely relaxing lounge to enjoy away from the hustle and bustle below. Should you wish to venture downstairs for cocktails you can, however there was something serene about having an exclusive lounge upstairs. 

Definitely a worth contender if you're looking for luxury in London.",5,2018,07,21
140,"Great Place, Great Location","The hotel is beautiful and the location exceptional to all the wonderful gems of London.  However IMO the greatest asset of The Langham is the staff. From the time of our arrival, Neil was there to great us with a warm smile and helping hand. We arrived early, so our room wasn't ready. While exploring the hotel, Anna the Bar Manager took it upon herself to be our personal escort. She showed us everything and was lovely, setting us up for a wonderful lunch at The Wigmore (IMO one of the best pubs in London). Further more, my 8 yrs daughter loved Anna and we would visit her at the Artesian every chance we could. It was so nice to visit her and her staff after a long day at work. ",5,2018,07,20
140,The place to stay is the Langham London,"We have traveled the world (6 of 7 continents multiple times) and experienced many different luxury hotels.  The Langham London is a place that scored five stars in every area. Guest service foremost, beautiful and well appointed rooms, fast and lovely room service, delicious food in the restaurants, creative cocktails and friendly bartenders in the Artesian bar, and the list goes on and on.  The Langham also helped to arrange very comfortable and luxurious Mercedes Benz sedan transportation to and from the airport for us. The hotel itself is very well located alongside Regent Street, blocks from Piccadilly, near the subway station and a block from the Hop On Hop Off tourist bus pickup which can take you to virtually every sightseeing spot in London at your own leisure. Many restaurants and high end shopping are nearby. A perfect location and exemplary staff.  We will definitely stay here again next time we are in London.",5,2018,07,18
140,Amazing!,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  The service is top notch, the decor of the hotel and rooms is lovely, and the location is perfect.  During our stay, my friends and I visited the hotel bar, which is really fun and serves great appetizers.  I 100% recommend this hotel to friends, families, couples, etc!",5,2018,07,18
140,Awesome - going back next week!,"The Langham Has been my favourite hotel  in London for a long time.  I used to travel to London on business and always stayed there.  The location (near Oxford Circus), the exceptional service, the nice rooms, are all reasons to go back.  The history is fascinating - it was the largest and most modern hotel in the city in the late 1800s when it was built.  My wife, daughter and I were there a few months ago, in a wonderful suite (they very nicely upgraded us from a junior suite).  The room was great, spacious, well appointed.  The lounge was spectacular.  Great breakfast, champagne all afternoon and evening.  Exceptional service.  

And of course, you cant not mention the high tea in the Palm Court.  And the terrific martinis!

When you stay at hotels like the Langham you have high expectations.  The Langham does not disappoint.

Looking forward to come back next week!",5,2018,07,17
140,Changed a bit and for the worse I'm afraid,"We always look to have a few nights in the Langham when back to the UK, this had become a bit of a family tradition for us. But after our last visit we had to look elsewhere for a final night back in London and will probably try other hotels now. 

With the Langham the service was always above and beyond, so a slight slip in service has a real effect on how you perceive a place to be. 

Anyway, our experience was such; we travelled the best part of 20 hours from Tokyo, via Moscow and got to the hotel late. When checked in it wasn't noticed that we'd stayed at the Langham many times. We got given 332, which made me chuckle as I almost expected to get 333 which has a fun history if you know the hotel as well as we do. Anyway, 332, was a pokey little business traveller style room, with no bath, only a shower. We're from Japan, we like to have a bath, we also had a 2.5 year old with us, try taking one of those in a small cubicle shower and see how interesting that can be. We tried to change, but this was at about midnight and we were told the hotel was fully booked, no real apology, just felt businesslike. Next day we were moved, but it still felt wrong, travelling all that way, being a repeat customer, getting fobbed off with a room which clearly didn't fit our expectations as a travelling family. 

We had to book a hotel for our final night in London due to an early flight, so we looked at the Landmark and was really blown away by their service and quality of room, so much so that we might not be such great fans of the Langham any more, shame really as it was as much a part of our stay in London as anything else we did.",3,2018,07,15
140,No longer the same Langham..,"
Room Access: keycards failed to work on two occasions (no we did not keep near a magnetic strip!), the last thing you need after a long day..

Bathroom: bath slow drainage problems, toilet flushing continuously after pressing, quite honestly not the standard you would expect...

Housekeeping: on two consecutive days, they would leave 4 dental kits despite there being a total of 5 guests, know your customer(s)?!

But most disappointing would be the lack of follow up by the guest relations team. Yes we received a “standard” message card and some complimentary confectionary however what would have been a better solution would be a face-to-face conversation on the issues experienced.  

One saving grace would be the helpful Concierge and Bell Captain teams.  I would suggest the other members of Langham who happen to be the face of the Hotel take a leaf out of their book...

 ",2,2018,07,15
140,Hotel excellence in London,"Recently spent 4 nights at The Langham Hotel in London. Can't speak highly enough of the staff who are all amazing from the doorman to the chambermaid but a special thank you to the customer relations manager Faisal, whose unfailing good humour and helpfulness make you feel like a valued customer. The rooms are extremely comfortable, the bathrooms luxurious and with Regent and Oxford street around the corner the hotel has everything going for it including 2 fabulous dining venues, Roux at the Landau and Palm Court. Having stayed at The Goring (similar price point) 9 months ago, where the rooms are smaller and The Dining Room disappointing (service top notch though) The Langham is the place I will be returning to on my next trip to London. Love love loved it.",5,2018,07,14
140,Another great stay,"This is the fourth summer in a row we've stayed at the Langham. The location, comfortable rooms, and fantastic staff keep us coming back. We stay in their basic ""Superior"" room. It is nicely appointed with good air conditioning, a must in our recent summer visits. We'll be back.",5,2018,07,13
140,Absolutely fantastic,"Stayed for a night in an executive room, which included access to the fabulous Langham Club.

Location: superb, just off Oxford St so very central and just a short stroll to be in the midst of everything.

Room itself: modern, stylish and clean.  Huge, comfortable bed.  Many plug sockets (and for different country's plugs) avoiding usual arguments over whose electrical items get priority for charging.  Bathroom was also generously proportioned with a large, powerful walk in shower and a bath.  Interesting books on the bedside tables (I particularly enjoyed reading about the hotels history). Nice touches such as delicious peaches to eat alongside the conventional small box of chocolates.

Swimming pool: a calm oasis and although obviously small big enough to swim 'properly' in.

Langham club: Amazing, definitely made the stay.  Fantastic service from all staff, delicious afternoon tea and evening canapes and the continual impression that nothing would be too much trouble,  Great cocktails.

Our stay was made extra special by the thoughtfulness of Ani, who on learning it was our anniversary left champagne in the room and more generally was just exceptionally helpful - she is the kind of person you wish every hotel you stay in has.

This was the first hotel in the UK whose service/standards were comparable to those of the Oberoi's in India - a fantastic achievement making for a fantastic stay. I hope to return.",5,2018,07,13
140,Excellent location,It doesn't get much better than this. Spent 8 nights here is a suite. Room was a very good size with an excellent bathroom. Housekeeping did an excellent job during my stay. Staff were all very helpful. A special mention about the Club Lounge. Expertly run with very attentive staff. Food and drinks we always on hand and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The Club Lounge is a true asset to The Langham.,5,2018,07,12
140,Won’t go back,"Was put in a handicap room (wheelchair friendly) which I explained I did not want because the showers usually don’t have a lip so water gets all over the place. And what happened?....water was all over the place!! I’m sure this room would have been perfect for a guest who actually needed it, but we didn’t. 

Additionally, the floor in the entry was parquet so we were quite surprised that it was STICKY when we arrived from a long day at Wimbledon. Disgustingly sticky!!! Unacceptable.

The bell staff was super friendly and attentive, and one of the front desk attendants was helpful when I needed access to their business center. Other than that, we were quite disappointed. Will not return and will not recommend to others.  

The Artesian lounge was overpriced and pretentious.

Location was perfect for Regent Street if
you’re into that scene but we should have stayed at our original small luxury boutique  hotel in Chelsea where shopping was just as good if not better but definitely more charming. The one benefit of The Langham location was its proximity to the Underground and Soho. At least there was character in Soho. ",1,2018,07,12
140,Lounge mostly makes up for room,"My husband and I had a brief one night stay for a layover.  We booked an executive room to have access to the lounge.   

While the room was large and the bed was extremely comfortable, I was very disappointed with the outdated bathroom.  The shower was tiny (and I'm only 5'-1"") and the general decor does not come anywhere close to the description or pictures on the website.    Also, although the room was quite large, the layout was impractical and there was only one lounge chair.   A better arrangement of the furniture could have easily created a seating area for two.   Fairly minor, but the outlets in the bathroom are not compatible with the hair dryer plug, so you have to use it in the room which is inconvenient.  Honestly, if we had been staying for longer than a night, I likely would have asked to change rooms. 

The Langham Lounge, however, is fabulous and goes a long way to make up for the shortfall of the room.  The lounge staff is is absolutely fantastic.   The food and wine selections are quite good and the design is lovely.   

Bartenders in the lobby bar are also great.  Very talented mixologists and we enjoyed a few creative cocktails.  

All in all, the rooms seriously need improvement for a hotel of this caliber.  But the lounge is amazing and we would come back solely for that.  
",4,2018,07,11
140,Afternoon Tea,"I come to London every summer and I look to have Afternoon Tea at different locations. I was not disappointed here at the Langham hotel. I had tea in the Palm Court- was very well done. 
The environment is very upscale but you are not made to feel that you do not belong.  The service was impeccable as was the food and tea. I would recommend getting the glass fo champagne - you are there so why not?
Please make sure to make a reservation.  Dress is business casual- I would feel kind of odd wearing shorts to a formal afternoon tea, but some people did. 
Cheers. 
",5,2018,07,10
140,Luxurious hotel with great service and an excellent Conciege staff,"We spent five nights in the Langham Hotel and had a great stay. It was our first time in London visiting from the states and the Concierge staff went over and above in helping us plan excursions, select restaurants and guiding us in navigating the city. The afternoon tea is a definite must as well as cocktails in the bar. We had breakfast every morning in the hotel and the buffet was amazing with lots of options for our kids. The indoor pool is stunning and very unique. Our kids loved swimming after a long day sightseeing. We can’t wait to return to the London and the Langham.",5,2018,07,09
140,A Week in London,"We have stayed in this wonderful hotel before, but not during recent times. We were delighted to see the many improvements and refurbishments that have been mad during our absence. Our room was clean, tidy, well though out from a guests' perspective and comfortable. Great sleep, revitalising shower and thoughtful little amenities, we really enjoyed it. The internationally diverse staff are friendly, attentive and professional. Everyone was really helpful and easy to interact with. One very special enhancement is The Langham Club, which is the hotel's Executive lounge - this is very special. A creative space, which exceptional service from a motivated team. Special thanks to Hoi, who is a remarkable hospitality specialist - cheerful and attentive. If you could clone him a few times you would have the best possible service everywhere. Well done Langham team.",5,2018,07,09
140,An oasis of calm and great service in the heart of London + an outstanding Executive Club,"The Langham has been on of our regular ""go to places"" to stay when visiting down-town London for business or pleasure.  It is located in the heart of the city and in one of the more posh quarters there, and its impressive facade oozes style and grandness.

Upon getting out of my Uber, I was immediately greeted by the attentive staff and offered to have my luggage carried. That good, initial service impression continued to the person opening the door for me, the staff inside welcoming me and offering to help me find my way, as well as along all other customer touch-points along the way. Clearly, they understand what great and genuine customer service is about here.

The interior design continues the classy, sophisticated erstwhile style impression, and a few, short minutes later I found myself on my floor and room.  The rooms are of the high caliber one simply expects from this class of hotel and cover all bases well.

Aside from the great location, service, top culinary opportunities and amenities on offer, one of the key reasons we continue to come back to the Langham is its executive-level club.  Fellow travelers will know such exclusive clubs and lounges from the various upscale Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Interconti etc. counterparts.  However, the Langham's club is in its own league.

The club provides a well-appointed oasis of calm in the middle of the busy down-town London bustle, and I always feel immediately at ease here settling down in a comfy lounge chair with a nice freshly-made coffee and enjoying the serenity.  Indeed, the club is ideal for small-group meetings and for more animated or larger group meetings I make use of the separate executive meeting-room, which is upstairs from the main club.  That location offers total privacy.

In short, I will be sure to make use of the Langham hotel and its Club on future visits to London and highly recommend the location to fellow travelers for similar purposes or simply as a temporary stop between engagements or travel destinations.",5,2018,07,07
140,Excellent stay,"Most beautiful experience I have had the pleasure to stay in this fabulous place. The bars, the room the restaurant, the food was an experience beyond expectations. The location was terrific for shopping and sightseeing.",5,2018,07,07
140,Great expectations: exceeded! Fabulous all around!,"This was a special trip, my kids first time in London (5yr. and 2 yr. old) and I wanted them to fall in love with the city. So while I come to London a few times a year for business, I did my fair share of research for this trip. I wanted an historical property with plenty of character and surely the Langham delivered: with over 150 years of history, the property is beautifully preserved. Known as the first ""Grand Hotel"" of London Charles Dickens wrote about it, Princess Diana was a recurrent guest ... the hotel becomes a large part of the experience, a destination of its own. But what is beauty without function even more while traveling with small kids? well, the Langham also easily exceeded my expectations on the more practical side: 
(i) our executive room was the largest room I have had in London (king bed, plus roll away plus portable crib with room for two sofas, desks and play area). It was an impeccable sunny room with open views. And included kids robes and teddy bear slippers! (kids loved them, insisted they wanted to wear them for sightseeing); 
(ii) my now favorite executive lounge in Europe. The Perrier Jouet kept flowing and my kids had endless glasses of warm milk. Breakfast and afternoon happy hour were fantastic (oh the scones!). The team at the lounge was simply incredible, particularly warm to my kids and just ahead of our needs all the time; 
(iii) a great size pool for adult swimming as well as for kids splashing! 
(iv) great service all around (room service, front desk, bellman) 
Highly recommend!",5,2018,07,05
140,Wonderful hotel and service,"I traveled to London for business and was joined by my spouse and son.  We stayed at the Langham for 8 days and were really impressed with pretty much every aspect of this hotel.  We stayed in an executive king room with club access - the room was very spacious and well-appointed, and I appreciated that a separate bed had already been made up for my son prior to our arrival.  (My son was also impressed by the child-sized slippers and bathrobe and basket of snacks that awaited us!)  
The club is a tremendous benefit and I wish we'd used it more.  The breakfast spread is fantastic, featuring pastry as well as eggs, breakfast meats, smoked salmon and fruits, and although the afternoon/evening spread is lighter, the salads were really delicious, as was the charcuterie.  We also ate ate the Wigmore, which was good for an afternoon snack while watching the World Cup, and had high tea at the Palm Court, which was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  The children's tea was really special, and my son - who usually can't sit through a quick dinner - happily snacked on jigsaw sandwiches and a really cool DIY pastry course for hours.  The Artesian bar is also excellent and bartenders Alex and Sarah really went out of their way to create a fun, hospitable atmosphere.
The location of the hotel is overall very good for getting around central London.  My one complaint - and this is in no way the fault of the hotel - is that the area as a whole is not particularly kid-friendly, and we had a hard time finding restaurants nearby that were suitable for us as a family.  Happily, the Langham's room service menu is extensive and delicious!
If you have a chance to stay here, I would highly recommend it.",5,2018,07,05
140,"If you check in late, then send you to a room of nowhere","I stayed on Monday of the week at 4pm and the staff gave me a normal room in the main building. Everything was fine and lovely. When I came back on Wednesday night checking in at 10:00pm. They sent me to the old wing with the old room. It took at least 15 mins from the lobby back to the room. You will pass through conference room and staff working area.  Air-conditioner in the room has loud noise. It was old designed while my male collageaue has a room in the main building. Is it a sexual issue ? I don't know and cannot answer it. Everything in the room looks aged. I paid the same room rate of my colleague and why I stuck in the old wing. The staff even claimed that it is the best room and is closed to Regent Street. I come here for work and not for shopping. I asked the reception to change the room. They claimed the occupancy of the hotel is 100%. Maybe he thought that I am an idiot, no hotel will take 100% occupancy in case of emergency happened. I don't know whether is the hotel owner's fault and i will send him a direct email as a formal complaint.",2,2018,07,04
140,London weekend get away,excellent value for money proactive and ready to help. The room set up was the best I have seen. Excellent location. The choice on dinning inside the hotel was also very good. Will definitely go back.,5,2018,07,04
140,Amazing,"The Langham Hotel is wonderful.  It's a large hotel, divided into two buildings which is a disadvantage because to get from the Spa to one set of rooms you have to wander many corridors and elevators, and to get from the Executive lounge also to another set of rooms you have to do the same.  This HOWEVER is the only bad this I can say about the hotel.  We received an upgrade to an incredible suite which was way over and above our expectations, but always a nice perk.  The staff are fabulous - each and every one of them.  It's by no means cheap but if you can go for it, I would say in this area it is the best place to stay. ",5,2018,07,04
140,"Wow, what an amazing Hotel!!!","I took my Wife here as a surprise for her 40th Birthday. I think I was more surprised than she was, talk about going the extra mile! I booked an executive room, so that we could use the Club room facilities. When we arrived at the Hotel, we were told by the front desk that we would be checking in at the Club room.  A lady, Josie, came and greeted us and took us to the club lounge and handed us over to Christina, who said 'would you like to check in over a glass of Champagne?'. She was friendly, courteous and non-intrusive. After a few minutes, she came over and told me that we had been upgraded to a suite, as a Birthday present. After a few glasses of Champers, we decided to check in. Wow, just Wow. The suite was massive. We had a large front room, hallway with toilet and a massive bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. Whilst we were unpacking, I had a ring at the door bell. When I answered it, a lady brought in a trolley with a bottle of Champagne, a box of chocolates and also a cake with Happy Birthday written on it, amazing! We went for a quick walk around Oxford Street, not for long as we wanted to enjoy the Hotel. Back into the club lounge for a few more glasses then we went and changed for Dinner, which we had booked for The Landau (part of the package was £80 Hotel voucher & 25% off!!!). Before we went we went the Landau, we stopped off back to the lounge for a glass of wine nibbles and were again thoroughly looked after. After the meal (reviewed separately) we visited the Artesian bar, which was lively, but not over powering and too loud and the staff were amazing and super friendly! After a lovely night’s sleep, we had breakfast in the Lounge and the staff were great again. I had a slight issue with my ordered eggs (they were given to someone else), but they did them again and were super apologetic. We have stayed in some top Hotels around the World, but I have to say that this has slightly edged the Savoy into 2nd place of our all-time greats! The trip wasn’t cheap, but my Wife was super chilled and thoroughly enjoy the treat, so was well worth it. We are thinking of booking again for a pre-Christmas treat.",5,2018,07,03
140,Nice but too expensive ,"Very nice location just by Oxford street.
Very expensive hotel in accordance to what you get.
There is no lobby .
The bar is nice but too crowded.
The rooms are tiny.
Breakfast are too expensive in accordance to the food variety and quality.
",3,2018,07,02
140,Outstanding courtsey and service!,"When in Central London, there is no other place to stay. Even though there was was a mix up in the room allocated to us in the beginning. It was sorted out without fuss. Then on staying at Langham was a dream. The Concierge made all our arrangements, vegetarian special food at odd hours was delievered to the room, the cocktails at the Artesian Bar were outsanding, the doorman would always be there to help with the shopping bags. The hotel itself is very charming and the service par excellence! Thank you for making our week in London so pleasurable.",5,2018,06,27
140,"""We've been expecting you!""","As I stepped out of my taxi the doorman (Bartok?) lifted his cap and said they'd been expecting me and hoped I'd had a pleasant flight.  First impressions matter.  Then the woman who checked me in happen to be in charge of the desk.  She personally showed me to the bar where I was offered a drink as my room was made ready.   Now I won't lie-- not all the service was of this caliber (had to wait a lon------g time for a salad I ordered) but life isn't perfect and it's the general tone that matters.  Lobby is lovely, breakfast room transforms into tres chic dining area for evening.  I'll   be   back.",5,2018,06,26
140,Afternoon Tea,"Great service and selection of food!

Great ambience! Relaxed environment all the staff were excellent and attentive 

Lovely music from the pianist - Will definitely return! 

Especially love the subtle touches with the Wedgwood and classic tea",5,2018,06,25
140,"Comfort, luxury and a warm welcome","Stayed on three separate occasions and keep waiting for it to not quite match up to previous visits......still waiting!  

Unpretentious, welcoming, stylish (particularly the bar which serves fantastic cocktails) and in a great location.  What’s not to love about this understated hotel? Don’t forget to book Roux at The Landau - food is sublime.   

I think I might book another cheeky getaway now.....",5,2018,06,24
140,Top hotel by world standards,"This is a seriously good hotel by any standard. Although it is in an older building with maze like aspects, the renovations have removed any real issues with this. The decor generally is now top class.

The excellent service and facilities at the exceptional club lounge are a real treat. Well worth the club room expense! See photos.

The rooms are clean, generously spaced and well resourced. 

The service throughout the hotel is excellent and actually seems realistically friendly. 
",5,2018,06,22
140,Classic London History,"I stayed at this hotel years ago, and I am happy to see that it is still well loved, and remember it fondly as a very well-heeled classic (think, Oscar Wilde, Sir Conan Doyle, Napoleon III, Antonin Dvorak, Princess Di, all of whom stayed here) with wonderful staff, beautiful rooms and a resplendent lobby. When I stayed, it was part of the Hilton family, but has long sense become its own glorious 21-century self. May she continue her reign in midtown London for another century and a half. I look forward to returning on my next London visit.",5,2018,06,21
140,Staying in Langham London was great!!,"Langham London is very close from the tube station and also close from the shopping places.
It has a very nice indoor swimming pool and the staffs are very kind and friendly. I would like to stay in Langham when I go to London again.",5,2018,06,18
140,One of my London Favourites !,"I have been staying at Langham London for the last 10yrs. I always try and get a couple nights here when im in London. The staff are great, the service is top quality and the location is perfect for me. If you like shopping and going out for dinner etc the location is the best.
The club lounge is fantastic and well worth it.
 Since the renovations have been done the gym, swimming pool etc are all fantastic.
You really cant beat the Langham London for a stay when in London.",5,2018,06,16
140,Exceptional retreat,Late spring/early summer visit. The hotel and associated amenities are without compare in central London. The executive rooms provide enough space to get a few hours of work in at the desk in the room and be close enough to local activities to still have some fun too. Staff is exceptional and concierge went out of their way to help locate a personal service for an urgent matter (local dentist). It’s these details and the quiet elegance that keep us returning to this amazing piece of history ,5,2018,06,16
140,Lovely London introduction,"Fabulous whirlwind two night stay in London.  Club Level always the way to go as in Chicago, our hometown.  Expert service delivered with genuine friendliness and care makes we want to move in.
Quality of food amazing.  We entertained a few friends at cocktail hour I had not seen in ten years from Oman.  Warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Can’t wait to return and use the bicycles when we have more time.  My husband had never been to London and I had not been in 23 years.  We truly and thoroughly enjoyed every minute and detail of our stay.",5,2018,06,16
140,Outstanding Guest Experience ,"This was our first stay at the Langham and we were blown away by the great accommodations and service. Clean, well equipped rooms.  The staff went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect.  We shall return ",5,2018,06,16
140,Amazing Customer Service & Experience!,"It’s only been 5 days and I’m still dreaming about the tea, sandwiches & scones! I booked a reservation in advance for myself for the Palm Court since i had one day i knew I’d be in London to experience afternoon tea. The day comes & as I prepare to leave my hotel, there is a demonstration & police everywhere with road blockages & being informed to stay inside the hotel due to a demonstration. Additionally, the queens birthday parade was earlier this day & London fashion week was occurring as well. The demonstration was close to my hotel in Trafalgar & moved in front of it. I called the Langham twice, since i knew my 4:30pm was the last tea time. They said they could accommodate me until 6pm but I hadn’t spoken to anyone directly at the restaurant so i was weary that by the time my Uber showed up, I’d be turned away. I showed up at 6pm after heavy traffic going 1.4 miles because of police roadblocks despite being so close & was relieved they observed my request for a table not central to the room as well. I was grateful they allowed me to be served, since I had only the day in London and the demonstrations threw my day itinerary off for the afternoon. The gentleman at the front was so gracious, whether or not I appeared flustered, I was happy to be accommodated. The service was impeccable, and i enjoyed the tea from start to finish. While it was pricey at $83 USD (55 pounds for the Wedgwood tea), if i don’t do it again, I’ll be content. First i was served the sandwiches, and ate them all, including the salmon one which is surprising since i don’t like cooked fish. The pineapple dessert in the shot glass was good, and i don’t like pineapple cooked. There was also a gelatin looking covered orange carrot cake & red one i believe was strawberry or cherry something. There were 2 more, a round one with some sort of chocolate filling and a cake-like one with a stamped langham chocolate atop it. I also ate off these. I got the Langham blend tea based upon the servers recommendation since i don’t normally drink tea except when sick & it was so delicious, i find myself thinking how I can i have this home in the states! I also tried another rose mint one.  I had heard from a friend clotted cream is delicious, and it was. I enjoyed my scones with that and jam. In all, I was pretty full. If you want to experience afternoon tea, i would recommend here. There was also a pianist to add to the ambiance. The hotel itself is beautiful as well. I had looked up others such as Dorchester, Sofitel, Savoy, Fortnum & Mason, but ultimately settled on this decision. Not to mention my fear of googling other hotels to possibly accommodate me for tea in case the Langham couldn’t, but to my relief, I was able to mark this off my bucket list. 5 stars all the way. I’ll be back when I’m in the neighborhood again!",5,2018,06,13
140,Sublime Experience,"My husband and I and our two young adult sons spent four nights at the Langham the first week of June to celebrate a milestone birthday. I booked two rooms through Amex Platinum FHR. I spent weeks researching our hotel options and zeroed in on the Langham based on reputation and reviews here, and though I rarely do this, felt compelled to add my own. Everything about our stay was perfection, from the warm welcome and rooms available for check-in before noon after a long flight from New York to the enormous buffet breakfast--included in our rate. We especially loved the bar, where we were greeted nightly with amazing, complimentary frozen drink samples, delicious bar snacks, and a wonderfully creative cocktail menu. Every staff member was friendly and conscientious-- front door, front desk, bar/restaurant, spa/pool, housekeeping. We are widely traveled New Yorkers and never met anyone at the Langham who didn't bend over backward to provide service with a smile, which hasn't been the case at all establishments of this stature. The hotel gave us adjoining rooms without my needing to request it. I checked the rate several times after booking in March and it dropped twice, and wound up with fourth night free, bringing the rate in line with many lesser chain properties I'd investigated. Little things went a long way here. I was particularly impressed that the concierge staff offered to mail my son's unstamped postcard to the states, and really appreciated the lobby staff's candid, helpful advice about our tourist travels. The beds were comfortable, toiletries top-notch, and location surrounded by convenience--shops,  restaurants, transportation, parks, tourist attractions all within easy reach. Two pleasant surprises I wish I'd known in advance: there was a power strip in the room with plenty of regular and USB outlets for our American devices, so I needn't have packed one, and the room held a beautiful book on the rich, fascinating history of the hotel, which I wish I'd discovered sooner and read cover to cover. No need to even have brought my own bedtime reading material. We will be back, and I can't imagine staying anywhere else for future London visits. Thank you, Langham, for an unforgettable stay.",5,2018,06,13
140,Fantastic ,"We’ve stayed before but not in a club room. Use of the club lounge felt like home. The actual lounge & staff were superb. Excellent choice of afternoon tea selections, canapés & breakfast. Champagne on tap! Absolutely brilliant. My one complaint is that we weren’t staying longer!! Loved every minute of it. ",5,2018,06,11
140,Good place and clean environment to stay at. Me and my boyfriend had a good time thank you. The staff were not too bad. ,"Good place and clean environment to stay at.

140,Absolute perfection,"In London for the evening with my wife for a university reunion (kids with grandma RESULT)

Stayed in a suite on the 9th floor - very very nice

Availed ourselves of the Langham Club - BRILLIANT

I have offices in UK, India, Europe, Middle East, I’m using executive lounges almost on a monthly basis but none measure up to this

The setting, ambience and service were on another level

In truth it is the service for me that sets the Langham London apart. From Ian on the door, to Racquel on reception to Hoi in the lounge they were all consistently charming and helpful

Off for a spa at The Chuan now!",5,2018,06,10
140,Outstanding,"A true 5 star experience. The staff were exceptional, especially in the Club Lounge. Our room was well appointed, lovely flowers and champagne on arrival. The facilities were good to excellent. The overall ambience of the property lends itself to a relaxing stay. One minor niggle is that the pool could introduce a specified time for young children to use the facility. Due to its size it became awkward to swim with children playing in the pool. What sets this hotel apart from its contempories is the quality of it's staff. So well done everyone.",5,2018,06,07
140,Wonderful - never disappoints. ,We tend to stay at the Langham wherever we go; and London did not disappoint. From the moment we first arrived we felt welcomed. The staff and service is first class and the accomodation second to none. The location is very convenient for exploring the surrounds. We will certainly be back. Highly recommended. ,4,2018,06,05
140,Excellent weekend break,We stayed here for our anniversary and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left all I can say is that the whole experience was amazing.  The staff at the hotel make you feel so welcome and go the extra mile to ensure everything is perfect.  We have fabulous memories and will hope to return later in the year. Thank you for a fabulous weekend.,5,2018,06,04
140,We Loved This Hotel,"We stayed for two nights at the Langham in Room 291 - a Junior Suite.  The room was beautiful and extremely quiet.  We had a large suite with a separate shower and bath.  The Executive lounge was comfortable, and convenient.  When we first arrived, tired from travelling the room was hot and the AC did not seem to work.  We were offered a change of rooms but instead we wanted to stay in that room because it was so well appointed.  Instead, we order fans and the AC did manage to cool things down.  

However the service, (particularly from Anni) was wonderful.  They accommodated our every need.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,03
140,A beautiful hotel - second to none,"A superb venue, rooms beautifully appointed and the service throughout the hotel is exceptional.  I visit so many hotels for both business and pleasure and this is definitely one of the best hotels in the world.

Having once again eaten in their wonderful restaurant, it never fails to deliver.

If you visit London, please stay at The Langham - it’s simply devine!",5,2018,06,03
140,Excellent Housekeeping and High Tea,"I love how Langham is historic and architecturally stunning. The hotel is perfumed and elegantly appointed. It is located near the center of town yet keeping a little distance for privacy.

One of the best things about it is the housekeeping, the turn-down service especially. Besides the norm, charging cords are coiled, water are refilled, a jewelry tray is placed next to your bed, your slippers neatly placed on the sides. She even noticed one of us is a bather and added extra toiletries at the tub. 

The legendary afternoon tea at the Palm Court Langham is exquisite. Our waiter, Alex, is extremely polite and attentive, patient and considerate, careful and discreet. How impressive it is for a modern young man to have an old world traditional manner. Knowing we are leaving the next day, the receptionist lady found a way to give us a table despite our sudden walk-in onto their fully booked restaurant. They do give hotel guests privilege and want to do everything they can to please. 

We stayed at the Langham for 6 days. I am quite pleased with it. I even enjoyed the Langham pen, it is encased in a floral case and writes ultra smoothly.",5,2018,06,02
140,Stunning hotel,We have stayed at some absolutely stunning hotels around a lot of the world. But this one is now our favourite.we stayed in a club room which is beautiful with stunning food and staff that are a credit to the company.we will be back.,5,2018,06,01

140,Excellent afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea at the Langham is sumptuous and very generous and it would doubtful you need to eat again that day.  

The service, setting and selection of savoury snd sweet treats is excelllent.  It is a great experience for any occasion.",5,2018,05,31
140,Perfection,"My family and I stayed in two club rooms over this weekend. The staff in the club were lovely, and were continuously making sure that we had everything we needed. The rooms were very large, and exactly what we needed to have a base to relax in after a lot of sight seeing. The clubs package was the best I have seen, with free flowing drinks all day ( bubbly, cocktails, wine, beer etc). We have been to a lot of clubs before, that only does this during a cocktail hour, and it really made our weekend not having to plan around specific times that the club was open.",5,2018,05,30
140,Superb location & facilities,"Outstanding little cation and all facilities / amenities were top notch. Will absolutely use this hotel again for both business and personal stays. 

Staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly - all in all a top notch stay. ",5,2018,05,28
140,Luxury at The Langham,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights over Whitsun bank holiday. We treated ourselves to a Club Executive Junior suite. It was absolutely wonderful. Comfortable, spacious and classy. We were treated very well and everyone went out of their way to ensure we had a lovely time.",5,2018,05,28
140,"Best afternoon, and halal.",Absolutely fabulous place. Decor was spectacular. Service was amazing. Staff friendly and helpful. Attended to our halal dietary requirements. The sandwiches and deserts were absolutely delicious. It reall is a must try for afternoon tea lovers.,5,2018,05,27
140,Superb,"Probably the best hotel I’ve stayed in...

Top draw service, rooms superbly appointed and whilst I ate courtesy of a corporate event , the whole experience was one I’d like to repeat. 

Afternoon tea is definitely something I’ll be back for.",5,2018,05,26
140,Lovely Afternoon tea with a personal touch. ,"The Afternoon tea in the Palm Court at The Langham is a definite for a treat. The offering, ambience & setting is both high end and professional. Although plush, the venue is relaxed and the pianist adds an element of yesteryear. 
We had the Wedge wood afternoon tea which includes a choice of sandwiches, followed by warm scones (plain &/or fruit) with strawberry jam & clotted cream. The final course is a selection of pastries. You also have the option of including a glass of champagne...or two! There’s also a High tea option that includes one extra course. 
They also offer over 42 different teas. 
The staff are amazing. Every one of them was friendly and chatty, yet professional. Alex looked after us and he’s fab!
The following personal touch was amazing. My friend and I book an afternoon tea once a year instead of exchanging Christmas presents. This is our 5th year and we choose a different venue each year. When Alex asked if we were celebrating anything special we told him this and during our tea he arrived with a ‘special’ rose shaped cake with Merry Christmas piped in chocolate on the plate. This personal touch and his thoughtfulness sets The Langham apart from others. 
If you’re celebrating a special occasion or just fancy a nice treat, I’d definitely recommend the Palm Court at The Langham. 
",5,2018,05,24
140,Quality venue for a business meeting ,"First time visit to the Langham and was very impressed with the service and venue. We only used this for a business meeting and have to say it’s a high quality venue. The staff are very attentive and the food/beverages are good.

The location is ideal on Regent street and very near to the BBC studios. 

I did notice the Roux dining rooms but sadly there was no time for dinner - maybe next time!!

",5,2018,05,23
140,Wonderful afternoon tea,"We went to Palm Court for afternoon tea and were not disappointed. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. The tea menu extensive (we went with the waiter’s recommendations, which were perfect). All topped off with some impeccable service - polite, friendly and just fast enough without feeling hurried. They dealt with my special dietary requirements (dairy and gluten free) with some fabulous alternatives. Recommended!",5,2018,05,20
140,Beautiful hotel throughout,"The hotel is all you’d expect from a top end London hotel. The decor is stylish throughout, rooms comfortable and the staff friendly and attentive. Great location and the buffet meals in the grand ballroom were excellent - fresh, tasty food. 

We had a question about which nuts were in a particular dish (re allergy) which staff couldn’t answer unfortunately, however there were plenty of suitable food choices and all staff were very helpful, offering to cook a alternative dish. 

Have stayed once before a few years ago and would definitely return.",4,2018,05,20
140,Nice place,"Nice place, good food, great service with a pleasant ambiance. In a convenient location for access to the rest of the city so ideal for business and leisure trips alike. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable to sleep in with little or no noise protruding through the walls on either side or the window to the outside. All in all, a good place to stay for a trip to the city. Will definitely visit again. ",4,2018,05,19
140,Stunning night at my favourite hotel,"We booked on Booking.com and got an amazing deal with my genius discount. £236 for a superior double room. I have eaten at Roux and drank at the Artesian bar but never stayed the night. On arrival the door men and reception staff are so lovely. Rodrigo on the front desk even upgraded us to an exceptional room free of charge which was lovely! Our room was huge! Massive bed, lovely bathroom, loads on info in the room about the history of the hotel and a view over Regent Street. A wonderful night in a very special hotel :) We drove there and although valet parking is offered the St Annes car park is so close and if you pre book direct online you will save about £25 and this is where your car will go anyway as they don't have their own carpark.",5,2018,05,16
140,Beautiful Hotel centrally located,"Centrally located - shopping all around.  Friendly competent staff.  Hotel is beautiful, full of history and very very clean and comfortable.  Near bus stations, underground and taxi's and uber always around.  The restaurants offer something for everyone and the service is impeccable.  A must if you can afford it.",4,2018,05,15
140,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent location, comfortable beds, superb breakfast and helpful staff. A beautiful Hotel in the Heart of London, moments away from Oxford Circus.

Well done to the management team and all the staff.  We were eight people, and we booked the Landou private dining for breakfast which was fantastic. 

",5,2018,05,14
140,Pretty & Friendliest Staff,"What a lovely hotel, and the staff is amazing! It also smells lovely all the time. Stayed there in May 2017, my best friend was getting married in London, and her and I stayed there for a couple of days for a pre-wedding girls weekend and it was lovely. We were well taken care of, and everyone who works at the Langham loves the Langham so the energy is always on point. I highly recommend it, and a plus is that the branding is pink, so you can't not be happy!",5,2018,05,14
140,The Langham - Wow's us again,"We arrived at the Langham on a really hot day, checked in, and were shown to our lovely room, this was a deluxe room and had been completely refurbished, it was lovely and restful and incredibly quiet, i slept better here than i had for weeks.  As this was marathon weekend London and the hotel was busy, but you would have never have known in this hotel.

This hotel is a five star hotel and the most wonderful thing, is nothing is to much trouble for the staff, they are not pompous like 5 star hotels can be, they treat you like royalty but are in no way arrogant.  The concierge service was great as was the porters outside getting us a taxi,

We had our breakfast in the 'Roux at the Landau' and they were amazing, the food was good in the palm court too, and i loved the handbag stand!

In summary, the staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble, and wow the Langham wow's us again.",5,2018,05,13
140,The Best,"This is the fifth five star hotel we have stayed in over the years and without a doubt the best. Elegant decor, large comfortable rooms with every amenity and the best staff in the city. I recommend the club level for anyone that can pay the extra
Charge because it is worth every penny. Have never seen a club level serve Perrier Jouet as its every day all day champagne. The breakfast is not a continental breakfast with a few extras, they have a chef making any eggs, pancakes or waffles you want. The tea service is and evening presentation with full bar service is phenomenal. The staff in the club is fantastic, thanks to Christina, Chris, Annie for everything. We also had a great meal at Roux which is in the hotel. As you can tell we can’t wait to return.",5,2018,05,12
140,Very nice hotel,"Very pleasant stay here. Service was outstanding from doorman, concierge, waitstaff and housekeeping. My only complaint is the water does not get hot at all. No matter when I attempted a shower, whether early morning, afternoon, evening, or very late at night. It at most was tepid. 
The food was very good as well.",5,2018,05,10
140,Fantastic hotel and great location,Location is superb - the hotel is located close to Oxford Circus and Regent Street and it is walking distance to Piccadilly Circus. Very comfortable room. Excellent service all around - the staff are fantastic from the minute you arrive until you leave. Federica and Baptiste at reception were very helpful.   The gym and pool are a welcome bonus. Breakfast was disappointing however the staff in the Palm restaurant were very helpful. We will stay again next time we’re in London.,5,2018,05,09
140,may Conference and pre weekend stay,"The historic Langham hotel is remarkable.  The beautiful marble entry reminds you of classic style immediately. 
The rooms are small and yet incredibly efficient.   Love the classic English bathroom.  Room was incredibly clean - kudos to the service staff - they are impeccable. Bed was incredibly comfortable.   The fitness center is small but has amazing equipment  and the pool spa is lovely !  The only negative that we needed to watch tv due to a bit of jet lag and the tv menu was beyond cumbersome and frustrating.",5,2018,05,09
140,luxury hotel and impeccable service,"We stayed here as part of a birthday treat. From the moment we arrived we were treated with a fantastic personal service, and nothing was too much trouble.

140,Amazing Everything!,"WOW! What a stay.
The staff were very welcoming on arrival, during and on departure of our short stay. Nothing was ever too much trouble. The room was in impeccable condition. Very well maintained both on arrival and during our stay. Housekeeping even sorted my sister's array of makeup and skincare supplies left upon the bathroom counter, to be arranged on Langham towels according to use and height.

Whilst we had a spot of trouble navigating through the hotel to get to the spa from our room, my sister and I found it exciting and adventurous. We were lucky enough to see a lot of the hotel we wouldn't normally see. 

Would recommend and stay again.",5,2018,05,06
140,Luxurious ,"Stayed at The Langham London. Location is excellent, it's at the bottom of Oxford Circus. Walking distance to selfridges. Room size is very spacious. Good amienties.

Will definitely return.",5,2018,05,05

140,Convenient spot in London ,"I often stay at the Langham when I am in London. They also have a hotel in New York .It is a nice Hotel walking distance from Oxford street and selfridges:) 
The rooms are spacious with a good size bathroom . (Specify that you wish for a non smoking room   although it apparently is in my profile i had to change rooms a few times ). I like  to stay on the wing where the gym and Chuan spa are located . Early check in and late check out are available something I appreciate . The food selection when ordering Room service should be improved and it should not be impossible to get a  simple vegetable soup .
The bar is a nice and fun place to have a drink.

140,Beautiful Institution,"I was fortunate enough to attend a private dinner event at the Langham with overnight stay.  It is a fabulous old building and beautifully elegant. The location, in Marylebone just opposite the BBC, is wonderful and the interior matches the exterior in terms of grand elegance. 
Front of house staff are delightful and thoroughly professional; service is highly polished.  My room was a king sized double and was very nice.  Shower pressure was limited (to reduce water usage) but slightly disappointing as a result.   All in all however, it was a privilege and treat to stay as this famous British institution.   Costs are not for the faint hearted but the experience is lovely. ",5,2018,05,04
140,"Gorgeous Hotel, Outstanding Staff","We stayed for four nights last week, and could not have been happier with our choice of hotel.  The hotel is gorgeous, the rooms are comfortable and chic, but it is the staff that makes this hotel outstanding.  We stayed in a room with access to their lounge, and it was a wonderful way to have another cozy, comfortable place to spend time - and the food and drink was excellent!  Every person we encountered, from the doorman's first greeting was absolutely wonderful.  They take customer service very seriously, but do so in a warm and generous manner.",5,2018,05,04
140,Afternoon Tea delight ,"I booked a table for 2 for a friend and I to experience the afternoon tea. I have visited many places for tea and I can honestly say, that this is one of the best in London! 
From the moment you arrived at this gorgeous hotel, you felt looked after. The stunning Palm Court location was conveniently positioned at the entrance. The customer service was superb from all members of the team, who did everything to ensure you were comfortable. The sandwiches were fresh and tasty, ( and replenished) , warm scones and a delightful array of speciality desserts with unique flavours. There was a wide selection of teas, (of which you could try more than one) to wash everything down.
The venue itself transported you back to a time of 40s glamour, with comfortable seating, tasteful decor and a pianist in the background to set the mood. They even provided individual stools for your handbag! The highlight for me was seeing the amazing kids menu being delivered, which included a Hamleys bear gift, chefs hat and the ability to decorate your own scones and biscuits.
This was a truly memorable experience, and I would certainly return to celebrate that special occasion or simply go as a treat. ",5,2018,05,01
140,Great hotel,"This is indeed a lovely hotel and a great location. Its pricey, I prob would not stay here if it wasn't for work and a corporate rate. I had a lovely room, after inquiring which room I was getting and changed it to one with a bath, I find it a bit bizzare that such an upmarket hotel has rooms with no baths. Bath tub was ok but a bit uncomfortable, not the best. Otherwise it was a great room with great views towards Regent's park. It was recently refurbished. The breakfast is amazing, make sure you pre-order it so it costs less (25 GBP), it was mostly plentiful and fresh. The one morning it was busy and they were out of many items but they were replenished eventually.",4,2018,05,01
140,The best 1,It Is the best hotel i have stayed in in London whenever you may face any issue you can ask for Faisal Aldaoudi he is the most caring and decision maker. The rooms are comfortable and the location is the best thing. ,5,2018,04,30
140,5 Star in every respect,"Attended a function recently at Roux restaurant.
Amazing food, great champagne and wine. Flawless service.
Shout out to: Arina and Talita for taking such good care of us as we departed.

Attended a work Christmas party here in Dec and it was stunning. Christian Black went above and beyond to look after us.

We will be returning for many more visits!",5,2018,04,30
140,It just keeps on getting better and better .....,"By way of reference, I am a very frequent traveller (between 100 - 200 nights per year).

I have the privilege of staying in some of the nicest hotels in the world.  I also stay in more moderate hotels as well from time to time.

In the last 12 months I have had the privilege of staying at the Langham Hotel in London four times. And each time it gets better.  Part of this is because I get to know the staff and the neighbourhood, but a big part of it is how the hotel staff continue to exceed my expectations no matter how high they are.

I have outlined in other posts how beautiful the hotel rooms are, how well appointed they are, the wonderful bathrooms, as well as the great location.  So in this post, I thought I would explain why the hotel keeps on getting better and better.

I was in town working on a project for a client with a very tight deadline which meant very little sleep or time to do anything other than work.  I was staying at another hotel in the city that my client stayed in generally.  I was in London for nine days.  But the fourth day I woke up in the other hotel and thought to myself, ""I can't take it anymore - I have to go back to the Langham.""  And so I did.

I had arranged to check in on a Thursday, but since I was transferring hotels I arrived in the morning prior to going to work.  I was greeted by friendly and familiar faces.  Upon check in (to my surprise) my room was going to be ready in about 30 minutes - despite the fact it was 9:00 am.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to come back to the hotel until about 27 hours later (an overnighter at work!), but I knew my room was ready.

When I arrived back at the hotel the next day, I was pretty weary.  Again, I was greeted with very friendly people that are always ready to help.  I went to get my room key from the front desk and made my way up to my room.  When I opened the door I was blown away.  I was upgraded to a suite, my bags were neatly placed by the door, and the room was just a sea of calm in all of the chaos I was living in.  

I hadn't had a chance to reallly eat in the past 24 hours, so I decided that carbs and butter and jam were very necessary.  Room service was amazing, conjuring up items that generally weren't ready at that time.  I had a wonderful and indulgent meal that one can only have in the UK with toast, scones, other pastries with jam, clotted cream and butter, and then sank into a deep sleep for a few hours to recover.

I could go on and describe all of the beautiful touches that the hotel did to make my stay spectacular.  But in short.  They simply looked after me in the kindest, nicest way. And in such a quiet, unassuming way as well.

You will never go wrong staying at the Langham.   It can be a bit pricey - yes - but if it is even remotely in your ""snack bracket"" to stay there I would highly encourage you to do so.  It simply rises above.  

I want to give a special shout out to the bell men that make ones ""comings and goings"" so nice and  warm, and to the concierge desk where no request is too small or too big.  And finally to the housekeeping staff who generally can be so overlooked. Much to my embarrassment and delight, I came back to my room after being out for a few hours.  I had literally dumped the contents of all of my bags onto my bed so I could sort out later - I was too tired at the time.  And you know what?  I came back to them being neatly sorted.  That is a WOW moment.",5,2018,04,29
140,Luxury in London,"I had booked to stay at The Langham for 1 night for a friends birthday. 

We arrived at 11.30am and the room was ready for us on arrival which was great, we stayed in a twin room on the 4th floor. The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.

After a day out in London we returned to our room to find a birthday chocolate mouse and card which was a lovely touch, and much appreciated. 

The service was fantastic from start to finish, great location and a beautiful hotel. 
I can't fault anything, and I look forward to returning! ",5,2018,04,29
140,London getaway,"The hotel’s location is just perfect right beside Oxford st. I loved the interior and the coziness of the hotel. The service was good and so was the room interior. 

The only thing I really didn’t enjoy is the bed which is the most important thing to be honest, I wake up everyday with a back ache because of the bed. I had to put 2 pillows under me because as soon as you lay down its like the bed sucks you in. I hope the beds do get changed into more comfortable ones. 

I really enjoyed this hotel and the staff were very friendly. ",4,2018,04,28
140,"Would like to call here ""HOME"" in London","We have stayed twice for a week in the last 12 months and have not been disappointed. Location superb, Rooms excellent, but service really great on the whole, with occasional exceptions and more often exceptional! Recommend the club rooms as the breakfast and the happy hour are outstanding.",5,2018,04,27
140,Perfectly Comforty,Cannot beat the Langham for a trip in London. The rooms are very comfortable. The gym is great. The breakfast is beyond perfect. And the bar (I forget the name...) is fantastic for a drink to close out the day. ,5,2018,04,26
140,Book your stay through reliable travel companies,"The hotel is very beautiful with good location, walking distance to popular shopping and public transportation. Excellent service in club level, friendly and beautiful ambiance. Rooms are comfortable and elegant. I was there with my family and we were in two different rooms in different floors, even though we had requested for either a larger suite and since that wasn't available we had been promised joined rooms. We also had a room that the AC did not work, it was after 2 nights that we were then changed to a different room. The biggest issue was through their reservation department that made several mistakes that are not worth listing but it was a huge hassle in our vacation. It took many emails and layers of employees to finally be contacted by a manager who still did not have the full picture. I was refunded some money and the manager did acknowledge the mistake. I would definitely give this hotel another chance in the future but not book my stay with their reservation department. You will find fair rates on all major travel sites.",4,2018,04,26
140,Some issues,"We had four rooms for four nights from 16th April. In general it was fine though the eggs I had at the Club lounge for breakfast were swimming in grease and totally inedible just like my old boarding school.
On check out I was told that there were very high charges relating to the mini bar, but I was unaware that there was a mini bar and certainly never used it. I was not charged anything for this but after my departure, and without my knowledge or approval, I was charged £99.75, which, according to the hotel  ""was taken by our system automatically on 19.04.18 to guarantee any further extras you might have"". I regularly spend over 150 room nights per year in hotels and have yet to come across this. The amount seems very strange for a random charge, and though the hotel claim that it is only an authorisation  and not a charge, it is still shown as being charged against my account. 
I do not feel that the explanation by the hotel reflects the true picture and certainly I have never come across such a thing before. What additional extras could be possibly charged after departure? Why were my colleagues not charged in the same way?
This does not leave a pleasant memory of my stay.",2,2018,04,25
140,Maybe not the best hotel for a group of friends,"We were a group of friends staying for the weekend. The location is of couse very good, the rooms and the service was great, but we got two rooms on opposite parts of the hotel. Travelling as a group this was not ideal. On top of that one of the elevators was out of service and we had to use the one for staff and deliveries. IIt felt like a labyrint every time we had to get to one of the rooms. Not a huge problem, but felt a bit unworthy such an expensive hotel having signs all over ""this way"". With a group needing more than one room I would probably pick another hotel the next time. But for a family or a couple it is probably fine. PS: We really enjoyed the pool.",3,2018,04,24
140,The epitome of excellence,"For my wife’s birthday, we decided to have a staycation in Central London. The Langham has an enviable location, being an easy walking distance to Regents’s Park to the North, Oxford Street and Regents Street to the South. Soho and the theatres of the West End are all within easy reach and Southbank just a couple of stops on the tube if you can’t manage a longer walk.

The staff, from the reception desk and housekeepers to the bar staff and doormen, were polite, helpful and friendly. Attentive to our every need without. being intrusive or obsequious.

The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms and bathrooms generous for a historical building. Well appointed with kettle, coffeemaker etc... The TV epg was a little glitchy so a channel list would have been a nice adjunct.

The spa was lovely, but a long walk from the main building and the signage could have been a little better. Well worth the walk though.

The bar was great, with lovely cocktails. Pretty expensive even for Central London, which is a shame for the residents of the hotel.

We’d definitely go again!! Make sure you save time in the trip, just to spend time in the hotel.",5,2018,04,24
140,Another excellant stay at the Langham.,"Not only is this hotel in a perfect location by Oxford Circus, it offers the highest levels of service.
If you are looking for an amazing hotel with fine dining and fine surrounds then this is for you.
Worth every penny!",5,2018,04,24
140,Family Overnight Stay in April,"My wife and I and two teenage daughters stayed overnight at the Langham prior to our annual overseas vacation.  It was only for one night (Friday) but we wished it had been much longer.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

The connecting room was excellent, the Landau dinner and breakfast memorably good but above all, the staff in all areas of the hotel from check-in to restaurant and guest services well above the average even for a 5-star property.  We look forward very much to visiting again.  Tim and Amanda",5,2018,04,24
140,Such a great hotel and such great service!,"The location is superb, the rooms are a little small but extremely bijou, the cocktails are superb, the Concierge service is exceptional (managed to get a new tyre put on my ancient Mercedes!), the doorman are the best in the business, the welcome is warm, the farewell is moving, the whole experience was marvelous.",5,2018,04,23
140,Home away from home,"The Langham is a wonderful establishment just minutes away from prime areas of London. I stay here often and although it’s expensive, you get what you pay for. Will definitely be visiting again. Beautiful scenes. ",5,2018,04,23
140,"Great Location, Comfortable Hotel.","I just spent 6 nights here April 2018. The check in was strange. I was taken up to the 3 rd floor club and waited while the one receptionist was checking someone else in. I waited 15 minutes, then when it was my turn was told the room was not ready. Not a great start.Next time if there is a next time I'll check in in the lobby thank you.
I went for breakfast in the club on the 3rd floor sat there for 15 minutes and was totally ignored. The final straw was when the waitress started clearing up the table next to me and ignored me, I walked out. I then went to the Roux restaurant for breakfast which was great.  Never went back to the club and never will.
The room was small but very comfortable had everything I needed. I usually stay at Claridges when in London, they were full this trip. I will be going back to Claridges on my next trip in May. Cannot compare the two hotels. Langham is very nice but not value for money. The real saving grace is the location.",4,2018,04,22
140,Lovely stay at the Langham London,"Stayed here for Weeding Anniversary. Very attentive staff. Very nice and clean rooms. Great restaurants in the Palm Court and Roux at the Landau and a lively bar in the Artesian. 
A stones throw away from regent a street and all the shops and a 20 min walk to Regents Park. Highly recommended.",5,2018,04,21
140,Great hotel overall,"Great hotel, comfortable if slightly small rooms, centrally located. But pricy.
The main restaurant is a little bit too exposed to the entrance- and you feel drafts coming all the way in when the hotel doors open.",5,2018,04,21
140,Excellent hospitality!,"Our fourth stay at the Langham- and that too 10 nights-in the junior suite- more like a large bedroom than a suite- 
There were initial teething problems of Airconditioning- but were resolved thanks to two great Managers- Kieren Auluk and Fadi- who went out of their way to keep us comfortable and fulfil our needs!!
The Langham Club Lounge is easily the best in the world- huge - with superb service- and lovely breakfast-afternoon teas- and cocktail hours- well alcohol is served throughout the time the club is open- never seen that before. 
Being vegetarians- they made special dishes for us. 
Their Swimming Pool is very nice- warm water- 16 metres- but lovely ambience-
Overall felt like a second home!!
Will stay here again !! ",5,2018,04,19
140,Mrs.,Whole family visited in April for husband's 70th birthday. Excellent Hotel. Very professional and yet warm and helpful and honest Staffs (husband lost an expensive watch - it was found by a staff who promptly gave it to lost and found. We picked it up the following day). Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Money well spent. Special thanks to Rodrigo Moraes. Will certainly visit again.,5,2018,04,18
140,Sabre D'Or Chapitre,A wonderful event in an exceptional venue. Really well organised event for over 100 people. Really good dinner too. All the staff were really friendly and efficient and the Langham is in a great location.,4,2018,04,17
140,Great treat for kids visiting London,"On a rare visit to London with our 3 kids (11, 10 and 7), we were treated to afternoon tea at The Langham Palm Court. What a great idea - this really is something everyone should do on holiday in London.
I'm not sure why it's called the Palm Court - the name suggests a glassy room with plenty of natural daylight and greenery, but the room, while very comfortable and tastefully decorated, is windowless with no vegetation to speak of. The acoustics and the pianist made it a little difficult for us to hear each other and the waiters, but this did not detract from a most enjoyable afternoon.  
The kids were enchanted the moment they stepped through the revolving door into  the grand atrium - an oasis of calm after the frenetic walk along Regent Street. They were even more delighted when they found a Hamleys teddy bear for each of them waiting at our table. The seating had been carefully thought out with the children on a 3-seater sofa and the adults around the table. 
The waiters provided excellent service, taking care that everyone's likes and dislikes were accounted for. The sandwiches were delicious, the scones were light and fresh, and the pastries were beautifully crafted. More sandwiches, scones and clotted cream were offered and produced at all the right moments and we were thoroughly satisfied by the time we finally left, well after 6 o'clock. 
On our request, the bits we couldn't manage (the kids' chocolate rabbits in various stages of dissection) were carefully packed up so we could take them away. 
I was particularly impressed by the carefully thought-out and indulgent children's menu, which included a huge chocolate rabbit (it was Easter time), hot chocolate, a tasty kiwi and strawberry infusion and jigsaw sandwiches. And, of course, the teddy bears, which will remind them of this day for decades to come.",5,2018,04,17
140,Ok hotel but too expensive,"I stayed here on a work trip and wasn't really impressed with the accommodation having stayed in the Conrad a couple of times before for around the same price would definitely recommend Conrad instead
Cleaning staff kept knocking on my door in the evenings to clean even though I was out all day and they had all day to do it. I arrived in the room a couple times to find no towels in the bathroom, cleaner came about an hour later to place them, again this could have been done during the day, people knocking on my door to offer me warm water in the middle of the evening, again as they were warm they could have placed them earlier. 
No view from my room whatsoever, very small room and windows, felt very claustrophobic staying there for 2 weeks. Also the room was very draught.
Restaurant food was very bland and expensive for what it is.

I really didn't enjoy my stay and wont come back unless work places me there again even though I already requested a different hotel.",3,2018,04,16
140,"A good hotel, but way too expensive","We spent 4 nights at the Langham London in March'18, as a family of three.

The good things first. The location is just WOW. It's right in the heart of the city. Bus stop and tube stations are mere walks away. Oxford & Regent streets are touted to be the hottest shopping zones of central London, and this hotel is perfectly placed for spending time here. 
The staff is very helpful & friendly. Our toddler was having a blast chit-chatting with all the staff at the reception and at the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet was also good (albeit a little restricted esp if you're used to Asian hotels' breakfast spreads!). And room service had an interesting spread as well.

The hotel was well maintained, and wonderfully reminded us of old world British charm which it works hard to retain. For instance, we got a hand-written note from the manager of the breakfast restaurant - just saying Thank you for dining with us and hope to see you again. Small sweet gestures that just bring a smile to your face!

But, it burns a huge hole in your pocket. You may get similar service, and bigger rooms, and more amenities at hotels that are not so ""prime located"" perhaps.
Also, despite the fact that our toddler had a good time, I'd not really call this a family hotel. It's more suited perhaps to a business traveller.",4,2018,04,16
140,Superb,"I can ot fault this hotel at all 

We webt for the club room package and it was excellant. In fact it was so good we thought about cancelling our evening appointment and just stay in there 

Would recommed",5,2018,04,15
140,Sublime ,"Location: The hotel is located at the very top of Regent Street, about 200 North of Oxford Circus and opposite the BBC.

Style: Impeccable modern 5 star luxury

My wife and I really enjoyed our two night stay at the hotel. Service was excellent.

We preferred the breakfast in the Palm Court which was more comprehensive than in Roux.

We took lunch on our Saturday sat up to the bar/prep area in Roux and got chatting to the 21 year old young chef as he prepared the various dishes. Really pleasant and interesting young man.

This is a very high quality property, bedrooms and public areas fitted out to exceptionally high standards.",5,2018,04,13
140,Pure Luxury & Perfect Location,"We stayed at the Langham London for 3 nights in a Junior Suite for a little Christmas treat whilst visiting from Australia.  Our designated check in was in the club lounge and we had full access to the lounge for duration of our stay. Our room was stunning with a extremely comfortable bed, once we had worked out the correct temperature it was perfect. All the staff we encountered were fabulous, very pleasant and could not do enough for us. The Club lounge itself was fantastic, with a beautiful array of breakfast and afternoon tea and also evening canapes. The location of the hotel was perfect for us to explore London. My only regret was not staying longer. When we are in the country and visit London again, we would not hesitate to return for another stay",5,2018,04,13
140,Amazing trip,i simply love this Hotel . London is amazing and espicially with this bieutiful Hotel . I was really well welcomed and the personal was simply amazing . The rooms were really comfortable and the room service was also good .

140,"Excecutive room, pure luxury, wonderful experience!","We have just returned from a weekend in an executive room at The Langham. Having access to the club lounge was fantastic. The breakfast was just superb, the flowing beverages until 8pm and evening canapés were just excellent. 
The staff could not have been any more helpful. They were attentive and there to serve you with a lovely smile. We were made to feel relaxed and completely at home in luxury from the moment we arrived at the third floor club check in.
The pool was lovely and warm and the changing rooms are very nice with flip flops, towels and gowns in each locker to use.
Our room was lovely and could not fault it (the only minor thing was that we could hear lorries reversing outside but this only happened on two occasions and the pillows are on the plump side but a quick call to room service and this was sorted).
If you want to stay in London and want to be completely looked after, then stay here.
The only trouble was leaving and going back to reality! We will stay here again as soon as we can.

140,An eclectic mix of the old and new another of London’s gems of a hotel!,"We needed a place to stay on our child free trip to London! I found a great room rate on Expedia and booked a night at The Langham. I have to be honest it wasn’t on my hit list I love visiting London and staying in beautiful hotels and this one wasn’t on my radar but it will be from now on. The staff were exceptional nothing was too much trouble and the attention to detail throughout the hotel was remarkable. The spa, lobbies, bars and bedrooms were all beautiful well maintained and to a very high standard a lovely mix of modern and chic with antique charm. I couldn’t fault the stay at all and will be adding it to my short list of places to stay when I’m in town. I wouldn’t have wanted to pay more than the £280 room rate I paid for our particular room as it was small and had a grim concrete view from the window but that would have been my only complaint!

140,Daughters 21st ,We visited the bar and can only congratulate the excellent bar tender who made us the most fabulous cocktails. She was so very informative and knowledgable regarding her work. Her attention to detail and customer service was excellent. Made my day 😊,5,2018,04,08
140,"luxury, comfort and amazing service","we stayed to celebrate an anniversary. we wanted something special and luxurious and were not disappointed. It lovely to be in such beautiful rooms, corridors, bars etc. The room was perfect. so comfortable and everything you could need, water, nespresso machine, lots of toiletries. The pool and spa was very relaxing, got to be worth some time there. The bar was great too. Service was exceptional. very attentive but not smothering. when they accidentally spilt drinks when serving we go offered a free desert. we would definitely visit again",5,2018,04,08
140,No sleep - dont stay here,"I dont know where to start.... when you pay as much as this hotel charges you would expect nothing but joy.... Boy, I was wrong...
We stayed in deluxe room (not the cheapest one) and we got last floor with tiny window and very small space. And some noise coming from outside. We asked to change a room than got one with small bed (queen bed) so we asked to change again. Be carefull they could downgrade you without telling you. So third room looked acceptable so we stayed.... and than couldnt sleep... problem with a/c, frigirator, electricity.... you name it... we had technician coming twice at 1 am.... no sleep.... even second night was very stressfull with lot of strange noise....
My god, what a mistake to choose this hotel.
And no apologize... no one...

To be fair, commin grounds looked very nice and wifi was very fast.....

But i would never stay here again....no way...
And this ia saying someone who sleeps 120 night a year in hotels.....",2,2018,04,08
140,Luxurious plus Amazing Service and Great Location,"Our family was traveling in London and had booked an apartment for the week. The apartment was not at all like what was described online and so we decided to change to a hotel while we were already there. We called the Langham and they couldn't have been more accommodating. They had two beautiful rooms with comfortable beds, modern bathrooms and even a Nespresso maker. The service was friendly and helpful and the hotel was wonderfully located, just a few blocks from shopping, restaurants and the subway.  The staff made you feel welcome and at home.  The breakfasts in the lovely dining room had a good selection of hot and cold items, beautifully served and was just a great way to start the day. The bar was lively yet the staff was attentive. We would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay here again.",5,2018,04,07
140,Great Grand Hotel,What a great experience we had at the Langham. We stayed there for one week with our kids and we had a great experience. From the impeccable service and the staff that was very professional and going out of their way to read every wimp. Housekeeping was amazing. Even our iPhone cables were nicely folded! And everything was done with discretion and a smile. The concierge staff was very professional and going out of their ways to assist us. We enjoyed the swimming pool and the spa area almost every day. Beautiful hotel with amazing staff. Bravo,5,2018,04,07
140,Five Star Service Three Star Room,"I booked my room through one  of the discount travel websites. When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted by a friendly doorman and an energetic bellman who carried my luggage and walked me to the reception desk. Check in went smoothly and I was immediately escorted to my room. The room was small, facing a construction site. While it was very well stocked with toiletries, mini bar, coffee machine, slippers and so on, the furniture and the decor was old, outdated. I inquired about when the rooms were going to be refurbished, I was told that those facing the front are already refurbished. I am assuming since I booked through the discount website, I ended up with an older, smaller room. The overall service at this hotel was exceptional. The staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and to make sure all my needs were met. Too bad the room was bad...",4,2018,04,07
140,Outstanding ,"I’ve recently returned from a two night stay at the Langham and I couldn’t have been happier. 
I booked a deluxe room which was a great size and the bed was probably the most comfortable I’ve had in any 5star hotel in London or elsewhere. 
However the main thing that made me fall in love with the Langham was the service, every member of staff I encountered from the front desk, breakfast, bar and porters couldn’t of been more friendly and couldn’t do enough for me. I’d like to especially mention Kieren Auluk from guest services who is a credit to the hotel and truly made my stay an enjoyable and memorable one. 

I spent a few hours in the bar sampling the cocktails which are all fantastic but again the thing that makes it special is the staff, oh and the burger which is still making my mouth water, I hope that stays on the menu. 

Now I’ve experienced the langham I couldn’t imagine staying anywhere else in London, in fact I’m on my way back for another nights stay as I speak. ",5,2018,04,06
140,Disappointed!!!,"I have booked to stay at The Langham from 6th to 14th of April 2018, and suddenly I received a cancellation email without my request! When I called the Hotel Reservation to ask about the reason of canceling the reservation, the agent replied that he couldn’t explain why, and I’m not allowed to book at the hotel!!!",1,2018,04,04
140,Afternoon Tea,"The reviews I have read have been positive and word of mouth recommendations too, so we decided to have afternoon tea here for a special family occasion. We were not disappointed, service was polite and friendly. Attentive without being intrusive, the food was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked.  Everything was done effortlessly, nothing was too much trouble.
Would recommend afternoon tea here definitely!",5,2018,04,04
140,Wonderful afternoon tea,"With so many reviewers rating it as excellent, there is nothing new for me to say about afternoon tea at the Langham Hotel but I want to express my thanks to the staff and my appreciation of the wonderful food and service.  We wished, in addition, to see the room in which Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde met their publisher and this was shown to us by two helpful and knowledgeable members of staff.  All in all, a very pleasant afternoon.",5,2018,04,03
140,"5* excellence, beautiful attention to detail","I stayed with my wife for 1 night, booking via a travel website. We had a lovely room, it's size was good, furnished to a high quality, decorated to a high standard (as is all the hotel) and clean. The turn down service is very efficient, restocking the tea/coffee and giving the room a general tidy up. On check in we were asked where we wanted to stay, high, low, front or back, when we asked for somewhere quiet as we are both light sleepers the receptionist found a room in a lovely location and we had a very restful night. 
The location of the Langham is great, just off Oxford St. (5 min walk) at the Oxford Circus crossroads, its quiet with easy access to the parks and shops, I felt the staff went out of there way to make our stay special, we went to the club lounge, you ned to have club level rooms to gain access, I have to say this is one of the best lounges I've been too, a full bar service including cocktails and champagne, waiting staff and lovely nibbles all free of charge, a lovely way to rest your feet after a day out.
My only criticism and why I did not give 5 stars was the breakfast, we paid for this with our room and choose to have it in the  Roux, our cooked breakfast came out cold, the plates were not warm and most of the items on the plate were either cold or tepid. When I asked to have it changed, the waited asked for what items, I would have expected him to have taken both plates and given us a new meal each. At £34 pp I expected much more.
The spa is excellent, a nice pool and relaxing, we didn't use the gym or have any treatments. 
Overall, our experience was very positive, I've read other reviews on this hotel, do I think this is the best in London no, but it's in the top 10 in my view.",4,2018,04,03
140,Only benefit is walking distance to regent shopping ,"This hotel may not be my cup of tea but may be for many others .
The only pros to us is the walking distance to regent street for shopping .
In terms of decor and other relevant related comparisons, I shall leave it as NA .
",1,2018,04,02
140,Highly recommend,"The combination of the quality of the hotel with the service makes this hotel great. From the moment you arrive the staff are professional, courteous and engaging. The Langham in London is one of the best Hotel experiences we have had. Highly recommend staying here. ",5,2018,04,01
140,World Class,"The Langham remains one of London's grand hotels, offering world class service in opulent surroundings. 

Walked in off the rainy street and was immediately offered assistance and directions to the front desk, off the lobby to the right. First impressions are of the calm colours and pleasant perfume in the striking, wide corridors.

I was very happy with the size of the Deluxe room with London sizes in mind. Not pokey at all and with a modest separate dressing area containing the closet, minibar and Nespresso machine. Rooms are of a classic design with a modern finish- still looking fresh and well maintained. Wonderful big bed, ample bedside power and USB charging.

Beautiful, spotlessly clean bathroom in lovely black marble and with heated floor. No bath but a spacious shower booth and good quality products, robes and towels. 

Left too early for a sit down breakfast (Palm Court opens at 06:30) but the wonderfully polite room service staffer delivered a fantastic breakfast spread at precisely the time requested. Tea and coffee to-go is available at the front desk, a great touch.",5,2018,04,01
140,Five Stars is not enough!!,Beautiful boutique hotel in a wonderful location in London.   You are close to everything and yet feel you are tucked away in your own little oasis.  The service is the best I have ever had in London and I have stayed in many five star hotels here before.    Thank you for a wonderful experience.  ,5,2018,04,01
140,Afternoon tea at The Langham,".... was perfect because, not only are the refreshments gorgeous, the atmosphere is congenial and relaxed.. top rate service with such ease and genuineness.. this sets it apart from the other London venues for me",5,2018,03,31
140,Excellent service ,Been there many times for coffee and cocktails . Amazing service by everyone and quality time guaranteed. My favourite is hot chocolate in the bar . Cocktails are unique as well and not very expensive . A good location in central London . Good experience. ,5,2018,03,28
140,LangHam London - Is the best 5 Star Hotel,The Langham is extremely nice and deserving of its 5 star rating but the reason I will return is the people of the Langham. The staff is incredible and are helpful in anything and everything you may need.,5,2018,03,27
140,Just leave me here...,"A firm favourite for years, The Langham is utterly heavenly. The refurbished club rooms are perfect for those who prefer to hide away from the world and spend the whole day reading the newspapers with a glass of champagne on the side. Every detail is thoughtfully attended to, staff are superb and the beds are outrageously comfortable. 

Completely luxurious yet unstuffy, perfectly located (particularly if you know that neck of the woods), with excellent dining. The ice balls in the Artisan bar are brilliant. Do not try to fit a whole one in your mouth no matter how strong the temptation. It never ends well.",5,2018,03,27
140,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Langham with two teenage children for 4 nights.  We had a wonderful experience. The hotel is centrally located, clean and comfortable. Our room was large and easily accommodated the three of us. Staff is very welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend a room with access to the Executive Club. It makes all the difference.",5,2018,03,25
140,Comfort and Ease,"I had originally planned to stay elsewhere, but when a problem arose at that destination, I looked at my best options. Thankfully the Langham had a package deal for four nights at the price of three, which took the sting out of the money I'd already spent on other accommodations that weren't suitable. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to meet any request they could. They safely held my luggage before and after my allotted reservations, making it easy for me to explore and wrap up other matters before departure. The room was comfortable and well appointed. Their central location made even far flung appointments a shorter drive than they would have been from many other locations around London. I'll be happy to return here on my next visit.",5,2018,03,21
140,Elegant London Hotel,Great Hotel.  Beautifully appointed and spacious room.  Great Service.  Great Location.  Staff are caring and responsive and very attentive.  One of the best hotel stays I have ever experienced.  Recommend it highly.  ,5,2018,03,19
140,"Love, Love, Love.","This hotel is beyond top notch.  I came to London a few years ago and had seen that The Artesian bar was ranked best in the world for 3 years.  My friends and I came to try a few drinks and were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped on to the property.  The drinks were out of this world and the service was impeccable.

I had such a great experience just visiting that when I came back to London and since they had a larger budget than I did, suggested they stay here.  Again, impeccable service the entire time.  We basically stayed here with them as we were at the hotel to do everything but sleep, although did stay for a glorious nap one afternoon! 

I highly suggest getting a room with access to the club room.  The staff were so wonderful, so funny, they knew all of us but the end of the weekend.  The wine and champagne selection is great and the little bites were the perfect snacks to fuel you for the day or keep you going before a late dinner. 

Beautiful, beautiful hotel with incredible dining all around.  I've got separate reviews for The Artesian & The Wigmore, check them out!",5,2018,03,19
140,I just love the Langham,I’ve been going to the langham for at least 15 years and know many of the staff. Great rooms. Fabulous lounge and breakfast. The spa is as relaxing as it appears a personal favourite. Try the artesian bar for a nice cocktail too,5,2018,03,15
140,Mr Erol Erduran,"Hotel has one of the best location in London and near Soho and Theater and entertainment district. Rooms are quiet,clean and large enough. Excellent service staff. Quality restaurant. Very friendly atmosphere.",5,2018,03,14
140,Fantastic hotel!,"Recently returned from stay at The Langham after my family present for my 30th birthday.
From the moment you arrive you know your at a 5 star hotel. 
All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
Henry checked us in on reception then showed us up to our room as it was not straight forward to get to the room.
We stayed in room 484 which was very modern but in keeping with the hotel.
Great location, only few minutes walk from Oxford Circus station.
We would defo return for a special occasion!
",5,2018,03,14
140,Classy Luxury,Enjoyed a fabulous early evening meal at the Langham!  Perfect service and classy ambience.  Very helpful waiters who helped me choose a great red wine and the crab salad was very tasty!  Relaxed and unhurried service and I was even given a gorgeous chocolate present for Mother's Day.  If you want comfort and class with an English flavour try The Langham!,5,2018,03,14
140,Amazing and luxurious experience!,"I stayed at The Langham for a week on business travel and could not have been happier with the accommodations. This hotel oozes luxury and class, all the while maintaining that wonderful English feel. The location is unbeatable, right on Regent Street and steps away from great shops and restaurants. Would definitely stay again!",5,2018,03,11
140,Restore while on businesd,"Perfect service. Relaxed environment. Delightful room. Just right English breakfast or lighter start to the day. Filter coffee delicious. concierge went out of the way to rebook despite unhelpful airlines. Near to regent street.

Going back every time.

140,Luxury Experience ,"The Langham in London is well located close to main city attractions , we love the Artesian bar since many years. At the Roux Staff is very attentive and know how to make you feel special.
One of my favorite Hotel of this company",5,2018,03,10
140,Luxury and fantastic architecture with all the pomp and finery,I came across the Langham by accident.  I thought it would be just another Hilton hotel and I was totally surprised.  I had been staying at another Hilton on the other side of Hyde Park and the room was big enough to decide whether to open your suitcase or go to bed.  The size of my walk in wardrobe at home.  Then I moved to The Langham.  My goodness the room is the size of a football field.   Tea served in a silver tea pot and correctly poured.  I felt like a princess and very underdressed when I went out in my jeans to explore.  The doorman treat you like royalty and you are walking distance to everything.  A wonderful lifetime experience.  Worth all the money and a once in a life experience.,5,2018,03,10
140,"Nice hotel overall, but telephone calls charge is ridiculously high","I have stayed at the Langham several times before my last stay and like the place. The location is just superb right at the Regent street close to shops and nice restaurants. The service is good and fast. Rooms are nice. Breakfast is great. Add here a posh bar to have a round of drinks before going to bed and you get almost perfect hotel.
But last time I was extremely disappointed by a phone call charge. I got some problems with roaming on my cell phone and used telephone in the room (for the first time in my life actually) to make short call to Russia. So, I expected that this could be expensive, but not that much. For a 15-minute call they charged... 140 (!) pounds. This is a horrendously high price, gentlemen. At least you could warn about this crazy tariff in your hotel services book",4,2018,03,09
140,Best Hotel in London,"My daughter and I had a family room for 5 nights. Added on lounge access. The room was beautiful, with tall ceilings, extremely large for London standards and 2 QUEEN size beds. We ate maybe 1 meal out a day, and went to the lounge for omelets made to order, tea in the afternoon with the best scones I ate in all of England, and many other sweet delicacies, along with a variety of tea sandwiches. Night time offerings of canapés with champagne, wine, or whatever you like. It was a working vacation for me, and I was up early in the lounge, drinking handcrafted almond milk lattes, maybe an egg white omelet, and got a 2-3 hours of work completed before my teenage daughter awoke. Then we usually explored the city until mid afternoon, rarely missed the tea. Great location for (walking) exploring shopping on Oxford street, Fitzrovia, the Theatre district. I have stayed in many hotels and very few rival this one. I usually explore different hotels in the same city (Like Chicago or New York) but I will always stay at the Langham in London. It just does not get better than the Langham!",5,2018,03,06
140,Always a great experience,"The Langham London is outstanding - attentive, excellent service.  The rooms are luxuriously appointed, the restaurants and bar are excellent.  It located in a great part of London - walking distance to shops, restaurants and museums.  The staff make you feel special from the moment you check-in.  This is one of my favorite hotels in the world.",5,2018,03,05
140,"Great hotel, apart from...","Group of four friends stayed at The Langham for one night. Great hotel on the  edge of the West End. Initial reception was somewhat lukewarm, not receiving any help from the door staff or into reception (which is round to the right BTW). The receptionist recovered well and we received a good introduction to the hotel. 

Room was a good size and what you would expect, although view was a bit disappointing being of a brick wall. So check that before taking a room. 

This hotel is great, I’d stay again... but the Artesian bar is looking very tired. The rest of the hotel is of a very good standard. ",4,2018,03,05
140,Home away from home,"We don’t want to stay anywhere else!

Close enough to shop regent and oxford st. 

Close enough to Hyde park and regent park for exercise and fresh air. 

Amazing service. Upgrade to the club!

Eat at Roux (separate review)

We love it to bits and won’t stay anywhere else !

140,Tremendous Hotel,"Just had the good fortune to stay at this fabulous hotel. The staff were superb at every level of this organisation. 

Nothing was too much to make your stay so pleasurable and I will return again later on this year.

Martin Taylor-Reid",5,2018,03,03
140,Amazing,"We stayed here last weekend and what a wonderful stay it was ! We dined in The Roux at the Landau on the Friday night and both of us had the tasting menu. Not great ones for tasting menus but feel it is a showcase for the restaurant. The one we had at Le Manoir de quatre saison a few years ago disappointed on a couple of courses. Not so at Roux at the Landau ! Every course was a delight ! The service informed and impeccable. Next was a la Carte breakfast in the same place. Again a delight and great service. On the Saturday we had high tea in the palm court with champagne again it’s an experience not to miss. Book ahead as it’s always very busy the same goes for Roux. Our room was lovely on the 5th floor with views to the Wigmore hall on the one side and the BBC on the other. I can hand on heart say that every member of the staff are friendly and caring and not a bit stuffy for such an up market hotel ! Don’t delay you must go and stay soon I know I’m working on my husband to go again as I write this. All this and within walking distance of so much especially The Wallace collection, Fortnum and Masons and selfridges !",5,2018,03,03
140,Best business hotel I have ever stayed in,"I stay in about 20 different 5 star hotels each year travelling on business and The Langham is a notch above the likes of Westin, Sheraton, Hyatt, Four Seasons and the Hilton. 

Impeccable service from check-in, waitstaff, doorman and housekeeping. They proactively do things to help before you even ask. I even received a hand written thank you note from the staff at the fantastic lobby level cocktail bar the Artesian. 

Rooms are well thought out: Semi-firm bed with high thread count sheets, USB ports by the bed, Walk-in shower and coffee maker. 

The gym has a good mix of cardio machines, free weights and machines. Surprisingly they also have a pool for laps. Bring your bathing suit. 

Breakfast buffet is solid with a good mix: everything from Cumberland sausages to fresh fruits and baked goods. 

Location is convenient. I did meetings at 12 different locations and they were all under 20 mins from the hotel. 

",5,2018,03,02
140,Birthday treat ,"Took my mum and sister to celebrate my mum’s birthday. It was fantastic (albeit expensive). I’ve stayed in a lots of hotels and this was among the best. Everyone, I mean everyone, we interacted with was superb. Well done the Langham you excelled. ",5,2018,03,01
140,Business trip,"
Well this hotel location is great and the services as well is good.

I didn’t experience too much from the hotel due to my work commitment but i didn’t like the fact the lobby is too small and as soon as you get inside the hotel door it would lead you straight to the restaurant.

Took me quiet a walk to find the gym, felt like a maze to be honest.

I would recommend it if you love location and the value is always high and i don’t know why.",3,2018,02,28
140,(Almost) perfect short stay in grand surroundings,"Decided to stay at the Langham for one night during my recent trip to London in part A) as a taster for a longer upcoming stay at another Langham property, and B) as a treat for my mother who traveled up to London to meet me for the night. Communication from the hotel prior to my check -in was excellent. On the day of our arrival, the friendly and enthusiastic porter whisked away our baggage, and escorted us through the door and into the attractive lobby, past ornate marble pillars, towards the check-in desk, where we were greeted warmly, checked in quickly and smoothly, and then shown to our room. First impressions - so far so good. Bags arrived within around 5 mins of entering the room. The room itself was classic and attractive in style, not huge but more than sufficient. The view out of the window could have been better - an unattractive view of gloomy, nondescript office buildings. It wasn't a deal breaker though as we didn't linger in the room and instead headed straight to the hotel pub, The Wigmore, overseen by Michel Roux Jr, that i was keen to check out and obtain some much needed refreshment. Loved it - posh but friendly pub with good ale and great food. 

Fully refreshed we headed off down Regent St for an evening stroll and to do some shopping. The proximity of the hotel to Oxford Circus tube station means getting pretty much anywhere in London is quick, cheap and easy. 

Upon our return to the hotel, i thought we would have a night cap in the famous bar, The Artesian. When we walked in, we were shown to a seat by the Hostess. After 10 mins and no attempt to offer us a drinks menu or take our order, we decided to leave and head back to the room, for which no attempt was made to stop us. As a famous hotel bar i would have thought it was more used to, and would better attend to, the more casual still but neatly presented looking tourist types such as myself and my elderly mother, as opposed to the trendy London types who seemed to populate the place. Shame it seemed a bit stuck up as would have liked to have had a drink here. Points dropped.

In the room, the hotel wifi was good and fast. The bathroom had nice fixtures and fittings, and the shower was good enough, although not a walk-in rain shower which would have been preferable but was to be expected in a building of this age. I normally prefer a hard mattress and although the mattress in the room was quite soft, it was comfortable and i slept well.

In the morning we headed to the other Michel Roux Jr restaurant within the hotel, Roux At The Langham, for breakfast. The restaurant is very classical in style, with old oil paintings hanging from wood paneled walls, and crisp white linen tablecloths and fine china dinnerware. We opted for the cooked English breakfast which was absolutely perfect - the quality of the ingredients and the execution were excellent, as was the value for money. We finished off with bircher muesli and fresh fruits and yoghurt, all washed down with some delicious coffee. The waiter was chatty and friendly which went some way to making up for our experience the night before. Absolutely stuffed, we finished up at the restaurant, headed to the room to pack our bags, checked out, and off we went to our next calling.

Overall, i was very happy with our stay at The Langham. Despite a blip, customer service was generally excellent, the hotel was very attractive and a lovely place to be especially with its grand history. The location is great, and the food was both delicious and great value for money. I would have liked to have stayed longer and experienced more of the hotel such as the pool and had afternoon tea at Palm Court but unfortunately time did not permit on this occasion.

I would strongly consider staying in The Langham again the next time i return to the capital, and definitely now looking forward to my longer upcoming stay at The Langham in Shanghai.",4,2018,02,28
140,Stunning Experience,Top quality hotel fine dinning amazing breakfast and staff who really care that you enjoy yourself what more could you ask for? We would certainly visit again and relax to a very fine afternoon tea and pleasant conversation with knowledgeable staff.  ,5,2018,02,27
140,"The Roux at the Landau restaurant  is ""the soul"" of the Langham hotel","For 7 years now we have come to he Langham hotel.
The first 3 years, we just went to the Roux at the Landau Rest for dinner.
The following years we have stayed at the Langham hotel, due to the restaurant manager Mister Franco Becci. We have heard that mister Becci has left, the furniture of the old Landau has gone, but there is one piece that is irreplaceable: mister Becci, he has put all his soul in making the old Landau restaurant to a “success story”. Without him it will be never the same!",5,2018,02,26

140,Flying visit to London,"Needed to pop down to London for a meeting so booked my favourite London hotel! Nothing is to much trouble for them! I always feel a tingling feeling when I walk in the lobby and smell the beautiful aroma of roses and stocks!

The service, rooms.... just everything about this hotel just screams quality! Nothing is to much! ",5,2018,02,25
140,Return to paradise for the 4th time,"We came back to Langham for the 4th time and our expectations were met perfectly. The friendliness of the staff is so natural and with a nice British style, we just love it.

We stayed 4 days (3 nights) and I arrived already in the morning due to business reasons. I decided to leave my luggage for my meetings and it took about 40sec(!) to give it to the porter at the front door - what a fast service.

Rest of the family had a hotel driver waiting for them in the afternoon at Heathrow, and the person gave wonderful service. Our little daughter (3yo) can be sometimes sick in long car drives, so she had an incident towards the end of the drive. Hotel driver took care of everything in perfect way and really contributed in that difficult time to help with everything.

We enjoyed the luxurious lounge service, received the room upgrade to bigger suite (due to Fine Hotels & Resorts program), did sweat in the cool new gym and for the fun of our kids, swam a few times also in the funky pool which was also renovated from last year. We experienced also the in-room dining as well as dined in Palm Court - both superb!

At the end we checked out with easiness, person helping with all the details concerning transports and all.
We are definitely returning to Langham again in future.",5,2018,02,25
140,A hotel to love in London,"From the second we walked in I knew it was special. The warmth and professionalism of the staff was exceptional. We booked through Platinum Amex travel and received a double upgrade into a stunning suite. The Langham Club was well worth the extra price - beautiful food and drinks all day, perfect for my son who would much rather eat on the go instead of sitting in a restaurant. The whole hotel felt special and really like a revelation. ",5,2018,02,21
140,Unbelievable customer service!,"Staying in a 5-Star hotel, one would not expect anything less than stellar service in a welcoming environment, comfortable rooms, a top notch fitness center (this one has even a 16m pool in downtown London!).

Therefore the reason I wanted to write this review is a call that I received from the security team of the security team of the hotel, just two hours after my check-out. They informed me that I had forgotten my iPad in the room (I had no idea) and they asked me how could they help me to retrieve it. This not how I am used to, even when it comes to top-rated establishments. Usually, I arrive home after a long journey and, horrified, I realize that I have forgotten something, knowing that I need to go through the gruesome process of calling the hotel to locate the item and, if I am lucky enough, to get back. Not this time. In less than two hours after their phone call, I had my device back, which is amazing.

Kudos to the management of The Langham and their team, this is a quite unique way you are running your business!",5,2018,02,21
140,Afternoon tea ,"I was given a voucher for afternoon tea for two people at the palm
Court .
On arrival we were shown to our table and handed the menu by a very nice young lady 
We had English breakfast tea sandwiches ,scones and cakes . The waiter changed our cups several times and was very attentive throughout . 
The pianist played happy birthday and I was presented with a little cake and one candle which was presented beautifully .
We had a wonderful after noon, we will certainly be attending again ",5,2018,02,20
140,The place to stay for a special evening in london,"We have stayed here before and would do so again; I would recommend including use of the Club as part of your stay. The service, quality of food and ambience is first rate and even if you are heading out later in the evening the Club is the best way to end the day and start the evening. ",5,2018,02,20
140,Exquisite as always,"This hotel never fails to impress, from the incredible welcome from the doormen, to the reception team, to the rooms. The service is attentive but never intrusive. This time, we visited the VIP lounge and I must say an amazing thank you to everyone there, but in particular Boris and Norbert who made our stay extra special. I don't have enough gushing adjectives for this hotel- it's beyond anything I ever thought I'd experience and leaving there is always an emotional experience.",5,2018,02,20
140,"Steeped in History, Surpassed by New Langham Properties","I've stayed at 5 Langham properties across the globe.  My expectations for the original Langham in London was very high.  I envisioned impeccable service, attention to detail, well appointed rooms, and a stunning property.  

The club was OKAY.  The selection was not the largest in terms of beverages or food.  I would pass on this in a city like London next time.  

The service was OKAY.  There was a lot of waiting.  Sonia Marrocu helped us out immensely at checkout after several errors.

The rooms were very classy but a bit worn.

I was no expecting to find any threadbare or stained chairs here but there were a few by the elevators.

Overall, this was a great stay.  They accommodated us after we had to extend our stay due to a snowstorm in the US.  It was not the flawless stay I had imagined but I wouldn't have chosen anywhere else in London.",4,2018,02,19
140,Beautiful hotel in a great location,Couldn’t fault our stay at the Langham. Absolutely fabulous from start to finish. Staff great. Rooms beautiful. Great location to all that London offers. Would highly recommend it and will definitely be back.  ,5,2018,02,19
140,A truly wonderful hotel,"The Langham. A Grand Hotel for more than 150 years. The home of the the quintessential afternoon tea. Centrally located a stones throw from Oxford and Regent Street and overlooking the iconic BBC building.
So we just had one night. Check in was seamless and we were made to feel like movie stars and given the full VIP treatment. We had an upgrade to a one bed Suite with club access. From check in we were led on a tour throughout the hotel and introduced to some key people - the bar  manager at the award winning Artesian, the Maitre D' at Roux at the Landau. Then to the Suite which was newly restored and truly magnificent. A bottle of Champagne on ice was waiting and opened by our wonderful guide (high five to Claudio)  - that was accompanied by chocolates, a cake, a huge bowl of fruit and innumerable bottles of still and sparkling water. A glass of champagne (or two) and then down to the Langham Club for afternoon tea. This is a really fantastic space - way better than the usual ""executive club"" experiences at most hotels. 2 floors, incredibly comfortable, free flowing wine and champagne and a huge selection of food throughout the day - we had to go steady on the afternoon tea sandwiches, scones, delicacies etc as we had a booking at Roux at the Landau. A quick change and then dinner in the brand newly refurbished Roux restaurant. Incredible service, great food and reasonable cost. Back to room for some sleep in a bed that was like floating on clouds. Then breakfast in the Club - superb selection with cooked to order eggs, pancakes, omelettes etc. I went for a walk, she went to the spa for a couple of hours - and was extremely well looked after. Then, as we had a late checkout, a couple more glasses of champagne in the Club and some more of those incredible sandwiches and snacks and eventually we had to drag ourselves away.
Will I go back. You bet.
I have stayed in most of the great hotels in London through the Amex FHR programme (and don't usually bother to leave reviews) but this takes the biscuit. The way the team balance superb facilities and excellent discrete service with a sense of fun is second to none - I have never been made to feel so welcome and relaxed in such an incredible environment. I can't thank all the team highly enough - the highly professional and kind guest services managers, the wonderfully attentive guys in the Club, the wait staff and Sommelier at Roux,  the team at the Spa, the turndown ladies, the guys on the door who just smiled all the time. What an amazing place. Just go there.",5,2018,02,18
140,Excellent hotel - quintessential British hotel.,"I have stayed at the hotel when my children were younger and last stayed on business.

Well positioned on regent street for oxford street and all central locations.

Rooms are a very higher standard with service to match.

The restaurant is very good, however a little over the top for a simple business lunch, but has good has it gets.

I would recommend the hotel for the family or business.

Underground parking is available 5 minutes walk away, could cost you up to £45.00 for 24 hours, so leave the car at home.",5,2018,02,18
140,A TASTE OF LUXURY,"In occasion of the bar mitzva of a relative in London me, my wife from Israel and my brother and wife from California made the Langham our meeting point and spent 3 nights there.
I must confess that due the generosity of my brother (he payed for the 2 roms) I had the occasion to be at the Langham and no need for less.

we received from the start vip status with upgrade to better rooms 

the location of the hotel, the deluxe rooms, the care of the hotel's team made our stay unforgetable
I also preffered to spend some time at the hotel during the day and enjoy all the cosy corners where you can read your own magazines or book or even better enjoy the amazing tashen books of art that are in display.
My wife on the other hand enjoyed the beautiful swimmingpool and was delighted to know that she swim in what once was a safe.

my tip: if you look for a 5 star hotel  the Langham will answer the craving for luxury that only a top 5 star hotel can offer.",5,2018,02,15
140,Home Away from Home,I've simply foundit impossible to stay anywhere else since I tried The Langham. The warmth of the welcome starts at the front door and permeates one's every experience throughout the hotel. I simply adore it there!,5,2018,02,14
140,Home Away From Home,"The Langham is a special oasis in the heart of London. The service is the best there is, the rooms and common areas are impeccably clean, and all the while the hotel is unpretentious and creates for a relaxed, “at ease” environment. Elena was particularly wonderful in ensuring that every aspect of our stay was perfect.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite overlooking Portland Place. It was spacious and had plenty of room to unwind and make oneself at home. The bathroom featured a deep-soak tub near a window looking out onto the city. Asprey products were consistently replenished, as were the fluffy towels, robes, and slippers. 

We enjoyed breakfast in all the locations offered – the lounge, Palm Court, and Roux (they all have the same menu and buffet option). The lounge is great for a more casual experience, while the Roux is more formal and luxurious. In the evening, we enjoyed the creative drinks at Artesian, drinks and hors d’oeuvres in the lounge (one helps themselves to the appetizers), and dinner in Palm Court during the live jazz performance. We unfortunately did not make it into the Wigmore, but it was packed every time we walked by – next time! Artesian and the lounge were always jumping. The food was all delicious, from the eggs benedict and breakfast to the lobster risotto for dinner, and the staff was most professional and friendly.

The spa at The Langham doesn’t disappoint either, and the staff sees to every detail. They even have the Dyson Supersonic hair dryers in the women’s lounge!

The Langham’s location is convenient – you’re a few blocks from Oxford tube station and a pleasant walk to Marylebone High Street and Regent’s Park. 

What sets The Langham apart from the rest is the service: the staff is so friendly yet professional, and they don’t miss a beat! They are also very fast: when we arrived straight from the airport, someone immediately brought my suitcase to the women’s area for me to freshen up after the long journey (our room was ready much later than we anticipated, but it wasn’t a bit deal). And, the staff saw to it that the suitcase and rest of our bags were brought to our room while we were out. It was all very seamless.

We had a very special stay at The Langham, and our next visit cannot come soon enough!",5,2018,02,13
140,Lovely weekend,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in recently. Beautiful decor, fabulous service, and gorgeous cocktails in The Artesian bar. Room was equally wonderful, very clean and very stylish. Fabulous location at the top of Regent Street.",5,2018,02,13
140,Perfection,"Ah, we love the Langham brand in the states, so what a special treat to stay at the original. It is elegant, understated and grand all at once. We booked a room with access to the club lounge, which is so worth it. You can order eggs in the lounge for breakfast. The crystal and tableware is like an elegant restaurant. The buffet was supreme. 

We have a higher floor, which seems to afford much better views, although it is still rooftops. We have a glimpse of the London Eye, which would mean we could possibly see the fireworks on New Years. 

Oh, an added bonus, warm bathroom floors and heated towel bar! ",5,2018,02,13
140,Outstanding in every respect ,"Outstanding hotel from top to bottom. 

The location is absolutely the very best in a London. But that’s only the start. The service, food, atmosphere and vibe were beyond expectations. 

Beautiful, inviting, warm lobby greets you on arrival. The dining room is grand, tastefully done with delicious food. The lobby bar is one of the best - if not the best - I’ve experienced anywhere in the world.

Beautiful rooms with top class linens and luxuriously finished.

This is a world class 5 star hotel. When in London there is no need to look anywhere else.",5,2018,02,12
140,First class,"We were extremely well looked after by the friendly and welcoming team. Opulent and extravagant, but not stuffy at all, a hard balance to hold
The food and drinks in Artesian are to die for, thanks to Sarah for her impeccable knowledge and flair. The Roux burger is a must try...

Thank you to the whole team",5,2018,02,12
140,Oh what a night!,"We were invited to the Langham to celebrate a friends 50th Birthday with dinner in a private dining room and we took the opportunity of staying over. We certainly weren’t disappointed the hotel is a beautiful, comfortable, friendly hotel the staff cannot do enough for you. 
Our dining experience was fantastic the food was amazing and the accompanying wines did not disappoint. 
Can’t wait to come back ",5,2018,02,12
140,Service.,The quality of this hotel  matches everywhere I've been in the world. The welcome is perfect and very helpful. The food is outstanding as is the attentiveness of the waiting personnel. I have no hesitation in recommending it to anybody who is accustomed to a high standard.,5,2018,02,12
140,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Amazing hotel at the heart of London, only a few hundred meters from Oxtord St and Regent St. Room on second floor with a window view to a summer courtyard and further onto the street,  spacious and very clean. Bed was very comfortable and room was very quiet making for a great night sleep. Pleasure of a stay. ",5,2018,02,12
140,It is expensive...but so nice...and so British,"It is a bit of a splurge, but the hotel is beautiful and service is outstanding.  The hotel is old--but they have done a great job modernizing (especially the bathrooms--water pressure was fine).  They also have a fabulous (Michelin Star?) restaurant in the hotel.  And of course, afternoon Tea is fabulous.",5,2018,02,11
140,Fantastic Guest Expereince in Superb Location,"The Langham is really special, from the front door to the front desk and beyond this hotel caters for every need and indulgence. On arrival the front desk was super friendly and accommodating, it was my mums birthday and we were upgraded on our room and a lovely cake was awaiting our arrival in the room - lovely touches that really elevate the experience. The decor is beautiful, all of the public areas and bars are really special, fastidiously clean and very well kept. The rooms are also lovely, everything is tasteful, neutral and comfortable. My only comment would be that the bath is quite small with a marble overhang which makes it difficult to really laze away in there but there is a fabulous shower and i wouldn't say this really had much impact on our stay. I think there are rooms with bigger fancier baths so book one of these if a tub is your thing. Rooms are big, staff are amazing - we will definitely be back",5,2018,02,11
140,Family break,Fantastic family room for 2 adults and 3 children. Service and people extremely helpful and welcoming. Would thorough recommend this hotel...perfect location for Regent street and Oxford street too. Lovely stay.,5,2018,02,11
140,Very agreeable place to stay,"Excellent hotel, superior quality of bed and linen in the room. Bathroom rather on the small size but luxury products and towels. 
Delicious breakfast, even with Champagne if you wish. Beautiful clientele. By a next stay we will come back to this hotel.
",4,2018,02,11
140,Can I live here???,"I was on vacation for a wonderful weekend in London. I had stayed at the one in Chicago in the past. The property is lovely. The staff is fantastic. I loved the doormen too.  So informative!!!  High tea was also a highlight of my stay. The gym was excellent. I really had no negative aspects at all to reports on my visit at the Langum. The location is also ideal near Regent Street 

I will return in a heartbeat!!!",5,2018,02,10
140,Celebrating birthday,"I stayed at The Langham London to celebrate my friend's birthday, I have requested a birthday cake to be delivered to the room. Josie from Guest Services was so helpful to organize everything, however I found out that my friend doesn't like sweets on the arrival date, so she organized some salted food instead that we found on the second day. She is very lovely! All the staff is wonderful, in particular I would like to mention also Rena and Joyce from The Langham Service, Federica, Darja, Claudio, Harry from Reception.  ",5,2018,02,10
140,A business trip with unexpected hospitality ,"We came for a business dinner but with leisure in mind. For once we made it in time for a drink before hand and they did not disappoint. A welcome drink, with real explanation as to why, extreme knowledge and more importance and the genuine friendliness were top notch. 3rd time we’ve visited and I’d visit again tomorrow. Thank you so much. ",5,2018,02,09
140,First class reliable service coupled with continuous upgrades in the facilities.,"I am a regular visitor and fan and my recent birthday stay again exceeded expectations. From my first visit to the then Langham Hilton in 1993 to the present I have noticed a programme of continuous upgrading of the facilities alongside a consistent tight emphasis on high customer service which I think is the hotel's USP. The reviews reflect this. It matters not whether you are a VIP or a one visit guest; all seem to receive the same courteous attention. The latest development was the opening of the Wigmore which we had the pleasure of trying out during the visit. A lot of thought has gone into this  'grand pub' outlet which is divided into three sections namely a bustling  noisy bar area, a quieter sit down area and a separate more restful snug room. Collectively this covers all bases. The food we had was excellent and the large cheese toasty (which we shared) elevated this everyday dish to something heading in the direction of fine dining and at just under £10 good value. The house real ale was well kept with a pleasant unusual and distinctive taste and the slightly cloudy appearance reminded me of German wheat beer. The manager Andre was under pressure but was attentive and kind enough to interact with us. All in all the Wigmore is a great addition to the Langham 'offering' and very good value for Central London.",5,2018,02,09
140,Birthday weekend,"Where better to spend your 70th birthday with all your family than this beautiful hotel. It is faultless, from the doormen who greet you to the delightful Club room staff. Food, rooms and service. Impeccable ",5,2018,02,08
140,Special experience to stay,We had a lovely stay at the hotel along with the friendly staff. The only problem was the extra bed which seemed a bit uncomfortable but other than that everything else was perfect. I would definitely come back anytime .,5,2018,02,07
140,A truly personal and memorable guest experience,"From originally making contact with Langham, every member of the guest services team, in their own way, took personal care and responsibility, in ensuring they arranged every aspect of request made for our stay. 
If arranging a weekend break, or staying on business, I recommend upgrading to Club lounge access, ensuring you experience the most Langham has to offer. 
Throughout our stay, the personal experience created by Christina, Christophe, Hoi and all of many fantastic people we met, was what made our stay most memorable. 
A truly Iconic London Hotel, however one with people who care passionately about guests leaving as friends.",5,2018,02,07
140,Langham stay,"Our stay at the Langham was a proper 5 star experience. The level of service was exceptional, the quality of the room and the food and drink were of the highest standard. A fantastic weekend. If you can then try and upgrade to the executive lounge as this was lovely. We will definitely be back. ",5,2018,02,05
140,Solid option in Mayfair ,"4.5 stars for the langham (but I must round up). This was my second time at the langham for business travel. The hotel is quite nice in a good location with excellent staff. I checked in after a red eye flight and the hotel had put a very nice continental breakfast on the desk when I arrived (not something I ordered), including fresh fruit salad, pastries and fresh squeezed orande juice. The cocktail bar is a nice benefit compared to the other high end hotels in the area. I took half a star off only because the rooms are a bit dated and in need of some modernization. Also, the gym was out of service due to a leak. The langham should be a five star hotel but I'd like to see updated rooms. ",4,2018,02,04
140,Lovely treat,Lovely welcome straight away from the people who helped us out of the taxi all the way through booking in to the room. Beautiful surroundings but you felt very welcome. Room was lovely and comfortable. Central to everything we needed in London,5,2018,02,04
140,Fabulous afternoon tea - again.,"My daughter and I had afternoon tea here this week along with my grandson. The service and attention to detail was excellent. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The food was excellent, as usual. We will return again",5,2018,02,04
140,Amazing as always,We live the Langham it's our home away from home the service and staff are impeccable. The club is one of the best we have visited and club manager Alisha and her staff amazing. I cannot recommend a club room high enough ours was a corner room with a fantastic view.,5,2018,02,03
140,16th Birthday Celebration,"The most fantastic stay here to celebrate our daughters 16th birthday. The staff could not of been more welcoming, they ensured balloons were in the room plus a cake with sweets and treats, our daughter was over the moon. Only stayed the one night which wasn’t long enough, we will defiantly be going back, thank you Langham a memorial stay 😊",5,2018,02,01
140,Theatre trip with my daughter,"Certainly couldn't fault the hotel, the facilities or the staff. Hotel was spotlessly clean and beautiful, staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. 
We were there to celebrate both our birthdays and a member of staff brought a cake  to the room which was lovely.
Food in the Club Lounge was delicious.
The only negative we could say, which has been said by another reviewer, is that when in the Club room it was quite obvious that there were certain visitors who had extra special treatment and were definitely treated differently to the rest of us. 
We wouldn't normally be able to stay somewhere like this so it was a special treat and it would have been nice if we had the same treatment in the Club Room as those who seemed to be able to afford that kind of luxury all of the time.
Would like to stay again though if I could.",5,2018,02,01
140,Afternoon tea.,The Palm Court is the home of afternoon tea and still probably the best in London. Wonderful atmosphere and attention to detail. The service is impeccable. Sublime cakes and pastries. Just perfect for a special occasion. ,5,2018,01,31
140,An incredible experience,The hotel is excellent and the service unbeatable - friendly staff who pay attention to every detail. The food in the Palm Court is outstanding and would also recommend paying The Wigham next door a visit too. Thank you for being so accommodating every time I visit with my family - we always look forward to our next visit.,5,2018,01,31
140,Location & atmosphere are great. ,"My first time in this hotel in the city center of London. It’s located perfectly on Regent Street. 

Very warm welcome, beautiful room & excellent breakfast. They personally prepare the room for every night. 

Will use this hotel for future visits. ",5,2018,01,30
140,First time visiting,Fantastic hotel lovely friendly staff fabulous service 1 slight hiccup would definitely stay again this hasn’t put us off revisiting the hotel again 100% recommend a visit front of house staff excellent palm court manager very nice bar staff friendly fabulous front lobby the biggest book of amazing pictures ever seen worth a look through the location is central to everything very close by tube station Oxford Circus a fantastic staff a can not wait for the next visit ,5,2018,01,30
140,Execellent stay,"The hotel and staff were excellent.
We were upgraded on arrival. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We visited the bar and the cocktails were amazing. Overall excellent stay and excellent customer service. ",5,2018,01,29
140,Overpriced,"Old and a bit tired . Hotel is living on its passed glory.
The staff were most helpful and attentive.we were there for a family occasion and only stayed there for our convenience . Don’t think we would stay there again.
It’s expensive and VAT is added to the room rate.breakfast at £25 for a coffee and cornflakes is not on ! Consequently we didn’t have it.",4,2018,01,29
140,Warmest Welcome in London,"Great Location for West End and Shopping, Oxford St, Regent Street and Bond Street.
Lots of bars and shops all around. The greeting from the porters all the way through check in and check out experience was fantastic - well done to the whole hotel team.",5,2018,01,29
140,Amazing hotel,"The location of this hotel is excellent, right next to Regent Street. 

The staff at the hotel were amazing. The receptionist at check-in personally brought us to the Club.

The Club was incredible. It was surely the best executive club that we had even experienced in a hotel. In most hotels, the food served at such clubs were generally downgraded version of what was served at their restaurants. However, the food at the Langham Club was as good as any restaurant. For example, the scones and sandwiches served at the Club were identical to those served at the Palm Court. In a way, we made a mistake of booking one afternoon tea at the Palm Court when we could have enjoyed the same food in a quieter setting at the Club.

We had a junior suite which was located at the top floor (9/f). The room was spacious and well designed.

All in all, we would definitely be back!
",5,2018,01,28
140,Not As Good As It Once Was,"I've taken time to write this review, because we became ill towards the end of our stay and I didn't want that to cloud the overall opinion.
Firstly, let me say that we enjoyed our room.  It was quite spacious, with a little seating area and beds that were twinned as requested.  Aurica remains a credit to the service in the hotel, even though she is no longer in the club and now at guest services.  It was lovely to receive such warm greeting from her.  As always, the floral arrangements were spectacular.  We were there right before Christmas and the hotel had partnered up with Laurent Perrier for their displays, which were champagne colored (of course), elegant and extravagant.  Lastly, Roux at the Landau remained a fine dining favorite of ours, with exquisite food and service.  We loved the lobster!  And the new  Wigmore was most welcome.  The roast chicken was a treat and the cheese toastie to die for.
Not onto the reasons for its three star rating:
1.  They sent the wrong bags to our room.  I had to call to have the right bags brought up as well as make a trip to the club to ensure they arrived.  Not the most positive way to start a trip.  
2.  On the second morning, I had no hot water for my shower.  This was rectified by evening, but taking a cold shower was not my idea of a relaxing morning.
3.  The only complimentary paper is now The Times as everything else is through Pressreader.  That's fine, but I had offered to pay to have The Telegraph delivered daily as well.  The first morning they sent The Financial Times.  I then told them to forget it and the second morning they sent The Telegrapgh.
4.  Food was not replenished as frequently as should have been in the club, especially at breakfast.  Cooked to order items took over 30 minutes to arrive, with the chef spending more time at the desk than behind the scenes.  We had tea there one afternoon as well and sandwich trays were left empty for over twenty minutes.
5.  There is a new CEO who has removed crisps from the lounge offering.  I had asked for some and were told that they had them, but couldn't serve them to me.  If I am specifically asking for a bowl of crisps that you have acknowledged you have, why not just bring me a bowl?
The above are the reasons I have made this three star.  If I am paying for a five star hotel, service should match.  The Langham sadly missed the mark this time.",3,2018,01,27
140,Nice hotel,I like the hotel very much. Hotel room with oriental contemporary interior design where I feel like staying at home. room is spacious and the bathroom nice and the floor is heated and it gave me warm during winter time. The location is convenient as well. Thanks.,5,2018,01,27
140,Usual great stay,"As always great time

Nothing is too much trouble 
Hotel us expensive but worth it
If u book long enough I advance u get a better rate but I it’s last minute it’s prohibitive

140,80th birthday ,"Treated my Mum to a night at The Langham to celebrate her 80th birthday.
We couldn’t have pick anywhere better in London.
They spoilt my Mum with cake, roses and a lovely upgrade. 
Attention to detail and immaculate furnishings in every corner make the hotel beautiful but the staff made this hotel stand out from others. Special thanks to Tiffany Yiu and the staff in The Langham Club.  ",5,2018,01,26
140,A perfect location,Langham hotel is centrally located in the shopping area.  It is close to the famous brand flagship stores.  The restaurants in Langham hotel are very impressive. Food in Roux at the Landau is very good in taste.  The steak we chose is very succulent.  The atmosphere is suitable for a special event. We spend our New Year Eve in Palm Court.  The life music and the food will give you an unforgettable travel experience.,5,2018,01,25
140,The Best,"We've had the good fortune of staying at some lovely hotels, but the Langham London is really one of the best. Gorgeous property, excellent location, great service... I really don't know what they could do better. We travel with our children and they request this place again and again.

Yes, it's pricey but it's a luxury hotel and you do pay for what you get in this case. Keep up the good work and we look foward to returning as often as we're able.",5,2018,01,25
140,Beautiful hotel that oozes class,"Wonderful hotel stayed for two nights with a friend, the atmosphere is really nice and a wonderful lobby.

The room we had was interconnecting both rooms were a very good size and what you would expect of a five star hotel 

The place has a historic yet classy appeal and I would stay here again, the broadband speed is incredible probably the best I have used and made my work so much easier.

The concierge team also very good printed my train tickets delivered them to my room in express time 

Closely located to pizza express and plenty to do eat and do within walking distance. parking was slightly far away we had to park in a car park across the road but it's central London I guess ",5,2018,01,25
140,Best hotel - location and price,"I tried many hotels in London and must say this is the best given the combination of its location, service facilities and price. It’s one of those rare hotels that have a pool and staff is amazing! The location is right in the middle next to the central tube station and the main shopping and theatre area. Everything is walking distance and very accessible. I look forward to returning theee sooner rather than later ",5,2018,01,25
140,The LangHam London,My first time staying at the Langham and the experience was awesome. You feel at home from the moment you arrived until you leave. Everyone makes sure you have everything you need to make the stay exceptional.,5,2018,01,24
140,Superb,"Top class hotel in a wonderful location. Ideal for theatres, shopping, restaurants, sightseeing. It's expensive but the rooms, staff and facilities are as good as it gets.
Even if you go there only once, treat yourself.",5,2018,01,24
140,Excellent,"Great location, great service, outstanding breakfast. A luxurious hotel in a beautiful city. 
It is clean, personnel is very kind. Rooms are big and well decorated. There was an event which remained separated and we were never affected by it.
Will be back, of course. ",5,2018,01,24
140,Fantastic !,"What a wonderful hotel, and full of old history as well. For a small extra-charge we were given an upgrade, and it was worthy. It gave us access to a Club at the 3rd floor, where we enjoyed the breakfast buffet in a very quiet surrounding. Just two negative points: the SPA isn’t really one, because there is only a steam bath and next to the pool there aren’t any laying chairs. One would miss a smoking lounge. But otherwise everything is at a top level and we strongly recommend this hotel. Will be back ! Thank you.",5,2018,01,24
140,Exceptional Service at one of the most amazing 19th century listed buildings with BBC history,Stayed for a weekend break for #lumiereLDN weekend. Club level room was expertly appointed with all the comforts of a fine hotel. Fascinating read of the building history with the hard bound in room book on coffee table. Amelia and staff in club lounge provided A+++ service. Lobby bar was a great late night hangout. Walking distance to Oxford St and much of Central London. ,5,2018,01,23
140,Nice five star hotel with great location,This is a five star hotel close to the main shopping streets and within 10 minutes walk to Soho district. The atmosphere was great and outside they served glue wine and had spare umbrellas as the weather was not the best. The hotel also offers a swimming pool where you can actually swim and saunas. A nice getaway especially for couples. Great service and a good breakfast. Great comfort in the room. Would not recommend to call to the hotel for any convenience but once inside you will get great service. Recommended!,4,2018,01,23
140,Just perfect,One of the best hotels in London and one of the best bars in the world. What more do you need? Great place for both business and pleasure. The New Years Eve dinner is a treat for the whole family. Club level is another treat.,5,2018,01,22
140,High tea with excellent scones,"Had a family afternoon tea as Xmas treat. Sandwiches were good but the scones were wonderful. Cakes were too sweet for my personal taste.
Youngest daughter has nut allergy and despite their reassurance she  felt the nut free sandwiches and cakes had been in close proximity and would not eat so maxed out on the scones!",4,2018,01,22
140,"The Langham, London","The Langham Hotel in London is truly an exceptional, 1st class experience. Every element of my stay was looked after with an elegance and attention to detail that makes it  a wonderful and seamless experience that I recommend to everyone.",5,2018,01,22
140,Best hotel in London,"Elegant but relaxed atmosphere, amazing food and very welcoming staff. Highly recommended not only for business travels. I'm always delighted to stay at the Langham. Also extremely well located in a quiet area just behind Oxford Circus.",5,2018,01,22
140,Great Hotel,"Enjoyed drinks at the Artisan Bar with friends (I wasn't a guest at the Hotel)  Needless to say they were great!    There is  something very special about this grand old Hotel.    It's possibly the way they have managed to fuse the original with modernisation in such a professional manner unlike many U.S. Hotels which have been ruined IMO.   The recently added Wigmore Tavern looks great,  we all decided to try this location next  time.",5,2018,01,20
140,Afternoon tea,"I don’t like afternoon tea. I don’t want to drink a gallon of tea while I’m stuffing my face with sandwiches, pastries and basically anything that isn’t proper food but I like the concept of sitting down having a meal in a relaxed environment letting things take it’s time. I want to have a cocktail, a beer and a burger. My wife however, loves afternoon tea and all that goes with it. Luckily, it is possible to combine my version of an afternoon tea with a traditional version at the Langham. We were a party of four, my wife, my daughter and my mother. My wife and mother had a traditional afternoon tea with champagne and my daughter had a children’s afternoon tea. The tea for the grownups was really good with good service but not really exceptional in any way. It was what you’d expect at a place like this. But the children’s afternoon tea was something else. First, and most important according to my daughter, you got a complementary teddy bear. The first course was jigsaw sandwiches. My daughter was not impressed. She ate my wife’s brioche instead. However, she got some hot chocolate that was made at the table with warm milk and a chocolate bar. It was to die for!
The pastries in the children’s afternoon tea was where things got exceptional. They had made a winter landscape on a plate. Icebergs made of white chocolate, a marzipan penguin, a lake made of blue jello and even some bigfoot paw prints in snow made out of icing sugar. The attention to detail was second to none.

I distanced myself from everyone’s gluttony and enjoyed a perfect cocktail followed by a really good burger and a cold lager.

The Langham Palm Court was a really nice experience. The experience is about the same as The Chesterfield or The Four Seasons but with a fantastic alternative for children.",5,2018,01,20
140,Breakfast Visit for my son’s birthday. ,"As a regular visitor to The Langham for both business and pleasure for many years I cannot 
overstate what an absolute pleasure it is to come back each and every time. 

Everyone from the doormen onwards are so pleasant and engaging, whatever the day or weather. 

I have frequented and stayed at a number of other London hotels and can simply state The Langham is a fabulous hotel with impeccable levels of service and attention to detail worthy of its five star credentials in every way, truly worthy of a visit for business or pleasure.

140,UKBF Afternoon tea,"What a wonderful afternoon. Fantastic service. Lovely afternoon tea experience. Catered for all our foibles. Nothing was a problem nothing was an issue. The music was calm and soothing as we ate. We had an extremely knowlegable tea waiter, he was friendly and definately made our day. I would highly recommend the Langham Hotel Afternoon tea ",5,2018,01,19
140,Wow!,What an amazing hotel! I had the best experience with everyone and everything! A must in London. The buffet was great. With a lot of variety and even champagne! The rooms are beautiful and clean and the people are uber friendly. ,5,2018,01,19
140,All of elegance and service you’d expect and more!,"I stayed at The Langham for four days while in London for business and it was exceptional.  When you are as picky about hotels as I am, you can never really judge by the gratuitous reviews that hotels are amazing because one persons amazing is another person’s meh.  But not so at The Langham!  It deserves ever compliment.  The service was absolutely remarkable!  From the doormen to the service desks to the concierge to the restaurants- EVERYONE delivers over-the-top service and THAT, coupled with an esthetically beautiful property and atmospheric rooms that are clean is how you get and keep 5-Star ratings!  Well done and well earned ✨.  I will certainly return and highly recommend.",5,2018,01,19

140,Great Bar with Impressive Cocktail Staff,"Quick evening drink after dinner and very impressed with the style and creative barman 
who were shaking and doing their stuff with the cocktails. Drinks were nice and tasty. Bar bill was a bit frightening but then this is London and its The Connaught so no surprise there. 
Drinks 10/10
Barstaff 9/10 
Busy or quiet 10/10 - very bust but with a decent crowd and mixture of guests and millennials
Overall 8/10",4,2018,01,16
140,Phenomenal service and attention to detail,"Phenomenal service and attention to detail by several members of the Langham team that made our family trip more special and enjoyable. From concierge to porter, the team clearly makes an effort to go the extra mile to ensure complete guest satisfaction. Rooms are impeccable and highly comfortable and the Palm Court experience is unique. ",5,2018,01,15
140,Amazing Hotel,A return trip to a fabulous hotel. The service at this hotel is first class and the rooms are  lovely. Would recommend booking a room with club lounge access for an extra special stay. The Wigmore is great for a late night drink in a busy pub atmosphere.,5,2018,01,15
140,Langham Review,"This was my first time at the hotel, and I would go again as I was very impressed with the service and the quality of the room I stayed in. I recommend it to anyone whose looking for a luxury night in.",5,2018,01,15
140,Excellent stay!,"The Langham hotel has a perfect location, excellent staff and rooms with very cosy beds. We also visited the Artesian for a drink on Friday and it is the perfect place to start of your London weekend. The portier at the Langham provided great service, had wonderful humor and excellent social skills. We will definatly come back! ",5,2018,01,15
140,Solid hotel in a great location,"I stayed here on a business trip with several colleagues. We arrived late at night, and tired from our flight. Staff at check in were incredibly pleasant and welcoming but managed to make several mistakes, checking people into the same room by accident which could have turned out rather badly (a colleague of mine was changing for bed when he realised the luggage at the end of the bed wasn't his - the other person mistakenly allocated to the room happened to have stepped out for a few minutes!!) This happened with more than one room and is far from ideal from a security perspective. Staff were apologetic when the issue was raised and did their best to make it up to the individuals involved.

The common areas of the hotel are beautiful and dining options were very good. Whilst the older style rooms aren't to my taste, they were well appointed and a decent size for London. Overall, it's a solid and well located choice for London.",4,2018,01,15
140,Langham's best property!,"My review is LONG overdue as I stayed here back in May but nonetheless I think this hotel and their staff deserve my review.

This was my second stay at the Langham London and It was wonderful. I booked two executive suites and we stayed for five nights for my parents anniversary. They were very happy and so was I. We had club lounge access and you certainly can't miss out on this. It is truly worth it.

Most of my interactions with staff were in the Club Lounge where Mr. Fadi runs a very tight ship. He was truly accommodating to the three of us and made us feel welcome and respected every single time we walked in the lounge. 

The rooms we booked were amongst the newest in the hotel and they were lovely. Classic with modern touches and an open plan layout. 

Unfortunately, the spa was undergoing renovations during our stay and we were not able to enjoy it. 

Overall, I loved my second stay at this hotel were I wasn't overlooked once and were Mr. Fadi made sure we felt at home.",5,2018,01,14
140,Great location for Regent & Oxford Street ,"Lovely hotel in central London , staff were very helpful and friendly. Small room in comparison to other Langham Hotel’s I have stayed at ( New York & Pasadena CA) , no view but also quiet as looking over a office courtyard, room was clean well serviced but would try club room if I stay again . Great bars and service. Pool and spa was small but nice for relaxing . I would recommend this hotel for a trip to a London.",4,2018,01,14
140,Late Christmas Ball,"For the second year running our Company held its Christmas Ball at The Langham. With around 180 hungry people to feed at the same time it is no mean feat. For starters the chef produced the most tasty lobster dish it was absolutely delicious. 
For main we had Fillet of Buccleuch beef and the beautiful cut was cooked to perfection on the rare side just how I love it.
I had to pass on dessert because I was full having had two starters a spare starter was going begging and I could not pass up the opportunity for more lobster
All I can say if the chefs can produce such quality for so many I can’t wait to try the restaurant one day where the food is cooked to order.",5,2018,01,14
140,"Class, Class ,Class","Just returned from a weekend in London and had the Langham experience ! In 5 star London hotels you expect a grand entrance, great public spaces , luxurious bedrooms, top service, along with fabulous food & drinks, The Langham has this this in spades!
What we felt however made our stay al the more memorable were the Langham team. Every member of staff we came in contact with were immaculately turned out, professional, knowledgeable but above all so very friendly and possessed the vision and almost ESP skills to anticipate what you might need and remembered names and previous orders etc. with a genuine intention to make you feel special.

 We made use of the Club lounge which was a very special place with food available throughout the day, (high light was the canapé's & buffet from 5.30pm) along with drinks, anything from tea & coffee to champagne. Many thanks to Emilija, Christophe, Norbitt, Ritchie, & Oi who were all so brilliant.

The hotels Artisan bar is a world class venue rightly winning 'best bar' award over many years. Again the staff their are top notch, Anna heads the team of incredible bartenders who create great cocktails with great skill and theatre and generate a buzzing chic atmosphere through to the early hours, it is easy to lose track of time just soaking up this experience. We loved the little welcome drink they give you on arrival really unusual and unique. Do try the Gimlet!!

Many thanks Langdon",5,2018,01,14
140,Outstanding,"We have been lucky enough to have traveled and stay in many hotels around the world, and the Langham has to be one of the very best. Great service, great location, can not recommend high enough, we will be returning !!!!!",5,2018,01,14
140,Wonderful end to a long trip,"We stayed at the Langham London on our last leg of our 3 week Europe trip.  We have found our new London Hotel! We felt at home the moment we arrived with greetings at the front entrance.  We were taken straight to our room with checkin completed in the room.  Welcome basket of goodies for the children.  The staff - door man, concierge and reception were all friendly and helpful.  We had a relaxing breakfast in the beautiful Hotel restaurant every morning.  The hotel also smells beautiful! The location is perfect for a quick walk to oxford and regent streets.  We will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,13
140,Only the best service is at The Langham!,"From the time you leave your vehicle you will be greeted by Ian and staff who will welcome you with open arms. The rooms and location are amazing. The staff could not do enough for our family and two year old grandson.
We will be back ASAP.",5,2018,01,13
140,A sanctuary in the middle of London,"This was our fourth stay at the Langham London and, as always, we were delighted with the hotel, the staff, the food, and the drinks.  We have always stayed in an executive room which gives access to the Langham Club which is a home away from home.  We will return.",5,2018,01,12
140,"Great location, nice hotel and friendly staff","We had the opportunity to stay at The Langham in December 2017 and January 2018. We enjoyed our first stay so much that we decided it was our hotel for our last leg of our long European trip. 

Needless to say, the hotel is well located with all the facilities of a 5 star hotel. What makes this hotel so wonderful are their staff, from the gentleman greeting you with a smile in the freezing cold, the doorman, the bellhop who will assist you enthusiastically, reception, housekeeping, waitstaff and so on. We have decided that this is our go to hotel any time we visit London. Highly recommended. 

Facilities: Chuan Spa, Nespresso coffee machine in room, indoor heated pool, open fire place in lobby, on site restaurants.",5,2018,01,11
140,Rude staff.  Terrible service.  Poor value for money.,"I would never recommend the Langham London.  We travel all over the world with our children and have stayed in other Langham hotels.  After coming from The Merchant in Belfast where we were absolutely spoiled, The Langham was a huge disappointment and really put a dampner on our time in London.  The staff were rude.  Everything was just too hard for them.  I've never encountered anything like it.  The room was average and needed serious updating. There was absolutely no value in our stay.  The doormen stood looking at us as we struggled with our pram.  They were rude to our children.  They directed us to various places incorrectly every single time.  We were tormented daily by room service who knocked on our door every hour until we left the room in the mornings.  Room service barged into the bathroom when my husband was on the toilet - not once but twice!  Just so average in every respect.  I was woken up throughout the night with the loud fridge which I eventually had to turn off so we could all get some sleep - every night.  We have been travelling for 5 weeks now and are still on our travels in New York.  So far, the Langham has been the only hiccup.  Really annoyed that we didn't book elsewhere - especially for nearly $5,000 for a 6 night stay.   From someone who loves to travel and appreciates lovely hotels and great service, I would suggest you give this one a big miss.",1,2018,01,11
140,Anniversary trip,"Amazing hotel almost overlooked it because of Savoy (thankfully i didn’t) — really thought getting executive room made a meaningful difference in my experience particularly since it allowed access to Langham Club, probably one of the best value propositions of all luxury hotels at which i have stayed in the past.",5,2018,01,11
140,Delightful afternoon tea at the Langham,"Today a party of friends spontaneously decided to take afternoon tea at the Langham. With no booking, we were pleasantly surprised when they prepared a table for us on the spot. The menu was beautifully set out on pearlised paper and contained interesting facts about the teas and coffee on offer. The decor is comfortable and inviting, the staff are welcoming and polite. Our party of six chose the high tea which included a glass of pink champagne and four course for £62 a head. The sandwiches were very interesting and had delicate flavours. I had the mushroom arancini that almost had a truffle flavour. The scones were light and warm. The cakes were beautiful to look at and the taste lived up to the presentation. Our tea was served with ceremony and our tea pot and cup were constantly refreshed without having to ask. A ten out of ten",5,2018,01,10
140,Was amazing experience,"I had an amazing experience with this hotel , i like their hospitality & kind welcoming,, they made rooms ready for us before check in time ,, i do appreciate this ,, thanks a lot to all from security guard to the cleaners 

",5,2018,01,10
140,Excellent hotel,"Top notch hotel, beautifully done up. We came here when intending to see Adele at Wembley. Sadly the concert got cancelled, but we still had a nice time at the Langham. The location is excellent and very central - at the top of Regent Street. We tried the cocktail bar there, which serves drinks in all sorts of weird and wonderful receptacles. If you want to try it out, you should head there as soon as it opens as it gets very busy.",5,2018,01,09
140,"Incredible staff, nice rooms, great club, great bar","Stayed at Christmas past -- all the staff, from reception, to the club, to the bar, were exceedingly friendly and helpful.  Concierge did what I needed her to do quickly and cheerfully,  Breakfast at Palm Court was very good, if a bit redundant -- I'd recommend they vary the items on the buffet a bit from day to day, just to keep things interesting.  They did that with the tea service and appetizers in the club -- Step up to the club level for a great value.  Again, great staff who pour a good drink.  Extensive food options.  Comfortable.  Really, a very nice amenity.  Rooms were fine, if unremarkable.  The craft bar, if a bit mod for my taste, has great bartenders who make fabulous cocktails.  They couldn't have been nicer.  A great hotel!",5,2018,01,08
140,Back to The Langham,"After exactly one year we went back to The Langham, finding the same perfection we had left. At the arrival Elena welcomed us warmly and provided our family room well in advance of the scheduled. The room was perfect, clean and spacious. In the morning, going for the breakfast, we were a little bit disappointed because the main restaurant was closed for refurbishment, but having breakfast at the Palm Court was still amazing. The service during breakfast is perfect. Furthermore we also had a dinner at the Palm Court, and food and service were perfect as well. We definitively consider this hotel our perfect companion when travelling to London and will choose it for sure in the future.",5,2018,01,08
140,Excellent hotel with a high quality service,I highly recommend the hotel. We stayd in Langham for three nights and enjoyed a lot. The hotel stuff is very helpful and service level is very high. The location is excellent. Restaurans are all high class and famous afternoon tea is higly recommended. ,5,2018,01,08
140,Simply superb!,"As soon as me and the wife arrived we were looked after straight away. From the doorman to the guy that checked us in at the front desk - they couldn't have done any more for us.
We arrived a little early but our room on the 5th floor was ready.
The room was perfect. Very refined as expected. Bed lovely and comfy and the bathroom was lovely.
When we returned from an afternoon shop, the bed was turned down and slippers put out for us - a nice touch! We also had a call from the reception asking if we had everything we needed - another nice touch.
For an older building we thought it might have been noisy overnight but we didn't hear a thing and had a lovely nights sleep.
All in all, a beautiful hotel with attentive staff.",5,2018,01,08
140,"Old bathroom and guest room, but great people and location","The hotel in general has very friendly, great employees who enjoy what they do.
The room is very small and the beds are very light so when you walking pass the beds, be careful to not trip over by its mobility.
The shower facility was not very pleasant, for two reasons. One is that the shower does not have enough pressure to release water. Two is the used water does not drain very quickly, so you feel like  you've been standing in dirty water throughput the whole shower.",3,2018,01,07
140,Delightful Palm Court Afternoon tea ,Seriously fabulous afternoon tea.  The Most delicious warm scones.  Perfect sandwiches and great service.  Pastries were light and so tasty.  Atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable.  If you like afternoon tea this is a must.  ,5,2018,01,06
140,Exceptional! ,"I don’t write too many reviews but when I do I try to make them as informative as possible. This was my third time staying at The Langham and I have to stay it is by far the most memorable. 
I booked this stay for my parents for New Years Eve as a Christmas present in which my partner and myself also attended. I booked 2 junior suites back in May and requested newly refurbished rooms, which, at the time were granted. 
However, upon confirming a week before my stay I was told the suites had been reallocated and could not be guaranteed. I was really disappointed as I had been planning this surprise for my parents since earlier in the year, and so was trying to make it as special as possible. The reasons given for why the suites could not be confirmed did not make a great deal of sense if I’m honest- that some guests have longer stays and so rooms are allocated to reflect this. Given this I was quite apprehensive before my visit. 
Upon check in we were personally escorted to the Club Lounge; a privilege afforded for Club, Junior Suite and above residences. I can certainly say it’s worth it. We were treated so well from the moment we entered the lounge. We arrived early (around 11am), and were offered champagne and even breakfast if we so desired. 
The lounge is very spacious and decorated in an elegant manner with different lighting and surroundings to suit your mood. I won’t go into too much more detail on the lounge as many other reviewers have already covered the essentials. My only minor issues on this were the far left corner  of the lounge near the toilets is extremely warm (we were seating here several times during busy periods but moved as soon as we could). We also noticed other guests doing the same. Secondly, I would like to have seen more hot food options in the lounge which I have seen in other Hotels. However, the quality of food and service is fantastic and these are only minor niggles if I was being picky! 
Our rooms were due to be ready at 3pm, however a member of the lounge staff approached us and explained one of the suites was still not ready and it was closer to 3.45pm when it was completed. We did not mind as the surroundings of the lounge more than made up for the delay. 
When we did get to our rooms (350 and 545), we were truly blown away. Without mention, we had both been upgraded to a refurbished One Bedroom suite with views over Regent Suite. I cannot explain the moment we walked in; truly breathtaking! I have seen smaller apartments. Everything was so thoughtfully done; to the fresh flowers around the Suite, the underfloor heating and the champagne, card and chocolates that were left for us. 
The fact we were in a refurbished room and an upgrade at that was fantastic. We could not be more grateful. My mum was so blown away she had tears of happiness at one stage when looking around the Suite. As I am sure for many, this was an experience that we won’t often be able to repeat (due to cost), so for The Langham to arrange an upgrade without mention was truly 5 star service. I can only assume it was due to the issues with my previous email correspondence. 
From my images, compared to previous reviewers one bedroom suite pictures, you can really see how big a difference the refurbishment makes. I hope all will be renovated to this amazing standard. We were so happy with our accommodation we could have quite happily not left had we not arranged to go and view the New Year Fireworks show. Again, only one small niggle with our room; the heating system. It was set to 22 degrees which was incredibly warm and could not be reduced in temperature. I can only assume a previous quest had requested the temperature to be set so high! A call to reception meant a member of staff came up and went away to investigate further. He explained he would be back in 15 minutes but half an hour later he had not returned. Due to going out it meant another call to reception who explained they would pass on the message. In the meantime I had to open all the windows as I could not cope coming back to 22 degree heat!
Breakfast was enjoyed in Roux at the Landau (you can dine here, the lounge or the palm court) ; a mixture of high end continental offerings and a full English buffet. Think avocado with sesame seeds. meats, cheeses and artisan breads. Again, champagne was offered which was a nice touch to welcome New Years Day. Tea, Coffee and Toast are offered/can be requested from your waiter. 
Overall, the minor negatives I mention are not enough to distract from a 5 star rating. My parents have stayed in most London top hotels and rate The Langham as the best. I am glad to see it climbing the rankings on TripAdvisor and hope it gains the recognition it deserves. When talking to my friends they have not heard the name, as opposed to The Ritz or The Savoy for example. I hope this changes! I hope to visit again in the future!",5,2018,01,06
140,World class. Simple as that.,"An absolutely amazing experience. Service beyond the norm, food that makes you giggle with happiness, along with real, genuinely personal and friendly staff. We were made to feel like royalty. From the very first contact with the doormen to the last.",5,2018,01,06
140,"Staying in hotels like The Langham, is an experience!","Having stayed in the Langham in 5th Avenue NYC i decided to book a room in the first Langham, located in London.
Arriving at the hotel way earlier than check in time, i was greeted by very professional and friendly staff. 
They checked me in because they had the room available and i was taken to the room.
The room was to the standard that i expected elegant and classy and lived up to the Langham expectation.
The marble bathroom was amazing too. 
There was a big TV, a big desk and a nespresso machine, and still plenty of space in the room, the only downside was no outside view rather a hotel inside view.
I have to mention the huge bed, which was by far the best bed i slept on, i did not want to get up in the morning and i am not a sleeping fan.
Another downside was the fact for this price the breakfast could be included, but it was not and any way i got up after breakfast time finished so it wouldn't have made any difference.
I cannot judge the wellness centre because i did not use as i did not finish what i had to do and be back in time.
I also left the bags at the concierge which i took later on because i had to check out and return late to pic them up, and the hotel staff made this way to easy.
Lastly the hotel lobby and reception area due to the festive season was so warm and nicely decorated,",5,2018,01,05
140,Stay at Langham,"I have stayed at many different hotels and have never experienced the service that I have received at Langham from check in to check out. 
In particular the Langham club lounge really took care of me and my partner for every single need. 
",5,2018,01,05
140,Wow,Excellent hotel. Great staff. Beautiful rooms. Breakfast is very special. The artesian cocktail bar has wonderful cocktails and I highly recommended a visit on your stay. A great location to see the sights of London. ,5,2018,01,05
140,Incredible!,"Perfect surroundings, perfect customer service, perfect food & drink! What more can I say? A wonderful hotel. 

The room was outstanding and everything is thought about so well. Can’t wait to go back!!!",5,2018,01,05
140,"What a great surprise!  The Langham, London.","A great location!  Who would have thought it.  Can't fault a thing here.  Fantastically welcoming staff throughout, lovely spacious rooms, the Club Lounge a wonderful place to have access to.  A really nice gym & spa to work off those calories earned in one of the hotel bars or dining options, which are all very different and so good that even the locals frequent too",5,2018,01,04
140,Best visit yet to our favourite hotel!,"Just returned from our fifth consecutive New Year's trip to the wonderful Langham which totally outstripped our high expectations. As we had booked a junior suite, we went straight to the Club Lounge to complete a friendly check in, after leaving our bags with the doormen. There we were greeted with champagne and the offer of afternoon tea before heading up to our room, which was on the ninth floor. We were also asked if we were celebrating anything in particular, to which I replied that we had had our Silver Wedding earlier in the year and this was part of our treat. Previously having stayed in Executive rooms, we were quite excited to see what a junior suite would offer. However, we were absolutely blown away we we arrived into the one bed corner suite which we received as an upgrade!

The rooms were spacious and comfortable, with a great range of amenities. The living area was well kitted out for refreshments, with a nespresso machine as well as minibar, tea making facilities and a range of glasses. It also featured a great work space, comfy sofa and coffee table. The hallway had a range of storage options. The bathroom was fitted out in marble, with a separate toilet area, shower, bath and under floor heating. The bedroom was generously sized, again with a great range of storage options and an enormous comfortable bed. A slight criticism would be that the pillows are a bit on the soft side, although, I do believe there is a pillow menu that would have rectified this. On top of this, we had the most incredible views! We normally attend an event so we can see the fireworks in London: had I realised that we would be treated to such spectacular vantage point I wouldn't have booked anything else. Although this was essentially a trip for my husband and I, our daughters were also visiting at the same time, so the extra space meant that they could also come and spend time with us in the hotel on a couple of occasions. 

We had barely settled in before a member of staff arrived at our door with wine, chocolates and a lovely card for our celebration. On New Year's Eve we received fruit, chocolates and a special house cocktail. My only minor disappointment is that the amazing fruit and popping candy chocolate bar we have received on previous trips seems to have been replaced, however the chocolates we did have were lovely.

If you are considering a trip to this gorgeous hotel, I would strongly recommend booking a room with Club Lounge access if possible. The selection of food differs from breakfast to evening canapes and is accompanied by free flowing Perrier Jouet. The scones with clotted cream at afternoon tea are not to be missed! 

The staff throughout the hotel are always friendly and a joy to deal with, from the doormen on arrival, through check in, waiting staff and house keeping. The hotel itself looks and smells luxurious. One of these days I will actually make it down to the spa and into the Wigmore, but between the delights of the Club and our rooms I didn't manage it this trip!

Locationwise, this hotel is hard to beat. Just off Regent Street with Oxford Circus less than 5 minutes on foot, there's a wealth of shops and sights easily accessible and if you don't fancy walking the doormen can summons you a taxi in seconds with a whistle. If what you are looking for is a little bit of luxury in the heart of London, look no further...you will find it at the Langham! Can't wait to return for my next fix!",5,2018,01,04
140,Great service and hotel,Went on a family trip to London and stayed at Langham. The rooms and restaurants were very nice. The breakfast included was very good. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping us plan our trip. Highly recommend this hotel!,5,2018,01,04
140,Exceptional Experience at the Langham London,"My husband, daughter stayed 5 nights at the Langham London.  It was by far one of the best service experiences and hotel stays we have ever had--and we generally stay exclusively at 4 and 5 star properties.  Upon arrival, the hotel upgraded us to a suite which was ideal since we were traveling with my 7 year old daughter.  From then on, the staff did anything and everything to ensure we enjoyed our stay with them.  I highly recommend booking the Club level with access to the Club Lounge.  The staff there is among the most highly trained and impressive as you will find anywhere.  They were kind, so attentive, and incredibly professional.  They made our time at the Langham truly special.  I cannot say enough about the level of attentiveness and service the Langham London provides.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else when in London, and will seek out other Langham properties for my future travels.",5,2018,01,04
140,Best location,"Very good hotel lovely rooms the service was excellent overall excellent experience the staff is very friendly and helpful breakfast and the food  also 
very good  and the location is great just 5 minuets walk to Oxford street ",5,2018,01,04

140,Fantastic hotel!,The Langham London was the best hotel I've ever stay in! The staff went above and beyond and the service was just perfect! I feel so lucky to have been able to stay at The Langham and I would highly recommend it!,5,2018,01,03
140,My Favourite Hotel Stay Ever!,"From the moment of arrival, the service at this Prestigue Establishment was second to none. We had the warmest welcome from Danny as soon as we approached the building and the reception staff were lovely. We stayed in a Superior Bedroom and it was wonderful. A lovely handwritten card was written by Josie welcoming us to the hotel and thanking us for choosing to stay. Champagne, Chocolates & a Cake were in our room on arrival and we had a beautiful rose petal turndown. We drank in both bars which were fantastic and Chip in the Artesian was such a pleasant waiter. Breakfast in Palm Court was simply amazing. The Pool & Spa Facilities were of a great standard and the Staff were so friendly and Accomodating. I did not want to leave this beautiful hotel as it was faultless, the most perfect start to the New Year.",5,2018,01,03
140,NYE @ The Langham,"Staying over the New Year period, when many hotels would struggle to keep the level of service up, The Langham kept up if not exceeded the levels i have enjoyed before. Having access to the lounge is the thing that lets you enjoy that fantastic service and bring it above most of the other 5 star hotels in London.
Will be interesting to compare it to the NYC hotel when i visit in Feb",5,2018,01,03
140,Great hotel,"Langham London is friendly, quiet, clean and it's location in London made it easily accessible for all our needs. Excellent staff. We stayed immediately prior to Christmas and the hotel was very festive. Will stay again on next London trip.",5,2018,01,03
140,Miller Christmas 17,If you can stretch then I highly recommend the Langham hotel.  It finds a perfect balance between being a slice of prestigious luxury London yet being highly approachable and welcoming.  The location is perfect for shopping and theatre expeditions and the staff are great.,5,2018,01,02
140,Pre-Christmas treat at the Langham Hotel,"The Langham London was an excellent experience from start to finish , and with its excellent location it exceeded our expectations on all fronts , in terms of presentation , quality of service and facilities , and we will stay there again .",4,2018,01,02
140,Superior or not superior,"You would think that when you booked a superior room it would mean that it# better than something else? Well not here. A superior room is a standard room. My superior room although supposedly double had only one bedside cupboard, the dressing table was placed next to the bed at the other side, which I have not encountered before so please do ask about this on check in. Also, the room I was allocated was the smallest 5 star room I have ever stayed in. I would call this a “crash pad”room. Certainly, there was only one chair so if there are two of you and you want tha last night glass of wine, one of you ha to sit on the bed. And, two people cannot access the wardrobe at the same time, so that could be tricky and awkward, if time is not on your side. My recommendation to the Langham is they change this room to single occupancy only. It really is not big enough for two and way lower standard expected for a 5 star hotel. On another note, they have just added a spa, which I didn’t have time to try out, the staff are friendly and attentive, the location is good for shopping and plenty of eateries near by if you don’t want breakfast or dinner in the hotel. All in all a good hotel but definitely check out your room on booking it. Finally, the bed was very comfortable, too comfortable if I am honest, I struggled to get up.",4,2018,01,02
140,"The best stay in London, no doubt!","The Langham is the reference for hospitality. Delightful! Top Quality service, rooms, food. The location is excellent. Staff is very kind. Feels very much like a home from home. The best stay in London.",5,2018,01,02
140,The Langham Hotel,"Great location, lovely friendly staff, overall an exceptional experience.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in London, it is close to the main shopping areas, the restaurant and facilities in the hotel are great",5,2018,01,02
140,A regular visitor to the langham - a few flaws this time ,"We hardly consider staying at any other hotel in London when we want a little treat after a family Christmas at our home :
We tend to stay in suites with access to their very spacious club lounge which might well be the best of its type in London .
So the flaws - well the air con in our room did not work it was stuck on 21:5 c so as it was rather warm outside -12 c plus 
We missed this especially at night where we experienced that unfortunately rather common experience of feeling rather 
Over warm with Windows you could only partially open and the aircon blasting out warm air very noisily - two attempts by engineers to fix failed but I was most impressed by the chap who came on the second try at fixing it he was pleasant 
And clearly informed about how it should work - but nevertheless couldn’t fix it 
So flaw (1) 
Flaw(2) was the young lady in the club lounge who when being told about our aircon said how inconvenient it must be 
- you have a sleepless night being cooked in your bedroom inconvenient is hardly the wood , she also failed 
Completely in dealing with the problem indeed she avoided dealing with it 
On leaving a manager at the desk in the club lounge - more direct ,un robotic ,gave us £200 off our room which was 
Generous ,but really paying £690 for a suite you have a right to expect working aircon .
The rather excellent club lounge service from the waiting staff could not be better they are humorous and attentive 
And it is the club lounge where you can avoid the milling throng in the rest of the hotel that is the main reason for us 
Preferring to stay at the langham
On previous stays here we never encountered the aircon problem other than pre their refurb when frankly there was no aircon  in the ordinary rooms that worked .
Only other minor gripe was a rather lousy lobster bisque that had only a passing acquaintance with a lobster in its making 
And certainly no lobster in it at all - compare sheekey , or the colony grill at the  beaumont .
So we left feeling a touch angry about no aircon but probably more angry about the way the problem was not dealt with 
I did ask the robotic person who checked us in at the club lounge for another  room a request that went unacknowledged 
It’s those little things that can change a loyal regular customer into one who thinks of trying elsewhere next time 
It was interesting that the person who did check us in a the club lounge asked if it was our first time in the hotel !!!
In the age of the computer such ignorance is hard to achieve ,and like most people we like to feel when we go anywhere 
The fact we are a regular , be it a hotel or restaurant or whatever is appreciated .
Oh dear !

140,Great hotel for a City trip to London,"comfortable beds
central situation, close to all facilities
nice staff
large and well heated swimming pool

breakfast ok, but nothing special for this kind of hotel (seating very uncomfortable in Palm Court)
lunch at Roux at the Landau expensive and disappointing (you eat better outside)",5,2018,01,02
140,Fabulous location and hardware ,Location is excellent as it is 5-10mins walk to Oxford Street that full of department store...shops...easy to go back to take a break when you are tired to shop and go again...room facilities is great...and fair size... customer service is so so....If you are shopaholic...it is a good choice. Walkable to Oxford Circus...Soho...and very close to Covent Garden...Borough Market...,4,2018,01,01
140,High Tea,"We went for afternoon tea one wet day in London, when we were seeking something to do. 

We had such a tasty and fabulous afternoon tea here. A treat for hubby & I, but well worth it. Loved the building and our waitress was very attentive. We'll be back!

Thanks!",5,2018,01,01
140,Amazing,Back from a wonderful Christmas stay in London . Location fantastic but the service and care that we were shown was a cut above . Nothing was too much trouble . We had the flu during the visit and the staff went out of their way to care for us with hot drinks and courtesy calls to make sure we were ok . The club staff did everything to make us feel at home . Amazing service . ,5,2018,01,01
140,watch your bill,"we had a package on NYE at this hotel, staff at reception were keen to point out what was in the package @ $1010  per night  ,one of the things they pointed out was free parking .when the  bill came  $80   for parking  ,sorry sir just a mistake    ,SURE it was  ,Champagne and chocolates said happy new year  but did not sat there were 
Complementary so we never touched them  ,",4,2018,01,01
140,Wonderful family stay,"We had booked connecting rooms which were honored and arranged wonderfully prior to arrival. The rooms were very spacious and bathrooms luxurious. The beds were very comfortable (walls are thin though and you can here neighbors, which is a minus). The hotel is in a great wonderful location with multiple subway access and walkable to many restaurants and shopping on regent/Oxford/carnaby. ",5,2017,12,31
140,You won't regret it!,"A five star experience in every way.  From the moment you are greeted by the doormen on arrival 'til after you check out, our family was made to feel very special and had a thoroughly memorable stay in London because of it.  ",5,2017,12,31
140,Lovely,"Practically perfect in every way - our family of five enjoyed a 5 day visit just after Christmas - great location, comfortable rooms, friendly staff - a truly memorable vacation in London.  The Langham lives up to its storied reputation.",5,2017,12,31
140,A pure pleasure,Excellent servise. Excellent bed. Marvellous location.good breakfast in a luxurious dining room.desk attentive to visitors requests . We liked the offers made by the concierge deskA hotel to return to,5,2017,12,31
140,Beautiful ,"Love love this hotel. Great location with very comfortable deluxe rooms. We were in the regent wing which was great because it had its own entrance so didn’t need to keep going through the hotel but one of our party thought that was a shame as didn’t keep seeing the Christmas trees! We had tried to get a suite but they were none available which we will certainly try & do next time. 

Breakfast has 2 options, we were too late for roux so had the buffet but then ordered a La carte hot breakfast, we did have to ask if this was possible though. 

All in all a great stay. ",5,2017,12,31
140,A Real Disappointment,"My friend & I arrived at the Langham a few days before Christmas with great anticipation, and left with much disappointment.   On the positives, it is a beautiful Los Hotel in a great location, and the service is impecable.   On the enormous CON side, At $550 a night with a minimal 2nd floor view and  without breakfast, I expect much more than a glorified Great Western hotel room with an equally TINY bathroom.   I thought it was a disgraceful lack of any value--- there was at most 4 feet of clearance around the bed, and you would have been lucky to turn around in the unremarkable bath.  Plus, my pet peeve, the towels were VERY cheap & could double as sandpaper.  The room was dingy and depressing... I would NEVER return!",2,2017,12,30
140,London again after 2 years,"I almost always stay at the Langham whenever I returned to London, mainly it’s because of its prime location and also the service quality which I’ve confidence in. This time I booked the early bird deal on a deluxe room, had been told by front desk it was recently renovated and I could noticed some of the features like usb plugs are installed. 
As usually the room is spacious, I didn’t expect a view so it was fine without one. The bathroom is huge with separate shower & bathtub, the only problem i had with it was the shower room couldn’t be closed properly thus causing a little flooding around the door. Also amenities were not refilled properly on a few days which could be frustrating while one finds out shower cap is missing again after a day out. The biggest disappointment was the wifi & general phone reception, it was very bad on the 6/f in my room which I couldn’t even make a phone call from my mobile.
Went to both restaurants for breakfast but none of them was good experience, the food was great but it was the service & the staff attitude which didn’t make one feel welcome. I understand mid dec could be horribly busy & staff are stressed but that already put me off from going downstairs but ordered room service instead. 
Upon my check out I was lucky to double check my bill as the Palm court charged on my breakfast while it should’ve already been included in my room rate so that was a bit of a flaw there. In general staff there was nice & friendly, I only saw 1 or 2 grumpy faces among the housekeeping & porter staff.",4,2017,12,30
140,Excellent Holiday Stay,"Stayed 8 nites at this wonderful historic property . The Family Room was spacious clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful and pleasant from the front desk folks to the restaurant . The food was excellent . The concierges were very good at assisting us making reservations and suggesting places to eat. 
Overall great stay over the Christmas Holiday ! ",5,2017,12,30
140,Excellent,"We loved our stay at the Langham. We enjoyed it very much: the location of the hotel, the friendly staff and excellent service, the good restaurant and bar, beautiful rooms, nice bathrooms, the overall atmosphere of the hotel....the service and the atmospherre of the Club Lounge is excellent. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,30
140,"Great location but quiet, traditional and modern comfortable for everyone! ","I started there many times but never get bored.
Beautiful restaurants and the room decoration is traditional and modern. Very comfortable for global citizens. The location is perfect for shopping or business meetings, very close to the Oxford circus but quiet. There are several cafes nearby and they open from 6 or 6:30am which are great for travelers with jet lug. I love the atmosphere of the hotel. Elegant!!!
And before I go, the doormen are excellent. There is a drive way for the hotel so easy to get in and off from a cab in the middle of London which is bonus and great greetings with practical services from the doormen! ",5,2017,12,30
140,Absolutely Luxurious without attitude,"A great luxurious place right at the centre of most happening place in London City, at a walkable distance from almost all important sightseeing places and shopping centre. Great spread of English breakfast. Staff are most friendly and helpful. ",5,2017,12,29
140,Upscale hotel with excellent service able to accommodate family of four with one guestroom,"The Langham is beautiful - definitely a luxury hotel - and the service is beyond reproach. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. As Americans, the only thing that wasn’t our very favorite was breakfast due to some cultural differences in breakfast food choices… However there was plenty to choose from and we certainly managed!  There was always the opportunity to order from the kitchen if something in the buffet didn’t suit us, so really this can’t be considered a problem at all.   What was especially nice for our family of four, with daughters ages 17 and 20, was that the Langham offers a large family room that sleeps four with comfort and plenty of space. We just had to navigate the single bathroom but that was not a problem. So although the hotel is high and pricewise, it actually was likely a savings for us because that most other locations we would have had to have two separate rooms. I should also mention that the beds are extremely comfortable! There were even nice touches like a high-powered blow dryer similar to that from a hair salon and a large selection of movies when we felt like hanging out in the room. Also the location  so close to Oxford Circus cannot be beat.",5,2017,12,29
140,2 night stay on the club floor suite ,"Hotel is beautifully decorated for Xmas, all staff pleasant, club lounge Christina & Hoi especially impressive. Best wagyu beef spaghetti bolognese.  Concierge excellent n welcoming! Housekeeping professional, cleans well. Our stay is a great experience!!! Our all time favourite. Great location close to shopping streets. ",5,2017,12,29
140,Langham wonderful quality and service,Exceeded expectations…property and staff were wonderful…attention to detail was superior…I will definitely use this property for future trips both business and for pleasure…the location is perfect…room was perfection …,5,2017,12,28
140,Simply wondeful,If you are looking for a special hotel with loads of charme and atmosphere combined with timeless luxury and elegance ... then look no further than this hotel. You will probably expect all this in a 5 star hotel in the hart of London. But you will get so much more than that. A lovely staff and a very personal touch. Enthusiasm can be very contagious!  ,5,2017,12,28
140,Understated luxury - come and be spoilt at the Langham,The Langham has consistently proven to be an exceptional place to stay in London.  I have stayed here for years and hope to keep coming back for years yet!  They are set apart not just by the quality of the property but by the staff that they have.  I do not believe I can recall one instance where I have felt disappointed.  Keep up the good work!,5,2017,12,28
140,Afterward tea,My daughter and I decided to have afternoon tea at the Langham it was amazing. The tea was ever flowing the sandwiches were delicious the sones light and fluffy and the cakes amazing. I would recommend to everyone even though was fairly expensive. ,5,2017,12,28
140,Fantastic!,"We stayed in a junior suite and had access to the Langham Club. The service, the staff, the experience - amazing. After this I can not stay iin any other hotel in London - ever again! The staff was so nice and always made sure we had what we needed. ",5,2017,12,28
140,Brilliant in every way,"Excellent staff from the concierge, reception, club lounge staff, bar staff and housekeeping. Can’t fault this hotel - my favourite place to be. A real break from the noise of the city but in the city! Love it and can’t wait to go back...if you are lucky enough to be in the club lounge make sure you try the macaroons...the best in London ",5,2017,12,26
140,"Good hotel, small rooms","The Langham is very centrally located, couple minutes walk from Oxford street. The hotel is very well made and the level of service is very high. Limited but very high quality selection for breakfast.

However, I didn’t enjoy my stay as the rooms are small and the gym was also too small and badly equipped for the size of the hotel. ",4,2017,12,25
140,Perfect Service in the Heart of London ,"Visiting the UK from Australia for Christmas we spent 3 nights at the Langham and loved every second. A great check in experience was quick but thorough and very professional but also friendly. We were escorted to a beautiful double room which has every amenity you could require. Beautiful bathroom and big comfortable bed. 

We included breakfast in our room rate and I would strongly encourage you to do the same. There are 2 breakfast options. Palm court is the more “casual” is set in a beautiful room where you have the choice of cold or hot buffet breakfast. The coffee and juices were great as was the service. Pastries were to die for. The other option is Landau which is Michel Roux’s on site restaurant. The service here is impeccable and the smoked salmon is the best I’ve ever had. We also had dinner here (great deal on a set dinner if you don’t want to do full a la carte between 5-30pm and 7pm) which was a wonderful experience. The food was incredible, silver service with Wedgewood plates and great attentive service from the team at Landau. 

The Langham is a 3 min walk from Oxford Circus station so underground transport access is no problem. You’re a similar distance from the corner of Oxford Street and Regent Street so you have some of London’s best shopping on your doorstep. 

The Langham has recently opened The Wigmore which is a great gastro pub adjacent to the hotel. Great beers and food in here with top service and a wonderful atmosphere. 

I’d like to thank all the staff at the Langham for making our stay so memorable but particularly to Sonia at the reception desk for helping me print some tickets I’d forgotten to get ready before we left home. Very professional and very quick service. 

We made memories at the Langham and will most certainly be staying here next time we visit London with plans to stay longer next time. If you’ve any questions please feel free to ask. ",5,2017,12,23
140,Destination for Luxury ,"Langham is one of the luxurious hotels in central London 
Rooms are perfect, staff are extremely friendly , breakfast is nice, but both restaurants are extremely busy and you should arrive really early if you want to have breakfast in the hotel.
Location is perfect , right at the end of Oxford Street and at the start of Regents street , for shopping and fine dining as well
We loved it, parking is extremely expensive by the way.",4,2017,12,20
140,Wonderful experience,Lovely historic building with great staff and service. We had a club room and it was a delight to go the club lounge for a drink after shopping / sightseeing.

140,Utterly Exquisite!,"Stayed for one night in Executive room and have enjoyed every minute in this beautiful hotel!., my husband had rang to inform hotel we would arrive early and we checked in with Bianca at Executive lounge who looked after us so well. We enjoyed a beautiful champagne breakfast and felt like we were the most important guests there!., the food and beverages are stunning and the staff go the extra mile to ensure you have the best experience!., we requested eggs, cocktails and the staff including Nicole, Richard and Norbert could literally not do enough for us. The customer service at The Langham has to be the BEST we have ever experienced. We stayed at The Langham Chicago which was beautiful but London stands in a class of its own!.. Diana and team make you feel so at home and it is a genuine love of their job that shines through. The room was so comfortable and quiet too. We did not want to leave, Norbert even had a packed lunch ready for our train journey home. Attention to detail, being remembered by name and also the staff knowing your beverage is amazing. Feel totally spoilt after this stay, can't wait to return and well done The Langham!.. fantastic outstanding stay x ",5,2017,12,17

140,A anniversary weekend at the Langham,"The hotel has an old-worldly charm about it, and the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly.
The room wasnt the biggest, particularly as we had told them it was a very special anniversary weekend, but it was very well furnished, and comfortable. Decor is very tasteful and everything spotless 
We had one bad experience, where we had asked what time the cocktail bar opened so we could have an anniversary cocktail before eating, and we were told the tables were only available on a first come-first served basis and couldn't be booked. When we went down, we were told that the cocktail bar was being used for a private function until 8.00pm, and until I got cross with the Maitre-d' in the Palm court, we were faced with not being able to get a drink before we left.
We had anniversary chocolates and desert left in our room, and the overall experience was a good one.
The lady who showed us to our room gave us some very interesting facts about the hotel and its history.
I would happily return to the Langham",4,2017,12,13

Excellent location, great accessibility to many places in London in the high of Oxford Street. The staff is so lovely, exhibited extreme professionalism, you feel at home. The bedroom was very nice, fresh fruit and flowers every day, service was excellent and the English breakfast at the Club was delicious. 
Christmas atmosphere at beautiful common spaces at the hotel. Roux at the Landau has an exceptional service and attention to detail at the dining experience, food was delicious, very good wines, it’s a pleasure. Chuan Body+Soul Spa, 60 minutes massage, makes everyone feel relaxed and refreshed when was done. I highly recommend.
Perfect for those looking for a trendy, elegant London stay!",5,2017,12,12
140,Night out,Stayed at the Langham for the weekend have stayed several times before and it was excellent but this time I was disappointed with the breakfast the room was fantastic very spacious with large superking bed and lovely soft pillows nice and warm in the cold weather.When we went down for breakfast we had to queue up in the corridor for about 15 minutes with other guests while the chap checking the room numbers on his computer then showing the guests to their tables it took him ages to return and repeat the process don't know if they were short of staff but haven't experience that method of showing guests to their tables.we were asked if we wanted tea or coffee but had to ask two times before it arrived when we went up for the cooked breakfast most of the dishes were empty had to ask again for them to be replenished was told yes they were coming but after several more requests they still wasn't replenish gave up in the end so went without breakfast ask for toast but had to ask two times for butter in the end got up and walked out not what you expect from a Five Star Hotel this spoiled an otherwise fantastic weekend other guests were complaining also several guests we spoke to were told not to order off the Breakfast menu as it was taking to long to get the orders out.I hope that this was a one off problem but there was no apology or explanation what was happening Very Disappointing.,4,2017,12,11
140,Wish I could have stayed longer ,"Having just come from a historic hotel where the rooms were tiny and every creak and moan could be heard, it was a treat to check into the Langham. It's all of the upsides of a historic building minus all the things that make historic properties a challenge for guests.  

The room was spacious and the setting quiet for being in the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a luxurious space with a comfy bed, quality linens, fine spa toiletries, and the purple velvet chair fit in as it only can at a Langham property. The staff is professional, warm, and friendly and I especially appreciated being guided personally to my room. It was in an adjacent building and I would have never found it if left to my own devices. 

The lobby is beautifully decorated for the holidays which adds to the energy and good cheer of the place. 

My only disappointment in my stay is that it wasn't long enough. ",5,2017,12,10
140,Lovely ,"Very spacious rooms, with all the relevant facilities.  The bedding was just comfortable and huge.
Huge selection of items at breakfast, it does get busy in the mornings, more staff on floor maybe a good idea.
Location is easy to find and get to Oxford street within minutes.
Will be recommending this hotel to others and more likely to stay here again very soon.
Keep it up!",4,2017,12,10
140,Only place to stay! ,"On arrival were upgraded to a studio apartment which was much appreciated as we were there for business and pleasure. 
Of course the location is excellent for shopping and the tube station is nearby. The staff couldn’t do enough to ensure we had everything we needed during our stay. 
We went for breakfast at two different locations within the hotel, both were excellent. The palm has a more relaxed vibe and roux gives you a more formal dining experience. 
If you need a five star hotel in London within this area then we would defiantly recommend the langham.........don’t forget to try the cocktails at the artesian bar, they are awesome! ",5,2017,12,10
140,Perfection,It would be hard to recommend a hotel more highly for a business trip. From check in to check out all my needs were covered. The location was great for where I was working and also for a bit of sight seeing.,5,2017,12,10

140,High Tea in London at its best,"Spent a week in London last week and high tea was high on the list of things to see/experience.  My step daughter lives in London and supplied me with a list of options while suggesting the Langham might be the best choice.  After reading reviews on line, I decided this was exactly what I was looking for.  Nothing too stuffy but very elegant while keeping with tradition.  I am so pleased to say our two hours spent during the service was extraordinary.  The staff was attentive, friendly and took great pride in providing patrons with a genuinely positive experience.  I would like to mention our waiter, Jamie, in particular. What a special individual he seemed to be.  So enthusiastic about providing us with his vast knowledge of teas.  This young man exhibited extreme professionalism.  While all the staff members were lovely, we obviously had more time with Jamie.  The tea, sandwiches, champagne was delicious and the pastry creations were Christmas ornaments.  They even provided us with a lovely pink Langham take-away box.  All in all, I truly hope to re-create this enchanted experience on my return trip.  This hotel truly impressive.",5,2017,12,08

Will definitely stay again on my return.",5,2017,12,06
140,Amazing hotel,"Bets hotel in London! I was there for business, and all the facilities were amazing: room quality, service, Lounge club... And location is perfect!!

140,Perfect location for christmas shopping,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location, fantastic team! You will feel really welcom in this hotel. Even so it is quite a big one, each and every guest is treated very special. The hole team is living the words 'of taking care of the guests'.",5,2017,12,06
140,No place for the business traveler,"As a frequent business traveler to London, I was really looking forward to my stay at the Langham based on its great reviews. based on my experience, this hotel is not at all an appropriate place for me or, indeed, for the frequent business traveler. Three main issues here:

1. No chair. When I checked in, I noticed that the ""desk chair"" was actually an overstuffed chair more appropriate for a living room. I called the desk right away and requested an ergonomic chair. I told them that it did not have to be anything as fancy as an Aeron chair but that it should offer some lumbar support. To their credit, the staff moved quickly and brought a replacement chair to my room in 15 minutes. Unfortunately, the replacement - a roundish green padded thing on a swivel - was no better than the first one. I was very tired, having flown all night, and I did not attempt to get a third chair. Frankly, it seemed to me that the staff had probably already done its best to accommodate me. So I got discouraged and gave up. By contrast, all of the Hilton properties I have stayed at in London have had workable desk chairs and recently the Beaumont offered to go out and rent me a chair when I asked whether they could provide one that was at least slightly ergonomic. Like many business travelers, I work many hours a day at my computer. At the Langham, I wound up working on the ""comfy"" chair in my room with my laptop balanced on my knees. This was uncomfortable and unproductive.

2. No tea. As a busy person, I typically leave no more than 10 minutes for breakfast in the morning. I had a pretty disappointing breakfast at the Langham. I asked the person who seated me if I could order some tea. Instead of saying that she would make that happen, she directed me to ask one of the servers in the room. There was no server in sight. I went to get some food at the buffet. I saw a server. I asked for some tea. The server said she was not responsible for my area of the room but she would pass that along. Seven minutes into my ten minutes, when I had eaten most of my breakfast, the server finally came over and asked me what I wanted to drink. She had no idea that I had already ordered tea (twice!). I ordered tea a third time. Then, before any tea arrived, the ten minutes were up. No tea. Not a great start to my day. No place for a business traveler, again.

3. No receipt. The man who checked me out at the front desk offered to email me a receipt. I thanked him and said yes. He checked my email address. Just in case, I asked him to print one as well. It's a good thing I did. There was no email receipt. I checked my spam folder as well as my regular email. 

In addition, I looked all over the room for an in-room dining menu. Perhaps Langham London offers in-room dining. But I could not find the menu. I was surprised by that. 

I paid over 500 GBP for a one-night stay. I am sorry that I did. Though the property was attractive; the room was on a high floor and far from the elevator, as I had requested; and the staff gave the impression of wanting to make my stay a positive one, I have to say that this was a disappointing, even a depressing experience. I am not inclined to repeat it. Maybe I am just not the right kind of person to stay at the Langham in London.",3,2017,12,05
140,Terrific hotel in a Club class room,"From the initial welcome on Friday lunch time, right through to departure on Sunday afternoon we received fantastic, personslised, high quality service. We had access to the Club which was extra special. Large bedrooms, very good facilities, great location just 5 minutes from Regent/Oxford Street.",5,2017,12,05
140,"Luxury Hotel with Warm, Engaging Service","Everything is luxurious in this property ... with the experience delivered by warm, engaging staff. Definitely worth checking it out! The location is unbeatable - far enough to be away from the busy-ness of Regent and Oxford Streets but close enough to walk to these exciting streets and SOHO and Piccadilly!",5,2017,12,05
140,Lovely stay and a great Location,Really helpful staff and credit where credit is due there was no issues whatsoever with our stay Lovely room recently refurbished overlooking Regent Street and to cap off a lovely stay we saw David Jason(Del Boy) what a legend,5,2017,12,05
140,Xmas Shopping 2017,"Our first time visiting the Langham London and wow were we impressed. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you every need is catered for. The decor of the hotel is elegant and transports you into a word of luxury. Fantastic location walking distance to regent street and oxford street. 

I would definitely recommend booking a room with access to the Club Level as that was truly amazing. The service from the staff was exceptional, the complimentary food and drinks were delicious. It made a huge difference to our experience and we now have found our favourite hotel experience in London for sure!!! Looking forward to our next stay already!!!!",5,2017,12,05
140,Beautiful stay even if troubling times,"I stayed in the hotel in April 2017, and already did a review for the two stays that month.

I was back in London on business in June 2017 a few weeks after the tragic Manchester terrorist attack and a few days after the incident near Borough Market.  It also happened to be during the election, and I departed two days after the election.  So suffice it to say it was a bit of an odd time to be in London.  Not quite unnerving, but definitely more of a police presence and vigilance, even though it was that very polite, stoic, British manner.

Inside the hotel it was a sea of calm though, and in keeping with the old British saying, ""Keep Calm and Carry On"", the staff at The Langham continued to cater to a guests every wish with their friendly and helpful manner.

You can read many reviews of the beautiful appointments of the room (I have done one myself) and their attention to detail.  All very true.  But it was so nice in these troubled times to feel as home as one can when one isn't at home.  And safe, and taken care of.",5,2017,12,03
140,A fine hotel,"I wasn't really sure what to expect but it is indeed an excellent hotel. We just had one night, in a room with Club access, which worked out as good value (by the time the various Club ""perks"" were factored in). The promised “butler service” was not really apparent but the staff in the Club Lounge were very helpful (as were those outside who organised luggage and valet parking). The food in the Club lounge was very good but not outstanding, though breakfast was particularly good for a buffet (they really know how to do pastries). Our room was of a reasonable size and very quiet and there were no negative issues. We took dinner in Roux at the Landau (see separate review) and were not disappointed. All the grand old London hotels have their charms and this one is no exception. I hope we will return.",5,2017,12,03
140,First visit First class!,"From arrival until departure the staff made us welcome and were efficient and courteous throughout.  This was evident from the Welcome and continued cooperation from the doormen, through to check in and check out. 

We took a suite which was very nice and by doing so you have daily access to the Club Lounge. This is a great benefit offering a relaxing venue for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening bites.  All with excellent service.  

The hotel enjoys a good location within minutes of Regent and Oxford Streets.  

We stay in London regularly at the likes of Claridges, the Connaught and Coronthia. All very good but none can match the staff and the feeling of Welcome. 

No complaints. Will be back. ",5,2017,12,03
140,NO WHERE BETTER!,"This was my first experience at a Langham Hotel, and I was really looking forward to it.  I was not disappointed! 
I have never experienced such service in my life.  Fantastic.  
And I had Club Lounge access, which is the best I have ever known.  Superb.  The staff knew my preferences from tea to water to wine....... remembered every day for 5 days.  Even if they had not met me before.  Bravo Langham!",5,2017,12,03

The Concierge was  exceptionally helpful, the staff in the executive Lounge made every visit a delight. if you get a chance to visit London as i do often, this hotel will turn your vacation magical.

140,A Spectacular Hotel,"My wife and I recently celebrated our 70th birthdays at the Langham. It was truly an extraordinary experience. The hotel is  beautiful, the location fantastic and the food fabulous. What made our celebration magical, however, was the service throughout the hotel. To begin with, the hotel went above and beyond to help us celebrate, starting with champagne, chocolates and fruit in our room when we arrived. Staff at every level could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We need to single out two in particular-- Kieren at the concierge desk and a manager named Ahmed, both of whom were tremendously caring and helpful to us.
Our stay at this hotel was so special that we have already committed to returning there next year to celebrate our 50th anniversary, and we can't wait.",5,2017,11,27
140,When an Executive room isn't an Executive room ... A disappointment after earlier excellent experiences.,"I have stayed in Langham hotels before, both in the US and in London, and these had so far been very positive experiences, mainly because of the excellent rooms, amenities and facilities and the very professional and helpful staff. Needless to say I became a member of the loyalty program. And when I planned another city trip to London, I obviously reserved the same sort of Executive room in the Langham London, where I had a great stay a little more than a year ago. Unfortunately, this latest experience, 24-26 November 2017, proved somewhat less than perfect and left me disappointed.

The welcome we received upon arrival was very friendly and, as one would expect from this sort of operation, they knew I had stayed there in an Executive room the year before. Unfortunately check-in was disrupted because there was an IT-systems breakdown (this can happen everywhere). It had also proved impossible to have my room ready for the slightly earlier check-in (1 PM instead of 3 PM) I had requested. This resulted in us being shuttled back and forth between reception at the main desk and reception in the Executive Club lounge (where we waited for our room to be ready). Having given my credit card to register, I was less than impressed when after a good twenty minutes I had to go and ask myself for it to be finally returned. In the end we did get our room keys after about an hour’s time.

The room (number 343) looked very different from the Executive room we had stayed in a year ago, but I initially put this down to variations in floor plan and only really paid attention to what was missing and different after we had settled in and were getting ready to go out. As one would expect the Executive room is bigger than a standard or superior room, so it can accomodate a “full size work desk” (I am referring to the description of the room on the hotel’s website). This had indeed been the case with the Executive room a year ago, but in our “Executive room” 343 there was nothing even resembling a work desk and indeed absolutely no space to put a desk of any kind (giving some indication of the discrepancy between the advertised floor space and the actual floor space in this room). The bathroom arrangement was quite different too. Instead of the “luxurious marble bathroom” (indeed what we had a year ago) we now had an “en suite” bathroom behind the wall supporting the bed’s headboard, with a freestanding bathtub and not much marble in sight.

Upon going out I did mention this to staff at reception. They did confirm 343 was an Executive room, but did offer to look if there were other Executive rooms available. By this time I had to head out in order not to miss an appointment (the purpose of the city trip in the first place) and we had no desire to re-pack everything.

Having noticed the distinct difference of this Executive room from what I had expected based on prior experience and the website-description, I paid attention to other details later on: a clock on my nightstand which didn’t work; the glass doors of the wardrobe closet that were stained with spots (of age, not dirt); …. On the positive side: the bed was soft and the Nespresso machine did work.

As we had a busy schedule we didn’t use the hotel’s fitness and wellness facilities. We did use the Executive Club lounge, but only for breakfast. The breakfast was high quality, although coffee service could be improved. I should also mention that the conciërge service proved very helpful and efficiënt when, due to the incident at Oxford Circus on 24 November, the restaurant where we had planned to eat had to close. They provided us with a table at a similar restaurant nearby that wasn’t affected. 

Since we did little more than sleep and have breakfast twice at the hotel, my disappointment with the room did not marr our city trip overly much. That said, when one expects a certain quality of amenities based on earlier experience and on explicit descriptions on a hotel’s website, it is disappointing when a hotel with a certain reputation tries to pass off something as an “Executive room” when it patently isn’t. After the positive experience last year, I thought I had a fully reliable address in London for all future stays, but now it looks like I will have to explore alternatives.

I want to stress the hotel has many qualities, including its excellent location. But when the room doesn't conform to what has been promised one can only give a poor rating. It is a mystery to me why a hotel with such a reputation and where I had such a positive previous experience messed up in this way.",2,2017,11,27
140,Wonderful hotel,"The Langham London is a very wonderful hotel, the staff is very serviceminded and tries to fulfill all your wishes. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the atmosphere was relaxed and very nice",5,2017,11,27
140,Shopping trip,"Super hotel, very efficient and friendly staff.  The bedroom was quiet, clean and tidy.  Great nights sleep.  Breakfast had a good choice of fruit, continental, and cooked breakfast.  Great location for getting xmas shopping done. The christmas trees are stunning in the entrance.",4,2017,11,26
140,True 5 star hotel,"I stay here quite regularly and never have any complaints. The location is fantastic, the staff are always friendly and helpful and the rooms are of decent size and immaculately clean. Would have no hesitation in recommending it.",5,2017,11,25
140,Birthday luxury,"I recently visited The Langham for afternoon tea to celebrate my birthday with my Mum. From the moment we arrived at the entrance we were treated like royalty!! We were escorted to the entrance of the Palm Court by a lovely member of staff who showed so much enthusiasm for our visit.  The staff show genuine interest in their guests, every single one wishing me a happy birthday and going the extra mile in their service. I must commend one our servers, Mikey, for his excellent service. He kept checking on us and giving recommendations and made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable.  The excellent organic hot chocolate he brought me was one of my highlights!! The tea room is luxurious and classy, with a very talented pianist accompanying proceedings; i was very touched when he played happy birthday whilst a cake and candle were brought out to me! This had already happened for a few guests before me but the staff still made me feel special. I was full to bursting by the time we eventually pried ourselves away. An excellent birthday day treat and I will happily return. Thank you to all!",5,2017,11,25
140,Outstanding customer service,"On the periphery of a police incident in London this afternoon, I found myself taking shelter in the lobby of The Langham in London (the police were advising us to get off the streets).  Many other people, some clearly distressed, had the same idea and the lobby was crowded.  I was greeted by a member of staff who asked if she could help in any way and who straight away gave me a bottle of water, showing me where I could sit and wait.

Was this just great customer service? Was it a simple human response in a crisis, was it kindness or just the kind of class act you would expect at a 5* hotel in a major capital city?  I don’t know.

But, looking around me at everything that was going on, what I saw was an organized, ‘all-hands’, calm, considered, attentive and respectful response to a still-unfolding situation. Hats off and thank you to the staff and management of The Langham.",5,2017,11,25
140,Superb service,"Second visit to The Langham this weekend. As before, the attention to detail is meticulous and the standard of the rooms and amenities first class. But for me it's the staff that stand out. At all times friendly, efficient and courteous. Staying in such a high end establishment could be intimidating but you are made to feel very welcome.",5,2017,11,20
140,Good option close to shopping area,"This was my first visit to The Langham London (I had stayed at The Langham Shanghai before).  The hotel is conveniently located on Regent Street, very close to Oxford Circus tube station and walking distance to restaurants and shops. The room was clean, beautifully decorated, good size, heated bathroom floor (with a very good shower) and a very, very comfortable bed (which made waking up and getting out of bed  very difficultly!!). Breakfast at the Palm Court and at the Roux at the Landau offered very good options both at the buffet and a la carte menu. The hotel gym is well equipped. Service overall was good, however, hotel staff could be more genuinely attentive and welcoming.",4,2017,11,20
140,"Beautiful, elegant hotel, well located","Beautiful room and public spaces, including restaurants and bar. Great service. Wonderful atmosphere with live music at Palm Court in the evening during dinner. Lively bar off of the lobby. Close to Oxford  and Regent Streets and tube.",5,2017,11,20
140,Afternoon tea,"Myself, my daughter & 2 friends had afternoon tea on Saturday. Amazing service & the food was delicious. We were offered extra sandwiches the scones were to die for. We ate so many there was no room for our cakes. We ended up taking them away in a lovely box and given a carrier bag which we all kept. I was given a little birthday cake a lovely surprise. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,11,20
140,"Beautiful, grand hotel","Amazing from top to bottom! Staff are very professional, friendly and helpful, they will do pretty much anything to make sure their visitors have a great stay, you just have to ask! Everything in the hotel is beautiful, including the lovely rooms.

The rooms have everything you could possibly need, including a hairdryer, bathrobe, slippers, coffe making facilities, TV etc. etc., but if there's anything you have forgotten, you can always ask the staff on reception. There is a well-stocked gym on the lower floor next to the spa. There are machines of all kinds there, everything you could want, plus a free weights section.

The breakfast was equally amazing, with so many options to choose from! Being gluten free, I was able to order gluten free bread and was informed of what I could and couldn't eat at the breakfast buffet.

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,11,19
140,"Top quality, home from home hotel","Top quality hotel. Room was spacious, quiet and well equipped. Loved the atmosphere of the Palm Court restaurant, which served a wonderful afternoon tea. All the staff were friendly and most helpful. We loved it here.",5,2017,11,18
140,Perfect Stay,"The Langham is a Gorgeous hotel with top notch service. While it is large, it offers a boutique feel with the amazing service of the staff. The room was wonderful, the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever stayed in. The bathtub was large and great to soak in after a cold day outside. If we ever return to London, we would likely stay here again.",5,2017,11,18
140,The Langham Hotel London still offering personal service,The staff at the hotel are professional and friendly particularly the team on the door and the staff in the newly opened Wigmore.

Love the brand color, pink.",5,2017,11,17
140,My stay,"Amazing Hotel. I never stay anywhere else when in London. As soon as you arrive, the staff recognize you and make you feel like you are at home. The club lounge is the best I have encountered in all my travels around the world. The new modern British Pub ""Wigmore"" is a gem. Great food and service. A must try ! Keep up the good work ""Langham Team"".",5,2017,11,15

140,Home away from Home,We had the pleasure of staying at the Langham in London for 6 nights in October.  I must say we felt at home and the staff could not do enough to make our stay memorable.  We were so close to the best restaurants on offer and the shopping precinct was just around the corner.  It was our first visit to London and it wont be our last.  We will definately be staying at this wonderful hotel next time we visit.,5,2017,11,15
140,"If you are not sure where to stay in London, stop at The Langham!","If you are not sure where to stay in London, stop at The Langham!  We were greeted promptly and courteous by the doormen taking our luggage and giving us a sincere welcome which continued at the private booking in at The Langham Club Lounge inside (you will find their own signature fragrance cleverly dispersed around the hotel (available to purchase from the exquisite shop too)).  We were all very generously upgraded to amazing spacious suites, signature tall sealing and breath taking windows.  Decorated perfectly, containing everything you may need with up to date fittings and technology ...I genuinely couldn’t imagine any recommendations to make the place any better.  The hotel and suites were maintained impeccably.
The food and drinks at The Roux at The Landau incredible and it was easy to see why the Artesian has won ‘The Worlds Best Bar’ three years in a row.  Breakfast in The Langham Club Lounge was equal to the incredible standards!  There are too many special thoughts and dedication from the staff to write in the one review.
Every member of staff was incredibly professional, consistent and actively seeking ways in which to serve you, we would like to give a real big special mention and express our thanks to Fadi director of the concierge and butler services and Christina in the Langham Club Lounge.  Why can’t I give this palace 6 starts!?  We have stayed in many 5 start hotel suites in London but never as impressed as our stay at The Langham.  Thank you guys - thinking about when we can visit again :)",5,2017,11,13
140,I love this hotel,"We booked to stay on the club floor , as we have before. Everything about our stay was perfect; the free flowing champagne , the amazing staff, the beautiful suite, the room service .. there is nothing that can be faulted. We will be back very soon - Thankyou ",5,2017,11,13

140,Exceptional!,I've been visiting London for almost 10 years and stayed at many hotels around Mayfair area. The Langham London was far beyond any of my experiences with its exceptional and delightful service! Strongly recommended!,5,2017,11,10
140,Superb Again!,"This is an excellent hotel in London - the other facilities, gym, pool, club lounge, restaurants, etc are great.  The room are clean, spacious, well appointed and the service is also excellent - friendly, efficient and thankfully bit understated rather than pushy.

We enjoyed our stay - AGAIN! We will be back.

140,Langham won't disappoint,"My company booked me into The Langham for a business trip for a movie studio, and they couldn't have picked a better place. Upon arrival I was met by Martin (?), an incredibly professional guy who made sure everything was in order, followed up by the lovely front desk staff who treated me like royalty. I certainly felt appreciated! 

Maria (again, I'm not the best with names), another highly professional member of the staff showed me to my room which didn't disappoint. Great views over central London, a nice, firm bed, spotless bathroom and tons of amenities. I had a good night's sleep here. Breakfast too was scrumptious and filled with many different choices, and if you get the time, stop by Artesian for a drink. The GT I had was by far the best! 

All in all, lovely staff and great location. The Langham won't disappoint you.",5,2017,11,09
140,Perfection!,"My stay at the Langham was AMAZING!!
Location is AAA – in the heart of Marylebone, 2 Min walk from Oxford circus, and very close to the main shopping areas, SoHo and other attractions.
Room was upgraded to a Junior suite as part of the Amex benefit program, and the room was beautifully – classic decorated, quiet and very comfortable.
I had club lounge access which came in very handy for a good private and quiet breakfast – Selection was top notch and chef and staff very accommodating. 
The lounge is very continent for meetings – with a full size meeting room and great service from the staff.
For afternoon snacks the lounge was also very nice but it can be a good idea to widen the selection or vary on different days.
Only downside I found at this hotel is the gym  location which is quite strange -  located in another conjoined building (you have to go to the first floor, cross to the other building and then back down to the gym).
Many thanks to Daniel the concierge for great dinner recommendations and to Zoe and rest of the staff for flawless service.
Will definitely go back!",5,2017,11,09
140,Excellent hotel,"From our first contact with check in staff our entire experience was perfect. Tiffany is a gem. She is incredibly helpful and made sure we were happy with our room. Our room had no view but was perfect in every other way. Clean, very decent size, great shower, brightly lit and thoughtfully furnished. All our requests were promptly attended to. Excellent service all round. Hotel is well located. Quiet. Restaurants amazing. Classy yet unpretentious. We are looking forward to our return stay.",5,2017,11,08
140,Centrally Located,"Overview:
This hotel was a good choice for our first time in London. We went for our honeymoon and booked through a travel agency. We enjoyed being close to activities but wish that service was better.

Positives:
The hotel is in a great location and very close to shopping and subway access. Our room was not available upon arrival so the front desk gave us access to the lounge, which was a nice way to start off the honeymoon. The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast that was included with our stay was good. It was a relaxing atmosphere and there were options to choose from.

What could have been better:
There was no view from our room and the room itself was very small. Concierge was was not helpful during our stay and misled us a few times when suggesting places to eat in that many restaurants were closed for the holiday and they were not aware. We mostly walked so it was frustrating after finally getting to the restaurants only to find them closed for the holiday season (after they said they called to check for us).",4,2017,11,08
140,Superb steak ,A great meal with exceptional service from Alex. Steak cooked medium and a great sauce to go with it. The wine list was extensive and a bottle of red and white ordered. A night cap of butterscotch to see the evening in perfectly. ,5,2017,11,07
140,Another lovely visit at the Langham London,"As a return visitor, I had high expectations that were met.  From the helpfulness of the front desk and bell staff on check in to the the breakfast waiter in the restaurant and room service one evening, the service was warm and caring.  The hotel location is good and it generally offers good value for the quality.",5,2017,11,07

140,Amazing Stay,"We recently spent a week at the Langham London - we have stayed at Langham properties outside the UK before, so we were looking forward to this stay.  From being welcomed outside the hotel throughout the whole stay, the experience was simply first class.

We had booked a Junior Suite which has club access and we had an upgrade, but even without this it would still have been a truly memorable stay.  The club lounge is absolutely great, and the team working there go the extra mile to look after you.  The food and drinks are great (breakfast, afternoon tea, and canapes) but the team really makes it special.  Throughout the whole day they sorted tickets, experiences etc. for the people visiting the lounge.  We had our breakfasts in the lounge - you have the choice of using the other resturants as well, but the lounge was perfect for us.

The rooms are very nice as well, and just like the other Langham's the bed are very comfortable.  WiFi worked well, and the rooms are well equipped.

The location was great for us - if you want easy access to Regent Street etc. its perfectly located.  We went to a West End show one of the evenings and it is a simple 10 minutes taxi ride.

We didnt have a chance to try the spa and leisure facilities but we spoke to some other guests who had used them, and they said they were great - next visit!

We have stayed in a number of hotels in London, and The Langham is by far our favorite, and we will definitely come back!  If you can afford a room with Club Access this is highly recommended.",5,2017,11,06
140,Amazing weekend,"We have had an amazing weekend at The Langham, service from the minute you arrive is excellent the quality of food the whole ambience of the Hotel is amazing . The attention to detail , the wonderful flowers as you enter the building. The bedrooms are well equipped with everything you may need. The bar is always buzzing with exceptional cocktails and friendly staff , booking is recommend though. We ate at Roux at the Landau which was exceptionally good too, great choice of food and champagne and wine chilled to perfection with the most amazing cheese trolley, a must if you are staying in the Hotel.  The location of the is so convenient, a few minutes walk and you are in Oxford Street so handy for all the local sightseeing attractions, we walked to Buckingham Palace which took about 45 mins then did the loop to Piccadilly Circus and headed back to Regent Street stopping at many well known shops including Fortnum and Mason on route",5,2017,11,05
140,Classic five-star hotel in perfect location with excellent Club Lounge,"This is one of the famed grande dame hotels of London.   It is in a perfect location for shopping and sight-seeing.  The service lives up to expectations for a hotel of this class.  The club lounge rooms have been completely renovated and are light, airy and spacious by London standards.  The renovated rooms also have all the modern conveniences needed for business travel such as ample plugs and good wifi.  The club lounge itself is one of the nicest ones I've ever seen.  Unlike many club lounges, this one provides table service.  There is also never any shortage of food or beverages including wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages.  This club lounge is certainly worth the extra cost.   I would highly recommend this hotel for those who want to stay at a classic five star hotel",5,2017,11,05
140,Business Hotel in London that has excellent service and character,"I stayed at Langham hotel during a business trip in August. The service is top notch. The staff of consistently responsive, polite. Unlike other hotels in London that I have stayed in, the rooms are spacious. There are three restaurants to chose from an all serve great food. Breakfast is available at two separate rooms. There is a sophisticated Eastern infusion most prominent in the service culture but also in some of the unique items e.g. The take away box, the pink pen.... 

The location of @Langham is ideal because after work shopping on Oxford street was a walking distance. 

 I had a pleasant experience at the business centre too",5,2017,11,02

140,A great hotel!! ,"Its a fantastic hotel- with super hospitality and lovely rooms- all facilities and some amazing restaurants!! 
I was upgraded to the junior suite and its was just Wow!!
The highlight of the hotel is their club lounge which offers breakfast to afternoon tea in a class which is uncomparable!! And you can get your champagne whole day!! 
The staff is extremely caring!! 
However the one star rating I had to reduce was due to their maintenance department- elevators not working- coffee machine in the lounge- swimming pool- water basin- etc- quite a few things were a problem. 

But I will stay there again!!",4,2017,11,01
140,Langham return,"Fantastic, classy hotel, great location and very friendly staff. This was our 4th stay at the Langham and my wife and I will definitely be back.

140,A hotel that smells like a rose,"If you can afford it is sure worth it. A luxurious hotel with professional and unpretentious service. The facilities are amazing. When you are entering the lobby it smells like a rose garden. I strongly suggest to have drinks and oysters at the Artesian Bar. Probably one of the best hotel bars in the world. Super luxurious rooms and suites. I am staying there once every year. Second time I have visited, the bartender of the Artesian remembered me and my drink!!! ",5,2017,10,30

140,Legendary Langham London,"This Would be My First Visit to London, I have been Mulling over Which Hotel to stay in for Months 
I wanted something Quintessentially English yet Luxurious with Heritage 
I Decided on The Langham London
Located in the Heart of West End just Minutes away from Tub & Soho District 
From the Moment I Step Out of the Black Cab I was Warmly Greeted by the Doormen
Immediately My Luggage was Whisked Inside and was Respectfully Ushered to the Reception.
Check-In was fast and efficient
The Hotel Facilities was carefully explained 
They Graciously Upgraded Me to the Club Level which provides me access to the Lounge during My Stay
The Room was Spacious and well appointed with all the Mod Cons a Modern Traveler Requires.
Complimentary Hi-Speed Wi-Fi was a Welcome Addition
No Detailed was missed from the Personalized Welcome Amenity 
to the Coffee Order in the Morning 
The Hotel was a Buzz with Activity but Associates still had time to Greet and Chat with Guest at Every Opportunity. 
Breakfast in the Lounge was of High Quality with Made to Order Hot Items including Michel Roux own Jams and Conserves. 
Overall an Exceptional Stay with Friendly Associates and Beautiful Hotel Inside & Out",5,2017,10,27
140,Lovely you end hotel in excellent location,"Stayed here on an excursion with the LA Rams this past week and could not have been happier with everything from the helpful doormen, to lovely public areas and a comfortable and large room.  Beds and linens are dreamy.  The restaurants and bars are all high end. We enjoyed the pool, gum and small spa throughout our stay.  The breakfast options are incredible.  Luxury and top end customer service throughout our stay.",5,2017,10,26
140,Best service in London,"From the greeting by the doorman, to the staff in the club a more pleasurable experience could not be found.  The rooms in the hotel was well appointed, and the Langham club was a great addition to the stay for breakfast, tea, and a pre dinner drink.  I will return on my next trip to London.",5,2017,10,26
140,"Superb! Really, really recommend!","Stayed here with the better half over the weekend and it literally could not have been better! Beautiful hotel and the staff could not have been better or more attentive. 
Rooms are gorgeous and the breakfasts were out of this world. Beautiful hotel, beautiful surroundings and amazing staff! What's not to like?! We will definitely be back.",5,2017,10,25
140,Langham understands,"When visiting the Langham hotel, they truly understand how to take care of their guests. The moment you are arriving they are helpful and willing to assist you. Made my stay with them very comfortable. I certainly will be visiting more often the Langham.",5,2017,10,25
140,Best hotel in London!,"The Langham is a beautifully appointed % star hotel. Staff are Exceptionally good at ensuring they meet customer needs and go out of their way to help. Rooms are spacious as are bathrooms. Hotel perfectly located yet quiet. The hotel's pub, the Wigmore and the Other restaurants are all superb. Breakfast in Roux at landau the best we have ever had. Having tried many other 5 star hotels in London this is definitely our favourite and one we will always choose in future.",5,2017,10,24
140,Great Week End,"For a special long week end is the perfect place location and  anything you can dream on a hotel, I was a solo for these time , I can way to bring my wife and have a week end to  remember,A trip around Xmas could be fantastic, they tell me  that Garret Str has the best Xmas light in all London",5,2017,10,24
140,Stylish hotel with peace and quiet,"Stayed here for the first time for 3 nights in September on business, switching our business hotel in London to the Langham. It's a very large hotel, and I have to say that I got lost on 2 occasions trying to find my room. Next time I will request a room not so far from reception. My room was very nice, with all amenities you'd expect from a high end hotel, and was nice and quiet, which is what I was looking for. They could do with an additional area to have a coffee/drink other than the lively bar and the (often dark) main lounge. Overall a good experience.",4,2017,10,23
140,Unparalleled Service,There are so many wonderful things about this hotel but I hesitate to mention them because it would ruin the delight for future guests when every need is anticipated rather than just met.  This hotel is beautiful everywhere.  The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  We have stayed in lots of 5 star hotels but The Langham honestly is in a league of its own and it's all down to their people who really treat you like long lost friends.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  ,5,2017,10,23
140,London weekend stay,"Beautiful hotel in excellent location with warm and friendly staff. Room and bathroom was clean and spacious, amenities in room were plentiful and good quality, the breakfast was lovely and The Wigmore for drinks is highly recommended.",5,2017,10,23
140,Good hotel but they need to renew there furniture,I would give this hotel another try but i would ask for a room on the other wing which faces the main road and has easy access to the gym.  But i would recommed this hotel for the LOCATION and there pool is very good compared to London hotels,4,2017,10,22
140,'Up there with the best',"A truly memorable one-night stay. I had booked an Executive room and we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite which was fabulous and such a treat. What we loved:
- the attention to detail in the bedrooms and public areas was amazing - stunning flowers throughout the hotel 
- access to the Langham Club is a fantastic facility for delicious breakfast, afternoon tea and snacks throughout the day - not to mention free-flowing Perrier-Jouet.
- Delightful staff who you felt genuinely wanted to make your stay memorable, from the reservations team to the waiters and waitresses in the Langham Club and the receptionists at the Health Club.
- Intimate health club (not busy in the slightest), excellent gym even with headphones you can borrow and great pool and steam/sauna. 

We have stayed in some lovely hotels and my husband felt this was 'up there with the best'. We will definitely return.",5,2017,10,22
140,Another Wonderful Stay at Langham London,"It has been 5 years since we last stayed at the Langham London, and have always wanted to return.  We certainly were not disappointed.  The location, the staff, the ambience, the rooms - all faultless.  Hopefully it won't be  as long before we return again.  The breakfast experience would have to be one of the best I have enjoyed at a hotel.  We arrived early morning after our flight from Sydney and were delighted to find our room was ready for us.  There is nothing we could fault. This is a wonderful hotel in deed and staying at the Langham made our stay in London even more memorable.",5,2017,10,21
140,Ladies do Lunch in London,"Our choice was a three course set menu at The Palm Court. The ambiance was very relaxing, the staff were exceptional and the food was amazing. Great value for money and entertainment. Would throughly recommend a visit to anyone who is looking for a London 5 star experience.",4,2017,10,21
140,Chuan Spa Birthday Treat,"Took my partner here during the day for a birthday treat. We had full use of the swimming pool, sauna and steam room and gym and I treated us both to the Baobab Oil and Seed Body Scrub which was amazing. 

The rest room is divine with complimentary cold and hot drinks and some snacks.

It was a shame there isn't music played in the pool as there is in the rest of the spa and the steam room and sauna isn't mixed so I couldn't enjoy it with my partner as they were located in the changing rooms. 

Staff were amazing, giving my partner a surprise gift just before we left which he was made up about. 

Changing rooms were beautiful and the accessories such as GHD straighteners and Dyson hairdryer was a good touch and I left feeling and looking great.

Will definitely be returning",4,2017,10,20
140,First time London visit,"We search the net for a good quality hotel & we were not disappointed 
The London Langham is one of the best 5 star hotels we have ever stayed at
Everything about this hotel is quality personified!
Our room was perfect, the decor is new V’s old themes , the food at the restaurant ( see seperate review) has been delightful 
We joined up with the club on the 3rd floor which included breakfast, brunch & pre dinner food - all thoroughly enjoyed by us
We were instantly greeted by Kieren the guest services manager - who impressed us with his elegant knowledge, charm & thoughtful services - nothing was too much trouble for him or his team 
Our stay in London was made all the better because of the staff & quality of the Langham 
Thank you",5,2017,10,20
140,Amazing ,"Breathtaking experience full with city life to spend.
Good food n spreading  sweets n desserts. Wonderful place to spend a holiday n shopping. Evening walk was beautiful after dinner at Langham.
Food was well prepared by the chef n staff. ",4,2017,10,19
140,Stay at Langham Hotel,My whole family loved the hotel. The ambiance - the staff and cocktails were great. It made the occasion of my sons wedding at a nearby venue perfect. Just rounded off a great experience nicely. The staff were very attentive.,5,2017,10,19
140,Pure luxury!,"We had a great stay at the Langham last weekend.. The building is lovely and inside is filled with flowers, it really was lovely. We arrived early and asked to leave a bag, but were able to check in early which was great. All the staff we were lucky enough to meet were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful and had a ll we needed for a great stay. Breakfast in Palm Court was simply to die for, there was endless choice and all of it delicious. I had avocado and tomato salad and the a waffle with some fruit... All of which was great!",5,2017,10,18
140,Superb,"There are many great 5 star hotels in London, but this is right up there. We loved our 5 night stay here. Superb location and service in particular. The door guys are the best and hope to be back again soon ",5,2017,10,17
140,"Reliably excellent, beautiful, with real character","Excellence is standard at this hotel.  You expect it from a 5* anyway, but it isn't always the case.  The staff here are happy, thoughtful and professional and the building is beautiful, well maintained and really really properly 5* soundproofed.",5,2017,10,17
140,Luxury all the way,From the moment the car arrived at the front door to the moment we left this hotel did not disappoint in any way.  The greeting from the doorman was very friendly and with a smile.  Likewise the greeting at reception.  We had asked the concierge to organise some tickets and they were waiting for us as promised.  Our suite was beautifully furnished with everything you would ever need.  Bathroom likewise.  The Club lounge is a not to be missed in this hotel.  Breakfast there is excellent and after the second morning they knew what we wanted to drink and when.  Evening offerings are great and just what is needed if you have been out to lunch and only require a light meal.  The flowers in this lounge are some of the most amazingly beautiful arrangements and are always fresh.  We stayed here on arrival in London for 6days and another 4 days before leaving and not once did service slip.  This is what an excellent hotel should be like.,5,2017,10,16
140,Affordable Luxury,"Having not stayed at The Langham recently I had forgotten how great this hotel is.
Check in and out are seamless and staff quietly efficient and very welcoming. The rooms are perfectly furnished, spacious are fully equipped with everything you could wish for. Their is a excellent selection of dining and drinking venues which has been enhanced by the recent addition of the Wigmore, a sort of posh pub but still with the service you expect from the hotel. Perhaps what really makes The Langham so stand out is the attitude of their entire staff where they always go the extra mile to ensure a guests comfort and enjoyment.",5,2017,10,16
140,The Perfect Experience,"The Langham is wonderfully situated for exploring London, much of it by foot from this central location. The staff are unsurpassed in my experience of London hotels, only matched by Claridges. The rooms are of a very high quality, claen, well furnished and with all the little extras you need. Artesian, the hotel bar, is worth a visit even if you don't stay at the hotel with it's cutting edge cocktails, wonderful atmosphere and knowledgable staff.",5,2017,10,16
140,Couldn't be better,"Arrived with my other half and there was a very kind gentleman there outside in a very presentable suit and top hat waiting to take our luggage into the hotel. As soon as we got in, checking in was very quick and we were able to go straight into our room which was so beautiful. Both the bathroom and the bedroom couldn't have been better. To top that the breakfast in the morning was to die for. All the staff were so attentive and made sure our stay was the best it could be. Would love to visit again.",5,2017,10,15
140,magical stay at langham,"if you want the most attentive service in London, its got to be the Langham. Nothing could be more of a problem. Whilst you think you would expect it at such a great hotel, there are a lot of places in the city that charge big prices without the service, quality, food to match it. This is not one of them. It is magical and really special!",5,2017,10,15
140,A true 5 star experience,"I travel extensively, and The Langham in London stands out as one of the most exceptional hotels I have experienced.  Location, character, service, food, attention to detail... nothing hit a wrong note.  

If you have the opportunity to upgrade to include the Langham Club in your experience, I highly recommend splurging to do so.  The breakfast spread is fantastic, and includes unique touches like honeycomb and a chef for made-to-order options.  You can stop down in the afternoon for tea (or a Bloody Mary) and it feels like you are in your own oasis of comfort.  

This is a beautiful hotel where no expense has been spared to make your stay a memorable one.  I feel like I'm writing an advertisement, but I would be hard pressed not to make this my default home base to explore London in the future.",5,2017,10,14
140,Welcome home,"It was another lovely stay at the Langham in London. A lovely warm welcome from the doorman who recognised us as we arrived - he is one of my favourite people at the hotel (there are a few). We arrived early after a long-haul flight from Sydney and the team had reserved us one of their newly refurbished suites - when we commented how tired we were, they offered us the choice of an un-refurbished suite available now. We were delighted to accept the offer. The lounge was as accommodating as ever and the second of my favourite peopler welcomed us back as we arrived for afternoon drinks. Although un-refurbished, our room was lovely.",5,2017,10,13
140,Classic and vintage hotel,"Langham London has absolutely excellent location , near the oxford street and soho, downstairs also has a very good french restaurant. Only thing I feel disappointed is the room is a bit small, well, that’s London. ",4,2017,10,13
140,As expected- first class,I stayed here for just one night and found everything to be spot on. The room was very clean and had everything you could think of in terms of amenities. The staff were very well trained and professional. Great location too.,4,2017,10,12
140,Lovely hotel,"Let me begin by saying that our wonderful stay here began with a wonderful front desk staff!!  We arrive after a very long flight and our room would not be ready for several hours!!  We were 5 of us with two rooms!  One of our party was sick and really needed a place to lay down!  We were given a temporary room until our room was ready!!!  Very nice of the staff to do for us!!!  
The rest of our stay was good!!  Restaurants and bars were nice!!!  
My only complaint is that the heavy doors to the bedrooms were very loud and woke us up every time they would close down the hall!!  Other than that we loved the hotel!!!!!!",4,2017,10,11
140,Generally outstanding customer service,My wife and I have been lucky enough to stay at the Langham a couple of times and dine on a few more occasions. We went for our engagement and then stayed for our first wedding anniversary. On arrival the reception staff (I can't remember his name but if I could I would love to feed this back to him directly) were exceptional. We had booked an Executive room and were booked in to the quietest and largest room he could find as we were returning guests and as my wife was 6 months pregnant. As our room was not quite ready he took us to the Palm Court and had coffee and tea brought us with no charge. We spent most of the day out and about but on our return to the hotel after dinner we asked if we could have a table in the Palm Court to have coffee and dessert which they were more than accommodating with. Breakfast the next morning in the main restaurant was exceptional with a huge choice of food and drink. The only negative was that on check-out they had charged us the full cost of breakfast when on the booking it clearly stated breakfast was included. It did take a few minutes of taking the staff through the receipt to allow them to understand. The cost of breakfast (very high at around £70) was immediately reimbursed so can't fault them for that. I've always found that if you ask for something with a smile on your face they are usually more than accommodating. I will return as much as my wallet allows!,5,2017,10,10
140,Fantastic,"We stayed at the Langham overnight as part of our 10th wedding anniversary celebrations. From the first contact with Josie in guest services, through the front desk, the quality of the accommodation and the atmosphere, food and drink in the attached Wigmore our expectations where surpassed. The hotel and its staff went above and beyond and I can’t recommend them highly enough. There was a minor issue with billing as we checked out but this was dealt with swiftly and professionally. I look forward to our next stay at this property.",5,2017,10,09
140,Best of London,"Overall excellent hotel, great location close to shopping.  Great staff, Very cool bar  Artisian with unusual drinks. Also lovely music in the evening at the other bar.  Opt for access to the Club room during your stay.",5,2017,10,08
140,Experience,"Friendly, beautiful,  luxurious, in no way stuffy.  Convenient location and excellent service.  Highly recommend the buffet breakfast.  I prefer,  a room with a outside view, but courtyard view is acceptable.  Street noise is not an issue, as rooms are extremely quiet, with little or no noise intrusion either from neighboring rooms or from the outside.",5,2017,10,06
140,Divine luxury with the most amazing service and staff,"A mishap saw us extend our stay in London and having to find a hotel last minute. It was expensive but worth every penny. I checked in with 7 bags due to cancelled travels, a husband in hospital and a son going to boarding school. Seamless checking with doormen attentive and understanding. I did not even go to the room but an hour later all bags were there. Maids were efficient ! Rooms immaculate ! Best beds and Pillows! Location outstanding ! 
The club lounge was the perfect addition to our stay as not only breakfast tea snacks wine served from 630 am to 8 pm but a business center and a great lounge area to have meetings in. We were able to recuperate , work , relax and enjoy. 
The spa is gorgeous with a pool , steam room and sauna so you can chill out .
I highly recommend this place for business couples and families !
Ticks all the boxes ! If you are going to spend it then do it at The Langham ! You will enjoy it!",5,2017,10,05
140,Such a treat of a weekend! ,"We booked the Langham via Secret Escapes and was an amazing deal considering the reputation of the hotel so we were already impressed. I contacted them beforehand to say we were celebrating a special occasion and when we arrived we were giving a cake/ dessert. Whilst not to send ungrateful I would have expected something more and we were given drinks vouchers when we last stayed at the Mondrian. The rest of our stay was excellent, the decor in the room and bathroom was really luxurious and the bed was very comfortable. We had a drink at the Artesian bar which was very expensive! Breakfast was incredible- probably one of the best hotel breakfasts I had and definitely made the stay end on a high note. We used the swimming pool and it was nice to not feel rushed in the morning with the 12pm checkout time. I would definitely recommend for a special occasion and hopefully we will get to stay again ",5,2017,10,05
140,Best of the best ... !,"I stayed in this hotel for 11 nights .. I searched a lot for 5 stars hotels in London. My aim was to find an excellent hotel with a great location for shopping. Surprisingly .. not many fulfilled my criteria but I ended up going to the Langham .. and I didn't regret my decision at all. The hotel is centrally located and within few minutes walking distance from Oxford street and Regent street .. the hub of shopping in London. Furthermore, you can easily walk to the famous Leicester square .. probably it will take you 30-40 minutes. Also the hotel is within walking distance from the beautiful Regent's park. The hotel itself is very nice .. the staff are super friendly and very pleasant and professional. The check-in and check-out were smooth. The concierge was very helpful. We stayed in an executive room. The room was clean and well appointed. The bathroom was of a good size .. both the room and bathroom were luxurious. The breakfast is served at both the Roux at the Landau and the palm court. Both serve breakfast buffet .. probably the buffet at the palm court slightly bigger but the Roux at the Landau serve more options in terms of a la carte menu (they have Chinese and Lebanese breakfast .. etc). Honestly speaking .. I can't find any negative comment to mention ... because every aspect of my stay was fantastic .. the only thing that I could think of is if they can fix the elevator at the hotel entrance .. because it was a bit difficult to carry the stroller of my daughter in and out of the hotel .. although the hotel staff did most of this work. Overall, superb hotel and great location .. highly recommended and for sure I will return back to this hotel in my next trip to London.",5,2017,10,04
140,"Great location, perfect bar, well appointed rooms","Had an overnight stay at The Langham; really good experience, the cocktails in Artesian Bar are inventive and delicious, enjoyed dinner in Palm Court Restaurant and superb breakfast in Roux restaurant - all staff were courteous and professional, rooms are well appointed - well deserved 5 stars",5,2017,10,03
140,Brilliant stay,Stayed at the suite and enjoyed it tremendously. Once you enter there is a bottle of champagne waiting for you! The club lounge put a decent spread for the evening and had the buffet breakfast there. The service was impeccable and would recommend this hotel. It's location is fantastic as so close to Oxford street.,5,2017,10,03
140,"The Langham, London","Many hotels claim to be and to give a 5-star experience but The Langham in London is one of the few in my experience that actually does it. I travel frequently on business and have many options as to where I can stay and if there is a Langham available in any city in the World i am traveling to, I grab it immediately!",5,2017,10,02
140,The Langham is the best hotel in London,"Excellent weekend stay. From arrival to departure we felt that we were the most valued guests in the hotel. Personal service, superb room and facilities. Executive lounge is outstanding. This is the best hotel in London.",5,2017,10,02
140,Consistent Beauty,"I have been staying at the Langham for the past 6 years. The service, rooms and staff have maintained a level of excellency that is hard to find.

Looking forward to being back.",5,2017,10,02

140,The Langham,"I really looked forward to my stay here and got to enjoy four nights. Service is exactly as you would expect at a quality hotel. The the room was good size but slightly let down by an oversized chair, bed very comfortable and everything in the bathroom functioned really well. The major let down was a view from the room of  high wall directly opposite and major air conditioning unit. For four days you didn't want to open the curtains. This was supposedly a superior king room.

Broadband functioned but was a bit slow, also no EE signal in the room.

Back to the Savoy I think.",4,2017,10,01
140,5 Star Service,"My husband and I recently spent 3 days at the Langham London and were very impressed by the quality of service.  We had dealings with front desk, doormen, concierge, housekeeping and room service.  Everyone was great at their job and very friendly.  I called housekeeping to ask for foam pillows and not 5 minutes later there was a knock at the door.  we ordered room service on what appeared to be a very busy Saturday night at the Langham, food was delivered promptly, and the table was collected right after we called to say we were done.  We stayed in a standard room on the 8th floor, no view, but the room was a decent size, with some nice amenities like the oversized towels in the bathroom and the heated towel racks.  Also there were UK, European and American outlets in the room.",5,2017,09,29
140,perfect,"what a fantastic hotel in every way. Beautiful rooms, an amazing cocktail bar, excellent atmosphere. We really enjoyed our wonderful stay. Thank you so much to the amazing team. We will be back very soon.",5,2017,09,28
140,"Can't get any better - #1 in service, #1 in comfort, #1 in style!","My partner and I stayed at The Langham Hotel for a month while on business in the UK. The whole experience was AMAZING! Our room was great and very modern – The huge walk in shower to the big comfy beds made the stay effortless.
The staff made us feel very welcome and all our needs were taken care of. Endless in room coffee and fruit!
The Langham Club is a great place to take meetings or grab a bite to eat and a glass of Champagne. The staff in The Club are super attentive and friendly, they made the stay extra special!
The hotel is in a prime location. Turn one direction and you have all the shopping you need on Oxford/Regents Street and the West End and the other direction takes you to the beautiful Regents Park and Primrose Hill, great for walks in the morning/evening.
There are multiple restaurants in the area you are spoilt for choice.
Our experience at The Langham was 1st class from the rooms to the staff. I would try to stay at the Langham whenever we visit again.",5,2017,09,28
140,Great week at the Langham,"Our first trip to London - staying a full week and wanted a great hotel.  We chose the Langham because it is a Luxury property with a great balance of everything.   Upon entering you are made to feel like family from the doorman.  Beautiful marble columns and foyer area.  The room was nice size and fantastic, separate shower, everything felt new and fresh.  The Roux at Landau was a fantastic restaurant in which we had breakfast.   Service and elegance was maxed out.  We also had buffet breakfast in the Palm Court which was fabulous.  Make sure to include that in your reservation.  We enjoyed late evening drinks in the famous Artesian bar which was lively each night.  Unfortunately the spa was being remodelled so we did not get a chance to enjoy that.  But it appeared to be a great experience.   The location was perfect as getting on the subway was just a block or two away.  And there was good shopping very nearby.  It was a fabulous trip made more enjoyable by knowing we were going back to the Langham and its great service each night.",5,2017,09,28
140,A Lovely Stay,"Tried out the Langham hotel in London for the first time. I was very pleased with the quality of service and furnishings in the hotel. It maintains a classic charm but is very modern in amenities and up to date. I loved how the bathroom stays warm and there are little to no drafts, unlike many other hotels, modern and otherwise. I only had one meal (breakfast) there but it was quite good. A small but carefully chosen selection which is better than a huge buffet of blah food. The staff are nice and helpful. The bed was comfortable and the sheets smooth and white. The lighting in the room was bright and warm and many choices as to configuration which is a big plus; too many hotel rooms are dim to disguise shabbiness. The furnishings were of very good quality and beautiful.",5,2017,09,28
140,Langham literally livacious ,"When your body tells you it must rest, you deserve the best. With a bed that takes you up floating on clouds, and a quiet ambiance that beckons you to slumber, this is cloud nine. Service that is well above the star rating you will feel like a king or queen. Food, wine and amnesties that will delight, extreme tantalising for the elite. Worth every penny for the global business executive. Indulge, you deserve it.",5,2017,09,28
140,Not so baby friendly,"My husband, daughter, and I are mid-way through a one week stay in an executive room which included access to the club lounge. The room itself has a nice view and is spacious enough for a crib/cot in addition to the standard furniture.
In general this is a fine hotel with a great location in a bustling shopping area. However, the service has been hit or miss. We had some issues with our room the first day (e.g., the shower drain was partially clogged with hair, causing a flood in the bathroom after a 5 minute shower), and no one answered when we called for service several times over the course of an hour. (We got through after a while, and they sent someone to fix the shower.)  We did have one significant issue in the club lounge. My 5 month old daughter and I went to the club lounge when they were serving canapés and drinks. Upon arrival in the lounge, we sat in the back area which at that time was less populated than the front library area. After some time, my daughter started to cry and, while I was trying to soothe her, a waiter asked me to move out of the back area and to the library area. At that point I felt like I was unwanted and left the club lounge to go back to our room, and I don’t think I’ll use the lounge again because I feel my daughter is unwelcome. I just wish I had known to be in the library area to begin with as it was quite embarrassing to be asked to leave, and then have to gather my belongings and walk out with a stroller and crying baby in my arms. I understand the balance between providing peace and quiet and accommodating children, but I felt this could have been handled better. If children are not welcome in that area of the lounge, then that should be more explicitly communicated to guests. 

Also, the hotel is not stroller friendly. There are two short flights of steps to get into the hotel from street level, and there is no lift or elevator available (I was told it is out of order). Every time we want to enter or leave the hotel, the stroller and child have to be carried up/down the steps. In addition, there are two steps from the elevator to the club lounge, so we have the same issue there. Not sure what you would do if you were in a wheelchair?",3,2017,09,27
140,Absolutely Fabulous ,"Took my partner for our second stay at this truly wonderful hotel 
Stayed for 2 nights this time in a Executive Club room giving us access to the best part of this hotel - the Club Lounge 
A location for the best food & drink in London with the most amazing, attentive and friendly waiting staff you could ever imagine 
One thing that had changed this visit was that breakfast could be taken in the other 2 restaurants in the hotel (Palm Court & Landau)
This addition cemented the fact that the Club Lounge makes this hotel truly spectacular as the food and service in the other 2 restaurants was nowhere near the quality of the Club 
Hoping to return soon ",5,2017,09,27
140,Favourite hotel in London,"Where to start? Stayed the weekend in a club room,not cheap but well worth it. We arrived in the late afternoon and were given a glass of Champagne whilst we checked in. Another glass on the long journey to our room made checking in a great experience! 
Our room was in the Regency wing which was a bit of a distance from reception but easy access to Regent street. Room comfortable , bed lovely really top notch. Bathroom large and well appointed.
Had breakfast in the club room and the Palm Court both excellent.ate at the Roux in the Landau couldn't be faulted.
Loved the location and the public rooms are beautifully presented.
The overall enhancement of our stay was the staff, everyone we encountered were exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. My wife was waiting in reception and was asked if she needed anything or wanted a drink whilst waiting. The staff in the club room were attentive and really helpful ensuring our every need was met. We had a brilliant time and would happily stay again and again!",5,2017,09,27
140,Tea for One in the Artisan Bar ,"I was looking for a place to have a pot of tea in a pleasant environment close to the BBC as I was going to see a recording there. On entering the hotel I could hear the sound of music being played on the piano coming from the Palm Court. I looked at the extremely lovely menu at £49, unfortunately I was unable to partake on this occasion. I member of staff very kindly showed me to the Artisan Bar. As I walked through the doors all the staff greeted me. I was shown to a table by one of the waitresses who then brought me a menu and a glass of water. The waitress then sent down to find the hot beverage section. I chose a pot of Earl Grey which came with 2 biscuits. When asked for I was provided with extra water. The bar was a very pleasant environment to be in and it was a very enjoyable experience, thank you to all the staff. I am looking forward to returning and experiencing the Palm Court. ",5,2017,09,26
140,A Great hotel and staff,Langham is located great in the city.  The staff were great and they were helpful and had a great overnight stay.  Wish I was there longer.  I would definitey return when I return to London. Next time I will try the restaurants,5,2017,09,26
140,Luxurious Central London Hotel,"The London Langham Hotel is without doubt a top 5 star facility in London, offering a good range of accommodation and restaurants, the facilities are excellent and staff well trained and genuinely friendly. The new Langham Club is the icing on the cake and something any hotel guest should experience, our next visit cannot come quick enough.",5,2017,09,26
140,Another wonderful time at The Langham,"This IS the best hotel in London, from the moment you arrive you are treated like you are the most important guest they have. We stayed in an executive room, which had just recently been upgraded, totally gorgeous.  This gives you access to The Club Lounge which is wonderful, calm oasis in a busy world. We were offered a glass of champagne as we checked in, Frank is a charming young man that anticipates his guests needs before they ask. All the staff in the Club Lounge are amazing, very professional but friendly too, Worth every penny to enjoy the champagne, cocktails, delicious afternoon tea and supper buffet. 

Beautiful hotel,  amazing room, fantastic staff and we can't wait for our next visit.",5,2017,09,25
140,"Fantastic hotel, service could use refinmenment classes","Everything about Langham is simply fantastic. Location is impeccable. The pool is gorgeous.  Luxurious quiet quarters, most exquisite bar with exuberant cocktails, a touch of history and constant attention by staff. Oh, the staff...They are young, eager to help, seemingly inexperienced, sweet and very, very polite. A bit too much familiarity by the doormen, English skills that could clearly benefit from improvement at the front desk, a bit of time pressure while asking for a restaurant recommendation  at the concierge desk.. When you get to be fantastic the expectations are also fantastic...",5,2017,09,25
140,Divine,"I had the pleasure once to stay at the Langham for 2 nights and the experience ranked between excellent and divine. The hotel has a lot of grace and from the moment you arrive you are carried away into a truly Olde London feeling and atmosphere. The room was well appointed and luxurious, the breakfast was excellent and the hotels location cannot be beat. Will always be looking for a way to come back for another stay. Highly recommended.",5,2017,09,25
140,The Langham Club,"The best hotel experience of my life. Genuine 5*.  Made to feel special at all times yet friendly. unfussy. Breakfast buffet, afternoon tea with free flowing premium champagne and evening substantial snacks with cocktails were all superb. Room, spa and swimming pool excellent too. Not cheap but brilliant value for money. When can I return?",5,2017,09,25
140,Just Excellent.....,The staff could not be more helpful.  The room and hotel decor was stunning.  Access to the Club Lounge is a must.  Worth every penny.  Breakfast in the Club until midday and even then people arriving after the buffet had been removed were asked if Chef could make them something up.  Great location.  Seriously the best hotel we have ever stayed at.,5,2017,09,24
140,Afternoon tea and cocktails ,"Had afternoon tea here on Saturday afternoon with a cheeky cocktails and champagne.
The service was impeccable as the staff with ease went through the afternoon tea options with champagnes and teas to choose from. 
The food was heavenly and Devine and the Langham is well up there with the best afternoon teas in London if not the best. 
The young waiter who served us with blonde hair was patient and gave us the full run down of everything on offer which was fantastic and gave some great recommendations. We left the Langham bursting at the seems and fully satisfied after a great afternoon in a fine hotel and would highly recommend anybody considering afternoon tea to book the palm court as they would be missing out on a gem.  ",5,2017,09,24
140,Amazing place with amazing service,"Weekend getaway could not be better and mainly thanks to this charming hotel. The quality starts right away when you arrive and last until you leave. I do not have to mention the nice decoration and comfortable feeling you get from the rooms. 

Definitely going to come back soon. Nothing that needs improvement.",5,2017,09,24
140,Very surpised,"My travel agent booked the Langham because there was no room at the hotel I usually stay in London. 

I am glad she did it. While i am used to staying closes to knightsbridge ñ, and therefore not as familiar with the Langhams immediately surroundings, its not that far from anything. 

Bu whatI loved the most was the room. I have lodged at virtual y all the top hotels in London, and for the money this was the best room. Great bathroom, great exposure, and the decoration is just on spot. 

Service was also 5 stars. The only thing less than 5 stars was the breakfast. But that is almost always the case in the old continent. ",5,2017,09,21
140,Wonderful,"The Langham is a wonderful, luxurious hotel that is both steeped in history and beautifully restored.   It is located at the beginning of quiet stretch of Regents Street across from the BBC yet close to the luxury shopping nearby.   Overall, the service was excellent with the staff friendly and helpful.   I highly recommend the Langham for a luxury stay in London.",5,2017,09,20
140,the best afternoon tea experience,"We went to the Langham for a family afternoon tea to celebrate a birthday. From the minute we arrived, the experience completely lived up to its reputation and admittedly high cost. The grand entrance and uniformed butlers started us off well. The room for tea was lovely and the live pianist playing created the right atmosphere. The tea included as much sandwiches, scones, jam and cream as you wanted and two of our party even asked for doggy bags which were provided. The waiter replenished as often as you asked. The cake/dessert plate was beautiful in taste and presentation. The child in the group got a Hamley's teddy and all her food we presented in a child friendly way - peppa pig, a ladybird cake etc. You could sample as many teas as you wanted and i was brought a birthday cake too",5,2017,09,18
140,Completely faultless!,"I was lucky enough to be treated to a surprise night away with my husband at The Langham to celebrate my 50th birthday.  From the minute we walked in on the morning of my birthday and were greeted at the front desk to the minute we left the following evening we had the most fantastic time.
Our first stop was to The Club Lounge where we had a celebratory glass of champagne before going down to Roux at the Landau for a delicious lunch where we were seated at the secluded table overlooking the BBC building.
After lunch we checked into our room to find a beautiful cake waiting for me and a birthday message.  We had a relaxing afternoon and then went back to The Club Lounge for a drink and something to eat before going to the theatre in the evening.
We started the next day with a swim in the pool. When we signed into the spa area, my husband casually mentioned we were away celebrating my birthday - when I signed myself out after my swim the receptionist presented me with a rose and box of chocolates to mark my birthday - wow!!
Breakfast was a leisurely affair in The Club Lounge followed by a walk to Camden as it was a beautiful sunny day.
We then returned to the hotel to have afternoon tea in the Palm Court - we were served by the most delightful man, Jaime De Botton, who made sure my celebrations continued seamlessly.
Then after another leisurely walk we finished our stay with a last visit to The Club Lounge before returning to the real world!
Every single member of staff we came into contact with during the two days was clearly proud to work at The Langham and took great pride in ensuring that everything was perfect for the guests.
I cannot wait to return to The Langham!",5,2017,09,18
140,Simply amazing hotel,"This is not our first visit to the Langham and after our experience this weekend it certainly won't be the last. The level of service, food and accommodation are exceptional. On this occasion we upgraded to the Club Lounge which I would thoroughly recommend, there's a relaxing atmosphere together with unparalleled service and attention to detail. We are looking forward to a return visit.",5,2017,09,18
140,Top Notch Hotel,"This hotel is the epitome of old-world elegance.  From the entry to the public areas throughout is decorated in a rich and stylish manner.  The rooms are lovely, a bit small for our taste, but typical of older hotels found in Europe.  Service was excellent, the dining facilities were very good - we enjoyed our stay thoroughly.  The hotel is located around the corner from the Oxford Circus tube station and within a very short walk from Regent Street which is lined with modern apparel shops.  This street turns into a pedestrian walkway on Sundays where there are lots of vendors and food stalls - very fun, almost a carnival atmosphere. 

The only minor negative that we found is the cocktail bar is very loud and noisy, not at all conducive for a quiet cocktail or conversation.  But the Palm court, the restaurant where the breakfast buffet is located, serves drinks and there is usually a quartet playing light music.

I would highly recommend The Langham and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,17
140,Beautiful and luxurious,"This is a wonderful hotel in the west end of London.  Our room was large , the breakfasts in the Club Room were lovely, the service was terrific. We were treated wonderfully, always coming back to fruit, cookies, bottled water in the room. 
London is of course a very large city, but we could walk to many attractions from this location. 
The concierge was wonderful about setting up plans and getting reservations and tickets.",5,2017,09,17
140,Wonderful,"We've stayed at other Langham Hotels and our experience here was what we expected.  The Hotel was beautiful, our room was perfect and the staff was friendly and so helpful in every way.  We will be back!",5,2017,09,17
140,Central London Luxury,A true and understated hidden gem. Centrally located with impeccable service.Would definitely recommend and will use again. The hotels offers choice of bars and restaurants and exceptional leisure and spa facilities. Luxuriate within the hotel and its facilities or enjoy the comfort and relaxed environment of the recently launched Wigmore next door.,5,2017,09,17
140,The best hotel,"When you walk into this hotel the most glorious fragrance of roses hits you and you know immediately that this is a place of quality. The rooms are classic and spacious and the bar does the most amazing cocktails, no wonder it's one of the best bars in the world!

Cannot recommend the Langham highly enough",5,2017,09,16
140,"Sheer Class - ""That's the way you do it""","I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel this week when speaking at a conference. Okay it's pricey...but that's London so let's not dwell on that side of things. 

However, what you get:-
-A respectful warm and friendly welcome
-offer of a coffee/drink while you check in
-preferences
-outstanding room
-outstanding facilities
-health facility
-great location
-security
-service
-beautiful building

But, what made it for me was the friendliness and genuine warmth of the staff plus a willingness to help. These days how many staff do the ""no eye contact thing"" i.e. Reduced my work if I don't engage

Not here, it's like a family, everyone helps, guides, directs and treats you without the hierarchical way of some other competitors

Well done guys

""Loved it""",5,2017,09,16
140,Excellent 3 day visit to the langham,"From arrival by taxi to the service in the Executive Club the care and attention the staff pay to their guests is superb.
The bedroom was a good size and despite overlooking the top end of Regent St was very quiet. We will definitely stay again whenever possible.",5,2017,09,15
140,Elegant and friendly,"The Langham always makes us feel extremely special and welcome, providing outstanding service and amenities but always with a friendly manner and welcoming staff.  The smell is the first thing I notice - beautiful and then the standard of décor - nothing fails.",5,2017,09,15
140,Exquisite!!,"My wife and I stayed at The Langham for two nights while we were in London.  The hotel is beautiful and immaculate.  Staff are very professional and friendly.  The bar has a great atmosphere providing a great selection of gins and cocktails.
Our room was lovely.  We are looking forward to visiting again soon. ",5,2017,09,14
140,Langham 5 Stars all the way!,"Beautiful hotel, full of history, great location in Marylebone. Spectacular common spaces, Roux and Palm Court are institutions and well worth a try. Oh, and great prices for rooms, compared to other 5 Stars with the same pedigree.",5,2017,09,14
140,Relaxing Hotel,"We stayed here for my partners birthday with a few friends, everyone had an incredible time. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were in ore of how beautiful the hotel was, the building is eye opening. 

The service we received from the staff at check in was brilliant they were extremely helpful and friendly. We were shown to our room which was a very nice touch. The rooms were very well decorated I loved the décor. The bed was very comfortable and we had loads of space. 

We really enjoyed our stay here it really is a London gem and would recommend anyone to stay here. I hope we get the chance to stay here again.",5,2017,09,14
140,Efficient and Friendly Business Stay,"Highly responsive hotel staff are the signature of this hotel. Facilities and amenities are above London standards ie spacious and well laid out. 

The hotel has three restaurants that are a delight to eat from and host short meetings. 

Great meeting facilities and support.",4,2017,09,13
140,Fantastic Relaxing Stay,"Fantastic stay here in a brilliant location , easy for car drop off at the front and concierge parking , excellent friendly greeting and escorted to Club lounge , here the staff are outstanding ,especially Christoph !! free flowing champagne and an excellent bar, the food is delicious so much so i was full up .... needed a rest for dinner later !! relaxing the lounge exceptional , rooms varied but all lovely , the health club has just reopened so lovely for a morning swim , stayed here a few times and returning again in October ... can't keep away !!",5,2017,09,13
140,great stay,"The Langham was the last hotel we chose to complete our 3 week tour of Europe.  I was looking for a hotel in London that was luxury and located in a vibrant area.  The Langham met all my needs.  

We booked a junior suite which gave us access to Club Lounge.  I knew about the Club Lounge before I checked in because I read about it when I booked my room online. Anytime I get a room with Club Lounge access I usually never bother.  The food is always stale and has been sitting out all day.  Luckily, I decided to check out the Club Lounge at the hotel.  WOW!  I was amazed!  This is such a great value!  The breakfast spread alone is worth it!  So much to choose from with waiters to attend to diners. The afternoon spread is just as impressive.  We had a jam packed schedule while we were in London.  So one afternoon, I suggested grabbing a quick bite in the lounge to hold us over until dinner.  We walked in and again were surprised at the spread and options.  We pretty much filled up on our ""snack"".

As for the room, I can't complain.  The junior suite is a good size.  Lots of open space nice big bathroom with double vanity.  Housekeeping and turn down service was good. 

Service at the hotel was excellent.  I wish we had more time to explore the hotel itself.  We were too busy touring the city that we didnt get to enjoy as much of the hotel as we would like.  

All in all, I have no complaints about the hotel",5,2017,09,12
140,Quality at its best,"2nd visit to this fabulous hotel.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Service, facilities and food are all five star.  Think this will be our regular 'London Holiday Home' for quite a few more visits.  The hotel is perfectly placed for shopping, theatres and dining.  The dining facilities at the hotel are above expectations - well done The Roux - you certainly didn't disappoint.",5,2017,09,12
140,The best hotel in London,"Wow!  Everything was perfect.  The location is the best, the staff really friendly, the gym amazing, the room beautiful.  You can't stay in a better hotel.   We arrived 5 hours prior to check in and the room was ready!  That never happens.  When leaving at 7am, they asked if they could get us coffee to go.  So nice here, they can't do enough.  Really made our vacation.",5,2017,09,12
140,It does'nt get better than this,"I love detail and this hotel oozes it. From fragrant honey on a beehive frame on the breakfast buffet to crazy quirky cocktails and a spotless hotel to staff happy in their work.  I asked a member of staff (porter I think) in the lift if he liked working here and he said ""I've worked here for 14 years""   The staff can not do enough. Everyone smiles and engage in conversation. This is the benchmark for any London Hotel.  Excellent hotel, Excellent staff, Excellent Service. It really doesn't get any better.",5,2017,09,11
140,excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel, one of the best hotels in London, indeed it’s a very expensive hotel but you get full value for your money.   the service level is very high, you receive excellent service from all member of the staff. The maintenance level is also very high and everything is fully functional.",5,2017,09,11
140,The quality of service totally exceed my expectation!,"I have been to London several times, each time in a different hotel. This time, I stayed in London for only one night for business, and after what I have experienced this time here with The Langham, London, the other hotels probably will be difficult to interest me.

I went to London this time for a conference, but because it was during Chinese New Year, I had to travel with my mother. When I was checking in, the lady in the lounge served us with the drinks we ordered while we were waiting, and explained the benefits to us. She kindly remind me that I have the pressing benefit and I can have my suits pressed for my meeting the next day. 
The next day before my meeting, I took my mother to the lounge and had some drinks.  It was the same lady in that shift and when she came to take our order, she asked if my mother would like some chocolate just like yesterday. I was very impressed about  her being professional since she had so many guests coming and going every day!
Before I checked out, a gentlemen at the frontdesk of the lounge noticed that I had some food credit unused, he suggested since my flight time would be after dinner, he could close my bill after we had some food in on of their restaurants. In this case, we could use that credits. Again, I was very impressed!
Before I went to the airport, I found I left my cellphone charger and the charging lines in my room. By the time I asked them to let me get back to my room, one of the maids was already waiting at the door of the room, with my stuff! 
It was only a hotel with lovey rooms, you actually can feel the thoughtfulness in each corner of the room and from the extraordinary and professional service of the staff. How can I be more impressed by the other hotels?",5,2017,09,11
140,A grand old hotel for modern times,"Expensive, yes.  But there are deals out there.

If you've paid thousands for suite then maybe it's not perfect but even for hundreds of pounds it's great value.

The staff are amazing.  The rooms are massive.  The Lounges and bars are lovely places to hang out.

If you can afford it- stay here!

",5,2017,09,10
140,Great Ambiance & Meticulous Service,"The London Langham with its history creates a great ambience for the staying guests. I am particularly impressed by the service and the overall attitude of all staff especially those at the reception counter and the Club Lounge.

Unfortunately, I was most disappointed with the view of the room despite specific request for a more open view towards Portland Place. In addition the lack of consideration for female guest who would need a proper space with a mirror and outlet for blow drying hair has marred an otherwise most pleasant stay at the hotel.",4,2017,09,08
140,"Solid 5 stars, but keep in mind of a few things...","The rooms are small and as my girlfriend tells me, the lighting is absolutely the worst for getting ready.  wouldn't mention this, but heard this daily.  The rooms are also very expensive, but service goes with that.  The Artisan bar on site is great.  Also must mention that the concierge desk is one of the best I experienced.",5,2017,09,08
140,Indulge,"If you like to stay at hotels where the people make you feel like you're part of the family, welcoming, caring and relaxed, then this is your hotel. The location is brilliant, rooms sumptuous, nothing is left to chance. Can't wait to go back!",5,2017,09,08
140,"Great location, classic hotel comfortable but small rooms","The location is excellent, very close to Oxford Circus underground station, shops, restaurants and parks. The staff is very friendly and service minded. 
The afternoon tea is just superb and the breakfast is also excellent. The hotel is beautiful and classically decorated, but the superior rooms are not very spacious, specially if you order room service and have the cart in room and there was no much of a view. If having a more spacious room with a view is important for you, you would be better off considering other rooms than the superior ones.",4,2017,09,07
140,Still A Top of the Line Hotel,"We were greeted from our taxi by a efficient doorman who gave us our baggage check and we headed to the reception desk to check in. The doorman was British and the last Brit we would see again amongst the hotel staff.

Check-in was a bevy of young women to whom none was a native born English speaker. When asked the reason for our trip we told them it was a birthday celebration for both of us with September birthdays.

Luggage was delivered to our room by a polite, helpful young man with possibly an eastern European accent.

The room had the view of an air shaft which was fine as Portland Place is always alive with traffic. It was well appointed with the most comfortable bed I had experienced other than my own at home. The bathroom was well appointed with combs, toiletries etc in case you had forgotten your own. Best of all probably was the fact there were electrical outlets with US, UK and EU outlets eliminating the need for adapter plugs.

Breakfast was buffet style. The scrambled eggs were very runny but could be controlled by topping them with thinly sliced cheese. Toast seemed to take a long time to arrive and was served cold both mornings. Again no one in the breakfast room was a native English speaker.

Clearly the hotel is part of an international chain and probably rotates it staff. For the London experience you would have to go elsewhere. 

The hotel is a charming well maintained 1920's building.

Returning to the room that afternoon, the room was made up and on the desk was a box of chocolates and a note from the reception staff wishing us both a happy birthday which was a nice gesture. Check out was painless and a porter helped loading bags into the taxi.",5,2017,09,07
140,Classy hotel,The renovated room that we were staying met a very high standard of cleanliness and the staffs's attitude and their attending to our needs were admirable. Reception check in and check out was quick and effecient,5,2017,09,07

140,Amazing Experience,Great experience. Everything from check in to check out was perfect. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in an excellent location with just a few minutes walk to Oxford Circus. The staff was very cordial and helpful. The hotel rooms are of a very good size. I would rate this hotel among the best hotels in London. Would definitely stay there again.,5,2017,09,06
140,Wonderful stay,"Once again we have been thoroughly impressed with the Langham. From the telephonic reservation right through to check out it has been wonderful. The new health and fitness centre is beautiful and has all the equipment needed for a good workout. If you prefer a run outside,the concierge will give you a map of different running routes. The breakfast is outstanding . Most memorable is the Langham scent when you enter the hotel!",5,2017,09,05
140,Exceptional Stay,"This was my 2nd overnight stay at The Langham London, and as before, it didn't disappoint.  The staff and service were exceptional, and would highly recommend booking a room with access to the Club Lounge.  Looking forward to arranging my next visit!",5,2017,09,05
140,Great hotel ,"Everything in this hotel is perfect. In a quiet place & a short walk to regent street ,oxford street. Most friendly and helpful receptionist & hotel porter. Breakfast , room service & afternoon tea were great. I like the executive rooms , good size. This was my third stay in this hotel & for sure not the last. ",5,2017,09,04
140,Is there something in the water?,"Every single employee I met was so courteous and helpful I'm left wondering if there's something in the water at the Langham! Only spent one night but wish it were longer. Every single thing you could wish for in a room was there including mirrors in the panels beside the windows. What genius! 
Beautiful everything.. room, bedding, bathroom, robe, slippers. This is what you call furnished to a high standard.",5,2017,09,04
140,What an amazing stay!,"really enjoyed the two stays we had at The Langham.  Such an impressive, classic Hotel - fantastic from the moment you arrive to the minute you (regretfully) have to leave ... Loved every minute of the experience - from the attentive staff, to the beautiful decor in the hotel and beautifully decorated rooms, the amazing services in the hotel (lounge, gym, bars and restaurants ....all fantastic!) - it was simply PERFECT.  Could not fault anything ... amazing attention to detail and perfection in everything they do ...  Definitely one for the books - wonderful memories !",5,2017,09,04

140,Great Langham experience,"The Langham is a beautiful property with great restaurants, we had a wonderful stay.  I think that the service was the best part of our stay.  The concierge, porters, front desk all went out of their way to be accommodating and helpful.  The concierge in particular was helpful with helping us plan our activities, transportation and meals.",5,2017,09,03
140,Lovely Hotel With A Couple of Disappointments,"While our overall stay was very pleasant, there were a couple of disappointments that we would like to share so that others may avoid them. We chose the Langham specifically for its pool which is featured on its web site.  After we checked-in and were in our room, we received a letter notifying us that the pool was closed for remodeling.  This was not mentioned on the web site and was quite a disappointment. The temporary gym permitted a good workout.  Unfortunately, there were 3 young children who were left unattended in the gym so they could play on the equipment.  Lastly, we were surprised to find that we could not get reservations in the restaurant.  Fortunately, a wonderful staff member was able to secure a reservation for us in the hotel bar.  While the food and service were excellent, it seems that most of the guests were locals. Perhaps this is why the restaurant was overbooked, i.e., hotel guests do not get priority over local patrons.  That said, we found other aspects of the hotel measured up to the standards of an excellent hotel.  The Club Lounge was fantastic.  We arrived around tea time and were hoping to have tea in the main salon.  However, after we received a tour of the hotel, we decided to stop at the Club.  The tea sandwiches, tea, and staff exceeded our expectations.  We also had a lovely breakfast on the day we were leaving.  We still would recommend staying at this hotel and especially the Club lounge.  Just be sure to make dinner reservations well in advance and confirm that the pool remodel is finished.",4,2017,09,02
140,The Langham Experience,From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service levels were simply fantastic ....... The Hotel was a genuine 5* experience . We enjoyed our stay immensely and would not hesitate to recommend this establishment to anybody.,5,2017,09,01
140,World class service ,Amazing world class service. Best hotel I have stayed in by far. From the pampering in the club lounge to the fresh plums and macaroons delivered to my room compliments of the manager. It can't get better than this! Thank you to all the wonderful staff who made my staff so luxurious. See you again soon!,5,2017,08,31
140,The Langham,"High Quality Hotel - Heritage style at its finest & most sophisticated.  Excellent staff who look after guests every need Great value Location is great - easy access to shopping, transport & central London",5,2017,08,31
140,Oasis in London ,"Having stayed in top luxury hotels all over the world .... this is right up there. 
From the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave... nothing is too much trouble for the staff from the Superb doormen (Daniel) to the club level lounge ( Christina) ! 
Celebrated my wife's birthday and booked a club room .... this place ticks all the boxes .
The club lounge concept although unique for London is flawlessly presented from service and attention to even the smallest detail... rooms are beautiful and in short if your thinking of booking don't hesitate!

Customer service at its best 👍🏼
",5,2017,08,31
140,Just exemplary service,"I stayed at the Langham in April for one night as  art for my wife Birthday and I had stayed at the Langham many years ago and when I first met my wife.

We arrived a little early for the room but as i had emailed the hotel to say this was a special occasion the room was ready when we arrived. I have a Voyager membership and this allows a 6pm late check out when available so asked about this upon arrival.

We were taken up to the room by one of the Langham guest service agents as the hotel is a bit of a maze but has beautiful decor. When we arrived at the room it was a lovely  executive room with club access which was serving afternoon tea so we went to the lounge to have afternoon tea.

When we arrived we were greeted by the club lounge manager who shoed us to a seat and offered us a glass of champagne as it was complimentary with the lounge access.

The lounge itself was amazing and so were the staff. We felt truly special as the effort shown by the staff was some of the best I have ever experienced.

We did return to the lounge that evening before going out for dinner and had a couple of pre dinner cocktails and some canapés which were plentiful and the staff kept everyones drinks topped up.

I would wholeheartedly recommend the Langham and especially the lounge as its truly wonderful.The staff and management have a great attitude of customer satisfaction and it clearly shows. I do look forward to the next time I can stay",5,2017,08,30
140,Overpriced!?,"We stayed in one of the club rooms, on arrival the bed wasn't made and we had no TV remote. 
The lounge was a great addition to the room package and we did use for a short amount of time before dinner. 
Pool area was lovely and empty but did feel the rooms were a little tired for the price.",3,2017,08,29
140,Great location,Beautiful hotel in a great location.  Tons of roses in lobby and restaurants.  Entrance is covered so you never get wet if arriving in the rain.  Always a doorman to help you and beautiful bathrooms of marble with separate shower and tub.  ,5,2017,08,28
140,Beautiful,"We stayed in a club room with access to the Lounge.
The features of the lounge including decor down to the food and beverages were 2nd to none.
Amazing hospitality at its best. Tasteful decor in rooms with exquisite finishes. Wonderful experience was had by all. ",5,2017,08,28
140,Delicious & relaxing afternoon tea!,"My friend and I spent a beautiful afternoon enjoying The Langham's scrumptious traditional British tea service today. We had an assortment of tea sandwiches, including vegetarian options. We also had excellent fruit and plain scones, clotted cream and strawberry jam, with a selection of tea. The wait staff was very friendly and made sure our plates and tea cups were refilled on request. We asked for the late seating at 3pm so we could enjoy an unhurried tea and we were there until after 6pm. All in all it was excellent value for money, in beautiful and tasteful surroundings, fresh flowers and linens and a Wedgwood china service: highly recommended!",5,2017,08,27
140,Wonderful,Was lucky enough to receive a dining voucher for Roux at The Landau. It was fabulous. The staff were amazing and made you feel so welcome. What can I say about the food - everything was terrific. The highlight for me was the marinated strawberries - waw! Husband argued that his sweet was better - cherry and raspberry souffle with raspberry sorbet. Was not overpriced and will definitely book again next time I'm in London.,5,2017,08,26
140,Lovely *sigh,"Essential hotel check list:
✅Great Bed 
✅Great shower
Bonuses:
✅Free guest Steam / Sauna is awesome
✅Great housekeeping 

All staff were bend-over-backwards helpful. 

Restaurants were great. Don't go anywhere else for your english afternoon tea. The Langham's is better than any other one I've had. 

Crazy cocktail bar. Very edgy drinks if that's your thing. 

",5,2017,08,26
140,Stunning ,"Hard to say a negative thing about this hotel. 
From reception to the rooms, the bar to the restaurant, it's all five star. 
As expected the staff are lovely, well presented and very professional. 
As much as I love it here and would love to make it my London base, the reality is , if the company wasn't picking up the tab I couldn't / wouldn't stay here. 
It's for business people and / or wealthy people. 
It will be hard when we check out tomorrow an head off to the Travelodge 😬but that s the reality of life. 
Definitely recommend if you can afford it. ",5,2017,08,26
140,another great stay,We Always enjoy staying at the Langham. And we always make sure we have time for a drink at the Artesian! Meals at the Roux at the Landau always excellent The rooms are comfortable. The staff are helpful.,5,2017,08,24
140,lovely hotel in a great location,"I was upgraded to a ""deluxe"" room - not sure what the difference was as it was still one large bed and a desk against the wall but I did have a view out over the front which I enjoyed. This hotel made me very happy. The design throughout was enjoyable with nice touches throughout. There is a bit of a focus on pink but it was nice to have the pink floral pens. I loved that the stone floor in the bathroom was heated. I couldn't decide which I liked better - my Tokyo hotel heated seat toilet or the heated floor under my bare feet. Bath towels were huge and luxurious. I made use of the Nespresso machine in my room one morning. I enjoyed breakfast in the main room off the lobby - good selection and attentive service. I had room service both evenings. The mezze platter was uneven - some really good items and some so-so. I ordered the onion soup the following evening and that was the best onion soup I've had. The pink macaron that was added to the tray each evening was scrumptious - I am not a huge macaron fan but I'd buy one of those any day. Hotel had multiple power and USB outlets above the desk although not by the bed. Lights could be controlled from bed. Drapes were manual but provided full black out. My only minor complaint was that the restroom also faced front street and had a building light just outside it so that it was very bright all night and I needed to keep the doors fully closed between restroom and bedroom. I was on the 3rd floor and enjoyed going up and down the gracious stairs instead of using the elevator (except when toting my bag). Good service. The location is lovely. First day I took a long walk heading to the left out of the hotel. Down Harley St past the clinics into Regent Park. Very quiet and residential outside the park. The next day I headed to the right out of the hotel - wow what a convenient place for all the West End dining, theater, and shopping! Lots of fun on a nice summer Friday evening.",4,2017,08,23
140,A fantastic hotel,"My partner and I stayed 4 nights and it was a pleasure from the very beginning. 

The staff where absolutely fantastic "" top class"" which made our stay feel special. 

The amenities are great, great location and and an old school charm about this place, made us feel at home. 

Highly recommended! Cheers. ",5,2017,08,23

We stayed here for 3 nights and I was pleasantly surprised by how large our room was, including the bathroom. Excellent bed, and we even got a roll away for our daughter and it was a solid, very comfortable mattress with wonderful linens. What I loved most here was the linens - we slept wonderfully as the pillows and bedding were excellent and towels were plush and soft.",4,2017,08,21

AMAZING! Food, service, rooms, concierge were all unbeatable and ive already been back several times.This bar seems to be a pretty well kept secret in London. ",5,2017,08,21
140,Wonderful ,A truly life enhancing experience. An absolute pleasure from arriving to departing. The langham staff couldn't have been more helpful Hopefully we'll be visiting again.We were given a complementary drink as we were celebrating my wife's birthday and our 20th wedding anniversary. Claudio was particularly helpful and we thank him for that  Highly recommended. ,5,2017,08,21
140,Luxury stay in the embrace of London,I stayed here for my business trip. I really love this place due to its location which I can walk from/to my office. Bed was very soft and I wanted to sleep forever. The complimentary fruits on the desk are the things you don't miss!,5,2017,08,20
140,A favourite ,"We spent a week at this special hotel. The service is amazing. Choose a Club room a day relax in the Langham Club. The Landau continues to offer excellent cuisine, with very friendly staff. The room are supremely comfy",5,2017,08,20
140,What a treat @ The Langham Hotel,"Wonderful weekend treat and hardly moved away from the hotel as we had all we could want right there at our finger tips. 

Cocktail bar - fantastic - so many to choose from and everyone a winner. 

Michell Roux restaurant - wonderful both dinner and brunch the following day. 

Rodregious who welcomed us at reception was an absolute star - could not do enough for us - thank you 

Very very comfortable rooms and so quiet that sleep was easy and very welcome.  

Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,08,19
140,Prestigious Hotel,"Located in one of the top rated locations in London. Beautiful hotel with a distinctive charm and character. The rooms are an elegant combination of classic luxury and contemporary style. Enjoy a cocktail at the award winning Artesian bar! Intriguing and stunning cocktails, you want to try them all.",5,2017,08,18
140,Elegant place to stay in London.,This was our first time at the Langham in London.  It was wonderful.  Location is very good with walking access to a variety of shops and restaurants and public transportation.  The neighborhood has lots of townhouses and flats  which make for a lovely walk.  Rooms are well appointed.  The staff was attentive and helpful....and I left several things in the room and they mailed it to me.  We plan to go back next year.,5,2017,08,18
140,"A true ""Grand Hotel"" - and surprisingly child-friendly","Exquisite, from the superbly appointed and comfortable rooms to the efficient and friendly service to the excellent Marylebone location just off of Regent Street.  Truly lives up to its stellar reputation.  

I don't have much to add to the other glowing reviews, other than a comment that we were delighted to find that such a luxurious hotel is also very welcoming to children.  We are a family of 5 (2 adults, a 13-year-old, and 6-year-old twins) who travel frequently ,and we often end up renting apartments in larger cities rather than stay in a hotel, because it's challenging to find a hotel room  (or suite, or pair of rooms) that is well-located, attractive, and able to comfortably accommodate a family of 5.  We were pleased to find that the Langham London offers a family package with adjacent rooms in a private corridor (the 2nd room is 50% of the first, which helps).  The rooms are not interconnecting, but they share a small private lobby area that is locked off from the main hallway, so it's quite easy to move between rooms while maintaining security.  This was ideal for us: we adults had our own room with king-sized bed and the children were just next door with another king-sized bed and comfortable single cot (arranged in advance).  To the children's delight, each day new little surprises appeared in their room each day: mini canvas backpacks one day, little rubber ducks another day, etc. The hotel also offers a delightful ""children's tea"" in the Palm Court, complete with teddy bears, strawberry-kiwi tea, and whimsical pastry creations.  All the staff were friendly with our boys, who still speak about how much they liked ""our fancy hotel in London.""  Would return in a heartbeat.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,08,17
140,Luxury Hotel,This is a luxury hotel in the heart of London with great transport links. The rooms are larger than the standard London hotel rooms and are furnished superbly. The afternoon Tea is one of the best I've had in London. The service and attention to detail of the staff is second to none. The price per night is a little high but that is expected considering this is one of the premier hotels in London. Don't be surprised is you see a few celebrities. And excellent hotel!,5,2017,08,17
140,Wonderful,"A stunning hotel, we were greeted by the most wonderful aroma of roses from the massive floral displays that flank the entrance. Helpful staff, stylish common areas and a lovely room.

140,Weekend away,"The newly refurbished Langham London is stunning, decor, food and staff are excellent.  Nothing was too much trouble. Its worth booking a room with access to the club lounge which is wonderful.  A visit to the Wigmore should be a must",5,2017,08,14
140,Outstanding English hospitality,"Our cruise chose this hotel as the overnight stay before boarding and we could not have been more pleased. The hotel in the center of London, the room and the staff were excellent. We'll stay there on our own next time.",5,2017,08,14

The rooms were well appointed with many amenities (king size bed with beautiful sheets and cotton robes; huge TV)

The first class buffet breakfast at Roux restaurant with its view of the church had all that one might desire at the beginning of the day.
Our stay was a delightful experience.",5,2017,08,12

140,Saturday night stay.,"Really enjoyed stay here, in deluxe room that sits one up from entry level in the room pecking order & for that, you get an ok sized room ( big tv ) & a very nice bathroom.  Everything very good with regards to room & hotel interior, but for me personally, it didn't have that wow factor, though make no mistake, it's smart. Didn't get to see the Artisan, though palm court looked fine & Landau, where we had a superb breakfast, I liked a lot. What was faultless about our stay, from beginning to end, was the staff & their impeccable service. Nobody missed a beat & we, as average joe's just visiting for a night, were made to feel no less valued than say, the high rollers or more ""important"" guests. Service had it all, warmth, professionalism, attention to detail & care ( not everywhere can pull this off ).  It was a belated birthday present for girlfriend & on arrival, she was greeted by a warm acknowledgement of this & unexpectedly, some cake & such was brought to the room for her ( lovely touch ). All staff as said superb, though special praise must go to Ben in customer services & Harry on reception, can't thank you enough for how well you looked after us. Their a credit & asset to the brand.",5,2017,08,10
140,Great experience!,"Well located hotel for shopping and other ""touristic"" activities. The staff look after you in attentive but discreet way.

140,Magnificent,"London is a city with so many unique and beautiful hotels but The Langham is a definite standout and top pick!  Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and looking for ways to make our stay more enjoyable.  We were particularly impressed with the Club Lounge staff, service and atmosphere and loved spending time in this space.   Our room was very nice, large, and clean although in the older wing with a more traditional feel (we look forward to staying in the Regent Wing next time we are there~which has more contemporary feel).   It's not often that you can describe a hotel as both impeccably elegant and warmly welcoming, but this is exactly what The Langham is!",5,2017,08,08

140,An experience to make your trip to London truly memorable,"A 5 star rating does not do justice to the quality, ambience, food, service that the Langham Hotel London offers. The staff from doorman to management have always shown my wife and I the highest level of friendly and personal attention making our stays at the hotel of the most enjoyable experiences we have had at any hotel worldwide. It is clear from the continued enhancements to the building and services offered the hotel is not sitting on its laurels. We have been guests at the hotel over the past 9 years and on each time we leave we are given good reason to look forward to future visits. We particularly appreciate Fadi Samhoun and Christopher's Club Lounge team for making our stays so enjoyable.",5,2017,08,07

Staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble and so friendly.

Breakfast was superb and also had dinner here. The set menu was brilliant - food well cooked, great quality and beautifully presented with faultless service.

Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,08,06
140,Our London base,"We have travelled to London numerous times and stayed at various five star hotels. Langham is now our favourite base. Facilities are great. The rooms are spacious, bed fantastic. The club level facilities are luxurious with excellent staff and service in the club lounge, worth the money. 
The location of the hotel is also very convenient, especially for shopping, close to Oxford Street, Old Bond and also the theatres and restaurants. Most attractions are within an 20 minute walk as well. 
We love staying here. ",5,2017,08,06
140,Simply the best in London!,"Generally stay at the Langham whenever visiting London. As always impeccable service, great amenities, very courteous and polite staff. The lounge deserves special recognition: the breakfast served is amazing and it's really a fantastic place for casual meetings or just to get relax through the day. Only limitation would say is the need for better meeting room facilities (just one room through a staircase from the lounge). Overall a great experience. Would stay again!",5,2017,08,05
140,Dinner,"Really lovely set meal deal with  prosecco. Food was delicious, staff were really friendly and attentive, entertainment was fantastic. Set in a lovely modern dining room. Would highly recommend and will be coming back. ",5,2017,08,02
140,Must stay in London,"When you want to treat yourself, Langham London is the perfect place. Every detail of the hotel is very well thought to make you feel home. The room is spacious and well decorated. The bed is very comfortable and huge. The bathroom is immaculate with separate bath and shower.

I highly recommend the Club House. The breakfast is excellent there.  There aren't lots of choices but definitely quality over quantity.  So delicious I kept eating and skipped lunch! They also serve afternoon tea and early evening champagne and cocktails all complementary. The crew are friendly, caring and professional. Love the ginger lily home fragrant smell I bought a bottle to bring home. 

Outstanding and elegant, we will definitely come back to the Langham next time. ",5,2017,07,30
140,The perfect hotel!,"Sadly, I only spent one night at The Langham but it was a visit I shall always remember.  The customer service, the beautiful spacious bedroom, the enormous bathroom, and the view across London were spectacular.  It was spotlessly clean -- and I really do mean spotless!  I foraged under the bed for my shoe and the noted that the carpet had obviously been vacuumed before I arrived.  Bathroom products are of the highest quality, the glassware exquisite -- nothing has been left to chance.  The breakfast buffet in the Palm Court was replete with every choice imaginable.  Unusually for me, I could not find even the smallest negative to report.  

Congratulations to all the staff upon your courtesy, diligence, attention to detail, and anticipation of your guest's every whim.  The Langham is an hotel par excellence!  I will definitely be returning.",5,2017,07,29

140,The Most Reliable With Superior Service,"I am a fan (not of MO but here for The Langham)! Have been staying in Langham wherever I go if there is one. Whether it's London, NY, LA, or Shanghai they might not be the most luxurious but their always high level of customer service is what I love most. As a 1851 member (their loyalty membership) we always get access into their Executive Club Lounge and the one here in London is just the best Club Lounge I have ever been and the most important point is their consistency. I have been staying in The Langham London nearly 10 times now before I decided to write this long overdue review. The only minor complaint I have is that the spa and gym have been under renovation since Jan this year and I do think it's a bit too long to be without one (though they have a smaller temporary gym as a stop gap)! All in all this is one of the best hotels I have ever stay globally. It's location is also most convenient. Still top choice for me in London after all these years!",5,2017,07,27

I've been staying on and off for almost 20 years and in its latest incarnation it has become one of my favourite hotels in the world. I loved the new bar - The Wigmore. Wonderful menu and great service - which for a venue in only its 1st week was truly spectacular. The Langham retains its old charm, but with beautifully renovated rooms and stellar service. It’s a must for anyone who’s passing through London. When I was there on this occasion they were just finishing a newly renovated pool and gym, which I look forward to visiting on my next trip. I stayed in an executive room. My room was available immediately on check-in and when I got up to the room I found hot coffee and breakfast ready and waiting, which is an incredible feat of service co-ordination for any hotel and something seldom seen anywhere.",5,2017,07,26
140,Elegant Hotel,"The Langham is truly old school elegance.  The appearance and the service was impeccable.  The staff was very friendly, personable and helpful.  The staff went out of their way to make sure we felt welcome.

The room was comfortable and spacious with all the amenities associated with a hotel of this stature.  The food prepared in the restaurants was excellent, well presented and very tasty.  

We were in London for 4 nights and the hotel was conveniently located to the Underground and many of the London districts including the theater district.  Numerous restaurants were within walking distance and the Concierge staff was very helpful in providing assistance for reservations and points of interest.

Very enjoyable!!  We will return.",5,2017,07,25
140,Amazing Stay,My first experience of the Langham hospitality and it was amazing. I liked every aspect of the hotel and service. The property is old and unique. I highly recommend an experience here. It is outstanding.,5,2017,07,25
140,"Amazing hotel, very special experience","I stayed at The Langham Hotel for one night this past weekend at and it exceeded my expectations! The location is prime - right near the city's best shops and only 5 min walk to Regent's Park! The staff is so helpful and friendly, the rooms are incredible - especially the beds! Worth it to upgrade to a suite to have access to the Langham Club - it was so great! Would come back here again in a heartbeat.",5,2017,07,24
140,Exceptional service. A+,"We stayed at the Langham on Regent street.  Rooms were spotless and perfectly appointed, staff was friendly and knew us by name quickly.  We had a wonderful experience and would recommend the high tea in the palm court.  If you can afford the up charge, I would strongly advise getting the upgrade to the club level. ",5,2017,07,24
140,Beautiful hotel,"This was our first trip to London and staying at the Langham was a beautiful introduction to the city! The building was beautiful, the staff was attentive. Their breakfast was delicious and we looked forward to it each morning thanks to FHR. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting elegant accommodations in central London. ",5,2017,07,23
140,wonderful staff  amazing bar,"from the greeting at the door, to the extremely pleasant and helpful concierges, to the almost perfect bar, the langham is a jewel in london's crown.  while the high tea was only good, everything else is great.  you must visit the bar (nightly) and have the banana daiquiri with dried banana and a dollop of caviar",5,2017,07,23
140,Grand hotel with tiny rooms,"The Langham hotel is impressive institution inside and out. Because we were travelling with our toddler we wanted two adjoining rooms. The only ones available were the standard rooms which were so tiny that we could barely fit in it with our luggage. We actually asked to remove some of the furniture to make some more space! The rooms certainly did not invite to hang around any longer than necessary. Most of the hotel public spaces were busy and noisy, so what was missing for us was a quiet, relaxing lounge to take a breather after the madness of London (there apparently was one which we didn't have access to due to our standard rooms). The breakfast was really fantastic and the location is super central and easy. The other facilities such as the (Artesian) Bar and Palm Court are great for grown up travellers but it's probably not the best place to stay with kids: It is hard to find a kid friendly place for early dinner, in fact we mostly ended up eating at the bar as Palm Court was full of people having their high tea with crystal glasses and silverware, with live piano playing (best enjoyed without very young children!)... I would recommend the hotel for couples but not for families. Spa & pool are also out of bounds for kids. 
Although very friendly, the staff messed up our babysitting bookings twice and kept calling our room multiple times after our child was in bed despite the do-not-disturb message activated on the system. I would have expected more of a hotel of that standard.",4,2017,07,23
140,Fantastic for business meetings,"Fantastic experience, great staff and the club lounge is brilliant. The staff are brilliant and do everything to ensure that you have a fantastic stay. The food is great and the rooms are a great size and quality.",5,2017,07,23
140,"Spacious, comfortable and brillant service","Definitely a five star hotel.

Service is amazing. Right from arrival, checkin to housekeeping and room service. 

I had two rooms as I travelled in between - both were very spacious for London. Bathrooms were luxurious and bad super comfy. ",5,2017,07,23
140,Excellent Customer Service,"Absolutely LOVED Staying at the Langham, Exceptional Customer service, Location, size of rooms, Quality of rooms and Care given to us as a family of 5. Stayed at the Langham in New York in March for the first time, thought we would try them in London too. No regrets. They take such good care of you, that You absolutely get addicted to staying at The Langham. The only problem is, My kids are so spoilt now, they don't want to stay anywhere else anymore. Keep up the great work!",5,2017,07,23
140,Never fails to impress,We've stayed here many of times and fall in love with it more every time we go. We always stay in a club room and find the staff to go above and behind for us and our little girl. The food is always excellent and nothing is ever too much trouble.,5,2017,07,20
140,Unique quality hotel with that personal touch,"This was not our first visit to the Langham and it never fails to disappoint. 
The hotel is a top 5star hotel that has recently finished a major refurbishment and the new rooms are a delight, well appointed and the beds extremely comfortable and one I never fail to get a good nights sleep in.
The Club Lounge is great, a relaxed place to take a break from the outside world with good food but most importantly the staff just cannot do enough for you, the make the experience that much more special.
Overall a quality hotel with the star really being the staff, from the greeting when you first arrive by the doorman all of whom are exceptional to the porters to the receptionists to those in the Club.
Just an exceptional hotel one of, if not my favorite hotel of any in the world not something i say lightly!",5,2017,07,19
140,A true 5-Star hotel...it would be difficult to imagine staying anywhere else in London.,"I have written many reviews for trip advisor but I don't think I have ever given a hotel a 5-star rating, until now. The Langham truly provides a 5-Star hotel experience. We decided to use the American Express Platinum card program to stay here, and we were certainly not disappointed. They apologized for not having a room available at noon (which AmEx says may be available) so they offered us complimentary drinks and snacks in their wonderful bar. They upgraded our room, and then said they were now offering a 3rd night free, which we had not expected. The room was spectacular. Fabulous bed, huge bathroom with large shower and oversized tub, separate alcove area for Nespresso machine and tea kettle, plus mini fridge. 

The breakfasts at the Roux were spectacular. The buffet breakfast is not huge but every single offering is exceptional, from the muffins to the smoked salmon to the pain au chocolat to the array of cheeses and breads. 

The service is outstanding, from the front desk to the concierge, from the housekeeping staff to the bellmen. You are aware of the keen attention to details, for example the perfect nectarines that suddenly appeared one morning. The staff is friendly and courteous, without being intrude or in any way ""stuffy.""

We have been to London many times, but the Langham has truly spoiled us, and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else on our next visit. Thank you, Langham staff, for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,07,19
140,Langham is Lovely,"Wonderful location of this grand hotel near Oxford and Regent.. Beautifully updated. The room we had, #649, had a wonderful view up Portland Place to Regent's Park. Harry at the front desk was super. The breakfast at the Roux good value if you book it in advance. Rooms impeccable. highly recommend it.",5,2017,07,19
140,London Luxury,Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.  The best of London's shopping is on the doorstep and we could walk to many major tourist attractions as well.  The club lounge is great and the service from all staff is excellent.,5,2017,07,19
140,Nice Hotel,Lovely hotel with great rooms and good location.  We had a Superior room which had great views over Portland Place and the BBC HQ.  I think the price is good for quality of hotel in London.  Would recommend this hotel if you want a quality/traditional hotel at a decent price,4,2017,07,18
140,Delightful and Luxurious,"Every detail of our stay at the Langham in London was perfect - the central location, the rooms, the attentive staff, the excellent breakfasts, and the extraordinary (literally) bar drinks. We recommend it highly!",5,2017,07,17
140,Very nice ,I took my 13 year old daughter to the hotel for a brunch as a mother daughter bonding experience and the food was lovely. The staff were very friendly and I loved Thier aprons. The man on the guitar was fantastic and got me singing and tapping my foot a little (which Isla was not happy about) however I felt that the music added something to the atmosphere and made me very happy. We only got to see part on the hotel but it looked very nice hopefully I can convince my husband to let me stay there for a nice weekend ( away from the kids),5,2017,07,17
140,Amazing Historic Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for about 3 months in 2016.  It is incredible.  The hotel has a full time florist that does an incredible job.  The lobby smells like a rose garden.  The rooms are spacious (for London standards), the employees are incredible (so polite, proper, and formal), and the location is fantastic.  An example of the thought that has gone into the hotel is the bathroom mirror is heated, so it won't steam up when you use the shower.  This kind of luxury doesn't come cheap though, so expect that.  Enjoy your stay if your lucky enough to have the opportunity.",5,2017,07,16
140,Need to say more?,"This hotel is exactly what they promise, and a little bit more.
Service is great and very friendly.  Rooms are very good, safe, coffee facilities. There is even an European powersocket in the wall.(I forgot my adapter).

Breakfast great, doorman as a doormen should be, helpfull, a little joke and knows his jobs.",5,2017,07,16
140,Fantastic from start to finish,"We had a wonderful experience at the Langham.  The room was beautiful, spacious and comfortable.  The service was exceptional throughout.  And the location was very good for us.  Central enough (London is quite spread out!) that we could walk to many attractions and restaurants.  We also had tea at the Langham and it was a highlight of the trip.  We look forward to returning.",5,2017,07,15
140,This is my home in London !,"This hotel is wonderful in every aspect. We stayed for 11 nights in an executive room. From the moment we arrived into the hotel till we departured we met with very friendly and cooperative staff. Everyone was smiling. The check in was smooth. Our room was well appointed and luxurious. On arrival the scent in the room was fantastic. The bathroom was clean and the toiletries  were of high quality. Our breakfast was included in our room, which was an open buffet but they have speciality menu as well that you can order from (i.e. Lebanese, Japanese and Chinese breakfast). The internet speed was amazing. When it comes to the location .. then this is the best hotel for shopping and entertainment because you are few minutes walking from Oxford and Regents street. In addition within 15 minutes walking you can reach the beautiful Regents park and within 20 minutes you can reach Madam Tussauds, and similar walking distance to Leicester Square. Overall, we had a memorable experience at this hotel .. it felt very homey. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to visit London if they can afford it. The only negative thing about my visit is that the lift from outside the hotel to the lobby was not working and this was not very convenient for us as we have a baby on a stroller.",5,2017,07,15
140,Best hotel in the world!!,"My wife and I have stayed in a lot of 5/6 star hotels in the world and, to date, our recent stay at the Langham in London was the best by far we've stayed in.  Service and amenities were exceptional!  Great location too near the west end theater district and walking distance to all tourist attractions.  We booked a club room and for this you get a large, great buffet breakfast, afternoon tea with champagne or wine and canapes and then evening drinks and a bigger selection of canapes.  And the evening canapes starts at 5:30 and goes all the way to 8 pm so you really don't need to eat dinner..Club room has plenty of great seating and full of light.  Staff are extremely attentive and very helpful.  The club room also provides a quick check in/check out facility for club stayers.  All this great food and service for a fraction of what you'd pay elsewhere in London.  the Langham was 2/3 of the cost for a similar room at the Park Lane Intercontinental and provided way better food and service for the money.  Don't even think about staying anywhere else if you want a great club room experience!",5,2017,07,14
140,perfcet place to stay for London atmsophere,"Located in Marybone, The Langham is well situated to experience London as if one lived in the city. Nice neighborhoods and restaurants. Close to Covent Garden theaters. We took a suite in the renovated area, which  is to be recommended. Staff all tried to be very helpful.  We will return when next in London.",5,2017,07,13
140,Efficient and friendly ,Lovely hotel.  Lots to offer in terms of restaurants and bars. The bar was 'buzzy' yet well served. The staff were friendly and attentative. An nice touch as taster cocktails were brought around. Wow.  Bit of a maze to find the toilets though!!!!,5,2017,07,13
140,Club level the best!,"Stayed June 7,8,9th, 2017. The club level wonderful with comfort and food and drinks! Great service on 
Ritz level of courtesy and helpfulness. There are abundant flower arrangements, all spectacular throughout
The hotel and all fresh flowers! Food excellent and beautifully displayed.  Met many nice people enjoying the
Club level experience. 
The history of this hotel is captivating and found in a special book in each room. Many world and cultural
Leaders in history have enjoyed this hotel! Amazing how old it is but how modern the rooms and bath areas are today. Tea time a real treat!",5,2017,07,12
140,Great Hotel,The best accommodations ever. The staff throughout the hotel gave excellent service. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. I have traveled the world this is by far my favorite hotel. I will definitely be staying here next time in London.,5,2017,07,12
140,Perfect for business trip,"The Langham was great. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Great restaurants. Central location close to Soho. I walked and took the underground for most of my trips around town.  I usually prefer a more modern design, and this one was traditional. But beyond that everything was perfect.",5,2017,07,12
140,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful outside and inside.  The service is superb!  Everyone is very friendly and will meet your needs before you ask them.  The beds are very comfortable, room service is excellent and the food great!  Great Wi-Fi also.  Highly recommend.",5,2017,07,11
140,Amazing!,"We had booked the hotel to go and see Adele,with the cancellation of the concert we still carried on our visit and went to the theatre instead.
What can I say about the hotel....... absolutely amazing you couldn't fault a thing,everyone we came into contact with was 1st class so much so I have booked to visit again at the end of the month and cannot wait!!",5,2017,07,10
140,Classic,"The Langham is such a beautiful and classy hotel. We had an upgrade and loved it! 
Great location! Right in the centre of everything. The rooms are very clean with classy decor. However, they can improve the menu for the breakfast buffet. 

All in all, a classy hotel! ",4,2017,07,10
140,The Langham London,"exceptionally friendly staff, distinguished outlets/cuisine offered on site, yummy food from room service, club facility notoriously generous with food and drinks, spacious and comfortable rooms, efficient bathrooms abundant with towels and amenities. best of all location location and location",5,2017,07,10
140,Look no further,Home away from home and just moments from shopping mecca you don't need to look any further in London. Splash out and stay in total luxury  and include the Club Lounge if you can. Don't miss out on the best cocktails in London either!,5,2017,07,09
140,"Fabulous, Even When All Else Goes Wrong","We travelled to London for an amazing trip to be at the last Adele concert along with 98,000 at Wembley Stadium. We had a fabulous package that included VIP tickets around the stage, metro passes, and a night at The Langham. What could possibly go wrong? We come out of the Oxford Circus metro to find every group possible protesting from the metro to the BBC. We make it through the crowd, reach The Langham, and check in. What an incredible hotel; the staff was welcoming and cordial. Everything was first class. Then we find out the Adele concert is cancelled. Our hearts sank. It was the reason for our trip; and our anticipation had grown through 8 months. We couldn't have felt worse, and I'm sure it was noticeable. The hotel staff rose to the occasion. They went above and beyond to salvage the evening. We left with a real appreciation for every aspect of this hotel including the elegant rooms, room service, bar and restaurant. Thank you Langham for salvaging our trip !!! Kevin",5,2017,07,08
140,The staff are what make this hotel exceptional!,"The rooms are recently remodeled, and by London standards are very spacious. Our room had a separate sitting area. The staff are what make this hotel exceptional. The doorman, housekeeping, and concierge were all amazing!  We left a valuable package in the reception area at checkout, not realizing it was missing until arriving at Heathrow, the staff arranged to ship it overnight to Italy for us. Will definitely be staying here on my next trip to London in the fall.",5,2017,07,08
140,Fallen in love with this place again!,"Our grown up kids bought us a weekend stay for xmas and our wedding anniversary and we stayed in March and again just in July!
We have been regularly staying at the Corinthia therefore we stopped staying at the Langham! We have fallen head over heals with it once again as the staff are so attentive and the bar is great for atmosphere. 
We cannot fault the hotel or its staff. Well done to all the team at the Langham. ",5,2017,07,08
140,First-class in every respect,The Langham lived up to expectations from the doorman upon arrival until a speedy checkout.  The rooms (we had three) are well-appointed with all the luxury features one would expect from a five-star hotel.  We enjoyed afternoon tea which even the grandchildren (ages nine and 12) found delightful.  Breakfast in The Roux was excellent although service is somewhat slow.  One negative: the bar music is very loud at night. ,5,2017,07,07
140,Luxury Hotel,"Amazing hotel in central London. Great food, great staff, warm welcome, attention to detail!!  Great location near shopping district. One of the best hotels I have stayed in! Love The Langham, Will be back!",5,2017,07,07
140,Amazing hotel - impeccable service.,"I stayed here late last year with Amex's FHR program and it was absolutely unforgettable.  I was upgraded to some kind of suite which was magnificent (gigantic bathroom, sitting area, and work area).  Stunning decor and the service was unfailingly polite and professional - from room service to the front desk.  Would stay here again the next time I'm in London - for sure!!!  I felt like royalty.  Thank you!",5,2017,07,06
140,Great Location in a 5 star hotel,"Recently returned from a very wonderful stay at this hotel and with the exception of a disappointing Afternoon High Tea experience this hotel was a good value, in a great location and with top notch service. My afternoon tea review will be separate. From check-in to check-out I found the staff to be courteous and friendly and welcoming. The concierge did seem a bit overwhelmed the evening the Adele concert was announced canceled, they seemed a bit apprehensive as to what to suggest (we were there to attend the concert and when that didn't pan out we went asking for suggestions).
The hotel is located just off Regent Street with all its wonderful shopping, and also Oxford Street. We walked to the hotel from Madame Tussauds a wonderful walk enjoying the embassies and high commisioner offices along the way. Its about 15 minute walk to Chiltern Firehouse. We truly found the location of the hotel to be very well situated. We would definitely recommend and return again.",5,2017,07,06
140,Excellence in Service & Experience while staying at The Langham London,"The Langham London is an experience in luxury accommodations, excellent food and overwhelming service. Set conveniently at top of Regent St., you can walk out the door and be in the heart of London shopping, dining & entertainment. It is the most welcoming place to return to after an exhausting day of touring or business. The Club Lounge is a very worthwhile expense to make your stay exceptional!",5,2017,07,05
140,Dream Stay,"Stayed here for 2 night. First of all location is great, right on Oxford Street near regent Street junction, few steps to Oxford Circus Tube Station. Fast and efficient check-in. Helpful concierge. Breakfast choice between buffet (Palm Court) or a la carte (Landou by Roux). Both are great. Nice rooms and bathrooms. Stayed in the Landmark Hotel a couple of months ago but prefer The Langham due to the location.",5,2017,07,04
140,"Location, Location, Location","The Langham Hotel is perfection personified in every aspect.  From the moment we stepped out of the car to check in,  to departing two weeks later, out stay at this hotel was wonderful.  The staff cannot do enough to ensure your stay is to your liking, and the daily fresh fruit is a most welcome treat after an exhausting day of treading the wonderful city of London.",5,2017,07,04
140,Love - Love - Love this Hotel,"Visited several times - I have had a girlie weekend with my daughter here and its always a special treat, we generally book the same room - in the premiium (can't recall what they call it).  The views from the room are glorious, the service is 1st class, staff are so friendly, the decor and attention to detail is one of the finest I've witnessed in a 5 star hotel.  The Restaurant is to die for - for dinner and breakfast.  My daugter had american pancakes, berries, bacon and maple syrup and it was better than what we've had in the US.  It is her 18th birthday in a few months and this will again be a surprise weekend away for her.    You won't be disappointed.",5,2017,07,04
140,The friendliest Oasis,"I don't normally review hotels we are not staying in but I wanted to make an exception following a lovely incident earlier today.

My husband and I had some meetings in London that left us with a couple of hours to wait at the end of the day.  We had done a little shopping but were feeling hot and tired and decided to stop at the Langham for a cup of tea as it was near our final appointment of the day.

When we got there afternoon tea was in full swing and the room was noisy and busy. The bar, out other option, had musicians playing and was not the quiet spot we were looking for. We spotted a quiet spot in the lobby and asked if we could just order a pot of tea there.

The young lady we asked came back with a bearded gentleman who I think must have been the duty Manager. When we repeated our request he said he would see what he could do. In a short space of time we had tea, water and delicious shortbread biscuits.  This in itself would have been perfect but the duty manager came back to check on us. He asked whether we were checking in or out and when we explained that we were just having a cup of tea before an appointment he smiled and said that he had already taken care of the bill and that they looked forward to welcoming us in the future.  It was an extremely gracious gesture and not one we were expecting!

We regularly stay in London and have not yet tried the Langham but thanks to the graciousness we received we will now!

",5,2017,07,03
140,Best hotel stay ever,"At short notice we were asked to travel to London for work and managed to squeeze in some family time. The Langham must be the best hotel in London. It is worth every bit of money spent. The rooms are beautiful, the staff incredible and the food Devine. It is really worth spending the money to get the additional service in the club lounge. Thanks to all the staff in the club lounge. You were all amazing.",5,2017,07,03
140,Overall a good stay but a few misses,"I stayed for three days at the Langham (my first stay at the London property). Overall the location is fantastic as I could walk to restaurants and get to the City very quickly for business. I was disappointed that on arrival after 16.00 the room was not ready, the staff member managed this as professionally as could be expected and looked after me in the bar until the room was ready but still not ideal. I was also disappointed that the gym was under renovation which was not obvious when I booked so I had to pay to use a local gym instead. Despite these things the overall room, service and food were excellent and it was an efficient and enjoyable stay. I will stay again..",4,2017,07,02
140,Another wonderful stay here,"This was our third time at the Langham. Our previous stays spoiled us for anywhere else, and this visit was no exception. The staff are friendly and professional. The rooms are very comfortable. They placed a refrigerator in the room at our request to store my husband's medicines.  The bath is wonderful to return to after a long day of exploring London! The location is fantastic. The common areas are quite elegant, as befits a hotel with this history.

When we arrived, our room wasn't quite ready, so we were offered free drinks in the bar while we waited. By the end of the checking-in process, our room had become available, but the clerk still walked us over to the bar and made sure we got drinks because of the minor delay on a long travel day for us. The servers in the bar are wonderful, too.

Overall, another great stay. We'll be back on our next trip to London.",5,2017,07,01
140,good but could be better - small rooms,"We were there in June for the Adele concert (the last one she could sing), and in a package with millennium concert.  Expensive through the organization and we thought maybe included a  a better room but room 315 was very small with views on work caravans on the ground floor.  Small room, in fact we are often with friends in Tenerife, did you know you need at least 42 m2 to have a 5 star rated hotel over there now.  So this room was much smaller.  But excellent service, preparation of the room in the evening and a good bed.  Breakfast was very good, but in the buffet lunch room I suppose nobody was responsible for the refilling of the empty plates.  My wife had to wait 10 minutes for salmon, I had to wait 5 minutes for cheese.  I suppose a litlle bit of pro active waiter would fill this plates in time so they are never empty. Spa was not open, but from what we read there will be a new spa in the months to come.  So to expensive for a tiny little room with no views.  But service as you may expect from a Langham hotel was near perfect - just those plates at buffet ......",4,2017,07,01
140,Lovely Lovely Lovely,"This hotel is beautiful. It is exactly what you expect historic hotel to be. The doorman are friendly and helpful, the restaurants and bar are amazing. Tea here is really enjoyable and no time limit is put on you. Our room was large and very comfortable. The club level has everything you need. ",5,2017,07,01
140,Heavenly experience ,"We have stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels and are not new to deluxe accommodation, however the Langham in London is above any hotel we have ever experienced! The service was outstanding, exceeding all expectations. The room was spacious, clean and relaxing. Free wifi was great! Concierge was very helpful and keen to assist in anyway possible. Staff were extremely professional with an eye for detail. Our only complaint is that we didn't stay longer! High tea was delicious! Daily buffet breakfast, amazing! London was the start of a family 5 week European vacation and the Langham was the highlight! We would definitely stay again. Suitable for families and couples, this hotel provides royal treatment for all. ",5,2017,06,30
140,"Perfect location, lovely staff","Stayed here for a couple of nights recently as a child-free treat, albeit having to work in London during the days. Never stayed here before and previously have stayed in similar class hotels nearer Green Park/Park Lane. The location of this hotel totally won us over in terms of convenience - we did a bit of shopping on Regent St on the doorstep & Selfridges which is close by. Also the location means there are lots of casual dining options if you don't fancy 3 course dinners eg. Starbucks over the road, EAT, Itsu etc. And 10 min walk to Soho for restaurants and bars there. The staff we encountered were all charming and friendly, and I would say the hotel has a more relaxed vibe than some of the Park Lane hotels (although still v much 5 star). We stayed in the Regent Wing which is a bit of a maze to get to - had to take lift or stairs to 1st floor and then walk for 5 mins and then take a different lift to our room, the room itself was very nice and seemed recently updated, but the bathroom was quite dated (think dark wood vanity with green marble finish). Appreciated the full size kettle AND nespresso machine in room, although had to call down for fresh milk (obviously not catering for a British clientele who drink tea!). We ate in Roux at the Landau for breakfast only which offers a la carte (or there is buffet option in Palm Court) which was delicious. I also recommend Portland Restaurant, 5 min walk away, for an evening meal - so good!",4,2017,06,30
140,Great hotel for a London getaway ,"Not much to say... at least nothin bad! it is a very well located for a leisure getaway as well as for a business trip. top notch service very nice people. Beautiful building, rooms and amenities. Beautiful breakfast and nice rooms. The hotel was fully booked but we still got a great level of service. A great choice in London. ",5,2017,06,30
140,charming,"at first i was reluctant to stay at this hotel, given its spooky reputation. do not google ""haunted hotels"" before you travel on your own :)) it will really cloud your judgement.

i ended up staying here anyways, and i am so happy i did.  it's very very nicely located,,just a few blocks away from oxford/regent street and also carnaby.  the room (and overall hotel for that matter) is tastefully designed. classic, lavish and warm at the same time.

room size if more than decent for european standard.  service is average but professional.  

and here's the most important part: nothing weird/funny happened during my stay.  the property does have an interesting history, i highly recommend to read it post-stay!

will definitely stay there again.",4,2017,06,30
140,Old world class,"Quick one night stay, great spacious room ,it was a disabled room that they did not tell me about but it was still good. Staff are  very professional and friendly, great location, room service was a bit slow and not that special but still ok. 
",4,2017,06,30
140,Excellent hotel,"The hotel had excellent service, beautiful rooms, a perfect location, and delicious breakfasts in opulent surroundings. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Every request was dealt with seamlessly. Highly recommend for business or leisure travellers.",5,2017,06,29
140,Great Luxury Property in the Heart of the Shopping District,"Great hotel with superior service. This is a classic type hotel listed as members of Leading Hotels of the World, and keeping to their high standards. I would only mention as a negative the door slamming in the mornings right at 9 AM. If one is not checking out and in need to leave the room early, this can be totally annoying. This is the only reason for my giving it a ""very good"" overall rating instead of excellent.",4,2017,06,29
140,Excellent,"We usually stay at the Ritz or the Savoy and The Langham more than compares to both of these. It is more like The Savoy than The Ritz but it also has a character of its own. All rooms, facilities, restaurants etc are excellent but the thing that really stands out is the level and quality of the service, staff are outstanding.",5,2017,06,29
140,Excellent hotel!,"The Langham hotel is a gorgeous, classic hotel with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Friendly personnel and, this may sound crazy but as they always say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day: they serve the most delicious scrambled eggs! It has a rich history which you can read all about in the book that you find in your room. A pleasant stay indeed!",5,2017,06,29
140,It is all about service! excellent.,"We stayed at the Langham for five days at the newly renovated Junior suites with access to the club lounge.  The room, the views, the service, everything near perfection.  Fadi at the club made possible the impossible, always with a smile.  I want to thank all the staff for making us feel special. 
Don't miss the restaurant Roux at the Landau, for a special gourmet treat.
If in London, don't go anywhere else.",5,2017,06,27
140,Sheer luxury,"A master class in customer service, sadly lacking in several top hotels. From arrival to departure we found first class service every where. Only staying one night and treating ourselves to an executive room we had free access to the Langham club. Here you will find complimentary drinks including cocktails, spirits, beers and evev champagne with snacks and canapés served throughout the day. Breakfast is served from early till late and includes a fabulous selection of tasty treats including bacon and eggs. Our room was a little noisy but how on earth could anyone complain. Maybe ask on arrival if you think this will affect you and I'm sure they will help. Can't wait to save up hard and return asap. Fantastic location with only a short walk to Oxford street and the London Palladium.",5,2017,06,27
140,Great Hotel - Great Location,"The lovely history of this hotel and the charm it maintains, make is a great place to stay in London.  Very walkable area, across from the BBC, and nearby many restaurants and shops.  Service is over the top.  Executive Lounge one of the best I have seen.  Sleep quality great. ",5,2017,06,27
140,Amazing service and food,"We stayed at the Lanham Hotel in June and chose to try the club level.  We were so happy we did. The private check in was quick and painless, the quality of the food for breakfast and tea time was terrific, and the service was better than anything I've experienced.  The spa was being redone so can't comment on that but we will come back to this hotel soon!  I miss it already.",5,2017,06,27
140,Excellent Hotel with a few tweaks,"The facility is magnificent complete with flower arrangements, extensive marble floors and candle lighting at night.  Several of the computers in the business office need to be reconfigured as they did not work. Had an announcement at 3 am in the morning that you could return to your rooms as the hotel was evacuated due to a fire signal but never heard one and called the front desk to confirm and received an answer that not everyone got a signal. Didn't do much for peace for mind. Food was lavish and service was impeccable.  Concierge on site was impressive.",5,2017,06,26
140,Exceeded expectation ,"We have stayed in many different hotels in London usually in Knightsbridge or Kensington so we tried a different neighborhood.   The hotel is very well located with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby.  The subway is 2 blocks away.  Often, I complement this type of hotel about the service but they went above and beyond.   Unfortunately, we had noisy neighbors one night. After I short call to the front desk, it was handled very quickly.   The one downside to our room was the very bright lights outside our window compensated by very dark blackout drapes.   We had a hard time getting up in the morning due to the jet lag and the lack of sunlight in the room. ",5,2017,06,26
140,Excellent,"Executive rooms large for London hotels. Club facility outstanding . Staff cant do enough for you. 
Some renovations currently being undertaken creating a new spa and bar.
Great Location convenient for Tube and trains.
A very relaxed experience",5,2017,06,24

140,High tea in London UK,"My wife and daughter had a wonderful high tea before the theatre. The variety of teas was amazing, explained by a very knowledgeable  maitre d'. Not only were the teas very interesting , so was the food. A ""must do"" when visiting London if you can afford it.",5,2017,06,22
140,Excellent....to a degree,"Overall this hotel is tops, staff wonderful...Club Level is not to be missed. Only let down was the much heralded Cocktail Bar, too noisy, cocktails were nothing special if you want a real cocktail special try Duke's as this was, again, in our opinion....way over hyped.",4,2017,06,21
140,Amazing central london hotel - perfect for a meeting,"We had a great offsite sales meeting yesterday, the service was impeccable and F&B delightful. Nothing was too much trouble. Would not hesitate in recommending this property to anyone looking for a great London hotel. Even the cocktails at the end of the day were 'breath-taking'.",5,2017,06,21
140,"Fantastic Hotel, in great location","I Attended a meeting at the hotel, yesterday. Staff and atmosphere were second to none, along with great meeting space both light and airy 
Very easy access from Oxford Circus 
Definitely try the cocktails in Artesian Bar!",5,2017,06,21
140,"Historical Hotel, Wonderful Location","After 22 hour flight we arrived at the hotel AT 5.00PM on Friday evening. We were escorted to the Club for check in procedures for our executive club room. There we met Fadi, the charming director of the Langham Club. We were told that our beautiful room was not quite ready as there was some problem with the TV. We expect that a room in any hotel, let alone a 5 star hotel should be ready before 5.00pm. Forty minutes later we were escorted to our 2nd floor room. It was indeed lovely but the TV was still not working properly and we were told that they would return to fix it on Saturday. 
After unpacking and a light meal in the Club we turned in early. At around 11pm we were disturbed by extremely loud music emanating from the Bar directly below our room on the ground floor. The music continued until the early hours of the morning and I was unable to sleep for the rest of the night. In the morning we asked about a change of room as we had booking for 5 nights. Fadi told us that there was no other room available for us during our stay. He said he would fix the music volume in the Bar. It was somewhat better after Friday night but it still disturbed us each night of our stay. With regard to the TV, that was finally fixed on the Monday.  Unfortunately these problems spoilt our enjoyment of this beautiful hotel. We had excellent service in the Club and also from the Concierge  but I doubt if we would return. We felt that another room or suite should have been made available to us under these circumstances.",4,2017,06,19
140,Luxury plus great location,"The Langham is our go to hotel in London. We always stay in the Club Level which gives one access to the large and comfortable Club Room that includes complimentary food and beverage throughout the day. The room was more than adequate in size as was the bathroom. The bed was comfortable. The location is excellent and convenient to shopping, Regents Park and many attractions in London.  ",5,2017,06,19
140,Truly Incredible,Been to this hotel a couple of times now and Its hands down the best experience I've ever received. The hotel its self is amazing and the staff is incredible. They super friendly and can't help you enough. If your looking for a hotel in London you NEED to stay here!,5,2017,06,19
140,Lovely Langham,"We have just spent 4 nights at the lovely Langham Hotel, London. My husband, son and I all absolutely loved our time here. We are sorry to leave tomorrow. Our room is amazing. With access to the Club Lounge, our 3rd floor suite overlooked the from of the hotel and was very comfortable for the 3 of us. The staff in the lounge is incredible. So friendly, so accommodating. We also enjoyed the front door staff and their friendly manner throughout the 4 days. We would DEFINITELY stay here again and actually cannot wait to return.",5,2017,06,18
140,The best in London,"The Langham always deliver. Super service, full attention to your needs. Perfect rooms, whatever category you have chosen. Perfect luxury athmosphere in London. On top of Regent Street, perfect location.",5,2017,06,17
140,Fantastic experience,"Superb facilities, service and location. We booked an executive room so could take advantage of lounge facilities, which gave us enchanced access to a boutique food and drink experience!  Spa was closed for refurbishment during our stay, but I doubt we would have had the time to use it anyway, I think this is opening later in summer 2017, and I believe the hotel is also opening a pub attached to the building.  We used the Artesian cocktail bar just the once, and found the new range rather over-presented to our taste (seved mine in a little barrel, and my wife's in a big wooden spoon0. Just our taste I guess, but I don't think we were presented with a more 'traditional' cocktail menu.  Didn't use the restaurant this time as we ate in the Langham Club, but habe eated in the main restaurant on a previous stay, and that was fab as well!  As a five-star hotel, the price reflects this, but if you're looking to treat yourself in London, I can't think of a better place to stay",5,2017,06,17
140,Setting the Bar,"I have now stayed at the Langham four times as every attempt to stay elsewhere leaves me asking, ""why would I?""  That the location cannot be beat for the purposes of our visits is second to the elegance of the spotless accommodations, but more importantly the warmth and professionalism of the staff.  From the gentleman who greet you at the door to the registration staff, to the concierge to the room staff, every interaction is focused on your comfort.  Service is genuine and effortless and my daughters and I felt we were among family.  There is something special about being remembered nearly a year after your last visit.  Breakfast offers a wide variety to suit all tastes while the bar is a world class experience before turning in.  If you happen to reserve a Club Room, be prepared to get spoiled.  No doubt, we will return as the Langham is our home away from home.",5,2017,06,16
140,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed at the Langham during a recent trip to London. The staff was attentive and the room was lovely. Great location to shopping and dining. Would recommend a room with access to the Langham Club. The club offered breakfast, snacks, tea and drinks.",5,2017,06,15
140,One word...Perfect!,"We returned for our second late spring stay with club level priviledges...which is the best club/concierge I experienced in USA or Europe. Delicious array of food, delicious wines, cocktails +++. Our executive room with large shower & very large tube, on the 6th floor had a beautiful view of the city for miles and was spacious, and immaculately clean!! In addition the room had large windows that open for fresh air and was very quiet for a great night's sleep.  In addition, when you choose a room with club access, you""ll be ""checking-in"" in the club, with excellent champagne in hand!
All staff we encountered were gracious and very professional.  This was truly 5*.  We will always stay here.  
PS: The location is ideal for shopping, transit, dining, sites!!",5,2017,06,14
140,Good but not as good as it used to be,"I have stayed here on many occasions over the last 10 years. Its one of my favourite London hotels, the rooms are always well equipped and interesting with each one being slightly different and its very central fir either business or pleasure. 

Sadly its not as good as it used to be. The service seems to have slipped over the last couple of years and the last time i stayed my room was pretty bad with a fault on the air-conditioning system that was so loud I tried to change rooms at 1am. The night staff were very slow to helps and in the end they said it was to late to change, by now it was 3am!

In the morning they gave me a 10% discount, but only after i complained to the duty manager, pretty small given my stay was wrecked.

The other rather disappointment was the unfortunate drop in standard of the food. I ate with three guests for dinner, two of them had to send the food back because it was either undercooked or the wrong order. Given the price i was paying (well over £75 per person) I would have hoped for at least an apology. The staff did not seem to care that much.

Guys, please try and get back to the standard you used to be...",3,2017,06,14
140,Outstanding London home away from home,"My wife and I visit family in London several times a year and we always stay at the Langham for a number of reasons.  The hotel is well located and the facility is first class. More importantly the staff at all levels are outstanding - they greet you warmly and really care about helping whether it is getting a taxi, arranging transport from the airport, dining recommendations etc.",5,2017,06,14
140,"Nice hotel, but watch for added 20% VAT NOT INCLUDED IN PRICE","We booked through american express, and it showed $0.00 government fees and taxes.  but when we went to check out they added 20% vat, claiming that wasnt included!
the amex price was almost exactly the same as the hotel web site, hotels.com etc web site, so not sure what that was about.  Took three days to fix, not worth the energy.  The other hotels we stayed at were nicer.",3,2017,06,14
140,"Fabulous Staff, Wonderful Location","The warmth and welcome of the staff makes this hotel simply my favorite in the world.  A home away from home. The Artesian bar is creative with a very positive vibe--a perfect place for business entertaining.  Rooms are comfortable, and the location cannot be beat.",5,2017,06,13
140,Top notch!,My tenth time returning to the Langham London and not a lot has changed. The hotel looks as good as new with staff across all departments as caring and efficient as ever. Well done to all at the Langham!,5,2017,06,13
140,Amazing night in a stunning hotel,"I must thank storm Doris for a delightful nights stay in a truly special hotel. Every single part of my stay in The Langham was beyond reproach. 

From the check in the deep pile carpets to the bed that gave me one of the best night sleeps that I've ever had. Now you can't compare the Langham to an Ibis and Premier in or a Marriott; heaven forbid. There is no dodgy coffee here its a lovely Nespresso coffee maker, no little TV with poor reception its a large and crisp picture, I could go on. 

If you have the money and are willing to pay the premium then I'm sure that you every need could be catered for. I hope to be back one day we will have to see where life takes you. 

Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2017,06,12
140,Simply superb ,"We have had the most amazing aft ronin tea today. Food was plentiful and delicious. Staff were outstanding. They have a vast selection of teas to try. Not only do you have the expected sandwiches, scones and cake but they also bring small appetisers during the courses to refresh your palette. 
Our daughter loved the special addition of her new Hamleys bear. 
Can not recommend enough. ",5,2017,06,10
140,Fantastic hotel very helpful staff,"Just stayed for the weekend with my partner, she decided to surprise me. 

What an amazing hotel, extremely clean, great selection on the breakfast which was very fresh and could of stayed in the palm court all day. 

Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff they went out of their way to help and assist. Huge thank you to a very helpful painter called Warren who very kindly went out of his way even though he was busy working to help me find the way to reception haha got slightly lost in the corridors! 

Great central location, loved the old school English charm of the hotel.

Definitely will stay again and highly recommend ",5,2017,06,09
140,Best in London,Superb and most memorable service.  Overall exceed my expectation from arrival to departure.   Staff are extremely attentive and anticipate my needs.  Such a pleasant experience and definitely best value for the money in London.,5,2017,06,08
140,Tranquil luxury,"We stayed on a Sunday in a deluxe room in the Regent Suite, which blends perfectly with the older part of the hotel. As before, the staff were wonderful, from the doorman onwards. The whole experience is of understated luxury. Breakfast in the Palm Court was spot-on with a great selection of fresh food. There was just one small issue with the reception staff being puzzled by us using a voucher bought online as a gift as part payment. But this was resolved in a very friendly way.",5,2017,06,08
140,"Good location, medium room","It is a great location. The hotel is rather worn. Room (207) had badly proportioned furniture so very little space for luggage or to walk. 

Nice parque in the floor but badly marked with use and appear dirty. 

An extensive variety of wall plugs, but it was not properly secured to the wall.  Dry ugly labeling on the sockets. 

Very bad quality shampoo, made my hair feel like I had spent the day in a desert. 

Bath drainage was very poor and took a couple of minutes to drain the shower water. 

Overall not very good value for money. Better off going to the Shard. ",3,2017,06,07
140,The Best Hotel Experience EVER!!,"Though we are common Americans, we were treated like royalty at The Langham. Besides the pleasant ambiance of the staff, we must mention that excellent breakfast buffet, and the light-hearted dignity of the Artesian bar. The doormen were outstanding, too, and the location can't be beat.",5,2017,06,06
140,Best in class,"The Langham is all you imagine a 5 star in London should be. All about classics, though (so don't expect modern, tech savy etc). amazing services and attention to details. It was a great honor to be able to stay here in this life time. Only reccomendation i have when you book a room is to ask (if you prefer) a bath tub for bathroom (i had a shower and was expecting one. but a great shower though and for the 3 days i stayed it was no problem at all ;)",5,2017,06,06
140,"Excellent,but a bit peripheral","We stayed at Langham on September 2016,and my daughter loved it.Friendly and helpful staff. Bathroom,beds, and in room dining are all of high quality.We will never forget splendid breakfast and afternoon tea.Indoor pool is well heated and of moderate size.The only shortcoming is long walking distance to major tourist attractions (like covent garden, Piccadilly,Big Ben etc.)",5,2017,06,05
140,What a product and what a location....,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you feel the  warmth of true british service. The Club lounge is truly remarkable. The food and beverage presentation and attentive staff makes the whole experience a memorable.",5,2017,06,05
140,Faultless and friendly in London,"I stayed at The Langham for business this week. It was my first time there, as I usually stay at smaller hotels. I have to say that The Langham doesn't have that large city hotel feel. It was warm, welcoming, friendly and the service was faultless. My room was large with a large shower and free standing bath and access to The Langham Club was a great perk. I was able to work in there and have complimentary afternoon tea, drinks and the staff couldn't do enough to help. I loved my time at The Langham and will certainly be back soon.",5,2017,06,01
140,Great deal at short notice,"Having been caught up in The British Airways fiasco during the last weekend of May I managed to get an excellent deal at this fine hotel at very short notice. I was given a large double room on the forth floor overlooking the BBC centre. The room was very well appointed, clean, comfortable and quiet. The bathroom was of a good size and there were plenty of amenities.
All the staff were efficient and courteous. I will definitely consider this hotel when next in London.",5,2017,06,01
140,The Langham in London - A Perfect Hotel!,"From when we arrived to when we left, everything about the Langham was exceptional.  The accommodations, location, services, staff were second to none.  The best hotel experience our family has ever experienced.",5,2017,05,31
140,Short stay but a lovely one,It's always a pleasure to stay at the Langham in London. Great service from the Club lounge team again. Room ready quickly for my early arrival. Attentive checkin with regular updates on likely access time to room. Quick check out. Great concierge service too.,5,2017,05,31
140,"New Years Eve Party, service the best I have had","If you are looking for a hotel that provides excellent service throughout your visit and with a smile then you are in the right place. From the start of entering the hotel you feel welcomed, we registered and then wa asked to wait in this gorgeous area to the right for about 5 minutes. This waiting room had the biggest television you with a nice sofa. Tea and coffee machines were available too. We were then greeted and apologies to for the wait and shown to our room.

We choose a small room as we hadn't planned on being in there for too long as we had a busy evening as it was New Years Even after all. The room was lovely and great value for money.

The bar downstairs is where we had planned to spend NYE celebrations so we checked in just to make sure we can get in, again the service was lovely and informative. 

After getting back from dinner and having a few drinks in the room we headed down to the Artesian Bar and couldn't quite believe our luck as we were taken to a table right in the centre in front on the bar facing the dance floor. The DJ was good value for the event and while this place is known for higher rates on drinks I would say no higher than most london hotels and in fact again the service of the drinks made it more than worthwhile.

The next day we headed down, the mini walk of shame, to breakfast where again we were treated so well. The dining hall was spectacular and couldn't have asked for more for our breakfast.

I would go back in a heartbeat to this place and would advise anyone wishing to stay in London to check this place out or if you are looking for evening drinks then shoot on over to the bar and grab a cocktail!",5,2017,05,31
140,Lovely,The Langham was beautiful and we had every amenity we could want.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The attention to detail shines through.  We'll definitely be back for another stay at the Langham.,5,2017,05,29
140,Excellent hotel with impeccable service,"An unexpected return visit to the Langham after we got stuck in the British Airways system meltdown and were stranded in London overnight.  Booked last minute and from start to finish, we had a wonderful experience once again at the Langham.  Staff were super competent, caring and helpful.  We were very generously upgraded to an amazing room in a private wing of the hotel that helped turn a really frustrating and draining travel experience into a great overnight in London!",5,2017,05,29
140,Loved it,From check-in you will notice that this is a very classy hotel. There's is really nothing at all to complain about. It all really works really really well. Location is perfect with all the nice restaurants in Fitzrova five minutes away and the junction of Oxford Street and regent around the corner. I look forward to stay here again when back in London. ,5,2017,05,29
140,Superb,"When you walk into The Langham you're greeted by warm smiles from the staff and the amazing ginger lily fragrance which immediately sets the scene and reminds you that this is no ordinary hotel.

The staff couldn't have done more for us during our brief stay. The hand-written birthday note was a particularly nice touch.

The room was appointed with real consideration, the quality of the finish was excellent and, as you'd expect, it was utterly spotless.

You couldn't want for a wider selection at breakfast and the food was utterly delicious.

Clearly all of the above comes at a price but I am very happy to say it was worth every penny!

A fabulous experience.",5,2017,05,29
140,Need to focus their staff.,"Whilst the Langham continues to maintain high standards in many areas, there is always a "" but "" ...
Around mid day on the 27th of May I was at the front portico where two staff were busy dealing with guests coming and going but needing more help with Taxis etc.
One tall liveried doorman was "" chatting up "" three young ladies, who may or may not have been guests. A couple who had just left the hotel were in desperate need of a taxi but were given to assistance by this distracted Romeo !",4,2017,05,28
140,Classy stay,"Everything about the Langham smacks of style - from the driveway greeting, the reception and the porter-staff. The restaurants [both] provided great breakfasts with the Roux a little more formal but not stiff. The room was okay but not opulent. Location is great. Recommended stay.",4,2017,05,27
140,Luxurious experience at the Langham,"We stayed at the Langham hotel London leisurely for few days.  Warm welcoming from the reception staff upon arrival, follow by escorting us to the room.  The room was spacious beautiful and classy, art work in the room were modern.  Breakfast at the club lounge were unbeatable.  Delicious and quality.  Conceige service was exceptional, they got us the best seats for the theatre.  Many thanks!  Walking distance to the high street shopping.  Highly recommended to Anybody who enjoy luxury experience.",5,2017,05,26
140,Could it be better?,"On this visit I opted for an upgraded room and boy was it a fabulous room.  
After my last visit I didn't think it could get any better but I was wrong.  I stayed in an Executive room that was very spacious, clean and comfortable.
This level of room gives guests the entitlement to use the Langham Lounge Club.  
The Lounge Club is a very spacious room which provides drinks and snacks.  Well worth the upgrade.
Although it costs a lot more I think I will have one of these rooms again next time - and there will be a next time.",5,2017,05,26
140,The best and convenient place to stay,"The Langham is very well situated close to Regent park, right in the city, easy access to everything. very comfortable stay, certainly being a corporate makes the corporate dining room available all day. Excellent appointed rooms. A very comfortable, welcoming stay.",4,2017,05,24
140,We just didn't appreciate it + Pool closed.,"Arrived at Hotel. Had to drive around the block due to a Fashion shoot taking place in front of the coned off entrance. Second time around, we were directed to park on the double yellow lines. Not the best start.
Car valet parked and bags to room ok. Check-in friendly enough. Receptionist explained that rollaway bed would appear at turndown time.
Directions to room not brilliant, bags beat us there as we got lost. Room pleasant enough, and clean; no view.
Cocktails in Artesian bar - quite good fun (served in novelty jugs, bowls etc). Had three each plus tapas. Didn't find any of them to our tastes. Atmosphere nothing special but it was early (18:00-19:00).
Back to room. Beds turned down but no rollaway. Had to chase reception, not expected level of service.
Slept well until woken at 08:45 by room service. Apparently we hadn't hit the do not disturb button. This needs highlighting at Check-in.
Breakfast in Palm Court went badly - a fairly standard buffet, but they ran out of Eggs and Bacon. Staff noticed I was sat with empty plate and chased the kitchen but it was 10mins before buffet re-stocked. Overall breakfast experience no better than Hol Inn or Hilton.
Afternoon Tea in Palm Court - better than breakfast, many of same staff so service exemplary. Much more filling than expected. Palm Court décor and atmosphere nothing special in my opinion.
Slept well on second night until room phone rang (no one on other end) at 08:30!
No breakfast in Hotel this morning - preferred Jackson & Rye in Soho for less than half the price.
Checkout ok, staff apologetic about Breakfast and morning interruptions. Knocked off the Breakfast, and given discount voucher, but even with the discount I still don't think its value for money for us. Prefer Waldorf and Le Meridien  who charge less even when Pool available, also Hilton Park Lane or Sheraton Tower if Pool not important.",3,2017,05,24
140,Excellent hotel!,"This is the BEST hotel I've stayed in when in London. There is no comparison to service, staff friendliness, and location. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, the beds comfortable and heavenly. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,2017,05,24
140,Fantastic dairy free high tea,"My husband took me to the Palm Court at the Langham for high tea as I have been searching for somewhere that catered for people with dairy intolerance and made them feel special. Well my search is over  the service was excellent, the high tea was tasty, looked great and made me feel I was having a treat. I even got a scone. They couldn't give me cream obviously but they curled my margarine to look like my husband's clotted cream. To top it all they had a dairy free muffin on a plate wishing us a happy anniversary. This will be my place to go when I want a treat.",5,2017,05,23
140,Brilliant for cocktails,We met friends of ours who were staying in the hotel in the bar for a cocktail. We had a White Russian cocktail each. It was brilliant and so was the service. Haven't been here for years - we used to do Sunday brunch here - Definitely would go back.,5,2017,05,22
140,5 star for a reasin,"Langham ""just do it right"". The doorman wasn't aware we were staying in the hotel but still spent time telling us directions. Fadi the manager of the club suite and Christopher spent time with us whenever we needed help or advice. "" Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend"". If you don't enjoy your stay at Langham London you need to lighten up and enjoy the good things in life.",5,2017,05,22
140,London Trip,"We celebrated our 1st anniversary in London and stayed at the Langham.. This was our first time at that hotel.. The overall experience was fantastic and it is a go to spot for us in the future. The hotel itself is stunning- incredible renovation, the team was great- genuinely friendly and happy/proud to be working at the hotel.  That came through in our interactions with everyone.",5,2017,05,22
140,Revisiting The Langham,"We returned to The Langham after a four year hiatus, largely because we wanted to try the updated lounge and, to be perfectly honest, also because The Beaumont wasn't running a complimentary night offer and The Langham was.
That being said, here were our experiences.
Firstly, all pre-arrival contact was amazing, from general inquiries to specific requests.  We had arranged for car transfers to and from LHR and upon our arrival, the driver phoned the hotel when we were ten minutes away to have someone greet us.  We were instantly escorted to the room for in room check-in which was a pleasure, and our bags arrived as soon as that was finished, very welcome when it's late and the jet lag starts to settle in.  Although part of FHR we were not upgraded, but weren't expecting to be so not an issue.
Our room was an executive room and I had asked for a newly refurbished one.  The room itself was fine, not overly luxurious but comfy.  The beds were indeed ""blissful"".  We had asked for them to be twinned, which they were.  Unfortunately, that meant the throw for the bed remained in the closet for the duration of our stay as it was meant for a king bed.  There were throw pillows as well, but they were put in a drawer by housekeeping and never put out again by housekeeping for the duration of our stay.  Also, the configuration of the room was odd.  We ordered room service several times (which was excellent) and there was no way to get the table into the room.  There wasn't enough room between the bed and the chest of drawers the TV was on.  We had to remove everything and eat from the desk and night table.  Not the most comfortable way to enjoy a meal.  Speaking of the TV, I wonder if it couldn't have been moved so that it could have been seen from either the table or from the little sitting area.  As it was, the sitting area which had two large arm chairs and a table had no view of the TV.  We used the space primarily to store our luggage and shopping bags.  
The treats in the room however were most welcome, particularly the plate of candy that was replenished throughout our stay.
Also note that not all rooms have a full bath.  Ours had a shower stall only.  I would definitely request a bath tub for our next stay, as we both love taking long bubble baths at the end of the day.   Water pressure was excellent, as was the temperature.  Air conditioning was spot on as well.
Housekeeping was generally good, except for one day when our room wasn't made up until after 2:00pm, and when it was, wasn't replenished with tissues, toiletries, etc.  also, I must comment on the state of the outside windows, which were filthy.  I understand we were on a high floor, but they looked like they hadn't been cleaned in quite some time as they were not only massively spotted, they were also blackened.
Onto the lounge, which had the definite wow factor.  Service was lovely with a team that was eager to chat, and the rumors are most definitely true... Your champagne glass is consistently topped up until you tell them to stop.  The breakfast is a buffet with cooked options as well, they serve afternoon tea with sandwiches and pastries straight from the Palm Court and evening canapés is more like a cold supper.  The quality of all is excellent.  I did miss not having hot canapés only because we weren't using the lounge for dinner and would have preferred to pick at something with my drink, but that is personal choice only.  They make up cocktails in the evening as well, again a varied assortment and very well done.  One point to note is that although the lounge stays open until 10pm, the evening buffet is pulled at 8pm.  If you go in later, there are only drinks, crisps and nuts.  The crisps are addictive!
The lounge was always busy but never felt chaotic until the day we left when a massive group of children with their (I am assuming) mothers came in.  They all spoke incredibly loudly, took masses of food from the buffet, were rude and demanding to the staff and spent the majority of their time using the breakfast buffet to make sandwiches, which I could only guess were for later, taking the crusts off the bread with their fingers instead of using knives, piling up plates and plates of food and rattling the staff and other guests.  This was precisely why we were hesitant in booking the club in the first place.  We were lucky as it was our final meal there, but would not have been happy if we had to endure a week of them.
While I understand there is no control over who stays in a hotel, if you are touting the club to be a relaxing and serene environment, this was certainly anything but.  The gentleman at the desk apologized, but to be fair it had nothing to do with him.  We would think twice about returning to that level though, as we go on holiday to relax, and you can't be guaranteed who will be there with you.
We enjoyed three meals at Roux at The Landau and all three were exquisite.  The tasting menu with matching wines was a great re-introduction to the menu, brunch was a mix of buffet and plated and the pork was melt in your mouth perfection (the champagne was free flowing there as well) and we chose a la carte for our final dinner and we're glad we got to experience all that was on offer.  Service was spot on for all three meals.  We would return even if not staying in the hotel.  We had dinner in the Palm Court one evening as well, which was lovely as they had a jazz band performing.  Service was excellent there as well.
So, overall, we would return, as the few misses don't equate to all the pluses, but just not sure about returning to the lounge if the guests we encountered on our last day are the sort of guests who will be frequenting it.",4,2017,05,21
140,London at its finest!!,"Spent five nights at the Langham, outstanding hotel!  Service was great, rooms were very clean and nicely updated. The restaurants and bar/lounge areas were excellent and the staff goes above and beyond!  Very impressed!  The Langham will stay on my short list of London hotels for business and personal travel.

140,Beautiful Afternoon Tea,"I was recently treated to a champagne afternoon tea at The Langham, I have had a fair few afternoon tea's and I have to say it was definitely one of the best. The staff are very attentive, always coming over and topping you up, the quality of the food itself was perfect, everything very fresh and lovely warm scones. 
They had a band playing, as it was my birthday they even played Happy Birthday on the piano which I thought was a lovely personal touch.
Overall it was a perfect experience and one I would definitely recommend.",5,2017,05,18
140,Fabulous stay ,"Stayed at this hotel for the 3rd time in London. Unlike the 1st which we got a huge corner room ,this one is small but still displays a touch of elegant luxury with full amenities like a Nespresso machine! The lobby is always my favourite as the decor is luxury yet contemporary. Location is perfect as the oxfords circus is 5 mins walk away and there are a few cafe & restaurants along the street.Great front desk staffs & even the housekeepers are super nice. Had late night room service as we checked in quite late,love the Indian chicken curry with pita ! So definitely my choice of hotel my next trip to London !",5,2017,05,18

If you want to spoil yourselves - the Langham is the way to go",5,2017,05,17
140,"Beware of front desk Upsell, otherwise amazing","Great hotel. Very good customer service. unparalleled amenities. I feel that if one is aware that there will be an effort to upsell him or her upon check in and is not taken by surprise, the stay will be that much more enjoyable.",4,2017,05,17
140,English hotel perfection,"Service, luxury and comfort in abundance. The bathroom had a luxurious bath tub and equally luxurious separate shower. There was a dressing area with all amenities.  There was a choice for breakfast of buffet in one beautiful dining room or from the menu in another as beautiful dining room.  The service was fantastic.",5,2017,05,17
140,Fabulous location & Amenities.,"The Langham is a revered London Hotel and there are many reasons as to why I See it remaining this way for the rest of time. Its location is fantastic. Steps from Marlybone and the underground as well as great shopping and parks.
The hotel itself is grand and luxurious, with friendly and accommodating staff. The breakfast and high tea are fantastic. With lots of jams, jellies, breads, teas, and delectables. There is also a great wine bar, restaurant and lounge. 
The gym and spa feature a lap pool, hot tub, sauna, steam room and plethora of workout equipment. 
The rooms are small but luxurious with cozy comforters that will swallow you up. 
I stayed here while my boyfriend was in town for work and absolutely fell in love with it.",4,2017,05,16
140,Perfection,Attended a family wedding in London and was recommended to stay at the Langham. This is THE perfect location to enjoy all that London has to offer. The staff is beyond first class. Step outside to enjoy the local attractions and the front of house staff will direct you. And they will wait for your return. These people look out for you. The hotel and rooms are obviously first class. The bar lounge made inventive cocktails that are beyond description. This is a destination hotel.  ,5,2017,05,16
140,Wonderful stay,"This hotel has excellent service, always with a smile.  The rooms are luxurious and immaculate and certainly large by European standards.  Be sure to stay in a room that offers privileges to the club lounge which has great food and top shelf cocktails  (including incredible raw oysters on the weekends).  Even room service is wonderful.",5,2017,05,16
140,"Amazing hotel , perfect location! ","I had the joy of staying at The Langham April 26-30th, with three friends to celebrate my friends 30th birthday. We had two lovely adjoining rooms. The hotel was gorgeous! I tend to be overly picky about the places I stay and I have zero complaints! The staff was delightful, the rooms are remarkably kept, and the concierge was beyond helpful! We will be back! ",5,2017,05,16
140,Grand hotel in a great location,"This is a full service, classy hotel. We were looked after beautifully from the moment we arrived at the front door to the time we departed. Check-in and explanation of the hotel facilities over, our room was excellent with plenty of room for our luggage and a desk and sitting area. 
The included breakfast could be taken in either of the 2 dining rooms or in our room, the choice was ours.
The bar in this hotel has a big rep among the cocktail drinking fraternity; it was good, and thankfully less formal than I expected. You can still just go in for a beer if that's what you need!
The location is great; in Portland Place ( name changes from Regent St to Portland Place this end of Regent St); not far from Oxford Circus, with Regents Park a short walk up the street. Plenty of shopping and dining around here.",5,2017,05,15
140,Another fabulous stay,"We love the Langham and would always choose to stay here when in London. The club lounge provides an oasis of calm (largely due to the generously flowing champagne!). It was a shame the spa facilities were out of action during this visit, but we look forward to using them again soon.",5,2017,05,15
140,Understated luxury with outstanding service,"My partner booked this hotel for my birthday treat, oh and what a treat it was. We stayed on The Club floor which gives you access to the lounge with complimentary food and drink. After booking in, we were then offered refreshments in the lounge, a calm oasis, beautifully furnished and caters for every thing you require.  We had a couple of  glasses of champagne followed by a light lunch before hitting London. 

When we returned in the evening we were then treated to delicious self service buffet, desserts and different cheeses, with a couple of more glasses of champagne. We were enjoying ourselves so much we nearly forgot we were actually staying there the night! 

The room was heavenly, large by London standards, bathroom to die for and furnished to the highest standards. I felt like I was dreaming with all this luxury. 

Back to the lounge  the next morning for breakfast, had a few more glasses of champagne with it! 

Exquisite hotel, staff so professional and welcoming, a wonderful weekend stay that will live with me always.",5,2017,05,15
140,Memorable Stay,"We stayed here with our 3 children (all under 10) for 3 nights.    We traveled to London to visit nearby family and to also have our children experience London for their first time.  We booked a family package at the Langham that included breakfast, which was served at the Roux at The Landau, a tour of the Hamley's toy store, and an afternoon children's tea at the Palm Court. The breakfast included both a beautiful buffet spread and a made-to-order menu.  Our children enjoyed the tour of Hamleys and particularly enjoyed the children's-themed afternoon tea at the Palm Court.   The room itself was lovely and spacious enough to accommodate the five of us.  The staff members went out of the way to make us feel comfortable.  The children loved their first trip to London and it was made  even more special because of our stay.   They are looking forward to another visit to London and to another stay at the Langham. ",5,2017,05,14
140,Pure Luxury,"I stayed for three nights in the Langham 4th -7th May 2017 as a birthday treat for my mum's 80th birthday.  From the moment the taxi stopped I can honestly say the service was fabulous.  Everything was seamless .. checkin, bags taken right up to the room.  I had booked an Executive room which allowed access to the Langham Club Lounge ... I honestly have never experienced such good customer care for three full days morning and night.  Yes it's expensive but for two people in the heart of London with complimentary unlimited champagne in the Langham Club Lounge you really would be very fussy to complain.  The staff took great care of us but were never intrusive.  On arrival in our room we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite which was just stunning and a piece of cake had been left for mum's birthday along with a handwritten birthday card .. so very thoughtful.  I had to save for a long time to take my mum for this special celebration and if I am ever in London again I will do all I can to save to be able to stay again.  There was absolutely nothing I would complain about.  The hotel is situated at the top of Regent Street .. just 15 mins walk to China Town.",5,2017,05,13
140,An Elegant Grande Dame,"With the confidence of a grande dame, this historic hotel welcomes guests with the graciousness of a by-gone era.  The staff is courteous and very helpful, making sure the guests have all they need for their stay.  The rooms are updated and feature extremely comfortable beds, wi-fi, well-appointed baths with thick terry robes and all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  There are two restaurants but I had breakfast every morning at the famed Palm Court.  And don't miss afternoon tea at the Palm Court, a 150 year old tradition with a selection of teas, pastries and of course, scones.  The location is excellent and within walking distance of many of London's attractions and a short taxi ride from others.  If you want to indulge yourself, this is the place.",5,2017,05,12
140,Fabulous hotel,We stayed here on my birthday. Beautifully furbished. Great staff. Huge beautiful bathroom. Brilliant bed. Amazing bar. Great breakfast. i would definitely stay here ahead. Also a great location. Nice for a treat.,5,2017,05,12
140,Charming,My third visit to London and my first to The Langham. It did not disappoint. The hotel is classic and elegant. No surprise with the look and feel. Dinner was quite good but service in the bar was not attentive. It was busy but I could hardly get someone's attention. Breakfast server was excellent. Ups and downs. ,4,2017,05,11
140,Exceptional Service,We stayed at the Langham in London recently and can only say that the level of service is exceptional.  The caring polite staff and the beautifully presented room made our stay relaxed and enjoyable.  The attention to detail throughout the hotel was amazing and I would not hesitate to stay at The Langham London in the future.,5,2017,05,10
140,Langham,"Lower end of high quality hotels.  Well located for public transport.  Bar a bit crowded.  Gym in remodeling, so don't get your exercise hopes up as temporary facility is small.  Staff attentive and polite.",4,2017,05,09
140,What a fabulous hotel,"My wife and I spent our 30th Wedding Anniversary weekend here, and from the moment we arrived to the departure - were so impressed with the dedicated and professional service of all the staff.

140,THE LANGHAM HOTEL - It is all about the people,"I am a businessman who travels frequently and I visit London at least once a month. I have known THE LANGHAM HOTEL for a long time and I stay there almost every time I travel for the past few years. I certainly recommend the hotel for business trips (and all kind of trips). 
In my last visit to the hotel (this April) I had the pleasure to have met both Helena from reception desk and Mariyah asst. to restaurant manager. Both ladies are service oriented, professional and attentive. They for sure made my hectic trip more pleasant.",5,2017,05,04
140,Excellent historical hotel,"Stayed a few days at the Langham. Located a few minutes walk from Oxford Circus station along Regent Street, very near the BBC Broadcasting House, it is a very convenient location.

Situated on a historical building, the hotel is full of heritage and decorated in a good taste style. Reception and restaurants located on the ground floor. Room size is acceptable, given it is London. Big enough to open 2 large suitcases. Amenities in bathroom is sufficient. Temperature control available to adjust the room temperature.

There 2 breakfast restaurants located on the ground floor. Both provide excellent food with a buffet line and made to order main dish.",5,2017,05,04
140,Amazing,We treated ourselves to another one night stay at this beautiful hotel just off Oxford Street opposite the old BBC building. The hotel oozes class and sophistication and nothing is too much trouble. Check in was seamless as usual and our bags kept with the concierge whilst our room was being readied. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the beautiful smell that the hotel has and the huge bouquets of roses. Our room on the 7th floor was immaculate and spotless with a huge bathroom and Chuan Spa products on hand. The bed was very comfortable and a good sleep was had . Breakfast was excellent. A few changes had been made to the layout and was a massive improvement. The only minor niggle was that the pool and spa were being refurbished and will reopen in July. Overall another excellent stay and thoroughly enjoyable ,5,2017,05,02
140,A True Club Atmosphere,"The Langham club has capture the essence of club life. The lounge area and the leisure areas were superb yet this was all eclipsed by the fantastic service by all the staff. If you like Laurent Perrier Champagne, this is the place for you.",5,2017,05,02
140,The Langham Hotel in London,"April 2017 stayed for one night on a business conference. The hotel is in a great Location, I had an excellent room which was well equipped; clean & tidy and the overall staff service was above average.",5,2017,05,02
140,Lovely afternoon tea,I recently visited the Langham for an afternoon tea with the family. The area that we had the tea was beautiful as was the atmosphere. A perfect place to visit with family or friends. The staff were friendly and helpful. Thank you!,4,2017,05,01
140,Afternoon tea - Superb,"We've eaten afternoon tea, at most of the high end hotels in London, the Langham, beats them all.

The lounge is stunning, the food superb and the service 5star.

A lot of top hotels try, but they just don't seem to hit the mark.

Highly recommended.",5,2017,04,29
140,Nice stay,"Stayed 5 nights on holidays in London. Nice rooms with good amenities. When I booked I was not informed that the spa and pool was out of action due to a lengthy renovation. Having stayed at several Langham properties in China and Australia, missing out on my Chuan experience was a disappointment. I probably would not have booked had I known.
Room was of reasonable size accommodating 2 large bags easily without us tripping over them. Coffee (Nespresso) and tea making facility was provided together with ironing board and an iron. Beds were comfortable and the room quiet.
Anyway,typical of Langham hotels the staff was very friendly from the front desk, room service and housekeeping, the service was excellent. I was truly impressed by all the concierge as I was grateful that on very late notice they secured excellent seats for me for both the musicals I wanted to watch. Nothing was too difficult and everything was done efficiently and professionally.
Overall the staff and service was faultless.
Housekeeping also did a great job and the room was spotlessly cleaned.
Overall a wonderful stay again at another wonderful Langham property. Also location was very convenient with shopping and restaurants within walking distance.
Overall a wonderful stay.",5,2017,04,28
140,Perfect,"Perfect facility, perfect location, perfect crew. 
Located on Regent St.,a few minutes walk away from Oxford St. 
The hotel is in a classic, beautiful building, and the rooms are great. 
The crew did everything possible to please us, including a few unique requests we had since we arrived with a baby (microwave, baby bath...). We even got a gift for him from the hotel - a small backpack with a few candies :) 
We loved it! ",5,2017,04,28
140,"Lovely staff, lovely comfortable stay","We booked an executive club room for our 7 night stay in London and could not have been happier with our first experience at the Langham. 

Our room was very comfortable - large and fairly quiet with good air conditioning keeping us warm in chilly London. Nice bath and reasonable pressure in the shower (usually a disappointment for my partner).

This hotel will be particularly memorable for its staff. The doormen were fantastic - helping us with bags, and especially with getting in and out of cabs (a bit difficult at times with a partial disability). When we arrived our less than satisfactory transfer driver left us on a corner to cross the road with all our luggage and the doorman raced across the road to carry our bags. I'm sorry that I didn't get the names of these lovely men.

I did learn the names of a few of the staff in the club lounge though. Everyone was wonderful, but Aurica, Hoi and Boris were so kind, attentive and generous - making our stay comfortable, fun and memorable. Also Concierge Brian who was generous with his time and good humour when advising us about getting around London.

Finally, I must commend The Langham on having the best English Breakfast tea in a month of travelling. But I guess you shouldn't expect anything else in London!",5,2017,04,28
140,Proper British Tea @ The Langham,"Yeah it's expensive but oh so fun! So splurge and if you're going to do tea in London this is the place. First of all these people take care of you! The tables are large, the seats are comfy and the room is gorgeous! Tea at the Langham comes with a choice of sandwiches( curried chicken was my favorite while hubby loved the egg salad on tiny brioche rolls) with seconds on request! Then there's the scones not belly bombers which is often the case but fluffy and light almost biscuit like served with clotted cream and the best jam you've ever tasted! Then come the pastries it was Easter Sunday so we were in for a special treat ( think chocolate eggs and cakes turned into little bunnies) lots of food, a couple of glasses of champagne and it was a really fun lunch! Oh yeah there's tons of tea choices too properly served and poured! Kudos to awesome staff and waiter whose girlfriend recently studied at a music school in NYC ( you know who you are) who made the whole experience that much better. ",5,2017,04,27
140,Another wonderful stay at the Langham London,"As always a pleasurable experience staying at this excellent hotel, along with the perfect meal enjoyed at the Landau. Rooms beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. Staff polite, attentive and cannot do enough to assist.",5,2017,04,27

140,Langham Hotel London,"We have stayed here numerous times and each time this Hotel delivers, if you are looking for a first class hotel with  attentive and fully trained staff where nothing is to much trouble then the Langham is for you.

140,MY CUP OF TEA AND SO MUCH MORE....,"The Langham is the ""bee's knees"" as they say in Britain. A genuine 5 star hotel, in terms of the hotel itself, but beyond that it is also a true 5 star experience in terms of the service, the hotel staff, and ambiance. The bedding was exceptional. There were a full range of guests: families, honeymooners, friends, and the business traveler. We all seemed to blend exceptionally well at tea time and at the superb Artesian Bar in lobby. It was great fun being in the hotel as well. 

The hotel is very well appointed, and quite beautiful but not at the expense of it being warm, cozy and friendly.  Every measure is taken to make the guests happy, tip or no tip. What a pleasure that is! 

In America we have a phrase...""location , location, location"", well the Langham Hotel applies here. You can walk everywhere: shops, theater district, and more. We walked to Buckingham Palace in 35 minutes. A well heeled walking crowd as well. 

A fantastic hotel for anyone who wants a lovely, luxe experience.",5,2017,04,24
140,"Great London Hotel, Really Lovely","Stayed here at the weekend, really lovely hotel in a great location just around the corner from Oxford Circus. We stayed in a executive room, room 405. Fantastically big bed and lots of space in the room, sofa, desk etc. Lots more space than other rooms I've had at a similar price in other London hotels. 

The bar has a great ambience and Saturday night was really buzzing, its a great place to hang out, quite small and intimate and playing some good tunes as well. They really know how to make cocktails too :-)

All staff were excellent and service was very very good, very efficient but with a sense of warmth too. They made you feel valued and certainly exceeded my expectations, everyone from the guy that parked our car to the reception and so on. Great people and clearly well trained. Great job.

We will definitely stay here again, beautiful hotel, good location, great staff and just a wonderful British hotel. We loved it.",5,2017,04,24
140,As close to 5 Stars as I've ever experienced!,"From the moment I checked in, it was nothing short of exceptional. I arrived about noon and they made an effort to get me checked in early after a long flight from the U.S. I asked for a quiet room (London can be noisy) and they located me in a back corner of the hotel on the 4th floor (5th floor to an American). It was a very quiet and lovely room - well appointed with all the small conveniences that you might need - robes, slippers, Magimix (Nespresso-like), bottled water, heated towel racks, etc - very nice. The concierge(s) made an extra effort to find nearby (walking distance) restaurants, suggest travel plans, tours, and make reservations. The room service breakfast was exceptional and the server was very polite. There were always 3 or 4 people at the curb or just inside the hotel to help with bags, taxis and provide additional security. The only 'bump' was a server in the restaurant that was not as attentive as she could have been, but everyone else make my stay feel very special. While not inexpensive, I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family with confidence,",5,2017,04,23
140,Wonderful hotel ,"I have to say this was probably the highlight of my entire trip to Europe, gorgeous hotel and excellent service (someone is always ready in front of hotel to help me with pram up the steps). I had to knock a star off because of the renovations on swimming pool this would've been lovely to have access to and we got options to visit other pools but really who wants a swim bad enough to do that? Everything else was immaculate including the cleaning.  The bed is so comfortable and large enough for my husband, my 2 year old son and I.",4,2017,04,23
140,Genuin 5 star hotel experience,"I had a  real British high end experience in Langham London.  It stands very convenient location and you can have nice stroll around Hotel.  Regent's Park is 15 minutes walk and Oxford Circus Underground station is 5minutes away. Staff are all very attentive and friendly. I enjoyed Breakfast and  high tea in club lounge. This stay was second time for me, and definitely will come back",5,2017,04,21
140,Few days in London ,"Beautiful hotel welcomed by the guys outside and reception staff are all very friendly, hotel lobby smells fantastic, rooms are wonderful my son and I shared a family room we had a large room with a double bed each and enjoy suite bathroom it was lovely my daughter was just down the corridor (18yrs) she was very happy too. Fantastic room service and presentation of food, and bought to our room with a big smile. Fast laundry service, hotel is in a great postion to walk to oxford street and other close by areas. Would highly recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again.",5,2017,04,21
140,Perfect in every way,"from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything here was perfect. The staff are exceptional and the club bar well worth the extra money. We ate in the Roux restaurant which was simply beautiful. We cant wait to return here to have a truly relaxing experience in the middle of London.",5,2017,04,19
140,A beautiful hotel with a beautiful fragrance of pink roses!,The Langham is my favourite hotel - it has a wow factor from the minute you step into the lobby!  Palm Court is lovely for Afternoon Tea or dinner.  In room dining is superb for a wonderful breakfast so that you can relax - service was both quick and charming,5,2017,04,19
140,Rather Average,This hotel has an excellent location especially for shopping and the theaters but the rooms are dated and not properly maintained. The bedside lamp would not go off and there was a constant dripping sound in the bathroom which proved very annoying. The decor in lobbies and dining areas is rather posh but this does not extend to the rooms. We had fluffy bath towels but grey and worn hand towels. The extra bed is not comfortable if you have a child. Overall it was simply not worth the price. ,3,2017,04,18
140,Very good for working,I have been to The artesian bar in the Langham a few times and I really liked it as I could work with my laptop with no interference. Usually there's a nice atmosphere. Good drinks and food. Clean and comfortable,5,2017,04,17
140,Afternoon Tea at Palm Court,"We chose the High Afternoon tea. We had a glass of champagne and there is a choice of about 30 different teas - I can recommend the white tea with apricot ! Then we chose from a selection of sandwiches which were all delicious although the pastrami and  coleslaw on caraway and cocoa bread was not really to my taste. This was followed by scones (plain and fruit) and then a selection of pastries. The food was delicious and we were pleased that they offer to box whatever you have left! 

The staff were lovely - very attentive and willing to make suggestions or accommodate dietary requirements.",5,2017,04,16
140,British Elegance,"Knowing that most of the London hotels have been conquered by the Gulf countries clientele, this Regent Street beauty remained well preserved. No offense to my Arab friends , but in some hotels you see no Europeans anymore. The hotel has the best location , good staff , great breakfast , nice rooms and a good bar. And the building is gorgeous. Very easy access to the Tube ( oxford circle ) . I feel that I found my new home in London.  ",5,2017,04,16
140,Wonderful stay,"Very centrally located; posh-understated elegance.

We were pleased with the location, wonderful concierge services and attentive staff

Our room was nicely appointed, it was clean and quiet, which was ideal given the fact that it is located off of a busy street",5,2017,04,15
140,afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea was delicious. Absolutely first class service. The sandwiches are chosen from a tray brought to your table numerous times!!
A plate of cakes each so no need to share!
Box to bring any leftovers home",5,2017,04,15
140,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff, other guests not so great","I have the wonderful opportunity to stay in some of the best hotels in North America and Europe.  I travel about 125 days per year.

I actually had two stays at The Langham Hotel in the past 10 days.  Three days for work, then I went onto the Continent and returned for seven nights for pleasure.  My first stay was more pleasant than my second, which I will explain.

The good:
- beautiful hotel - the pictures on its website do not do it justice
- each staff member without exception was friendly, welcoming and helpful.  The staff was extremely polite and well mannered.  Wonderful really.
- the rooms while small (as you expect in Europe) were beautiful.  Very well appointed.
- excellent location: right by Regent Street if you want to go shopping and steps away from Regent Park for walking or running

I absolutely loved my first few days on business.  The hotel really was a pleasure.  I was up early to go running and then out all day.  So I didn't have the experience I had the second time, which I am sorry to admit, did negatively impact my stay.

During my second stay of seven nights my husband joined me.  We like to sleep in, go running and then take our time getting ready to go out and about.  Five of seven mornings we would be woken up by, or disturbed by slamming of doors; kids running up and down the halls; guests speaking loudly on their cell phones etc.  It was annoying.  I am pretty sure that the hotel would have moved us, but I had already unpacked, and after almost a month on the road I didn't have the energy to move.

When it came up during checkout the hotel did mention they would put me on a higher floor next time I come (which I assume means they put families on lower floors??).  

So I can highly recommend this hotel.  I think the guests should be more aware of their surroundings and more considerate of others.  And of course, the world would be a better place if we were all as nice and considerate as the staff at The Langham.",4,2017,04,15
140,Stayed here for years whenever I am in town,"I stay at the Langham whenever I make my yearly trip to London on business and have finally decided to write up a review. After all this time, the Langham feels like a home away from home. Truly a gem in such a wonderful, bustling city, the Langham has always stood up
to its luxurious reputation. The restaurant is excellent. The accommodations are outstanding. The truly exceptional staff are eager to provide service and many of them even remember me by name, even though I only get
to make it there once a year (George and Michael especially!). If only I could be there more often!",5,2017,04,15
140,Absolutely love this Hotel,"I have stayed at many of London's finest hotels from The Ritz, The Dorchester, Claridge's, Hotel 41 and the list could go on. Once I started staying at The Langham London there was no going back to the other hotels. The personalized service and attention to detail is superb. The location is amazing, step outside the door and Regent Street is right there, just blocks from Oxford Street and easy walking access to many of London's top sites. Highly recommend.",5,2017,04,11
140,"Beautiful physically, but lacking soul.","One of our favorite hotels to stay at in the states is the Langham in Chicago.  This hotel had a beautiful classic/glam feel, but just lacked something in terms of service and the above and beyond effort.  We did have our three (well-travelled, well-mannered) children with us, which may have attributed to that ""missing link"".  But for the price, you want the feeling of being immersed in the experience.  Just a bit of a disconnect here despite the beauty in surroundings and favorable location",3,2017,04,10
140,Lovin' Langham!,"A wonderful place to stay! The staff are awesome! Everyone there is so attentive and ready to help, you didn't feel like you were bothering them. We stayed in an executive room nice and spacious, which gave us access to the club lounge. Everyone in the club lounge was great! A special mention goes to Diana who helped us resolve a billing issue and from the moment we arrived gave top notch service. Also Monica in the club lounge has to be mentioned because she was very friendly and attentive. All the servers in the club lounge were awesome I wish I can remember all their names but I can't because all them gave great service, but the two I do remember are Aurica and 
Hoi. Aurica went out of her way to attend to our needs and she was very pleasant to talk to, the same can be said for Hoi. He didn't let me see the bottom of my cocktail glass. The gentlemen at the front entrance of the hotel were on it as far as getting our bags and giving us directions and tips on where to go. We only used the concierge once but we didn't have any problems with our reservations that they made for us at the restaurant and they were very quick to respond to our request. Marija Stoliarova from guest services arranged a special cheesecake dessert for our anniversary and gave us a lovely card it was so nice to come back to after a long day of seeing different tourist attractions it was great. The club lounge is one of the best. They not only have an assortment of continental breakfast items, but they also feature hot breakfast items like sausage, bacon, ham, eggs, even omelettes. And you can even make requests for certain items from the menu in the restaurant with no extra charge. On one occasion my wife requested chicken sausage and they brought that from downstairs and on another day we requested pancakes and they also brought them from downstairs. The sampling of the afternoon tea as well as the canapés offered in the evening have decent selections. Champagne flows all the time and they have an assortment of cocktails and liquors in the evening. I would stay at this hotel again I can't stress enough the high level of quality service my wife and I received from beginning to end! There are only a couple of minor issues that I had with the hotel. One is you can hear the doors of the other rooms or housekeeping closets slamming shut from the hallway, an easy fix to this would be to put soft close hinges on the doors to the hotel rooms and suites as well as the housekeeping closets. The other minor issue is when you're in the bathroom you can hear the water flushing or going down the drain or running from the other neighboring hotel room, but that's it. Other reviews said that it took some time to get to the club lounge from their room in the newly refurbished wing of the hotel, I found that to be the case but it wasn't that big of a deal it wasn't too long of a walk.  Other than that the room was clean the bed was comfortable and the view was great.",5,2017,04,10
140,The Best Hotel in London - better than the Dorchester!,"I stayed here with my partner just before Christmas. It was a very busy time of year for all staff, but the service we received was perfection! The Langham has everything done right for a 5*, which has made this my most memorable and best hotel experience ever. No questions asked when we arrived and bags were taken straight out of the taxi without a mention. We were lead to reception where the staff were so helpful. Taken to our room and offered not just a hot complimentary drink, but champagne! We had room service that night as we were tired from the travel down and the food was beautiful! The decoration of the rooms and the lounge where we ate breakfast were gorgeous. We visited the Chuan Spa the next morning, which had everything. Luxurious and everything you could need. Coffee machines and herbal drinks and teas were on offer. The changing rooms were the best I've seen too, with every product you could think of including hair straighteners, towelling robes and kaftans. You literally needed no more than your bikini. I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back as soon as I can.          ",5,2017,04,10
140,Amazing luxury stay. ,We recently stayed at the Langham London hotel. It lived up to all expectations. Comfortable high quality classic surroundings. Excellent food and service with the best cocktail bar in the world !!  Vibrant atmosphere with a great feel good factor. The icing on the cake is the Roux at the Landau. We had the 5 course taster menu with wine. The staff were extremely helpful and attentive. The food was spectacular. Very reasonably priced. Highly recommend . The whole stay was a perfect couples romantic stay with a touch of quint essential British class  ,5,2017,04,09
140,"Very centric, great","Well situated, renovated not long ago, great stay. Although our rooms were small-ish we did enjoy a very good offer/rate. Comfortable yet retaining its historical value and aesthetic, nicely merging the old and the new: elegant and refined but def not stuffy. Beautiful and happening bar at night. Gorgeous dining room (great for high-tea!). Really well situated by Regent St, near the tube (oxford circus stop) walking distance from Carnaby Street, Soho, and theater district. Oh: and every time you enter lobby it smells divine (++ in my book) makes you want to linger a little longer...the concierges were excellent and very helpful with restaurant reservations, tourist attractions and how to get there. The spa and gym are currently under renovation, still was an excellent stay. ",5,2017,04,09
140,Wow best afternoon tea ever!,"My husband gave me a voucher to have afternoon tea at the Palm Court for my birthday, so had high expectations and was not disappointed!

To put it simply it was a wonderful experience, from the moment we arrived until we left.

There was free flowing tea and you can try different ones I tried the 150 anniversary tea which was really different from any other tea I have ever tried.

The sandwiches were free flowing as were the scones which were like beautiful little pillows of deliciousness!

The sweet treats were also amazing.

We also had a savoury course included, my husband had the duck and I had the beetroot and goats cheese, both were exceptional.

The staff were excellent a good balance between attentive without being too obvious.

Would happily return and would recommend.",5,2017,04,09
140,Brilliant hotel,"When you combine a beautiful building with world class service and a superb location, it is hard to go wrong. 

This is truly world class and is the perfect way to enjoy one of the great cities inn the world.

The staff were terrific with our children.  

Awesome!",5,2017,04,09
140,Our home from home,"Our stay at the Langham was great. The staff in the Club were, as always so welcoming and hospitable. The hotel is ideally located for shopaholics. What I really like is that the staff remember you. They even reserved a table in the Club that we always like.",5,2017,04,09
140,Fabulous hotel and great location,"Love The Langham. 

I've stayed in this hotel on several visits to London. The hotel location is perfect for shopping on Oxford street and walking to Mayfair!

Your 5 star experience starts from the moment you are warmly welcomed by the doormen.

It also has one of the best hotel bars in London.",5,2017,04,08
140,Left a bitter taste ,One would expect far better coffee for £6 a cup - although refills where plentiful - it was extremely bitter.  the hot chocolate was far too sweet also.  Such a shame. Good service from friendly staff - couldn't find fault there. Such a lovely building.  Perhaps the tea is better :),3,2017,04,07
140,Amazing Hotel,Amazing & Cheerful hotel. staff was very helpful and friendly. Super comfortable beds and very clean rooms. Perfect Breakfast. Great Experience overall. Good Location. Concierge very helpful. Good spaces compared to other London hotels.,5,2017,04,04
140,Excellent Hotel,"We loved this hotel's location, staff, and impeccable rooms.  The hotel was centrally located to Oxford & Regent which put us smack dab in the middle of a great shopping district.  We're looking forward to trying their hotel in our home town.",5,2017,04,03
140,Really lovely and comfortable hotel,This hotel provided me with the very best service from my initial reservation to my departure.  I was traveling alone and they took great care of me.  My room was fabulous.  I am handicap and the room was the best handicap room I've ever stayed in.  It was like having a small apartment.  The room service was exceptional.  I loved all the little details they thought of to make my stay more comfortable.,5,2017,04,02
140,"Awesome stay, fabulous hotel ","My partner and I and two friends stayed here for one night, departed on the 1st April. The hotel is amazing, friendly helpful staff, central location to attractions and shopping, beautifully decorated, very clean, the most comfortable beds and the smell when you walk in the hotel is amazing!!! I can't fault it at all, saying that the cocktails in the bar will set you back £18 each but then this is London and a 5* star hotel, so I can't really complain!! Plus they were amazing and heavily dosed with alcohol!! Would definitely return and even more so if I win the lottery, would be intrigued to know what the Sterling suite is like 😊",5,2017,04,01
140,Impromptu visit ,"This was a last minute booking after visiting family. We have stayed in lots of the 5* hotels in London and this is one of the best. It is a beautiful hotel with great staff. We will be returning as a family very soon. The breakfast is great, we had family meet us for breakfast in the morning and spent a few hours together in a beautiful setting. The staff here are fantastic particularly the reception & bar staff. We can't wait to return. ",5,2017,03,31
140,Best Hotel Stay we ever had!,The Langham London was the best hotel stay my wife and I have ever had. The staff was incredible from the time we arrived until we left. Every staff member was personable and were ready and willing to make recommendations on local restaurants that we should try. We can't recommend the Langham London enough.,5,2017,03,31
140,fantastic hospitality,"the moment they've done something wrong to you, you will be treated like God... Otherwise, it is ok. People are bit absent minded and may be too busy to care. 
make sure you get at least deluxe above room or else it is really small.",5,2017,03,30
140,Decent,Room was just fine. Everything was equipped. Could have added some curtains. Building was a little old but lobby was chic. Hotel put me into a room where I have to walk for over a minute after exiting the elevator.,5,2017,03,29
140,Old comfy stay,"We love this hotel which is located close to Piccadilly, Oxford street, and old bond street for shopping. Its nearby restaurant is burger&lobster.  The hotel service is superb, all staff are highly attentive and professional. Room is spacious and clean. However i find its buffet breakfast a bit disappointing with limited selection. ",4,2017,03,28
140,A Luxurious Stay,"My family and I just returned from our stay in London at the Langham. We were thrilled with our time there. The hotel is just beautiful, and the staff was incredibly attentive. The rooms were beautifully appointed and spotless. Centrally located in London, it was very easy to reach all our sightseeing locations. Check out the Artesian Bar for drinks before dinner. We would absolutely stay there again, and highly recommend it.",5,2017,03,28
140,You paid for the service,"Langham hotel location is great if you want to do your shopping in the main business district. It is around 5 minutes walk to the tube station. The room is all right with a large bed, TV is a bit small related to the bed. The shower is speedy enough. Bed is quite comfortable. Pillows are a bit too soft for our comfort and they all seem to be the same level of softness. Housekeeping do great service to clean your room.
Umbrella is offered to us when all sudden it rains just outside the hotel. The concierge organize local tour very efficiently for us. Early check in/ Late check out is done very quickly. Taxi service is just opposite the front door of the hotel.
From all of the above, the hotel just about to be perfect for all the boxes.
There are too minor points to be achieve 100%:
1. The doorman told us the taxi trip to the airport cost $65 but it did cost $86 (traffic, of course)
2. Service can be more down to earth instead of business, business and business!",4,2017,03,28
140,The Langham London,"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious. The reception personnel and concierge are exceptional. The Artesian Bar is lively and worth a stop. However, dinner at Roux at The Landau is substandard; I would recommend Hélène Darroze at The Connaught or Petrus for an extraordinary dining experience.",4,2017,03,27
140,Lovely long weekend at the Langham,"I'm on those people who can obsess over a hotel, particular if I'm looking to stay in a posher property.   I don't mind spending more if I get a relatively reasonable rate and the property is worth it. But I hate to spend my hard-earned dollars for something and be disappointed.  The Langham hits the mark and does not disappoint .  It is a luxury property with elegant public spaces without feeling obnoxious or stuffy.  The client is affluent without being flashy.  Sorry, I didn't see any celebrities.  The service is quite warm and friendly.  It is definitely worth it, if possible, to book a club level room.  The club is a light- filled, sophisticated yet comfortable space with breakfast, mid day snacks, afternoon tea, and evening canapes and sweets available.  Our 16 year old son thought the food was amazing.  Champagne is available all day and their complimentary wine selection is quite good (I'm pretty sure some cocktails may be available but I'm not certain).  They pretty much had me our first evening there when I, a mostly white wine drinker, was offered a fantastic sancerre and not some cheap but unpalatable chardonnay (although I'm sure their chardonnay was good -  free chardonnay usually isn't worth the calories). 

They are in the process of renovating the spa, pool and I think some rooms as well so they are invested in keeping things fresh.  Even the nicest hotel will its luster if not properly maintained.  We were traveling with our 3 kids and our club level rooms were spacious, elegant and comfortable in an updated traditional style, and were right next to each other: in a word -perfect.

The location was outstanding too: you're basically on Regent Street with a 3 minute walk to Oxford Circus with access to the Central Line that with connections can take you anywhere in central London , an under 5 minute walk to Marylebone, 7 or 8 minutes to Bond street and Mayfair,  a dozen minutes walking to Soho. 15 minute walk to Westminister.

The Langham is not the absolute poshest hotel in London.  If that what's you're looking for, God speed.  If you are looking for a luxury property that is understated, with calm, warm service with sophisticated decor in a great location, then by all means consider the Langham.

Special kudos to the entire staff at the Langham, from the doormen and bell staff, to the  front desk, concierge, restaurant and bar staff, lounge staff, and housekeeping staff.  All were outstanding.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2017,03,27
140,Super service and great atmosphere,The hotel has a great location. The service is in top. The employees where very friendly. The club room witH Club lounge entry was great. I can recommend a stay at the Landham and I will come back.  Best hotel I have ever tried in London,5,2017,03,27
140,The Langham,"Fantastic service, friendly and helpful staff, great restaurants and food, beautiful hotel and room, great location.. I was there on business and the staff made sure I had an extremely comfortable stay. I would stay at the Langham again!",5,2017,03,25
140,Heaven on Earth,"I've been here many times, and I still love this hotel.  This trip, I came for my birthday.  The hotel took extra effort to make me feel special on my day.  I had champagne, chocolates and a lovely upgrade waiting on arrival.  I'm a regular guest, so perhaps they went above and beyond, but that's the benefit of being a regular guest.  And I'm a regular guest because they always go above and beyond.  I highly recommend this hotel.  Ask for an extra large family room if you're traveling with the family.  The junior suites on the 9th floor have exceptional views.  And don't miss the Artesian.  Order the Cocoon cocktail for a really special experience.",5,2017,03,25
140,Exceptional hotel,"One of those hotels that gets everything right from the second you arrive until you reluctantly leave! Great door staff and reception, impeccable service, incredible bar and great bed at the end of it all!! Casual luxury at its finest!!

140,Perfect!,"Another wonderful visit to the Langham London. Amenties and service quality are top notch! Housekeeping is excellent. Breakfast at the Palm Court has plently of options for kids and adults. 
Concierge went above and beyond and got us 4 tickets on New Year's Eve on the London Eye with a fast pass optuom which saved us 45 minutes waiting in line.
Overall a perfect stay.",5,2017,03,23
140,"flawlessness, perfectness and faultlessness","My husband and i stayed at the Langham / Langham Club last year and had the most magnificent and memorable experience. I recently visited the Langham Club on my own in March 2017 (did not even bother to research other hotels) and again my 5 night stay exceeded my expectations! The Langham Club's Director Fadi and his colleagues are at the highest level of professional excellence.  The chefs are complimented with their amazing talents in providing high quality signature dishes and an exceptional variety of quality food.  The Clubs ambiance, atmosphere, along with a heartfelt welcome, attentiveness, kindness, hospitality, generosity and attention to detail  is impeccable and phenomenal. The Langham and Langham Club is a perfect embodiment of flawlessness, perfectness and faultlessness to the highest degree in hotelier. Thank you so much for accommodating.",5,2017,03,23
140,Elegant and Relaxing,"We stayed here for our last night of a rather exhausting European tour. We knew we'd like to end on a high note but this exceeded our expectations of comfort, luxury and pampering. The bar was exceptional, the room was extremely comfortable for our family of 5, and the room service was some of the best I've had. We will absolutely make this a recurring stay. The price is very high but you do get what you pay for here.",5,2017,03,21
140,5* and more..,"The best UK hotel experience we have had.  We would certainly recommend a visit here.  Not the cheapest but certainly amongst the best.  We treated ourselves to a suite and couldn't have been happier with the room.  We usually only experience standards of service like this abroad, a lot of UK hotels need to spend on improvements - but not here.  Well done Langham.",5,2017,03,20

Fantastic decor and most breath taking building.There is a great spa and of course the cocktail bar is the best in London.Best afternoon tea in London/Of course love to have Singaporean Sling there too.
Highly recommended.
My friends stayed in this hotel when visiting London they have found top class service for the money you pay.Only one complaint I had from one of my friends that she did not liked the bread at the breakfast.I am sure they have improved it.",5,2017,03,19

Everything is just beautiful !",5,2017,03,14
140,What a place!,"This hotel must have the best service i've experienced!

From the warm welcome upon arrival to the friendly assistance of every member of staff until your departure, this place really is definitely worth the money.

TOP TIP:
If you can, upgrade to an executive room. This is the lowest level of room that allows you access to the Club Lounge, and my goodness is it worth the extra money.

Included is an lovely buffet breakfast, free flowing champagne from 10am until 10pm, afternoon tea (with alcohol) from 2pm and canapés (which is more like a full meal, with alcohol and the occasional oyster), from 5pm until 10pm.
Before you've had a chance to finish your glass it is immediately topped up by a member of staff who encourage you to have more!
There is no need to book any dinner reservations after a day in the Club Lounge which, in the long run, could even save you money.

Rooms are also furnished to a high standard. 
If I could go back every week I would! It is however a treat and has a price tag to match, but this hotel definintely needs to be experienced.",5,2017,03,14
140,Christmas at the Langham,"Stayed here for a combination of Christmas and new year birthday celebration. This hotel is first class when it comes to service. I had a slice of cake and card awaiting me in the room for my birthday. I stayed on the 9th floor which was the top floor and there were no issues. There was everything you needed. Breakfast was included and we went to roux at the landau everyday. The service was lovely and the room was beautiful. Had waffles one day, omelette the other. The butter was to die for lol. Went to the jacuzzi, pool and sauna. Pool was slightly cold but still nice for a light swim. Everywhere was beautifully decorated with Christmas trees everywhere. The hotel is situated right in the centre of everything so you can shop and get back to the hotel in no time. Would stay again! Loved it",5,2017,03,13

140,Afternoon Tea at The Palm Court. Awesome,"Well, I don't run around going trying afternoon tea everywhere but I've had a few.

I would say however that the offering at The Langham is as perfect as it could possible get.

Bottomless for a start, keep eating and it keeps coming. The sandwiches were divine, as smart as The Coldstream Guards, but on a plate.

Scones, or scones depending on how you pronounce the word, were short but not crumbly and the clotted cream had some crust on it.

The small cakes served as a last course were beautifully made.

The teas was something special.

The waiting staff were well up to date, none of that obsequious nonsense (mind you that goes for all of The Langham's front of house staff). They were friendly and therecjust when you wanted them.

Just brilliant, thoroughly recommmended.",5,2017,03,13
140,Great short break,Chose hotel as needed to go to Harley Street but it was the best choice - great location on Regent's Street. Staff friendly and always ready to help. Club lounge was excellent with free flowing champagne - living in Dubai you have very high expectations - The Langham met and exceeded these.,5,2017,03,12
140,Beautiful Hotel,"I have stayed at the Langham twice now and it never disappoints. From the warm, friendly welcome to the stylish bedrooms, this hotel offers charm and luxury. I dined in the Roux at the Landau restaurant and enjoyed the exquisitely cooked and presented tasting menu. This hotel is definitely one to stay in if you are visiting London. It is only a short walk from Oxford Circus so ideally located for shopping and theatres. I, for one, will definitely be staying again soon.",5,2017,03,08
140,The Langham,"Just the most perfect hotel, friendly, welcoming, accommodating, comfortable & clean what more can I say other than try the Level 3 Club Lounge Lush. Looking forward to the New Health opening. restaurants and Bars are also worth experiencing.",5,2017,03,08
140,Beautiful hotel,"Stopped for one night as a last minute trip to London last weekend. We were very kindly given a free upgrade and had a lovely large room. The breakfast was superb. The downside was that the only bar my daughter was allowed in for farming snack etc was the palm court. The service was very slow, the card machine wasn't working very well and was disappointed that the drinks menu wasn't more comprehensive. There were no speciality gin menu etc. The guineas arrived in a can! For such a lovely hotel shame the bar didn't keep up with the luxury feel X",4,2017,03,07
140,The Langham Portland Place,Having stayed in many top class hotels in London 'The Langham' takes it to a different level.  The staff were excellent and attention to detail second to none.  Highly recommend. Excellent location too.,5,2017,03,07

140,Another enjoyable stay,"Consistent standard from the hotel staff and service are some values which one looks out for in selecting overseas hotel stay.

It is always nice to go back to stay in Langham hotel due the mentioned reasons and will be the few reasons why I will choose this hotel again whenever I come back to London.",5,2017,03,04
140,Excellent hotel which most certainly deserves its 5 stars,"Having stayed in this hotel for just over four weeks during a visit to London with family  I must say that from day one from the doormen on entering the hotel, the reception, housing keeping and restaurant staff everyone was so welcoming and any request we had was dealt with in a very positive and efficient manner and as an hotel truly deserve its five star status keep up the good work and thanking you for such an enjoyable and stress free stay. Look forward to visiting again in the near future.

140,Celebration,"Just lovely, we have come down to London for a celebration weekend and this hotel has not let us down. We are staying in a deluxe room which is beautiful, not extra large but plenty big enough with a lovely big bathroom, great toiletries. The decoration is understated glamour, traditional yet modern a lovely feeling of luxury. A really comfortable bed. The staff are all really friendly polite and helpful, especially the doormen. The bar is amazing, old Hollywood looking with a modern twist. Great food and cocktails very innovative. The location of the hotel could not be better to get to all the fun that London has to offer.
Breakfast in my opinion, is the only area for some very small tweaking. (The oddest omelet and Luke warm hot dishes in both restaurants) Although the continental offering and the setting / room decor are fantastic.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit.",5,2017,02,28
140,Nice stay,Great location in the centre of London. Lovely hotel and stunning room. Really enjoy the breakfast and the whole experience was great  we were looked after by the staff from the moment we arrived. Not the most modern hotel but lovely in a traditional way.,5,2017,02,27
140,Best hotel I have ever worked with as an Event Planner,"In 25 years of Planning Corporate Events, this is by far the best hotel I have ever worked with.  The hotel is charming, the staff is friendly and extremely helpful and prompt, and the food and beverage superb!",5,2017,02,27
140,Unforgettable (Daughters first time to London),"I've been to London several times but this is my first time staying at this hotel. My daughter has never been to London and I took her for her first trip all the way from Miami, Florida. 
Wonderful hotel with great staff members. The architecture is simply amazing. The dining areas are beautiful. I could sit in the lobby all day, it's so comfortable. I cannot recall her name, but the young lady who checked me into my room was very kind. The gentlemen in concierge were very helpful. Thank you so much to Filipo and Brian for assisting in having a car take my daughter and I sight seeing. Our room (522) was quite comfortable. 
My daughter and I had Langham High Tea and it was such a lovely experience. The tea was amazing, the sandwiches and the desserts as well. Our waiter (I cannot recall his name) was such a kind gentleman who was always smiling and kept a watchful eye on our table. 

My only complaint is of breakfast. My daughter and I had breakfast on the morning of our departure. My daughter ordered the duck eggs for her meal, she took one bite and did not like it at all. When the waiter brought to bill over to the table, he asked how the meal was, I responded ""it's still there, she didn't like it"". He simply gave a kind smile and left the bill. I would suppose that if a person didn't eat their meal because it wasn't to their liking, that it would be REMOVED from their bill. Other than that, we had a great stay. 
",5,2017,02,26
140,Perfect stay - Returning to Langham again and enjoying it again,"Our family of 4 returned in Langham hotel for our yearly visit to London, and we had a perfect stay. One exception was the lack of pool time as the spa area is under restoration. Hence we went with kids to swim pool in vicinity with vouchers from hotel. Concierge background info of the conditions were not up to date, but in the end things turned out ok.
We stayed in junior suite, had access to club and also enjoyed the Artesian bar for drink and Palm Court for dinner,  in addition to in-room dining. All experiences were truly excellent, as they had also been in the past. Comparing Langham to many other 5 star hotels the service feels genuine friendly in all places and the quality of rooms, food and drinks is perfect.
We will definitely return again.",5,2017,02,26
140,Afternoon tea,"Spent a lovely couple of hours in very elegant comfortable surroundings in the Palm Court having afternoon tea. Our server, Dora was extremely attentive and we were frequently offered more sandwiches, scones and tea and she very kindly boxed our left over cakes to take home. Would definitely return ",5,2017,02,25
140,Breakfast Meeting,"What a stunning venue to have a breakfast meeting with clients.

Greeted by the valets on arrival, who were very cheery and pleasant.

Great service in the breakfast room which complimented our meeting as efficient yet discreet which allowed us to conduct our business without interruption. The design and elegance of the room was fabulous. high ceilings, great decor and soft comfortable seating.

Facilities were clean and ample, although a little bit of a walk from the entrance.

Highly recommend for a meeting venue.",5,2017,02,25
140,the best hotel,We just returned from a week in London with our daughter and son in law We had a perfect time. We were in the newly renovated rooms which were outstanding. The help from the front desk to the maids outdid themselves.The conceirge were superb and always avaiable. The breakfasts were wonderful. We will be back next year for sure. Naomi and Jeff Stonberg,5,2017,02,25
140,A Soothing Oasis,"Afternoon tea in The Palm Court was exactly what I needed after a day shopping on my own. I had eaten a large lunch and only wanted a pot of tea.  The staff were polite and helpful, they brought a large pot of English breakfast tea ( 4 cups).  Tables were set with immaculate linen and crockery.  After listening to the soothing, live piano music for 45minutes I felt refreshed and had a glass of their excellent Prosecco, served with complimentary crisps and honey glazed nuts.  A beautiful way to spend the end of a hectic day.",5,2017,02,25
140,100% recommendation,"Great hotel in a great location! Everything is clean and nice. Staff is super friendly. Pool and small sauna to relax after lots of walking. Incredible birthday surprise! 😍 Many thanks to the great staff.
We will definitely be back!",5,2024,02,12
140,Unforgettable afternoon tea,"I had wanted to try afternoon tea for a long time, and after some research, I discovered that this was the first place that brought this tradition to London. So we booked well in advance because we knew it was a very popular place and despite this we managed without any problems. We were welcomed in a very professional manner and taken to the table, there was the set menu, which however during the holiday period was a little more expensive, from £75 to £95, although we honestly didn't know this at the time of booking but oh well let's let it pass. These sandwiches are starting to arrive, one with cream cheese, cucumber and chives, the other with cheddar, chutney and tomato bread, the other with beetroot bread, mushroom cream and beef wellington and the last with white bread, chives and prawns, all accompanied by a gazpacho of blueberries, turkey and bacon. Of all these, my favorite was the prawn sandwich, then the wellington sandwich and the gazpacho. In the sweet part we get some scones, delicious, and served with strawberry and pineapple jam, and then 4 cakes, one with charcoal with vanilla cream, a pastry with caramel cream and cinnamon, one with currants, almonds and vanilla and the the last with pear jam and jasmine mousse, and to them was the addition of a mince pie with Stilton cheese on the top. So of all my favorites were the one with caramel and cinnamon and the charcoal and vanilla cake, the mince pie with cheese was a huge fail, and we accompanied both the sweet and savory dishes first with a black tea and then a red dragon tea . So very very nice place, staff always very professional and super friendly and helpful, very high quality and a little high price but it is an experience that must be tried for once. Super satisfied",5,2024,01,01
140,Es excelente!,"El hotel está muy bien situado en Marylebone, tienes buenos restaurantes y muchas tiendas entre estas está Lyberty, también cerca de Carnaby, el staff es amable, la limpieza es excelente y la comodidad de la cama hace que puedas dormir muy bien. El restaurante tiene un chef de muy alto nivel y la calidad es insuperable. El único detalle es la incomodidad de las sillas en el restaurante y sobre todo de las mesas muy bajitas así que tienes que acercarte mucho a la mesa y no puedes recostarte, lucen lindas pero no son cómodas. Y por último el staff son muy amables y serviciales. Excelente !",5,2023,05,11

140,Più classe che lusso,"Quello che impressiona subito di questo albergo un po' eduardiano , e' la sua eleganza particolare, una eleganza che esisteva prima di noi, che non possiamo che constatarla
come sempilci pervenu . Il Langham e' un vecchio hotel molto british con tanto da raccontare: Napoleone terzo ha passato  qui un  po' di esilio, ( una prova che i potenti cadono sempre con eleganza)  e poi questa storia comprovata del fantasma del principe tedesco che qui  suicido nel 1914, predilige la camera 333 ,ma tranquilli e' discreto  ed educato. E' un hotel che non si dimentica, io ho esteso la mia permanenza nel we, per godermi la sua spa cinese insolita ma bellissima, e il suo famoso te delle cinque, che al Langham,  più che un'evento e ' un tributo trionfale della inglesita' perduta di  ,  una piccola isola fuori tempo in una Londra tutto affari,  pret a mange e frotte di turisti. Buona esperienza prezzo altino, ma questa volta paghi la classe non il lusso.

",5,2023,01,24
140,Non tornerei nonostante la bellezza della struttura ,"Si tratta di una struttura eccellente situata nel centro di Londra. Il personale è stato nei miei confronti molto gentile e premuroso. Nulla da eccepire in questo senso. Spiego brevemente i motivi del mio no:

- camere troppo piccole (rapportate al costo) 
- assenza di lettini in piscina. Solo sedie. E' pertanto impossibile rilassarsi dopo aver nuotato. Stessa cosa vale per l'area relax della Spa. Solo divani. Come un normale salotto di casa. Che senso ha? Mai visto 
- camera fredda all'arrivo. E' stato necessario un intervento del tecnico per ripristinare il riscaldamento. Considerando che avevano portato in camera un welcome gift (frutta e cioccolatini) perchè non controllare il corretto funzionamento dell'aria? 
- modern tavern chiusa senza avviso. Avevo prenotato con Amex FHR. In genere queste informazioni vengono fornite all'agenzia preventivamente. L'unico ristorante disponibile per cena era lo stesso dove si faceva il breakfast. Un po' poco per un 5 stelle lusso 
- Lunghe attese alla colazione. Ristorante con poca disponibilità di posti quando l'hotel ha molti ospiti 

Per concludere. Un albergo dall'ottimo potenziale gestito in modo poco professionale. 

",3,2023,01,13
140,Magnifico,"La habitación que nos dieron al arribar no fue de nuestro agrado y de inmediato fuimos atendidos y a partir de ahí todo fue disfrute en este histórico hotel perfectamente situado, refinamiento en cada detalle, comida memorable, atención impecable, todos los Lanham me han dejado con deseos de volver, pero este en especial se ha convertido en el único al que llegaré en mis visitas a Londres.",5,2022,12,05

140,"Immer noch gut, aber hat leider etwas nachgelassen","Nach 2019 waren wir wieder zu Gast im The Langham London. Service, Zimmer, Freundlichkeit und allgemeines Ambiente sehr gut - aber das Frühstück war ein Rückschritt. Im Vergleich zu 2019 st das Buffet nur noch 25 % gross zu früher. Im Preis ist ein kontinentales Frühstück und das kostet 30 Pfund pro Person - zu teuer für das was sie bieten. Alles andere muss teuer bezahlt werden. Selbst eine Flasche Wasser wurde extra abgerechnet + 12,5 % Service (allerdings wurde das beim bezahlen beim Check Out wieder gestrichen) Service wird sonst sehr groß geschrieben.
Wir hatten mit dem Fahrservice Probleme, als Entschuldigung gab ein Obstteller und eine Flasche Rotwein aufs Zimmer. Zu unserem Hochzeitstag gab es eine Flasche Champagner und nochmal Obst aufs Zimmer. - ganz großes Kino.
Das Alles hat natürlich seinen Preis.

fter 2019 we were guests again at The Langham London. Service, room, friendliness and general ambience very good - but the breakfast was a step backwards. Compared to 2019, the buffet is only 25% larger than it used to be. The price includes a continental breakfast and costs £30 per person - too expensive for what they offer. Everything else has to be paid dearly. Even a bottle of water was charged extra + 12.5% ​​service (although that was canceled when you paid at check-out) Service is otherwise very important.
We had problems with the driver service, as an apology there was a fruit plate and a bottle of red wine in the room. For our anniversary there was a bottle of champagne and more fruit in the room. 
Of course, all this has its price.",4,2022,09,15
140,Excelente!,"Visitamos Londres para un evento que se llevaba a cabo precisamente en este hotel.
Mi perspectiva de hotel londinense cambió por completo con respecto a la que tenía anteriormente y no solo por su excelente ubicación, que nos permitió emplear nuestras horas libres caminando por la cercanía.
El servicio de “porters” es impecable. Todos, sin excepción, son unos maravillosos embajadores de este hotel, y señalaría que es el punto de diferenciación que, personalmente, destacaría.
El hotel está muy bien cuidado, las flores que lo adornan son espectaculares y, casualmente, eran hortensias (de mis favoritas).
Como recomendación, una cena informal en The Wigmore. Las cervezas, los cócteles y las opciones para cenar nos encantaron. 
Tuvimos la oportunidad de desayunar en dos ambientes, y nuestro favorito fue el ofrecido en el Palm Court, tanto por el lugar propiamente dicho, como por la experiencia y el servicio.
Resaltar el Room Service, nuestra opción para cenar la noche antes de regresar a casa. Rápido, con la temperatura correcta y con un excelente servicio de Camarero.
Finalmente, un aplauso para la atención al detalle de quien revisó nuestra habitación a la salida y nos dejó junto a nuestro equipaje en consigna, las dos corbatas que nos habíamos dejado en el armario. Gracias!
Volveremos!",5,2021,11,15

140,Ottima struttura nel centro di Londra,"Pernottamento di tre notti in questa struttura che già esternamente fa intendere il livello qualitativo. Intanto è un hotel che ha una storia che si può leggere in uno dei libri presenti in stanza ed inoltre l’edificio è storico, situazione nel centro di Londra a due passi dalla fermata del tube Oxford Circus. Entrando ti accorgi della cura negli arredi, di fronte la sala dove abbiamo potuto gustare un’ottima colazione a buffet (non inclusa nel prezzo). La camera era perfettamente pulita, ampia e ben arredata con tutti i comfort che un hotel di questo livello può dare, un bagno grande quanto la camera con riscaldamento a pavimento, un piano lavabo ampio, vasca e una doccia grande. Cabina armadio, macchina del caffè, frigobar e letto comodo. Servizio perfetto di pulizia e di preparazione della camera per la notte. Abbiamo usufruito della piscina coperta, veramente molto carina , della palestra, non enorme ma con attrezzi moderni e della spa, bagno turco e sauna, piccole rispetto la grandezza dell’hotel ma dove però non abbiamo avuto problemi di affollamento, anzi. Insomma è un bellissimo hotel che ovviamente non è alla portata di tutti ma che aiuta a rendere la visita della città più rilassante. Ah, c’è anche una bellissima zona bar che alla sera è molto frequentata e un ristorante di un rinomato chef che credo tenga anche corsi (ho visto una sala con tanti tavoli attrezzati da cucina).

Nachdem ich mich beschwert hatte, gab man mir ein sehr großes, helles Zimmer mit geräumigem Bad. Was man mir verschwieg: Im minutentakt fährt die U Bahn unter durch.

Heute strahlt es den wunderbaren Charme einer längst vergangenen Zeit aus und es verbindet auf angenehme Weise Tradition mit Moderne. 

Wir sind zu einem Business-Meeting hier und nicht als Übernachtungs-Gäste. 

Allerdings ist unser Eindruck von Service und Dienstleistung, vom Haus selber und von dessen zentraler Lage, von der Freundlichkeit jedes Mitarbeiters und von der Qualität der Bewirtung so grossartig, dass ich sicherlich das Hotel Langham auch für meinen nächsten Privat-Besuch wählen werde.

Die Drinks in der Bar waren auch sehr außergewöhnlich und wurden sehr professionell serviert!
Doorman, Empfangshalle, Ambiente und Flair des Hotels sind genauso wie man sich ein Londoner 5-Sterne Haus vorstellt, hier würden wir jederzeit wieder wohnen und können es auch gerne weiterempfehlen!
Einziger Wermutstropfen war der etwas überteuerte Preis, lag vermutlich auch daran, dass London zu dieser Zeit sehr gut besucht und die Hotels alle nahezu ausgebucht waren.",5,2018,06,27
140,Hotel eccezionale nel cuore di Londra,"Hotel di lusso davvero molto bello situato nel cuore di Londra, tra Mayfair e Marylebone e, dunque, ideale per visitare a piedi la città. Abbiamo soggiornato in una camera deluxe situata al quinto piano con vista sul viale alberato di fronte all’hotel. La stanza era ben arredata, pulita e molto spaziosa, così come il bagno in marmo e la cabina armadio. Tutto è curato nei minimi dettagli e il letto è molto comodo. La colazione, servita in entrambi i ristoranti dell’hotel (Roux at the Landau e Palm Court), è abbondante e molto buona. Durante il soggiorno, abbiamo usufruito anche della piscina coperta, ideale per rilassarsi dopo una giornata trascorsa a visitare la capitale inglese. 
Tutto il personale (dallo staff del check-in/reception al concierge fino al personale di servizio) è molto gentile e disponibile. Ringraziamo, in particolare, il sig. Mattia per la professionalità e la gentilezza nel darci informazioni e consigli utili. Mi sento di raccomandare assolutamente questo hotel, in cui tornerò sicuramente in futuro.",5,2018,06,26
140,Attraktiver Preis,"Wir hatten für 3 Nächte das Langham besucht. Ein sehr professionell geführtes Haus. Der persönliche Service ließ zu wünschen übrig. Das Frühstück ist hervorragend, die Bedienung war extrem langsam. Zahlreiche Gäste an den Nachbartischen klagten darüber ebenso. Die Zimmereinrichtung ist zweckmäßig, aber nicht besonders ansprechend. Wir bekamen einen sehr guten Deal und deshalb waren wir im Großen und Ganzen zufrieden. ",3,2018,05,27
140,Eleganza allo stato puro!! ,"Non c’è niente da dire se non che la Pasqua passata in questo hotel è stata magnifica! Servizio, cordialità, accoglienza....tutto ineccepibile! Eleganza è dire poco. Per altro il vero tocco di classe è la presenza dell’ Artesian stupendo cocktail bar all’interno dell’hotel! Consigliatissimo! ",5,2018,04,20
140,"Siempre impecable, mi favorito. ","Después de probar muchos hoteles en Londres, casi siempre por temas de negocio, este es sin duda mi favorito. Elegante pero acogedor, servicio siempre excelente, habitaciones amplias e impecables y muy buena localización. Gimnasio y piscina muy bien también. ",5,2018,04,01
140,Da tornare assolutamente ,"Sono stato in questo hotel situato nel centro di Londra e l’ho trovato eccellente, a partire dalle camere con un letto comodissimo, un bagno accogliente e con un sevizio per farsi il caffè e il tè. Piscina eccellente e spa ottima ma a parer mio un po’ piccola.Cena nel ristorante ad altissimi livelli anche con un semplice “fish and chips”. Ho addirittura ricevuto una torta a forma di rosa come sorpresa per il mio compleanno. Personale gentilissimo e disponibile.
Ovviamente consigliassimo.",5,2018,03,23
140,Magnifico hotel nel cuore di Londra,"Hotel di lusso, molto confortevole nel cuore di Londra in una posizione davvero fantastica. Personale attento, gentile, sempre pronto a venire incontro a qualsiasi richiesta. Camera executive spaziosa e molto curata nei dettagli. Un hotel da cinque stelle!! ",5,2018,03,04
140,IMPRESIONANTE,"Muy buen hotel con un servicios muy atento. El mejor hotel sin duda que he experimentado hasta el momento. La comida muy buena y las habitaciones superan las expectativas, muy buena limpieza y se descansa muy bien, sin ruidos. El hotel es muy céntrico. Sin duda repito!",5,2018,02,09
140,Muy bueno,"Llegamos a Londres y había reservado el servicio de traslado del hotel, al salir con las maletas no encontrábamos el cartel rosa con el nombre de hotel. Buscamos por más de 30 minutos, mientras nos tratábamos de comunicar con el hotel, luego de un rato nos dijeron que debía estar ahí. Seguimos buscando y no estaba hasta que lo vimos entrar por la puerta. Estamos de vacaciones y no me iba a ser problema a pesar de que estábamos cansados por un largo viaje.
Luego llegamos al hotel nos recibe una señorita muy gentil nos lleva para hacer check in al club lounge. Como estaban ocupados nos sentamos a esperar hasta que nos llamaron. Tengo que decir que ya me estaba poniendo de mal humor porque tardaron bastante para atendernos y queríamos nuestra habitación. Y los mozos del club no se acercaron en ningún momento.Esta modalidad la cambiaron la otra vez que habíamos estado nos la hicieron en la habitación y es mucho mejor y más personal. Ya que por lo menos me muestran las instalaciones. Y es más cómodo para alguien que viajo tantas horas. 
Una vez hecho el check in nos dirigimos a la habitación. Sacamos una habitación executive con exceso al club. La habitación estaba muy bien en perfectas condiciones ya estaba la camada de mi hija, una cama extra. Teníamos un sector con un sillón. Muy cómoda y funcional nos resultó. La vista daba a la calle Regent todo divino! Tenía máquina de café y termo para el té. El baño algo chico sin bañera pero elegante. Con todos los productos shampoo etc.
Nos encanta este hotel por eso lo volvimos a elegir. Era nuestra segunda estadía.
El desayuno lo tomamos siempre en el club, leí que había mozos que hablaban castellano lamentablemente  no los conocimos. En varias oportunidades tuve que levantarme a pedir que por favor me traigan café y te. El lounge es muy completo por las tardes tiene buen surtido de fiambres, algo de ensaladas. Pocas cosas calientes, sopa lo único que recuerdo. Nos venia bien después de recorrer tanto. Siempre sirven champagne. Hay horarios en los que estaba muy lleno de gente y al levantarse los mozos no limpiaban las mesas rápido como para los que estaban esperando se sienten. 
Estuvimos 6 noches y fueron increíbles. 
Me llamo la atención que por las noches no pasaban  siempre hacernos el turndown y no dejan más esos chocolatitos con el logo del hotel. Ese era un lindo gesto que en la almohada este el choco. Me resultó raro que no pasen todas las noches a arreglar la cama. De las 6 noches habrán pasado 3. 
Para  la noche de navidad nos dieron un chocolate. Que a mi hija le encanto. 
El personal en general es muy atento. La limpieza es muy buena. Los conserjes que hablan español son muy buenos dan muy buenas recomendaciones. 
Tengo que decir que es un hotel encantador. Tiene ese encanto único. Que nos hace querer volver. Recomiendo este hotel una vez más!

140,Raffinatezza e cortesia,"Abbiamo alloggiato in questo luxury hotel tra la fine del 2017 e l’inizio del nuovo anno. Posizione eccezionale tra Regent e Oxford Street, a due passi dalla metro.

140,Excellentes Hotel im Centrum,"Die Lage des Hotels an der Regent Str. und nahe zu Oxford Street und Oxford Circus Underground ist 
schlicht und einfach gut; Empfang durch den Doorman war sehr zuvorkommend, der Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption schnell, freundlich und kompetent. Die Ausstattung des Hotels und des Zimmers ist sehr hochwertig und gediegen. Die Betten sind breit, sehr gute Kopfkissen; das Bad ist sehr geschmackvoll und gut ausgestattet; es gibt eine Kaffee-/Teemaschine und einen Wasserkocher. Hervorzuheben ist das schnelle und leistungsfähige WLAN. Frühstücks und Service dort war ebenfalls sehr gut,; frisches und aufgeschnittenes Obst in großer Menge; div. Wurst- und Käsesorten; der Wunsch nach besonderem Brot wurde sofort und freundlich lächelnd erfüllt.
Insgesamt ein rundum zufriedenstellender Aufenthalt, der zum Wiederkommen einlädt.",5,2018,01,06

140,Clásico té en Londres,"Previa reserva por web , concurrimos por el clásico té de la tarde. Estar atentos que otros sitios más bonitos y glamorosos como el Hotel Ritz, tenían ya sus reservas colmadas varias semanas antes.
Atentos que no reciben después de 5pm . De modo que fuimos a las 4pm.
Pianista en vivo animando, bien servido , ofreciendo reposición para cada sección, entiéndase: sándwiches (4 tipos) , scons ( increíbles) y variedad de pasties .
El precio comienza en £ 49 , para el tipo de té que cada quien elija, al que hay que agregarle el costo del servicio ( 12%).
Luego, ese básico se incrementa si   Optamos por copa de champagne y más a medida que aceptamos otros ítems.
Una tarde agradabilísima , en un lugar hermoso, bien atendido , con sabrosas degustaciones y solo disfrutar de la compañía.",4,2017,10,23
140,"gute zentrale Lage,sehr guter Service,ausgezeichneter Club","Das erstemal im Langham.Es lohnt sich.es ist nicht billig.Die Lage ist mehr als zentral.Die Zimmer,hauptsächlich die Juniorsuiten sind zu empfehlen.Der Service im Club ist excellent und einmalig.Die Weinauswahl ist gut,der Champagner fliesst in Srömen,kostenlos!  Ein altehrwürdiges Hotel auf den neusten Stand gebracht.Die Restaurants sind zu empfehlen.",5,2017,10,17
140,Simplemente excelente,"Desde el primer momento notas que tu estancia será excelente.
La atención, el ambiente, la decoración.
Pasamos tres días en Londres y el hotel de lo mejor. La habitación perfecta, el baño que es en lo que más me fijo siempre, me encantò.
El desayuno para pasar la mañana en ese salón y con tanta variedad y cantidad.
No nos dió tiempo a disfrutar el spa y la piscina pero si que lo visitamos y daba gusto solo el verla.
El bar, Artesian, para pasar un buen rato entra cocteles distintos y preparados con muy buen gusto. 
Nos encataría volver. 
Gracias Lanham.",5,2017,10,06
140,Ottimo hotel in pieno centro," Hotel di lusso, servizio impeccabile ed ottima posizione. Abbiamo alloggiato nell'ala nuova ,un po' scomoda da raggiungere ,ma con camere veramente spaziose e belle. Bell'atmosfera nel dopo cena al bar per un drink.",5,2017,09,24

140,Freundlichkeit inklusive,"Die Ankunft ist sehr herzlich gewesen. Wir wurden sofort zum Frühstück begleitet, da wir sehr früh im Hotel angekommen sind. Zimmer sehr exquisit und die Suppleys im Bad hervorragend. Durch das Pauschalangebot mit Nachmittagstee und Abendbuffet auch erschwinglich.",5,2017,08,30
140,Wochenendtrip,"Bei der Planung für das Wochenende in London, sind wir über Umwege auf das ""The Langham"" gestoßen. 
American Express läßt Grüßen und wir haben es gebucht.

Der Empfang war dann doch etwas holprig, da die Doormänner zu beschäftigt, mit anderen Gästen wie auch mit sich selber, so das uns keine Beachtung geschenkt wurde.

Egal, an der Rezeption war der Empfang um so herzlicher und es ging auch ohne Umwege in die Clubetage die wir gebucht hatten. 

Frank, der uns eincheckte, ist ein absolut sympathischer Kerl. Witz, Charme und alles mit einem lächeln auf den Lippen. Bei einem  Champagner wurde uns der Club vorgestellt, zu welchen Zeit es Frühstück, Afternoon Tea und 
The Butlers Pantry präsentiert wurde. 

Anschließend ging es auf unser Zimmer. Ein Eckzimmer mit Blick auf die BBC Zentrale und die Regent Street. Großzügige Zimmer und gut gegen den  Lärm von außen isoliert.
Badewanne, geräumige Dusche, Fußbodenheizung, ein Ankleidezimmer, bequeme Betten, TV und Hifi, Sitzecke und wunderschöne Blumendeko. 

Alles in allem ein tolles Hotel in einem beeindruckendem Gebäude. Das Hotel wurde erst 1991 wiedereröffnet. Davor stand es mehr oder weniger leer. Im Krieg stark beschädigt wurde es nach 1945 von der BBC als Unterkunft für Ihre MA genutzt. 

Heute erstrahlt es wieder in altem Glanz, das Grand Hotel was Anfang des 20 Jahrhundert das größte und modernste in London war. 

Ich muss allerdings einen Punkt ansprechen. Die wärme und Persönlichkeit wie bei Ritz Carlton fehlt etwas im The Langham, aber das ist jetzt jammern auf hohem Niveau.  

",5,2017,08,25
140,Confortevole,"Hotel con molti confort, spa, piscina, sala fitness molto invitanti. Pulito, personale disponibile e gentilissimo. Alla reception per chi non conoscesse l’inglese parlano anche italiano. La camera dove ho soggiornato era un po’ piccola ma molto intima. Lo consiglio perché in una posizione centrale e molto bella.",4,2017,08,24
140,Gute und Ruhige Lage in London,"Wie besuchten das Langham in London über Sylvester leztes Jahr
Es ist ein sehr schönes älteres Hotel in typischen englischen Styl

Le stanze sono arredate secondo uno stile anni '20, fiori ovunque, servizi di primo livello.
il cibo è ottimo e la colazione è molto curata e ricca, per tutti i gusti.
I lpersonale è a disposizione e discreto. non è il solito hotel carissimo di Londra che ti fa pagare una fortuna solo perchè è in centro a Londra. Qui c'è qualità vera",5,2017,07,21
140,Lindo hotel,"Un hotel muy bonito, excelentemente situado a dos cuadras de Oxford Circus. La habitación era muy buena, buena cama, buen baño. 
Lo único que no me gustó fue que para el servicio de desayuno por supuesto la bebida te la traen a la mesa y por lo genera la traían a los 15/20´de haberme sentado, por lo que ya estaba terminando mi comida cuando me traían el jugo y el té.
Y el día de mi partida pedí un taxi y que me ayudaran con las maletas y a los 15 min nadie se había dignado a hacer ninguna de las dos cosas por lo que tuve que salir yo misma pateando mis maletas y pedir uno de la calle. Me pareció poco atento.",4,2017,06,21
140,Excelente,"Fuimos a tomar el té. Excelente servicio, ricos sándwiches,  los mejores acons que he probado hasta ahora, hermosa vajilla. El salón es muy lindo, decorado con muy buen gusto, estilo tradicional. Muy recomendable",5,2017,06,18
140,Excelente ubicación!,"Muy lindo hotel con la magia europea q uno espera!
Lo mejor sin duda es la gran ubicación que tiene
El servicio súper y gran atención sobre todo la gente de la entrada, Dass o Nass no recuerdo bien el nombre súper agradable, servicial y amable!
Las habitaciones son chicas, muy justas pero así es Europa en gral, colchón duro y almohadas muy bajas solo llamas y te traen almohadas más confortables, de memoria o antialergicas!
Estuvimos 1 día sin energía en todo el hotel y sin aire fue duro pero cosas q pueden suceder, nos mandaron una atención de frutas y bombones por lo orcurrido
Lo súper recomiendo

140,Me traje un buen recuerdo de Londres,"Estuve alojado dos días en este magnífico hotel en una visita de negocios. Me pareció de un nivel extraordinario por la calidad de las instalaciones. La entrada en el hall me pareció pequeña para lo que luego es su interior, elegancia y grandiosidad por doquier. Elegí una habitación interior para evitar el ruido de una calle con bastante tráfico. Está situado en El Centro de Londres con lo cual puedes desplazarte al corazón de la ciudad en los ratos libres de cualquier reunión. El desayuno perfecto con atención directa de la camarera. La habitación sin ninguna pega, bien decorada y cómoda. 
Un hotel perfecto para un viaje a la city.

140,Perfekter Aufenthalt,"Endlich mal wieder London! Für einen mehrtägigen, privaten Aufenthalt in London galt es ein zentral gelegenes, gutes Hotel zu finden. Nach meinen sehr guten Erfahrungen mit dem Langham anlässlich eines Geschäftsaufenthaltes in Hongkong habe ich mich für dieses Haus entschieden und es keine Sekunde bereut. Vom Empfang und Einchecken in der Club Lounge bis zur letzten Minute haben wir uns rundum wohl gefühlt. Das Personal ist ausnehmend freundlich und nimmt es in der grosszügigen Club Lounge mit dem ""free-flowing Champagne"" und jeglichen anderen Köstlichkeiten sehr genau. Da bleibt kein Glas halb leer und kein Wunsch unerfüllt. Alles ist sehr gepflegt. Das ""Hotel im Hotel"" hat seinen (Auf-)Preis aber der ist diesen wert. Wir hatten das Glück, dass die Lounge gut aber nicht zu gut gebucht war und so verflogen die Stunden zwischen Museen, Ausflügen und Shoppingtrips nur so mit guten Gesprächen in bester Umgebung. Die Executive Rooms sind klassisch gehalten und für Londoner Verhältnisse angenehm gross. Die Lage in Gehdistanz zum Oxford Circus und Regent Street. Wird sicher nicht das letzte mal  im Langham zu Gast gewesen.",5,2017,04,26

140,Fantastico!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo meraviglioso Hotel, elegante, perfetto in posizione centrale da cui si raggiungono le principali vie dello shopping in 10 minuti (New Bond Street, Mount Street). Estrema professionalità da parte di tutto il personale( molti sono italiani), le camere silenziose e dotate di tutti i confort:accappatoi, pantofole, bollitore, macchina espresso, bottigliette d'acqua, servizio notte. Letti comodissimi!. L'unica nota stonata è la vista delle camere che guardano verso la Cavendish PL il cortile è poco curato e si può migliorare.Ottima la colazione servita al tavolo presso Roux at the Landau. Lo consigliamo a tutti coloro che hanno buon gusto e noi ci ritorneremo nel prossimo viaggio a Londra.    cosimo panico",5,2017,04,01
