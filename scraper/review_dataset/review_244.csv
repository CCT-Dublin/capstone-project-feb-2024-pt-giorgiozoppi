244,Lovely hotel in lively area,Lovely hotel in lively area. The decor is elegant and cozy. We loved having a cocktail in the afternoon in the lounge. We also enjoyed the breakfast. We booked our room on the hotel website and we were upgraded! Such a nice surprise. We will definitely stay at The Fleet on our next visit to Dublin.,5,2024,10,15
244,Wonderful stay in The Fleet,"Highly recommend this hotel. This has been my fourth stay in this lovely hotel and will not be the last. The location is perfect for exploring Dublin whether you are there for a concert, shopping, a night away or to see the sites. The staff are nothing short of amazing and could not do enough for us, the lovely food, the relaxing bar and fabulous cocktails. The room was great, and the bed was so comfy, all the amenities that you need.",5,2024,10,14
244,Fabulous ladies weekend away,"We had a ladies weekend away and we stayed in the fleet hotel, it was the best choice we had made üòç from check in ,  , to lunch and just relaxing in the beautiful lobby (where we enjoyed a few cocktails in) üòç and a fabulous breakfast.  only minutes walk away from shops and tramline. Everyone was so lovely. 
We most certainly will be back üòç",5,2024,10,13
244,A room without a window! ,"The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We were in a room without a proper window!!! No comment! Be very careful when booking this place, the photos are great but in reality you can get a room without any oxygen, once when you manage to open a little window the only sound you can hear is the sound of air conditioners, which are used who knows for what! This was a disaster! 
The stuff is excellent!",1,2024,10,12
244,Highly Recommended,"Excellent hotel in a terrific location!  

The service orientation of the staff is wonderful. Ebube was accommodating, he facilitated an early check-in after I had travelled all night.  

Great breakfast, the two servers were very friendly and responsive.",5,2024,10,08
244,I saw a lot of my room during my stay.,"The Hotel has an ideal location. Grocery store across the street and nearby is Trinity College and Temple Bar. The Staff was welcoming. This was my first visit to Dublin. Unfortunately, I fell ill during my trip and spent most of my time in my room. I want to come back and when I do, I plan on staying there again.",5,2024,10,07
244,Amazing,Amazing hotel and great people. The room is perfect. The ambience of the reception is very classy and the staff do an excellent job... New first choice hotel for us whenever we are staying in Dublin... Which is quite often ;-) the central location is also very convenient.,5,2024,10,06
244,Best service from one person senan,"Senan is THE man, makes unreal cocktails, talented service, if this man is not bar manager, he SHOULD be !!!!! Shutout to senan well done!! 
Also the layout and lights of the pub are exquisite, would definitely visit again, thank you to the fleet in",5,2024,10,05
244,Exceptional Service and Wonderful Atmosphere,Quaint little hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Exquisite furnishings and beautiful rooms.  Cozy beds with well appointed rooms. Everything you need for your stay at your fingertips.  Exceptional food had at the bar downstairs.  The seafood chowder was delicious and the Eton Mess was our favorite dessert of the entire trip.  I wish we could have stayed here longer.  We had to leave early before breakfast so I don‚Äôt have any opinions on the buffet offered.  Grand hotel that offered us everything we could possibly need.,5,2024,10,04
244,Wonderful boutique hotel & best location,"Superb location, attentive staff, excellent food & bar, I could go on and on!! Absolutely gorgeous restored hotel. Our room size was generous with a seating area and king bed, lovely coffee station, large closet. The heated floors in the bathroom were wonderful! Breakfast buffet in the restaurant is a good value when you pre-purchase at check-in! We loved being able to walk to all the Dublin sights we wanted to see.",5,2024,10,01
244,Good hotel for the money and the breakfast was worth it,"The room was a bit snug but perfectly clean and the mattress was pretty good. The staff was pleasant and accommodating and the breakfast was excellent. 
Be careful when you visit and really check the schedule. Apparently, there was a cultural weekend of some sorts and it turned the whole district into a thumping party scene that was impossible to navigate in the evenings. 
Fortunately, our room was tucked away and saved from any unnecessary noise which was great. But my advice is to just plan accordingly",4,2024,10,01
244,Comfortable and friendly and so well located.,"Lovely stay, before and after our roadtrip.  Elegance rooms are comfortable and of good size. 
Lobby is welcoming and a great place to meet and have a drink.  
Breakfasts were great where Cecilia was particularly welcoming with a warm smile every morning.  Also Felipe and Lorenzo. 
Enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,09,30
244,"Fantastic location and great lobby, awful service.","Fantastic location and lobby, rough level of service. 

I think a lot of this can be chalked up to miscommunication, but it‚Äôs been a few weeks and I‚Äôm still salty about how we were treated. We arrived early in the morning and were told to ‚Äúsit right down‚Äù because our room would be ready soon, or at least by noon. At noon I was told check in was at 4pm. It was a cluster. It was also a chilly day (48F) and we asked for our heaters to be turned on. Eventually they came with a space heater around 11pm. 

The lobby is cozy and gorgeous and the bar drinks are amazing. The rooms are tidy and the location is perfect. But the management and staff couldn‚Äôt care less. 

Save money and go to the nicer Morgan down the street.",2,2024,09,23
244,Overall the hotel is in a great location. Our room was not what we needed or expected.,"The building, lobby and reception area are very nice.  Our third floor room was not.  It was a very basic handicapped room (which we did not request or need).  The room was not air conditioned and only one window would open about 1/2"" inch.  There was very little water pressure for the shower.",3,2024,09,23
244,Tiny bedrooms,"Good location , nice bar and good breakfast (+ charge). BUT the double rooms were tiny. Not convinced the bed was a double. You get better rooms at Premier Inn or HE Express and the cost ¬£400 for 2 nights. So poor value for money and definitely not a 4* experience",2,2024,09,18
244,Perfect boutique hotel stay in the heart of Templar Bar,"We had a fabulous one night stay at the Fleet Street Hotel  the heart of Templar Bar.  This was a wonderful ‚Äúoasis of calmness‚Äù in the midst of the area‚Äôs shenanigans.  A very warm welcome on arrival, large, spacious rooms, and a delightful breakfast.  Wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2024,09,18
244,Please Reconsider Staying Here - Saftey of Guests Isn't A Priority,"Never again will we stay at this hotel .. especially as a woman. I felt extremely unsafe around the staff working overnight. An example .. used the lobby bathroom in the middle of the night. One employee (a man) followed me in, tried to open the stall door, left and come back in a few times. This went on for a good 20 - 30 minutes. I was afraid to come out. We told the staff the next morning and nobody cared enough to followup.
There are so many great places to stay in Dublin .. please choose one where the safety of guests is a top priority.",1,2024,09,12
244,Lovely hotel excellently located in the Temple Bar area. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and p,"Lovely hotel, super pleasant helpful staff.well equipped room spotlessly clean with modern hi-end bathroom, lovely shower, fluffy towels. Nice relaxed bar.
Breakfast was everything you wanted, with a pleasant comfortable breakfast room supervised by a very helpful and professional maitre d.
 Can't  wait for a return stay",5,2024,09,09
244,Convenient location to major sites in and around Temple Bar,"I picked this hotel specifically for my family due to its location to Temple Bar and a nearby bus stop for the airport bus. Check in took a while but we finally were given keys to 3 rooms. Although I booked a King bed for my wife and me, their King was actually a Queen sized bed. On our first stay, we were assigned room #252 on the second floor in a back building which required going up and down multiple stairs to reach it. Thankfully there were signs on the walls pointing us to the way back to reception. Apparently only the rooms in the newer section had a/c which was the reason I booked these specific rooms.  The bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. We didn‚Äôt turn on the TV as were out all day and just wanted to sleep. The breakfast buffet is excellent with a varied selection of breakfast items to suit most tastes. It was located in the basement area, decorated with light colors, with tables spread out around the area as were the many tables where breakfast items were offered. There were no lines of guests waiting to get what they wanted. There were two coffee machines and in another room were two computers for guest use. We returned a week later to stay again before flying home, that time in a different room. We enjoyed staying both times at the Fleet and would do so again should we travel this way again.",5,2024,09,08
244,A lovely boutique hotel,Great people and great place right in the heart of the city. Room was a little small but had everything we needed. Bar and lobby are lovely. At the end of Temple Bar but as soon you you come into the hotel is so quiet. Breakfast were fantastic. We booked direct with the hotel and the breakfast was included. Overall a perfect stay.,5,2024,09,08
244,A happy surprise in the Temple Bar area.,"The lobby is lovely, the Barman was fun and drinks were top rate. The offering of Irish whiskeys was impressive, and the bar also offered a cappuccino that was delicious. We ate in the restaurant and found it to be quietly elegant. The experience was all above our expectations!",5,2024,09,02
244,Excellent stay.,"The minute we arrived at the Fleet, I could feel we where in for a good stay.
The desk staff where super friendly. We where very lucky for an upgraded room for a start. Our room was very comfortable, very clean and quiet concidering its location.
The morning Breakfast is a real treat here as well. Spoilt for choice. 
We would love to come back here again.",5,2024,08,28
244,"OK stay, charming lobby and good location","The location is great and the lobby is charming. The bathrooms were nicely updated, but I wished there was lotion. Other toiletries were provided besides lotion. I did not check my room category carefully enough when booking. I assumed since the hotel was advertised to have AC that all rooms would have it. 

Unfortunately the category we booked did not have it. They do have windows that open and provide fans, so we did that. However the street noise from the alley makes it a bit difficult to sleep, even for someone like myself who is fine with city noise. One of our outlets didn‚Äôt work, either. 

It was a pretty cool few days while we were there but the room was still quite stuffy without the window opened so just bear that in mind. 

The reception staff was a bit unwelcoming. The three different people we encountered acted as though we were bothering them. This was offputting, especially at the rate we were paying. 

Location and lobby were great but the corridors were long with stairs and there is no help with luggage, so that was a challenge.

Overall I would stay here again if prices were lower and I booked a room with AC. I felt that what we paid was not worth the product we were getting and there are some other options in the area worth exploring.",3,2024,08,23
244,Great stay at this hotel,"Very well located hotel, close to all the sights of Central Dublin.
We were given a very comfortable hotel room, which was cleaned daily to a good standard..
 Excellent service provided by the front desk staff.
Lovely bar area for an evening drink.",5,2024,08,19
244,Disappointing and uncomfortable,"While the location is perfect for exploring, it can be loud if you need to open your window. Our room did not have AC, was the smallest we‚Äôve been in for the price, and the mattresses and pillows were the most uncomfortable we‚Äôd ever used. We left sore and exhausted from poor sleeps. I rarely review, and I hate to complain. There were no triple occupancy rooms available to make a switch for our second night. Very disappointing for the price.",2,2024,08,15
244,Dublin getaway,"Love this hotel . Have been a few times.
Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Great selection at breakfast . 
So central to everything . 
Only negative on this occasion was not getting our room until 16.30 .pm.
Even though they say guaranteed check in by 15.00 hrs .",4,2024,08,15
244,Best Choice for Dublin Temple Bar Hotel,"Our Elegance Double room was lovely and modern, very clean and had AC! The bed was comfortable with good pillows. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Gorgeous lobby and bar area. Easy walk to Temple Bar centre area, lots of restaurants close by. Also easy to walk to the Hop-on-Hop-off bus. Wonderful breakfast. Would definitely¬†stay here again!",5,2024,08,14
244,Excellent hotel,"The room was large, clean and provided a comfortable chair, large desk with chair and a queen bed.  Our view was of Westmoreland street however no traffic noise was heard.  There was a nespresso coffee machine with plenty of refills.  The bathroom provided a walk in shower and towel warmer.  There were even washcloths with are rare in Europe.  Our room included a very nice Irish breakfast buffet.  The location was excellent, within a short walk to Trinity College/Book of Kells, St Patrick's/Christ Church, Molly Malone statue and many many restaurants.  Tesco Express was across the street if a quick soda or snack needed.  The Bank of Ireland ATMs are also just down the street to obtain Euros if needed.  The photos in their ad are accurate.  The staff was helpful and friendly and I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.",5,2024,08,12
244,A Stay That Met Our Expectations,"I shared an Elegance double room with my teenage daughter. We had a very pleasant stay. The room was lovely spacious with an excellent view to Westmoreland Street ‚Äì yet the traffic didn‚Äôt disturb us at all as the windows had a double glazing (and we were at the top floor). The bathroom was very functional with a good shower etc. The air conditioning ‚Äì which was the reason why we‚Äôd booked the room in the Elegance category ‚Äì worked well, too, although at times a bit loudly. The room service was almost impeccable and so was the friendliness of the staff. The only hickup we had was with the afternoon tea booking but at the and that was solved well, too.",4,2024,08,08
244,Good location.,"Location is good and the breakfast is really good and the two main reasons we chose The Fleet. The rooms are cramped and both of our rooms had no AC which was tough in August. I wish I thought of this prior to booking because I would've asked for an a room with an air conditioner. Depending on the cost, of course. Being that there is no air-conditioning, you have to sleep with the windows open. The alleys outside are very loud so you don't get a good nights sleep.

I would consider staying here again if the air conditioning was an option at a reasonable price. Otherwise, I definitely would stay somewhere else with air-conditioning in the summer months.",4,2024,08,02
244,Classy hitel!,"Very nice, classy hotel in a great location in the centre of things.   We stayed at the beginning and end of our Irish trip, four nights total.  The seafood chowder in the restaurant is the best I‚Äôve ever had!  The beautiful foyer is perfect for a drink or just to relax.  Lovely experience all round, highly recommend The Fleet.",5,2024,07,30
244,First visit to Dublin,Very nice stay. Staff very helpful. Room very quiet and luxurious bathroom. Quite a long walk to room from lift but staff pleased to help with suitcases. Great breakfast - nice fresh and well cooked food. We enjoyed our stay very much. Reception lounge  and bar area is very comfortable and we used it to meet up with family staying nearby and nightcap drinks. Convenient location for nearby bars and restaurants and tourist attractions.,4,2024,07,25
244,"Fabulous Fleet Street‚ù§Ô∏è Summer, Miriam and Julie are a few of the staff who personally saw that I was enjoying my holiday","From Reception forward I was very happy with my stay. I look for historical properties in which to stay; this building is gorgeous. If there no molding, count me out! I can get that in America thank you. 
Staff was attentive and I am happy to say thanks again to Summer, Miriam and Julie‚ù§Ô∏èThe guys were great as well. Food is local so you can‚Äôt go wrong. Centrally located in Dublin to everything.",5,2024,07,25
244,Wonderful city centre stay,"Wonderful city centre stay! Room is modern and comfortable. Bathroom was newly decorated to a high standard. Welcoming staff and lavish reception area. Breakfast was in a bright space, with plans of choices to suit all. Will definitely be staying again",5,2024,07,21
244,Would stay again,"Rooms were clean and well-appointed. Great showers. Comfortable beds. Perfect location. We will stay here again when we return to Dublin.

Top notch service. The staff was extremely attentive and helpful. Ana at the front desk helped us check our bags and gave some good recommendsations. The manager and her staff member Yuri went above and beyond to assist us with picking up a package we forgot. Very grateful.",5,2024,07,18
244,Delightful hotel in a great location,Beautiful hotel within walking distance to many areas of interest. Our room was lovely and comfortable. The hotel staff were attentive and gracious and the breakfast buffet was delicious with great variety. We had someone who could not eat gluten and the staff made sure his needs were met. There was a lovely outdoor rooftop seating area. I would absolutely stay here again. Highly recommend.,5,2024,07,11
244,short stay in dublin very confortable,"the staff is very helpful and kind, the cleanliness is very good, and breakfest is nice and healthy. The location is the most central without disadvantage (quiet and facilities in the car park beside). The room are very confortable (room for disabled person).",5,2024,07,08
244,"detailed, Room without a view frosted","Tried to check in just before 15.00 (the time on the website for check-in) I was told the room was not ready and it's 15.00 up to 16.00 (meaning 16.00 is guaranteed) still not ready but I said I would try and move you to a room that is. Which I thought was fine was told i would be the same standard. Room was 450 so thought more chance of a quieter night. The lift only goes to the 3rd floor and was a bit of a walk from the lift, down some steps along a corridor then up some more steps then to the room. (It is 2 different buildings) It is very quiet at night the only downside was you couldn't see out of the window. The window and the smaller window that you opened like a cupboard door are both frosted glass for some reason. The room had plenty of storage, The Coffee machine's only thing was the placement of the cups and coffee and tea bags etc,  Where not next to it.  The room also had a safe handy for passports etc, and a good-sized shower with rain style and a mixer style but beware turn it to much one way and the other comes on. The extractor fan was on a timer which came on at 06.30 which if you had the bathroom door open would make the room cold. The room came with AC and a good-sized TV. Breakfast was plenty of choice, I found one of the coffee machines made a better coffee. All staff were friendly would also say the security at the door at night to make sure you are staying their also friendly the one that was there on Thursday night was willing to give ideas of where to go, Don't be put off from location due to noise a fellow traveller said they looked on to the street and was quiet too.",4,2024,07,06
244,Stylish but not celebrating history of the building,Beautiful entrance and bar but staff knew nothing about what it was before it was a Hotel: it was bewleys cafe est. in 1905. When this was pointed out to staff theyd zero interest. It‚Äôs trendy and boutique but lacks atmosphere as it doesn‚Äôt honour its history. This could be so much more with even 5% more effort in appreciating the beauty and history that is there. Rooms nice and clean.,4,2024,07,05
244,"Good from afar, but far from good!","Put Ireland on your bucket list. Three of us drove along the coasts of Ireland and Northern Ireland to play some of the finest golf courses in Europe. After undergoing knee surgery, one of us came just for the fun and skipped the golf.¬†The Irish people are welcoming, delightful, helpful, and a joy to engage in conversation. The country is stunning, and the cuisine delicious. Gone are the days of boiled gray meat and potatoes! The country is breathtakingly beautiful. (FYI -  Dublin traffic is horrible with lots of one-way streets and road construction, typical of large cities. If you‚Äôre driving, it will take you  longer than you anticipate, so plan accordingly.)

We ended our two+ weeks in Ireland in Dublin with several days at the Fleet Hotel. 

What Is Good -- 
     1. Convenient location. The Fleet is a solid choice¬†if your focus is¬†a hotel close to the fun in the Temple Bar district and walking distance to most Dublin attractions.¬†
     2. The lobby is beautifully decorated, warm and inviting. 

What‚Äôs Not So Good --
     1. Not every room has air conditioning, so if you're interested in having this feature, carefully check the website. Since the Elegance Double Rooms include air conditioning, we reserved two of them. 
     2. We did not experience the same hospitality and helpful nature throughout our travels in Ireland at the Fleet. Reviews of the staff we‚Äôve read were glowing, but for us, the staff was not up to par and communication was difficult. 
     3. When we pulled up in front of the hotel, there was no bellman to guide us, so we started unloading our luggage. What we thought was a bellman finally showed up. He was actually a security guard and he tells us we needed to reverse our car back down the one-way street and park on the opposite side. Keep in mind this was at night, and there were a ton of people walking in the street. One of us stayed with the luggage we were able to unload before having to move the car and got us checked in. Two of us headed to an offsite parking garage some distance away, a garage where the entrance and exit are in two different places. It‚Äôs so much fun trying to find your bearings when you‚Äôre unfamiliar with an area, do not have GPS, and your shlepping golf clubs. Not! 
     4. The rooms. We booked two Elegance Double Rooms. They are advertised as being larger and some have window shutters and fireplaces. We didn‚Äôt have any of these features. Our rooms were small and maneuvering around golf clubs and luggage was a challenge. The rooms felt as if they were converted attic space. The bedrooms only window is small and stares out upon ugly rooftops riddled with machinery. You would think the bathrooms of the Elegance Double Rooms would be comparable. They are not. One is large with a dressing table, ghost chair, soaking tub and a lovely separate shower. There is a tiny bathroom with only a shower in the other room. For the same price, this simply is not right. Perhaps we got the worst rooms because we arrived around 8:00p. BTW, keep in mind the European king bed is about the size of a queen. 

What Is Absolutely Horrible -- 
The elevator only goes to the third floor, even though our rooms are on the fourth. Not ideal, but you think it‚Äôs doable‚Äîthat is, until you have to walk to your room. Imagine this. We had two large sets of golf clubs in oversized golf travel bags the size of a human, three suitcases, three backpacks, a carry-on bag and a few shopping bags of purchases made along the way. There are numerous hallways and corridors to negotiate once you exit the third-floor elevator. Moreover, there are five flights of stairs‚Äîwell, technically four flights plus a short flight of three steps‚Äîthat go up to the rooms. There are multiple closed fire doors that need to be opened. Do you think anyone has a spare hand to open a door? Nope. This is not just a small annoyance. It is a disaster, especially so for our guy with the new knee. There is no mention of this on the Fleet Hotel website. If you‚Äôre a weight-lifting triathlete this might be just fine for you. If you‚Äôre like the rest of us, you‚Äôre going to need that air conditioning when you finally get to your room.

Bottom Line:
     1. While it‚Äôs probably not realistic for the Fleet Hotel to take on an extensive renovation project to remove the quirky maze of corridors and have elevators go to all floors, they most certainly can be forthcoming with these shortfalls and disclose them on their website,  they can improve their hospitality, have a greeter at the front door to offer assistance, streamline the check in procedure and educate the staff in customer service. 
     2. If all you want is a hotel located close to the fun in Temple Bar area, the Fleet Hotel will serve you well. If you expect customary hotel  service, an elevator that goes to your floor, and value for your dollar, look elsewhere.",2,2024,06,22
244,Midweek break,"Very central hotel, very clean. Staff really friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be coming back to this hotel. Rooms have everything you would need for your break away from home. Ate in the restaurant food very good. Breakfast was brilliant,  set you up for the day.",5,2024,06,20
244,Really enjoyable short stay! ,"Stayed at this very pleasant and relaxed hotel again recently for a concert nearby.

Had some drinks on arrival, then had some dinner at the bar. Both of which were very enjoyable. Went for breakfast the next morning, lots of healthy options, gluten free, freshly orfered poached eggs etc. Cannot fault a thing. 

Bedrooms are lovely and refurbished, esp the bathrooms. 

Every member of staff was extremely welcoming, helpful & pleasant. Thanks guys, you made our stay very enjoyable. See you soon. 

",5,2024,06,18
244,Nothing was too much trouble!,"The staff and service were excellent, the hotel was clean and tidy. Conveniently located in the centre of Dublin a short walk from the airport coach stops. Allowed to leave our baggage before check-in and and after check out was really very useful. Next trip to Dublin we will certainly stay at The Fleet!",5,2024,06,18
244,Service won out,"Beautiful old hotel in Temple Bar.  Lovely room and great breakfast, but the winner was the staff.  I was quite ill, having gotten a nasty flu.   Yuri, a wonderful staff member, leapt to my aid, went and got meds at the chemist for me and did it all with a smile.  Each and every person was thoughtful and caring and I will definitely return to this lovely and gracious old hotel.",5,2024,06,18
244,"Perfect location, lovely hotel.","We had a wonderful stay at The Fleet. The room was clean and spacious enough for all our luggage. Plus, the bed was super comfortable. The location of this hotel can't be beat - it's walking distance to everything you want to see in Dublin, plus many excellent pubs. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you're planning on enjoying the night life in Dublin.",5,2024,06,17
244,Perfect spot in fun Temple Bar,"I loved The Fleet Hotel and would stay again 100%. Located in the heart of Temple Bar, it‚Äôs an oasis of calm elegance inside. A beautiful lobby with a sparkling bar leads to clean and comfortable rooms upstairs. Nighttime security guard makes sure only guests enter but I encountered zero issues as a solo female traveler. Staff were super helpful. Most Dublin sites were walkable from the hotel. Temple Bar is pretty quiet after 11 pm so no noise issues during my stay. Oh and an outstanding breakfast in their downstairs restaurant!",5,2024,06,16
244,My new go to,"Best place to stay in Dublin . Stunning hotel so close to everything and really comfortable stay . I will go back to the Fleet because why change whats already perfect , this is definitely my go to hotel in Dublin now. When I find a place that‚Äôs got everything I go back because i like to know where I‚Äôm going .",5,2024,06,15
244,Highly Recommend - Gorgeous lobby & Location!,The Fleet Hotel was in great location with a gorgeous lobby & bar! Super great staff and concierge. Friendly and courteous. Assisted with any needs. Very secure with doorman and front doors locked by 1am. Lobby atmosphere was elegant in decor with cozy fireplace. WIFI worked great everywhere! Highly recommend!,5,2024,06,15
244,Probably wont return,"Hotel lobby was really beautiful, but the room was a huge let down.  The room was so small that you couldn‚Äôt open the bathroom door all the way because it hit the side of the double bed.  There was only room for one suitcase on a luggage rack, and no drawers or shelves to unpack your things. It might have sufficed space-wise for a single traveller, but was not suitable for two.  The biggest issue was that the room was dim and smelled really musty as there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any ventilation at all - no a/c, no fan, only a small window that you can lever open a few inches, but then you have to leave your drapes open to the light and hear everything outside. We left the window and drapes open  24/7 for the 5 days we were there and this helped quite a bit.  I sure wouldn‚Äôt want to stay during as warm spell, as I think the room might be unbearable. 
In contrast, the bathroom was very large, bright and modern, with a rainfall and conventional shower head. In my opinion, they should have saved a bit of money and square footage on the bathroom and worked on the main room a bit more. 
Location is right on the eastern edge of Temple Bar which makes it really central to the sites, transit, tour bus departures, etc, but was a bit less enjoyable for us in the evenings and early mornings when many roads and alleys smelled strongly like urine and the odd partier left their stomach contents on the sidewalk.  Most businesses seemed to spray down their building and walkways in the mornings, so they are doing all they can.  This is no reflection on the hotel whatsoever, but potential guests should know it is in a bit of a wild area.  It was our first visit to Dublin, so that‚Äôs on us. 
One further note - for anyone who might have mobility issues, the hotel has an elevator, but once on your floor, the corridors are full of multiple short sets of stairs up and down which might make things challenging.",3,2024,06,11
244,"Super location, clean, friendly staff, great breakfast, close to many attractions and transport.","Great location on the edge of bustling Temple Bar, which can be avoided if it‚Äôs not your thing. Right next door to one of the best pints of Guinness in the city at The Palace Bar. Close to many Dublin attractions, short walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street and public transport. The lobby is beautiful, stunning stained glass windows and a cozy bar for a nightcap. The room was spotless, really nice bathroom, it had everything you need. Breakfast A+ and so was the coffee. The staff were very helpful and couldn‚Äôt be more friendly. I spent four nights here and overall I‚Äôd rate this hotel very highly",5,2024,06,06

244,Celebrating the Mini Marathon ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,We spent he afternoon in the fleet hotel rooftop after the mini marathon the staff were incredible so attentive and friendly nothing was too much trouble the food (I had the platter) and cocktails were the perfect way to end the best the day ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,2024,06,06
244,Not for families.,"Not for families.   The room was tiny and had no air conditioning.  We had to open window, but the noise from the alley kept us up all night.   The walk to the room required a lift, down a hall, down stairs, down another hall and then upstairs again.  Not fun with luggage.",3,2024,06,05
244,A great day spent in the terrace!,"Keenan was an amazing host to myself and a group of friends after completing the VHI mini marathon. We were welcomed on to the beautiful rooftop terrace with prosecco and cocktails, followed by delicious food from the Cafe 1920 menu. It was a brilliant day from start for finish. Would recommend a trip to anyone in the temple bar area for food and drinks.",5,2024,06,05
244,"Perfect hotel, perfect location, lovely staff & you will not find better in the centre of Dublin!","Absolutely stunning hotel, bed was so comfortable and pillows too! (It's made my bed at home feel terrible) 
Gorgeous breakfast, lovely friendly staff and the most beautiful room I could have asked for. The hotel is right on the main street so do expect a little noise (but after all you are I'm the busiest part of Dublin) 
Honestly I cannot wait to come back and stay again! It will be my third time next time and I honestly can't wait!",5,2024,06,05
244,Great hotel but noisy at night!,"This is my second stay in this hotel and it is a great hotel right in the heart of everything. The rooms are lovely and the lobby/bar area is gorgeous.
However, on this occasion our room looked out on to an alleyway and there was so much noise through the night from people fighting and taking drugs. Openly taking drugs which was there for anyone to observe. This went on every night 3 or 4 times per night from midnight until about 8am.  We appreciate the hotel can‚Äôt control what is going on outside but worth being aware of this.",4,2024,06,03
244,Great location and fabulous staff.,"We loved the location. It‚Äôs at the start of Temple Bar road, so out of the super touristy area. Our room was on the 3rd floor up and down several flights of stairs after the elevator ride, which we loved. Can be taxing with luggage! There are plenty of rooms near the elevator‚Äôs. The Palace Bar next door is great local bar with good drink prices.",5,2024,05,27
244,Outstanding staff and a lovely room,"Hi.
I just wanted to tell you what a great reception staff the fleet have! When I arrived on Friday, I was exhausted just coming in from an overnight flight from New York. I also lost my debit card on the flight and never recovered it. I had other cards with me but, just losing that card was stressful. Contacting the bank, locking the card etc. I was still at the airport two and a half hours after my flight had arrived. 
Finally I decided to just head to The Fleet and check in.
When I arrived I was welcomed into by¬† your hotel receptionists Ana and Izabela.
After what I had just gone through you couldn‚Äôt have asked for better smiling friendly faces. I gave my name and they proceeded to look up my reservation.¬†
It seems I had cancelled my reservation in error! I thought at first this was the climax of one of the worst travel days of my life.¬†
They both reassured me they would help me out. And they certainly did. They were able to get me a room despite the short notice (a lovely room at that) and assured me all would be alright. They were actually sorry the room wouldn‚Äôt be ready for a few hours. This was fine by me as I needed to stretch my legs after a 6.5 hour trip, and get a decent hot meal into me! They directed me where I could freshen up, and then held on to my bags while I stepped out.
Upon returning a few hours later they were happy to see that I was feeling better and gave me the keys to my room.
They both apologized for the confusion. I told them it was ME not THEM that was at fault for accidentally canceling the room. ¬†
Receptionists at a hotel are the face of the hotel. They are the first people customers have contact with. They both are a credit to your hotel! I just thought you‚Äôd like to know!¬†
(I‚Äôm sure a raise wouldn‚Äôt hurt either!
That‚Äôs me talking- not Ana or Izabela)

Thank you for hiring them,
Phil Connolly",5,2024,05,27
244,Ideal spot in city center,"Ideal location for visiting Dublin. Loved the local pubs nearby. Was so nice to have a grocery store across the street! Quiet and comfortable rooms. Easy to find for a first time visit to the city as well. Would definitely recommend. Had a restaurant and bar in the lobby - didn‚Äôt partake, but looked busy!",5,2024,05,24
244,Nice Gem in Temple Bar,"Great location. Easy to get taxis. Good walking area. Room was excellent.
Hotel staff were so nice and very helpful.
Shout out to Stephanie and Fernanda!
Breakfast was good, service was good. Only ate once at restaurant - good burger and salad - excellent service. Both bars had great drinks and service.
Finally, LGBTQ+ Friendly thank you.",5,2024,05,19
244,Couples stay in May 2024,"A lovely hotel in a great location. A great room (we stayed in the Elegance Double Room) with lovely views over Westmoreland Street and O'Connell Bridge. Breakfast was lovely - great choice of food, all high quality. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Overall, I would recommend and I would stay here again.",5,2024,05,14
244,Nice hotel and great location,Very nice and clean hotel lacated close to Trinity College. 24 hour concierge service. Alex and Patrick were very friendly and accomodating. Gettin from and to the airport was easy. This hotel made my stay in Dublin enjoyable and memmorable. Thank you,5,2024,05,13
244,"Full payment taken on check-in. Comfortable Room, tiny dark windows. City centre prices.","All hotels in central Dublin are eyewateringly expensive and you have to pay top dollar to get rooms as well appointed as this, this close to the centre of town. I paid ‚Ç¨471.50 for 2 nights and thought it was reasonably competitive.

Breakfast was ‚Ç¨26 per day on top, and instead I can recommend Joy Of Ch√° five minutes up the street for a less corporate breakfast with a wider menu and fresh cooked-to-order ingredients.

At this price, the upside is that the room was comfortable, well appointed and a good size. On the downside, the windows were tiny and dingy and faced out onto a dim interior shaft so there was not only no view but not much daylight coming in either. So despite the pleasant decor and decent electric lighting, the room was quite dim and oppressive in the daytime. 

In fairness this Is a luxury City Centre Hotel squeezed into a narrow city block, so it is what it is. If you want to stay bang in the middle of Dublin at this level of comfort, this is what you can expect for the money.  A room of the same size with bigger windows and more daylight would certainly have cost much more at any other hotel. 

ONE IMPORTANT WARNING: The Fleet is operated as a pay-as-you go hotel, like a Travelodge or Premier Inn. 

When checking in most four star hotels, guests can leave an open credit card payment - authorised for the full amount - which is then taken on departure. That way you have the option to pay cash on departure. Or (if travelling on business) for your host to come by and settle up during the course of your stay)

Not here. The check-in staff insisted payment for the full amount must be taken from my credit card immediately before they would give me a room. 

Service at The Fleet was polite, brisk and efficient. But relaxed, friendly and welcoming, it wasn't. The hotel staff were clearly under pressure - they had their orders and were working hard to follow them. Which was understandable enough. 

The odd smile and a bit of Dublin warmth wouldn't go down amiss though...",4,2024,05,11
244,two night stay.,"Great location for exploring Dublin. 
Adequate size twin room with all amenities. 
Lovley bar area down stair really made you feel you had stepped into another world from outside.
My only comment would be that windows do not keep out noise as bin men were noisy one of the mornings.",5,2024,05,08
244,The best stay in dublin,OH MY GOD THIS HOTEL WAS AMAZING! Decorated so cute and had a great restaurant and bar with amazing food! The room was so comfortable and cozy! The location of this hotel was the best! We walked to see all the major sites and were able to walk to Guinness and Jameson! I was so happy with this stay and would recommend it 10/10 to anyone going! The staff was amazingly friendly and answered all our questions. Stay here! You wont be disappointed üòç,5,2024,05,07
244,Great location.,"Visited for the  weekend. 
Room was clean and spacious. 
Bedding and  towels good.
Tea and  coffee  etc in room and this was replenished. 
Did not stay for breakfast. 
Nice  lounge  area. 
Hotel is in the heart of the activity and you can hear the noise from the  street in the room. 
Overall a pleasant stay close to all the  Dublin sights.",4,2024,04,28
244,Highly recommended,"Lovely hotel in the middle of the city centre, an absolute splendid experience with wonderful staff and a great breakfast. The rooms were nice and tidy and we really enjoyed our stay, which was much too brief. We shall come back soon. Thank you!",5,2024,04,28
244,Nice hotel would recommend,Beautiful hotel with the most comfortable beds. Not sure what room I had but free standing bat and bathroom size of a bedroom. Location excellent,4,2024,04,18
244,Great hotel plus location ,"Enjoyable stay close to all amenities ideal location for getting around Dublin. Hotel lovely lovely bar, decor. Room immaculate cleaned daily 10/10 to hotel cleaners.
Food great if having food plus plenty of nearby food restaurants, coffee shops. Stephanie receptionist lovely also Adam who was great. Definitely be back thankyou for a great stay Karen and G√©rard Byrne",4,2024,04,18
244,A gem of a hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"A super hotel in the heart of Temple Bar. The reception area is stunning and the rooms well equipped and very comfortable. Whilst staying here you will not realise how lively it is outside, our room was very quiet at the back of the hotel. The location is absolutely perfect for anyone visiting Dublin and wanting to be able to walk to some snacking bars / restaurants or sights that Dublin offer. Can‚Äôt fault it and the staff are amazing too!",5,2024,04,14
244,"Great for a ""girls getaway""","I visited The Fleet with my 2 sisters and my mom from Friday 5th of April. I live in Sligo but my family were visiting from the USA. We wanted a get-away girls weekend to celebrate my sisters birthday which was on Sunday 7th of April. 

The reservations staff were able to accommodate our request for a quad room (1x double bed and 2x single beds) so we could all be in the same room together. It was a bit of a tight squeeze but we didn't mind at all!

The beds were comfortable and the waterfall shower head in our en suit felt very luxurious. The staff even had a lovely plate of treats in the room for arrival to kick off the birthday celebrations as well.

The lobby and bar area is absolutely stunning! I was worried about the possibility of noise from the busy street outside but was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. There was security on the front door in the evenings as well which was comforting. My mom and I had a nightcap on one of the evenings by the fireplace before heading to sleep and it was so relaxing. 

The breakfast room was bright and modern, comfortable and spacious. The spread was really nice- standard full Irish breakfast as well as meats and cheeses, yogurts, fruit salad, cereals, etc. The coffee is self service but if you want tea, they'll bring it to your table. 

After the first night, we had requested our room to be serviced which was great and we all got fresh towels as well. I cant stand staying in a hotel that gives you small shower towels, but The Fleet has larger towels which was a nice surprise. 

We were able to leave our luggage at reception for a few hours after check out time so we could explore a bit more. Parking is off site at a nearby garage, but we were offered a discounted rate for parking as guests of the hotel.

A few things to note...  there is one lift that services the 3 accommodation floors. It is small and takes quite a bit of time to get from one floor to another. We found the corridors a little confusing to navigate at first as well. And our room was pretty warm and the window only opened slightly at the top.

Nothing that the hotel can control but the surrounding area at night is really busy, like crazy, crazy busy!! We expected this as its located in the heart of Temple Bar but there was some antisocial behaviour in the general area. We just took great care to keep our phone, wallets and bags close to us at all times. 

All in all, a wonderful spot, close to all the music, bars and shopping, helpful staff and a beautiful, luxurious interior!",4,2024,04,08
244,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"Stunningly beautiful and very sophisticated hotel. Even though it is right in the heart of Temple Bar, I found it very reasonably priced. All the staff are so professional and very friendly too. The breakfast is superb. The bed was really comfortable. I can not fault this hotel. Don't bother with AirBnB, travel in style!",5,2024,04,08
244,Recommended but be careful if you get upgraded!,"We liked most things about this hotel. The location is great right in the Center of town. Reception, the lounge the cafe and breakfast were all really nice. Drinks are pricy in the lounge and for that sort of money should come with a few crisps or nuts or olives. Having said that, the lounge is a peaceful comfortable haven compared to the nearby pubs which are often standing room only. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded. I‚Äôm not sure about that. Our room had zero view. We had to reach it up about twenty stairs. The lift stopped one floor below.",5,2024,04,08
244,Perfect weekend stay,"What a wonderful experience we had at The Fleet Hotel and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. The room was amazing, so spacious and the bed was very comfortable. From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a smile. Staff go above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Breakfast is exceptional and they offer such a variety. Cecilia working at breakfast is incredible with her friendliness and attention to detail. Thank you all so much and we will definitely be back again",5,2024,04,05
244,Lovely Boutique style Hotel,"Great location in the Temple Bar area, room was nicely set out and very comfortable.
Staff very attentive and welcoming as dropped bags off prior to check in 
Food in 1920 restraunt was great and so was the breakfast next morning even if bacon was a bit chewy 
All in would stay again as its a lovely hotel that would suit any type of visa from Buisness to romantic get away",5,2024,04,01
244,Great hotel ,"Was a very friendly hotel, all staff were very attentive, room very well appointed and clean, had dinner in the restaurant, I can recommend it!! Food of high quality and very tasty, the residents bar was just what was needed after a concert!
Buffet breakfast was of high quality and very enjoyable, all tastes catered for.
Beautiful building too!
If I have one negative it's not enough toilets to cater for a fairly large restaurant and bar, but that's minor.
Would highly recommend this beautiful hotel, wether for work or pleasure, you won't be disappointed!",5,2024,04,01
244,Excellent choice for exploring London,"We loved our stay in this comfortable, well-located hotel. The rooms were clean and comfortable; the staff was knowledgeable and kind; and the breakfast service set us up each morning for a great day. We had two rooms--one for the two adults; one for the two teens. While not connecting rooms, they were right near each other. This situation worked perfectly for us--and was still more affordable than similar accomodations where we would have all been in the same room.",5,2024,04,01
244,Another  great stay .New lobby is outstanding ,I have stayed at the hotel several times and it has always been a very enjoyable experience.On my most recent stay last week it was even better.The addition of the new ground floor lobby has really brought this hotel to another level.The spacious lobby is beautifully decorated and has a really nice seating area and bar.The staff as always were really friendly and helpful .We dined at the hotel restaurant ,5,2024,03,29
244,An beautiful oasis in a busy area,"Approaching the Fleet, I was a bit apprehensive, its in a side road of a very busy area. As soon as you open the door, you are transported to the beautiful bar and reception area, reminiscent of old Bewley's Tea Rooms. The hotel is lovely and considering the location,  very peaceful. We had a room at the side of the building, which was quiet. The staff are highly trained experts in the hospitality industry and struck the balance of friendly and professional,  well-done, The Fleet. Breakfast was ‚Ç¨20 and well worth it, in my opinion. The restaurant was also of a high standard and good value. 
The location is perfect for getting around Dublin and surrounding area or just pop next door for a literary pint in the Palace.
Thank you to all the staff, we loved The Fleet",5,2024,03,28
244,Mixed,"Nice staff.
The bed was great but too big for the room and left little space.
Location great for our stay. The wardrobe bar was fitted far too high to enable use of hangers. Very bad design. We stayed 2 nights but on both mornings staff knocked on door at 9am wanting to clean room. Not good.  
Would stay again thouh because of location.",3,2024,03,18
244,Great stay in the best street in Dublin,"The hotel was decorated  very well and keeping in with its heritage was sympathetic too. Rooms were spotlessly clean and all staff were very friendly. Loved the breakfast,in such a calm atmosphere. A stones throw away form all the action of Temple Bar pubs and restaurants.",5,2024,03,13
244,Good boutique hotel,"Overall, The Fleet is a good boutique hotel.  We stayed in the Elegant Double Room and it was spacious. We were on the 2nd floor and it was a bit of a maze with multiple stairs. We didn‚Äôt love the Temple Bar area (tourist area, packed bars, younger crowd), but the hotel was surprisingly quiet.",4,2024,03,07
244,Thank you Fleetü•∞,The most cozy hotel in Temple bar. The Elegance room was amazing full of rich history that was well maintained. The bathroom was gorgeous and the location convenient. Lovely and polite staff who are always helpful. Amazing breakfast as well! Thank you fleet for this experience.,5,2024,03,02
244,Fantastic Fleet,"We arrived in Dublin and went straight to the Fleet.  They held our luggage while we wandered before check in.  We also spent some time in their lovely parlor area while waiting.  Our room was just what weary travelers needed.  
Breakfast was delicious and the service couldn't have been better!  Can't wait for our next visit!",5,2024,03,01
244,Don't stay here,"Fleeced! Worse Hotel. Don't stay here.
Booked room a month ahead.  Get to hotel. They don't have the room we requested and I point the mistake. They proceed to ask for a new room payment and cancel our previous reservation.   Now they want more than 2x our original cost.  We are tired and have no option but to take it.  
Get to room to find window is broken and won't open.   We were there 3 days and they never fixed it. 
Upon checkout the proceed to charge us for a crummy breakfast. Even though it was included in the initial reservation. Don't include breakfast, there are better options all over within walking distance for better price. 
STAY AWAY.",1,2024,03,01
244,Looks pretty but needs better service,"Check in was great and easy, and we had someone help up bring our many luggage to our rooms. The stay was ok. Could have used more amenities like a fridge, water bottles, and hair dryer. Our room was not consistently cleaned every day. We had to call the reception to have someone come and pick up our trash. Check out wasn't great. We had to leave really early in the morning and so asked for a wake up call and requested a taxi at a certain time. The wake up call never happened and called down to remind about the taxi. Since we had a lot of luggage (suitcases, backpack, car seats, stoller) we asked for assistance bringing our luggage down. They never came and we brought everything down ourselves while wrangling 2 kids. The taxi was apparently there but left because we took too long (they literally waited 5 min before leaving). We could've been down in time if we had some help.",2,2024,02,27
244,Great 3 night stay,"We spent three nights at the Fleet, the hotel has a lovely atmosphere, the reception area is beautiful and relaxing, always warm too which is great in chilly February.  Our room was clean and decor was nice, shower had good pressure and we were facing a busy road but heard little noise. (based on the third floor)  The only point we would raise, it was quite a way with luggage with our room, lots of stairs, would have been nice to be offered a hand on arrival. 
Breakfast was fabulous, possible it was the best we have had in terms of service and foods being fresh and warm. I think the staff really make the hotel a good choice, if we were to return we would stay again.",5,2024,02,26
244,Brilliant base for Dublin,"We chose the fleet as our base on a weekend away to celebrate our friends 50th. We were a group of 12 couples in total and arrived at about 11.30. One of our rooms was ready which enabled a bunch of people to pop their bags in there (though others used baggage storage with reception which was nice and efficient).
Before heading out into Temple Bar we had a drink in the lounge, which is stunning. I can recommend the baileys coffee, it‚Äôs delicious.
Our room was towards the back of the hotel and lovely and quiet. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well equipped. Bathrooms too are spacious with good toiletries and a strong shower. Rooms are serviced daily and everything is replenished.
We didn‚Äôt have breakfast at the hotel though a couple of our party did and said it was delicious.
The staff are friendly and incredibly helpful.
It‚Äôll be our go to sip next time we‚Äôre in Dublin for sure.",5,2024,02,18
244,Perfect choice,"I stayed at this hotel last year, so was happy to stay again and recommend it to some friends. They were every bit as happy as I am . This hotel is an excellent choice for a stay in Dublin. The rooms are comfortable,and extremely clean, the breakfast is excellent, and the staff are all so friendly, the location is at the quieter end of temple bar, walking distance of the shops,and many attractions. I will return and highly rate the Fleet",5,2024,02,15
244,an oasis of calm,"when we booked a city central location, right in temple bar, we had not expected it to be so calm and peaceful
after a hectic day in the hustle and bustle of the city, walking through the doors of the fleet was like having a weight lifted
we only wish we'd had more time to relax in the lounge so we will have to return",5,2024,02,08
244,Amazing stay,"Amazing hotel, could not fault it! 

Staff were attentive, breakfast was beautiful with a great range. The bar/reception area was decorated beautifully with a lovely, chilled atmosphere. The rooms, again, decorated beautifully with nice complimentary touches and comfortable beds/bedding. 

We arrived on an early flight and majority of our rooms were ready on arrival, with a complimentary upgrade too! 

Location right within temple bar area was perfect for us, outside the hotel was buzzing but inside the building, no noise could be heard! 

We will definitely be back!",5,2024,02,07
244,Ok,"Average.
Some good points: the breakfast, the bed, the reception area with cheminees.
Bad points: the durty linens not changed, the receptionist who doesn‚Äôt know the tour advertised at the reception in front of him.  
The room was classic, the hotel too.",3,2024,02,04
244,"Beautiful, Comfortable hotel in Temple Bar area","I had a wonderful week at the Fleet Street Hotel.  The lobby is stunning and was decorated beautifully for Christmas.  The staff was lovely and I was able to check in as soon as I arrived from a red eye from NYC.  My room (Deluxe Double) was very spacious, including an closet, safe, space for my suitcase, nespresso machine, desk, and sitting area.  The bathroom had ample counter space for my toiletries and there were no issues with water splashing out the shower as I often find in European hotels.  The bed was so comfy and the room temperature was great.  

Other Pros and Cons:
Pros
- when I checked out, the front desk called me a taxi for the airport that came almost immediately
- very central location at the edge of the Temple bar neighborhood. There is a supermarket and starbucks across the street.  
- The bar offers a nice variety of well made cocktails
- Generally lovely staff who happily replenished water bottles & nespresso pods upon request. 

Cons
- Breakfast is okay, I wouldn't pay for it with the reservation but a nice option
- As with any city hotel it is a bit noisy outside at night, particularly since the area is full of pubs.  As a New Yorker it did not really bother me 
- The bar can get a bit busy which slows down the 1-2 servers, and closes at 11PM",5,2024,02,01
244,5* you won't be disappointed,"This Hotel is an absolute 5* . From the moment we walked in the door, the atmosphere was great. The receptionist was a lovely,  pleasant, welcoming, gentleman. We were upgraded to the Castle Room and upon entering the room my sister was met with a beautiful birthday plate. The room was 5*, from the decor,to the big comfortable bed, and large TV . Despite being on Temple Bar there was no noise , thanks to great windows. The tea/coffee are was perfect. A proper coffee machine. Good size mugs, unlike the tiny cups some hotels provide. Good size safe provided and a hairdryer.  Full length mirror,very important to us women. Great lighting.  Bathroom was beautiful, everything provided in the shower, so no need for shampoo,conditioner or shower gel. Under floor heating in the bathroom was so welcoming.  I have only one complaint about the shower, it was not a power shower, the flow and pressure were painfully slow. This is an amazing hotel but a better shower definitely needed. We had dinner in the restaurant and the service, the food and the atmosphere were all outstanding.  Walking into the breakfast room the next morning,  WOW the decor is like none I have seen before.  It was very homely, the colours just so relaxing. The service from when we walked in the door was outstanding.  My sister throughly enjoyed her breakfast as she had plenty choice. I been Vegan could only have beans, mushrooms, hash browns and dry toast as no Vegan Butter. This is  a fault at every hotel I stay in. Just a little tip. You provide Flora Butter. At home I use Flora Butter as they do a Plant based one too. Something to look into. And there are so many choices out there for Vegans for breakfasts and dinner. I only had one choice at dinner , however it tasted amazing, there was no desert choice for me at all, so my sister ate her desert alone. again plenty choices out there these days.  Vegan carrot cake being a favourite  of mine. In the room there were a few books to read,which I did and sat in the chair with the beautiful reading lamp right above it. A lovely touch. Well done to this hotel ,we will be back.",5,2024,01,31
244,Lack of sleep,"Firstly I‚Äôll start with the positives 
The reception/lobby area is beautiful. The breakfast is great and the staff I encountered especially at breakfast are really great

I have just returned from Dublin after staying at the hotel for 2 nights alone
The first room I was in wasn‚Äôt the nicest room I‚Äôve ever stayed in, it was basic but it was ok. 
There are a set of double doors in the hallway outside this room so every single time someone walked past the doors would slam and wake me. The floor boards are also super creaky outside.
I was woken up around every half hour/every hour between the hours of midnight and 3am ish 
Then at 5.30am the fire alarm started going off. Then it went off again at 6.15 ish. 
It was a false alarm i find out both times from people in the hallway and calling reception the second time 

The whole night of my stay I felt so vulnerable being alone. Hearing people so loudly outside my room and then not knowing if I needed to leave the building wasn‚Äôt a nice feeling. Probably had 2 hours broken sleep if that all evening 

I complained the next morning as I just couldn‚Äôt face another night without sleep so the lady on reception agreed to moved me
She apologised for the fire alarm said it was a guests fault and didn‚Äôt have a lot to say about the door noise outside my room
I was then moved to a shoebox which was outdated and absolutely tiny 
I had thought that perhaps as there were still rooms available that second evening, they maybe would have felt sorry for me and my lack of sleep situation the night before and put me in a nicer room but nope I was in a worse 
one which was so disappointing. 
In hindsight I should have asked for a refund and just left 
It was quieter at least and I managed some sleep 

The rest of my family stayed in the Morgan down the road which is the same price and the rooms are fantastic big spacious and modern",2,2024,01,29
244,Marvellous Hotel,"Fabulous hotel, great comfort, food and service. Very agreeable and accommodating staff, lovely decor, great beds, beautiful bathrooms and everything I needed in my room. Had a wonderful stay. Will definitely stay here again.  Also the location was so convenient for temple bar and grafton street.",5,2024,01,24
244,Great Experience,"Great hotel - charming and great location. Beautiful inside and clean modern rooms. Very comfortable beds, and super lobby lounge area. Great breakfast as well. There is a supermarket across the street and it is right in a great area for walking around and shopping.",5,2024,01,18
244,A gem of a hotel in the best location!,"Great location, with a very nice lobby sitting area. The restaurant and front bar are very comfortable with good friendly staff. I would highly recommend the Fleet as a great place to stay, good value and so close to the City centre.",5,2024,01,15
244,Great location to explore Dublin from!,"Perfect location for walking around Dublin, really lovely downstairs bar! Only downside was in our bedroom, 352, we were behind the Palace bar and the windows had shutters but no curtains so lots of light still came in. Overall fantastic stay though and spotlessly clean, the cleaners even came back in the afternoon to clean one day as put the sign on the door for a lay in! Would stay here again.",4,2024,01,15
244,Great hotel in a great location,"I‚Äôve stayed at this hotel a few times over the years. I‚Äôm especially impressed with the renovation they did a few years back making proper usage of the main floor (used to have to go up to the first floor for reception).

The reception, lobby, and bar area is setup quite prestigious and depending on the room type the rooms are quite elegant as well. Everyone in the hotel comes across as super professional and easy to approach; in fact, I randomly ran into one of the employees (off-duty) around town and had a quick chit-chat.

The breakfast room serves a great traditional Irish Breakfast which is a great start to any day. 

Location wise it‚Äôs really well located at the tail end of Temple Bar thus depending on room placement can get a little noisy but aside from one stay nothing very disruptive and most of the major sights around Dublin are easily walkable from the hotel.

The only thing I thought was a bit odd was that you‚Äôre unable to charge expenses from the hotel bar to your room (this was previously an option). Apparently, they had an incident where someone charged some expenses to someone else‚Äôs room and ultimately decided to end the practice. Not a deal killer my any means, just a subtle inconvenience.",5,2024,01,06
244,Good hotel let down by area,"Decent hotel smack bang in the throng of Temple Bar.  Easy access to Dublins key attractions, restaurants and bars.  Good that hotel bar prices are similar to the pubs.  Polite and respectful staff, although one or two were particularly slow moving.

Hotel severely let down by being surrounded by overt presence of organised begging and drugs trading in doorways etc.  Annoying that every time you exit hotel you expect to be approached by beggars. Garda really need to sort that out rather than seeming to ignore it.",4,2024,01,05
244,Nice upscale hotel decorated for Christmas,"We were very happy with our choice to stay at the fleet hotel. It‚Äôs very centrally located to all the action in Dublin and is in walking distance to temple bar and everything else in the city. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the little bar was cute and the bartender quite friendly check in was pretty easy and the front desk staff was friendly. The card keys were a bit annoying with two of our keycard that stopped functioning during our 3 night stay that needed to be reset to work properly again. It was a bit of a maze to get to our room with little stairs going up and down every which way. It was pretty quirky to say the least. We had a deluxe room that seemed to be sequestered in the back of the building somewhere, and we didn‚Äôt hear at street noise or bar noises at all. Our bedroom was unexpectedly quite small and had very little room to move and relax and was especially cramped with our luggage. Bed was comfortable though. The bathroom itself I believe was actually bigger than our living/bed area and was huge! The walk in shower was nice and the separate bathtub was really a godsend after a long day or walking around in the wintery Dublin weather. Sadly no products for the bath were provided which would‚Äôve been really nice. The shampoo and conditioner smells were nice but creamy Lilic was a bit of an odd choice for one of the scents. We did order room service on one of the nights and the staff seemed to be confused as to what was actually available to order and didn‚Äôt have the items that were listed on the room service menu in the room binder. The food itself wasn‚Äôt great and there didn‚Äôt seem to be any options for drinks on the room service menu which was a bummer. I was just expecting better from a hotel of this quality and price. Thankfully there is a grocery store right next to the hotel so we could get extra water and such. Overall was a very nice place and would stay again.",4,2023,12,30
244,The Fleet Hotel,"The positive: 
The staff is great, super polite, always willing to go that extra yard.
The hotel itself is positioned right in the middle of everything. Temple bar and all the other areas are a walk away. Transit (bus or DART) are either around the corner or down the street. 
The rooms are clean, and spacious. Our room had a queen size bed, our room description said king size bed, it was an American double. My wife and I are not big people, so it was fine, but if you are larger you should be concerned about that. The beds are good quality, nice and comfortable, the linens and bed sheets are great quality as well 
There is a bar in the lobby, they make great Irish Coffee‚Äôs. Perfect balance of whiskey and coffee. 
The Not So Positives:
The elevator needs to be upgraded, it takes forever to arrive, and when it does, it can barely fit you and luggage. My wife and I simply walked the stairs to avoid the elevator. 
Morning breakfast consisted of the standard Irish fare, and everyday the same. We did breakfast just one morning, but the rest of the time, we just ate out, or skipped breakfast entirely and just had lunch. 
Television, now I understand you are not here to watch TV, but at some point in time, you want to relax, and that consist of watching TV. I am not sure if it‚Äôs Ireland or the hotel, but the channel selection is terrible. Absolutely nothing of quality to watch. Bring a tablet with Netflix and that should cover you. 
For the hotel, I would rate this a 8 out of 10.",4,2023,12,30
244,A nice Christmas stay,"Our stay in The Fleet was lovely and really pleased with everything. The location is amazing and even though the streets are quite noisy, we slept well and weren‚Äôt disturbed by any of it. The staff was nice and the breakfast was good. The beds and the room was comfortable. The only thing negative was that the shower didn‚Äôt have a shower head, only a ‚Äúrain shower‚Äù which is not great if you just want to was off make up and not your hair. Also there wasn‚Äôt a shelf or anywhere to have your toilettery bottles in the shower. Apart from this, everything was perfect.",5,2023,12,26
244,A Gem of a Hotel,"First time staying here and will not be our last!
An oasis of old school style and luxury in a perfect location.
The hotel lobby and bar areas are opulent and comfortable.
Room was excellent and there was not a sound from the busy streets outside.
",5,2023,12,20
244,Excellent hotel for a city break ,"Lovely hotel, excellent location.
Stayed 2 nights for a city break, the hotel is great and customer service is excellent. Plenty of choice at breakfast and loved the open fires in the lobby/lounge area.
The hotel is exceptionally clean and has lovely decor. 
A little noisy outside the first night but fine on the second night. I believe the inside rooms are quieter. Overall highly recommend.",5,2023,12,17
244,Amazing stay in Dublin ,"Just returned from a Christmas Shopping trip in Dublin with my sister. The location is excellent, right in the centre of everything! But very quiet considering it‚Äôs in Templebar. Our room was a good size, beds were comfortable, good tv and amazing shower. The bar was beautiful, we loved the Christmas decor and it was very cosy with the open fire. The breakfast was delicious, lots of choice, we really enjoyed our stay.
However, what has made the hotel stand out as exceptional to us is the staff/management. We stored our bags at the hotel whilst we were shopping and collected them around 5pm on our way to the station. When we arrived at the station we realised we had left a bag behind at the hotel. We didn‚Äôt have time to return to the hotel and get back in time for our train. I phoned the hotel and they confirmed the bag was there, and agreed to put the bag in a taxi and send it to the station for me. The taxi arrived just before our train was leaving and the hotel called me to let me know the driver was there so I didn‚Äôt miss him. The bag contained gifts for my 7yr old daughter and I would have been so upset if I had to leave the bag behind me to catch my train, but thanks to the quick response and helpfulness from the staff at the hotel, even on a busy Friday evening, I was reunited with my bag just in time and I will now have one extremely happy 7 year old on Christmas Day. Thank you so much. We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Dublin. ",5,2023,12,16
244,Charming hotel with character,"Such a beautiful surprise when you walk through the entranceway: the decor and ambiance of the lobby and bar area is tranquil and inviting and such a contrast from the bustling street's.
We had two rooms, the elegance double and deluxe triple.
The elegance was on the 4th floor and it was clean, quiet and we appreciated the uniqueness and original features.  It was warm, though and the conditioning seemed to struggle to keep an ambient temperature, but as it was December, not a real problem.
The triple was on the 2nd floor, it was refurbished but was smaller than the photos shown of room, which is a little disappointing but adequate for two nights.
Breakfast was fantastic, a wonderful selection and quality.
The staff at breakfast and who worked behind the bar were all a credit to the hotel.
We ate in the restaurant one evening and again we were not disappointed by the food or service.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

The only negative is that without pre notification a 50 euro deposit was taken when we checked in, for each room, which we are now waiting to receive refunded in full.  ",5,2023,12,12
244,"Gorgeous hotel, great location, wonderful staff ","My sisters, aunts, cousins and I spend a weekend The Fleet Hotel at Christmas time every year to celebrate and remember the life of my mum. Every year the team look after us so well and make sure that each trip is one to remember fondly. Without exception, all team members are friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is wonderful for shopping and seeing the sights of Dublin. The highlight of each trip for us though is enjoying Afternoon Tea in their gorgeous, lobby. It‚Äôs hard to believe that just outside, around the corner is busy, bustling Dublin when we are sat in front of the fire and the twinkling Christmas tree. We highly recommend visiting the Fleet. ",5,2023,12,09
244,Superb location  so near Grafton street shopping where all the major brands are,"What can I say 
Greetings from. The doorman 
Security at night time 
We felt so safe here 
The breakfast is sublime you must try it 
We were. Lucky to meet the manager who was hands on and helping out at  meal times 
You don‚Äôt see that so much any more 
I think his name was John
So well done him
Room was cosy and quiet 
So central we shopped till we dropped
And slap bang in the middle of all the beautiful bars and restaurants in Temple Bar
We will be back 
Well done to John and his team.",5,2023,12,06
244,Not worth the money and not what the website shows! ,"The only part of the hotel that looks like the pictures online is the lobby. The arrival experience is great but other than that, nothing to write home about. The people at the front desk were not kind at all- something that was unusual as we had experienced nothing but EXCEPTIONAL service in all of our other stays throughout Ireland. The guestroom was dark and did not look at all like the pictures. It was cramped and it was extremely difficult to find your room. There were tons of hallways, sets of stairs, etc and in order for us to get to our room we had to take an elevator, 2 different sets of stairs, and 4 hallways. Let me tell you, I got lost more than once. While the location cannot be beat, I will not stay here again due to everything above. ",2,2023,12,06
244,Incredible stay,The hotel is incredible really nice vibe. The staff are really friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Although our cabby mentioned it‚Äôs a busy and lively the room was quiet.  Good location. ,5,2023,12,06
244,Mainly a positive review,"We had a mainly positive experience here . Good points were location , breakfast , friendly staff and beautiful bar area . Negatives for us were the room was cold and what seemed like a thin summer duvet, no food served after 9:30 which seems rather early for people staying in the hotel , we had change our room keys 3 times in the 2 days !",4,2023,12,03
244,Perfect couple of nights ,Such a lovely hotel! The location is perfect and overall the stay was really nice. All the staff we encountered were so lovely and provided amazing service. The room was lovely and spacious.. the beds were a little short for us but that was a very minor problem. Breakfast was also delicious. Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. ,5,2023,12,02
244,A mixed bag...,"I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. First the good:

- We enjoyed the location in Temple Bar.
- The lobby is pretty and very cozy.
- For the most part, the staff was helpful.

Now for the bad:
Overall, we did not like the hotel sleeping rooms.  They were rather ugly, the bath was very small, and the sleep quality was not good as the walls are VERY thin and the bed not terribly comfortable.  We heard LOTS of all noise from the hall.   

AND - if you are driving, I would avoid this hotel (and perhaps Temple Bar in general).  The hotel has an agreement with a garage across the street. The garage doubles as a home for unhoused people and is full of broken glass. I would AVOID.  Also, the hotel told us we would get 1/2 of parking.  THIS WAS NOT TRUE.  We showed the receipt to the hotel, and they did nothing to help, but just made excuses.  

On a better note, we happened to be staying in this hotel when the riot broke out and we felt very safe.  Hopefully, that won't happen on your trip, but the security in the hotel is very good.  ",3,2023,11,29
244,Home away from home ,Staff friendly and extremely accommodating. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The location is a perfect home base to explore all things Dublin. Make sure to see Darryl at the hotel bar for one of his unique and delicious cocktails. 12/10 would and will be staying again.,5,2023,11,28
244,"Very good location, very charming","I never found the room 119 on my own because the route is very badly signposted. Which is pretty unpleasant when you arrive at the hotel around midnight‚Ä¶
It was very cold in the room and I had trouble falling asleep because of that.
The bedding was good, the bathroom very good for une person, but I had take a cold shower because the hot shower handle was blocked.
Great breakfast.",3,2023,11,21
244,oldish,"To be honest the staff are amazing and ever so helpful!  We got upgraded but the aircon did not work the room was nothing special for the amount we paid so felt let down, downstairs was beautiful, food good we had breakfast,  I have stayed in cleaner rooms.",3,2023,11,18
244,Very good and well located hotel,"The hotel has a central location in Dublin, close to every interesting sight seeing and the DART station (easy to go to Howth and D√πn Laoghaire)
Big and clean room, efficient air conditioning system to heat the room, very good breakfast",4,2023,11,16
244,First time visiting Ireland,"Great location! Many attractions within walking distance.Temple Bar and many other bars/restaurants and stores within walking distance yet while inside the hotel, nice and quiet. Tesco ( small supermarket down the block- used it to pick up waters, snacks and wine). It was my daughter's 28th birthday and she had a surprise waiting inside the room-plate with slice of cake and cookies!!  Awesome! Extremely thoughtful!  The front desk employees were pleasant and helpful at providing area and tour information. The rooms were clean, soft mattress and pillows. The lobby with its two fireplaces made the main room warm and inviting. Coffee at the hotel was very good. I recommend this location. ",5,2023,11,15
244,Highly Recommended ,"It‚Äôs a beautiful antique hotel. All of the furnishings look to be from around the 16th century. It‚Äôs in a very convenient spot. 
When I walked to the Irish Dance Show, it was a comfortable walk. I had a problem with the keys not working in the elevator and the staff very kindly tried to help solve the problem. 
Thanks for a good visit. ",5,2023,11,08
244,Daylight robbery,"On arrival at Reception we were told we had to leave a ‚Ç¨50 deposit because, they said, some residents take breakfast without paying. I was told the money would not actually be taken so on this basis I agreed. On getting to my room, I discovered that ‚Ç¨50 had actually been debited to my card account. On check out the following day I asked for my money back but they refused and said it would go back onto my card in a few days ! They basically don't trust their customers but expect the customer to trust them - a disgraceful practice in my opinion for an already overpriced hotel. Still waiting for my money back as I write.",1,2023,11,03
244,The Fleet is the BEST,"In 3 weeks of travel this was the BEST hotel I stayed at.  Close to everything,  comfortable and quiet room and wonderful breakfast buffet. The ambience of the lounge/bar is beautiful. The dinner at their restaurant was 5 star. If you're going to Dublin,  stay at The Fleet,  it's awesome.  I  didn't want to leave.",5,2023,10,29
244,"Great hotel spotless, mind where you park your car","The staff were amazing, always greeting you and polite.  Breakfast was amazing especially the sausages.  The hotel was spotless clean and the rooms were lovely.  Could not fault the hotel itself.  The only thing that spoilt the trip was the recommendation by the hotel to use the Fleet street car park, on the last day we discovered our front car window smashed and all our belongings stolen.  We went back to report it to the hotel as we did not want others to suffer and were told its the car park we partner with.  So great hotel just don't park in the Fleet Street car park!!",5,2023,10,27
244,Comfortable and central but a bit small,Centrally located in the heart of Dublin. Short alk to most attractions.  Beautiful lounge area with lovely ambiance. Good restaurant. Rooms are comfortable and clean but a bit small. God breakfast. Helpful staff. ,4,2023,10,27
244,Beautiful clean and stylish hotel in prime location,"Lovely lobby as you enter, very tastefully and luxuriously decorated. Reception staff were very friendly and although my room was quite small, there was only one of me so it was fine. It was all scrupulously clean and well equipped. The location is excellent, at the very top if Temple Bar so giving you access to the bars and restaurants there (if you're minded to sit with other tourists) but walking distance from the many much better bars and restaurants further south. Convenient for the airport bus too which stops nearby. Would recommend as a good place to stay and reasonably priced for Dublin.

Only issue was their unusual practice of taking 50 Euro at check in and keeping it in their account before refunding it in 5-7 working days (!). It's normal to swipe a card and keep it open but strange to actually take the money and keep it for a week. When I asked the next morning to be refunded to the card I paid with the night before (normal practice and easy to do), the receptionist gave me an unconvincing reason why that wasn't possible. I know it's only 50 Euro but with 111 rooms, this means that with full occupancy, that's 5K they're banking every day and holding in a savings account. Just put a couple of Euro on the room rate!!!",4,2023,10,25
244,Fantastic Stay at The Fleet,"We spent two weeks abroad traveling and spent our time between many hotels along the way. The Fleet in Dublin was at the top of our list in terms of the wonderful hotels we experienced. The beautifully historic venue, wonderful restaurant, convenient location, great rooms, and wonderful service team made our stay fantastic. ",5,2023,10,22
244,"Fabulous hotel, location and service.","1920s vibe, good ambience, great bar, maze of staircases! Lots of character, might not be everyone's cup of tea but we loved it!  Upgraded to an elegance room on the fourth floor, meant the lift up to the third then stairs to the top, a few different flights to choose from meant each return to the hotel each night was a little adventure!  The bar area was great though not always manned, not a long wait for someone to attend to your drink though and the staff were super friendly and helpful.  Worth being friendly to receive the same response made for a great break.  Warm, cosy fires, good breakfasts and good cocktails.  Really enjoyed our trip to Dublin (from Holyhead) for a few nights at the Fleet Hotel, great choice of hotel and wouldn't have changed a thing. Excellent location, close to Temple Bar but on the outskirts so not noisy.     Just fabulous!",5,2023,10,18
244,Friendly & Professional Hotel Stay,"While attending a conference in Dublin City recently, I had the pleasure of staying overnight at The Fleet in Temple Bar. We arrived a little early in the day so the bedroom wasn‚Äôt quite ready to check in, but the friendly receptionist offered to store our luggage and when we arrived back later on that evening our bags were already in the bedroom. Both Bedroom & Bathroom were absolutely spotlessly clean! Nice modern hotel room, and I had a view overlooking Westmoreland Street. The room came with some nice amenities such as the Nespresso Coffee machine and a USB port beside the bed. 
We had some pre dinner drinks in the reception bar that evening, which was a great setting ahead of the night out, with beautiful ‚ÄúHarry Clarke‚Äù Stained Glass Windows and a wood fire burning, it really was cozy! 
We had a quick breakfast the next morning in the restaurant on the lower ground floor, this had a great selection of fresh pastries, smoothies and of course the Full Irish. The provision of the self serving coffee machine was great for a cappuccino or americano. Oh! And we received a really nice warm welcome and big smile from the breakfast team! 
All in all this was genuinely a five star experience, delivered by a fabulous and professional hotel team. 
Thank you all, and keep up the outstanding good work!",5,2023,10,13
244,A must for staying in Dublin,"The Fleet is my go to hotel for staying in Dublin and once again everything was top class. Central to everything you could want, warm and inviting atmosphere and the friendliest of staff (special shout to Darryl, Patrick and Kevin for the chats,laughs and keeping our glasses full) cocktails were 10/10 so we saw no need to venture further than lounge bar. Breakfast hit the spot and any staff we met were pleasant and professional. 

Counting down the days until my next stay! ",5,2023,10,12
244,Lots of stairs,"We stayed at the Fleet when we arrived in Dublin.  You can‚Äôt beat the location!  Just a short walk to the Temple bar, shops and restaurants.  They have a bar in the lobby with the best bartenders (we might have even gotten one to perform a little Irish dance with us after a few drinks).  There is also a bar next door which was lively and a lot of fun.  My only complaint is the rooms were a bit stuffy, and there were LOTS of stairs even after taking the elevator up to our floor.  But I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.",4,2023,10,09
244,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel all staff very helpful and friendly. We didn‚Äôt have breakfast so can‚Äôt comment on the food. Room was clean and modern with no complaints would definitely stay again.
Location is excellent for city centre and Templebar area.",5,2023,10,07
244,Our favorite place to stay ,"A beautiful hotel and excellent value for the money.  The location could not have been better and the staff was wonderful.  For a hotel breakfast it was truly amazing.  This was our first time in Ireland and we didn't really know where to stay.  When we arrived our driver said ohh that is a good spot it is like Bourbon's street in New Orleans.  Being from the big easy I was filled with dread.  Luckily they had never been to NOLA.  It is in the perfect spot and there is a lot going on at night but it is safe, clean and fun.  ",5,2023,10,02
244,Excellent hotel,"Really beautiful and historic hotel.  It has been remodelled recently to a very high standard, making it modern whilst still keeping the old world charm.  I stayed 3 nights and was meeting a family member in Dublin for a few days, so was on my own.  I had a slight issue with my first room, but reception quickly sorted it for me.  I hate complaining , but the woman at reception (who's name I didn't get) was so helpful , I really appreciated that.  Second room was at top of hotel and overlooked O'Connell street.   Good soundproofing and a really comfy bed made sure I slept well., I wasn't bothered by any noise.  But keep in mind you are in Temple Bar on a busy street, there will be noise.  The attached restaurant is very good, staff is friendly and a nice place for a quick lunch.  Was one of the few places I went into that didn't feel like a tourist trap.   Location was outstanding.  Loved this place and would go back. ",5,2023,09,30
244,Great hotel and staff ‚ÄºÔ∏è,"We stayed 5 nights at the end of September. The hotel is in a great location to access everything in Dublin. Our bedroom and bathroom were both a good size and had been modernized. We were on the Westmoreland side of the building and had no problem with noise. The staff were very accommodating. 
In the bar / restaurant Darryl and his team are fantastic - friendly and totally service oriented. The food is very good and and great value for a hotel in the center of a major city. 
Would definitely stay again. ",5,2023,09,30
244,Lovely Hotel in Perfect Location,"The Fleet has an elegant reception area where guests can order a drink or coffee from the bar.  The staff is efficient and  very accommodating.  The room was quite comfortable and although completely updated, it also retained the charm of an older building.  There is a restaurant, Cafe 1920, connected to hotel with good selections for lunch or dinner.  Finally, the location is perfect. The ultra-light""Lua"" train is directly across the street, buses are there and around the corner, and it is a brief walk to the Tara rail station for traveling to the surrounding coastal towns. We were able to walk to many of Dublin's attractions.  Highly recommend to any visitors who want a lovely place to stay right in the heart of the city. ",5,2023,09,25
244,Welcoming,"We stopped in for a drink and the bartenders Shane & Darryl were so welcoming, so friendly and hard-working, yet managed to multitask and answer all of our questions offering tidbits of culture and Dublin stories to enhance our visit. They are the perfect ambassadors of all things Ireland, their love and pride in  their country and workplace  emanates! . And of course they made a banyan Irish coffee. Highly recommend and we will be back!",5,2023,09,24
244,Disappointing,"This was supposed to be a special last day of our Irish tour and it was big let down. Paying 300 euros for one night with dinner we expected a bit better service from a hotel which claims to be special.  We arrived at about 4 - hugely impressed with the lobby area - and were given room 12.  Room 12 was hot, noisy and stunk of fried food because it faced inwards and was over the kitchen with a massive flume outside the frosted windows which, when  opened let in even more stink and noise. Straight back downstairs and we were eventually were given another room which was bigger and brighter - with no smell. The welcome drink on arrival was two vouchers - for different drinks and when we both ordered the same drink it was a problem - which meant a trip back to reception to put right - eventually (not a luxury experience!).  The meal in the bistro restaurant was a disaster - no wonder it was empty at 8.30 in the centre of Dublin!   Very small and slow lift. Good location and looks great but needs to take a look at its customer service. ",2,2023,09,14
244,Lovely Hotel in a Busy Area,"Loved staying in this crowded, noisy area. Close to train, bus, river and easy walk to most major sites. I am NOT very sensitive to noise and we actually slept w windows open but the windows were double sash and seemed pretty good at keeping the room quiet if needed. 

Frederico made us feel welcome and helped solve an issue we had. Never had to wait at reception. Good security. Great bed and pillows. Very nice cozy lobby, and also a terrace on 3rd floor.

Breakfast staff did an amazing job of keeping the room neat and restocking items. They fried eggs to order... much appreciated. 

Negatives were the 1 slow elevator, & long walk w confusing stairs to 4th floor room .

We really did enjoy our stay here.",4,2023,09,13
244,Lovely lodging in The Fair City!,"Excellent location if  you want to be in Temple Bar, at what seems to be the less crowded end. The hotel itself is decorated beautifully. The hotel staff were all very welcoming and helpful. The service in the bars, the dining area, and the breakfast room is impeccable. We opted to include breakfast with our reservation and it was well worth it: buffet service that offers a delicious variety to suit everyone's preferences, from yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals, granola to baked goods to full Irish breakfast. THREE THINGS TO CONSIDER: FIRST - being an older building, there are stairs in the hallways, especially on the second floor. The hotel does have elevators/lifts but within some of the hallways there are stairs. The staff helps with luggage if needed. SECOND - being an older building, there is no a/c in the rooms. (Dublin's summer weather is usually cool so heat usually isn't a problem.) The transom windows do provide fresh air and each room has a fan, but you might have to contend with street noise if your window is open. THIRD- being an older building, the rooms are small. Very nicely furnished and extremely clean, but small. We use carry on luggage and there's only room for two open carry-ons in the rooms we had. But knowing all that, I would still rate The Fleet as a great property!",5,2023,09,10
244,"Excellent location, friendly staff",The Fleet Hotel is in an excellent location to explore the best of Dublin. The staff was helpful in obtaining Bus Tickets and meeting our requests.  The breakfast was great with a variety of selections both hot and cold. I would definitely stay again.,5,2023,09,08

244,Location was great,"The Fleet was a very nice ‚Äúboutique‚Äù hotel.   Bed was very comfortable (we had a queen).   The room was not overly large, but given the time we were in it, that was Ok.   The rain shower head was awesome,  Salon was nice to sit and relax.   No gym onsite, breakfast included.  The hotel is at the top of the Temple area, so great location and quiet.
",5,2023,08,26
244,Overpriced and noisy,"Overpriced. Beautiful reception area the best bit. Room was small, very hot and noisy (despite request for a quiet room). Breakfast average buffet in a basement room with no windows .. not worth the price.. ",3,2023,08,26
244,Enjoyable stay,"Our first visit to Dublin and won't be the last but we'll check what's happening next time as it was overrun with Americans.

The hotel was efficient and clean and perfectly located for mooching around and bar hopping. The only downside was no air con in the room and due to the location was very, very noisy so sleep was almost impossible but didn't spoil our stay. A tad expensive @ ¬£160+ per night for size of room and room amenities. We stayed in room 217. Would recommend they check the drainage in the bathroom. Shower leaks and sink slow to drain. Standard double bed on the hard side and seemed like cheap pillows, no extra pillows,robes etc and no view, one can tell room designed by a man as no socket near a mirror, cheap compliments tray, a tad dated, but all in all we enjoyed our stay. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Brownie points due to location and the great bar next door.",4,2023,08,24

244,Highly recommend The Fleet in Dublin,"The Fleet has a lobby with an eclectic and cool vibe. The breakfast buffet is very good. In the evenings they have security at the hotel entrance, who was never needed but nice to know they were there. 

The location is very convenient and ideal for us as it was our first time in Dublin.  We did not need a car as it is walking distance from everything in central Dublin. 

We would go see a site or shop and could come back and rest our feet and go out again. 
Walked everywhere, even took a walk along the river to Phoenix park which is only a 30 min walk with lots of sites along the way. Everything else (sites, restaurants, live music) is only 5-15 minute walk away. 

Our room was on the first floor but it was not loud considering the location.  We loved our room which was a European queen deluxe. Very well appointed, good size, clean, and loved the high ceilings.

They helped make our special celebration with some personalization which we asked for. 

Would highly recommend the Fleet for its friendly service personnel, lovely property & rooms, and excellent location.

244,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel was easy to find and the location was super. Rooms were very clean and well equipped. Staff is very friendly, breakfast is very good, beds are good. We had a room at the back of the hotel, was very quiet. The entrance of the hotel (bar and lounge) was very pretty. ",5,2023,08,17
244,Welcoming staff and location,"Front reception staff was very welcoming. Lobby is beautiful. Location is perfect if you want to be literally steps from all that Temple Bar neighborhood has to offer. I booked two rooms and both were complete with nice details like coffee makers, cookies, tea, coffee, creamer, etc. I especially appreciated the vending machine on the 2nd floor that was stocked with snacks and an electrical adapter for $15.",4,2023,08,13
244,Few days break ,Hotel is beautiful. Location excellent. Very appealing reception/ bar area. The staff were lovely and very helpful. We had a double room which was quite small but more than adequate for 4 nights ( we are quite fussy too). Bed a little small and very soft ( personal preference). Well equipped. Just needed somewhere to put towels. Lovely bathroom. Very very clean. Hotel was a little noisy at times but nothing the hotel could influence. Dray men delivering opposite. Inconsiderate guests banging doors at all hours of the night. Never the less a beautiful place and i would go back.,5,2023,08,04
244,Wonderful Stay in The Fllet,"Great locations in the middle of the city walking distance from all areas of interest. Friendly & helpful staff. Room was very comfortable and clean with large bathroom and excellent shower. Terrific breakfast in the morning. 
The hotel is in the middle of Temple Bar but you would not know that when inside as you cannot hear any loud music or street noise.
Hotel is much bigger on the inside that it looks form the street.

Highly recommend !!

244,"Excellent location, helpful staff, spotless and fab breakfast in the heart of central Dublin","I booked last minute as unexpected stay in Dublin. It was very reasonable and location excellent for anyone wanting to visit for nightlife and see Dublin attractions. I was on solo visit and was met by the most helpful guy on reception (sorry didn‚Äôt get his name!) who was so accommodating and helpful with my 21.30 check in! 
My room was lovely, spotless along with a decent size En suite and again spotless. 
I had a beautiful breakfast where again the staff were so helpful and attentive. 
Unfortunately my stay was just a quick sleep but I will definitely book here for my next night with friends given the location, service, staff and cleanliness.",5,2023,08,02
244,Very nice hotel,Very nice boutique hotel. Bedroom was small but comfortable. Clean modern bathroom with large shower. Very nice breakfast. Ideal location in the centre of the city. Nice comfortable bar as you enter. If you have mobility issues best to ask for room near lift.,4,2023,07,29
244,Needs a makeover,"Unfortunately while we loved visiting dublin we did not love this hotel. Where to begin, checkin is after 4pm, room cleaning is in the late afternoon if it happens, we had a blackout in our room, there is dirty carpeting everywhere, breakfast was ok. The food in their restaurant was not very good. The room for three people was extremely small - luckily they managed to give us another room. I would not return.",2,2023,07,23
244,Great spot!,"I thought this hotel was in a great location. Beautiful interiors. The rooms have double sliding windows I assume to help with some of the area noise. We stayed during the week and the bars closed at 11:30 and at 12 it seem to be pretty quiet.
We stayed on the fourth floor, which the lift only goes to the third-floor, and then there is a series of steps. We had someone in our group with knee issues just be aware when booking if there is any limitations which you cannot do steps. 
Everyone we engaged with at the hotel was friendly. If I ever stayed in Dublin again, I would come back to the Fleet!",5,2023,07,20
244,Clean and central,Thoroughly enjoyed our short stay here. The hotel is very central to everything and yet still surprisingly quiet. The room was well equipped and clean. The deal you get for parking over the road is good too. ,5,2023,07,19
244,Something to eat,"We didn‚Äôt realise this was a hotel until we went into the bar to order something to eat. Very posh looking and we just went for the charcuterie. We had made our way through most of it when my girlfriend mentioned that she was sure it should have come with crackers, after looking at the menu, she mentioned it to the staff. Fair enough they were brought to us, but would have been nice not to have had to ask.",4,2023,07,19
244,You really can't beat the Fleet,"The Fleet Hotel was a wonderful experience. The hotel itself, it's location,  rich history, the decor was beautiful. The staff was professional, welcoming, and very pleasant. My room overlooked the street and I could open the windows to let in the cool air and the sounds of Dublin. The bed was comfortable, the food and bar were great. As an artist and writer to me this was an amazing environment and perfect center point from which to explore the city. I could not have asked for a better place to stay for my adventure. Thanks to all and I hope to be back soon! ",5,2023,07,17
244,EXCELLENT,"If being within walking distance to Trinity College, St. Steven‚Äôs Park, Grafton Street Shopping, the FUN IRISH PUBS, and almost every other Dublin attraction, the FLEET IS THE PLACE TO STAY! You can even take a short walk across the Liffey to O‚ÄôConnell St. and the EPIC Museum from The Fleet. Our  room and bathroom were small but immaculate. The beds were very comfortable, and although in Temple Bar, it was very quiet except for the occasional cawing of seagulls! Our only complaints were not having enough electrical outlets, a small window and no AC. ",5,2023,07,14
244,Can't go wrong with Fleet Street!!,"I'm in a wheelchair so the staff had to get out the ramp every time I entered or left the hotel. They were always very responsive and helpful. They also had to deal with several special requests because of me and did not have any problems helping.  The lobby is spotless and beautiful.  The rooms are small (based on US experiences) but clean, well organized, and quite comfortable.  Bottom line: truly enjoyed the hotel and would most definitely recommend staying there!",5,2023,07,03
244,Fabulous City Center Location,"Amazing location to visit Dublin city center and more. So close Grafton Street, Lego shop and Disney Store amongst other.
Beautifully appointed bedrooms. We stayed in a triple room and felt very welcomed as a family.
Very fast wifi (little person approved).
Bar food was fabulous. Chicken Caesar salad, toasted gourmet ham and cheese sandwich and the fabulous charcuterie plater. Beautiful cheeses and cold meats with savory chutneys. 
Very attentive bar service, special mention to Darryl who made the most beautiful mojitos and mocktails. He was a great character and full of personality. Great hospitality person.
Also worth mentioning the amazing breakfast offering...Cecilia was a pleasure to deal with and the offering was really good. Very good products and lovely surroundings.
The bedroom was nicely appointed. Very hot water. Nice toiletries. Lovely fluffy towels. 
We will certainly return.
Fab place to stay if exploring the city.",5,2023,07,01
244,Highly recommend.,Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. Location was perfect. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was delicious. There‚Äôs a bar on premise. Highly recommend. Would stay again. Definitely check out the pub next door too. Best pint in town.,5,2023,06,28
244,"Heart of the City, close to lots of sites within walking or transit.","If you want hustle and bustle of city this is a good selections. However there is a lot of noise especially if you are on the outside row of rooms along a street where there is lots of party goers. Room was clean and in order , comfortable bed and nice bathrooms.",3,2023,06,26
244,Great Location & Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here recently for 2 nights. With flight delays coming in, we only had one full day in Dublin. The location was perfect to get a lot fit in. It is just a couple of minutes away from Trinity College - so we got the College Tour, Book of Kells, city tour (which was fantastic), Guinness Tour (20 minute car drive) and we went to see Riverdance at the Gaity Theatre which was about a 10 minute or so walk, and dinner in the Temple Bar district. The location was excellent and meant we could get a lot in in very short time. The hotel itself is absolutely lovely. The reception area with bar and lounge is gorgeous and relaxing. Great way to start and end an evening. The room itself was beautiful, spacious and the bathroom was very nice. Our only issue was it was noisy late into the night outside since our room overlooked the main street and it is right in the Temple Bar area. Make sure you get the morning breakfast. It is perfect to start the day - lots of food options and great service. The hotel itself has lots of corridors going up and down, so it can get confusing, but I found the whole thing charming. They also have a really nice outdoor patio. Wish we could have stayed longer. We loved it. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the outdoor noise - but really - you have to balance the fact you have the perfect location with the fact there is noise outside. One thing I will say about Temple Bar though, the locals told us nobody local goes there - it's all tourists - so it's a bit like Nashville in that tourists come in to get really drunk, and that has its repercussions ",5,2023,06,25
244,Top-Notch Service and Staff,"My husband and I visit Dublin often and decided to stay at The Fleet this time around and we will definitely go back. First, that I was one of the most beautiful and comfortable lobbies I‚Äôve ever seen ‚Äî it felt like home. The breakfast every morning was absolutely perfect with a lot of variety. And then there is staff‚Äî what a WONDERFUL, professional and polished group of people who all went above and beyond for us throughout our stay. Special shout out to Vicktoria, Yuri, David and Deniz for taking such great care of us. We miss you all already! You made us feel like family. ",5,2023,06,25
244,Dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed, I paid nearly 800 euros for 2 nights, had to move room as the 1st one was so small. Bedlinen cheap and nasty and the air con didn't work properly. Just expected more for what I paid. I fed this back to hotel to give them a chance but their response was as dissapointing as the stay.",1,2023,06,23
244,Definitely will visit again ,"Nice cozy hotel at the city centre, location was perfect (only 2 min to airport bus stop) pillows&mattress were very comfortable. Shower temp and water pressure were very good as well. Quiet and comfy room. Wifi speed was exceptionally fast as well. Staffs  were extremely helpful, especially Tamanna who helped me through check in process. ",5,2023,06,23
244,"Lovely hotel, clean, quiet, and perfect location!","Beautiful and clean hotel in ideal location! Staff very helpful with early check in, calling for airport transportation, etc. Lobby exactly as pictured and so were the rooms. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location - steps away from everything! Felt very safe. ",5,2023,06,22
244,End of term night out,"Stayed for a night out at the end of term with work colleagues however prices are higher than before in Dublin. Location is perfect for a night out. Breakfast was excellent, there is a good offering and the staff there are lovely and very attentive.",5,2023,06,15
244,Perfect city centre base,"I had eaten here before and needed a central hotel for a recent event I was attending nearby so decided to stay over. Being in the centre of the city was perfect, my room was ideal and the team at the hotel were very helpful and attentive. I did add breakfast which was plentiful and very tasty. Like all city centres it‚Äôs a busy area but that‚Äôs what we wanted and we loved being in the heart of Dublin.",5,2023,06,15
244,Bad experience,"Based on the website description we thought we had booked a decent room. It certainly wasn‚Äôt their cheapest room. We got our keys and found our room in a narrow old hallway. It was the oldest and dampest room I had ever been to with a tiny opaque window. And it turned out that it had no air conditioner. Went back downstairs and demanded a room with some air circulation. The front person was nice but a hidden manager in the back demanded more money to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù us. Eventually he or she agreed. 

The new room was as small but clearly nicer and the bathroom was refreshed. There was also an air conditioner. But once we turned it on water started dripping from its condenser in the bathroom. The water falling on your head was terrible. The next thing was with the shower. The water pressure was good but the drain couldn‚Äôt handle it. So we had to pause our shower ever minute to let the water go. 

Also the parking voucher they gave us didn‚Äôt work and had to pay full price for parking.",2,2023,06,13
244,Classic online bait and switch,"You fall in love with what is presented online with the rich, lovely bar and charming rooms. They give you the keys, you walk to the back of the hotel and open to a tiny, old, tired room wit a shower barely enough to turn in. The small window, dark, drab old decor and no AC on a warm night. I asked management twice for a change and there‚Äôs no way they were ‚Äúfull.‚Äù. They asked for a review, Well it gets the single star it deserves. ",1,2023,06,12
244,Great location and the BEST staff!,"The cleanest and comfiest hotel in Dublin! My fianc√© and I stayed at this hotel for a few nights in Dublin. The lobby is beautiful and actually quiet - amazing specially since it‚Äôs in the middle of the city. The staff was very nice and helpful. We got to our room and there were sweets waiting for us! The room was really big and spacious. It had a safe, a king bed (HUGE) and shower (no bath tub but that‚Äôs our preference). Waterfall shower. Enough said. Everything was very modern. Highly recommend the breakfast. Buffet style and they had everything to make your dream irish breakfast come true! GREAT LOCATION! We walked EVERYWHERE. Shops, the ha‚Äô penny bridge, St. Stephen‚Äôs Green park, Temple bar is literally next door, and so on. Shout out to the best GM John and the amazing staff - especially Yuri! Thanks for always bringing up my requests! Security 24/7.  Will definitely be back. ",5,2023,06,10
244,Wonderful time at the Fleet. ,"The hotel is quite charming and the staff is top notch. 
Shout out to the manager Andrew. Very accommodating and professional with a personal Irish touch. He is well liked and respected by the staff.
Raise a pint with Daryle and Patryk. Daryle is one of the bartenders and a   the lad with the gift of gab. He‚Äôll fill you in in about 3 minutes. Patryk is more quiet but will suggest an excellent meal and a prefect pairing including whiskey. He was correct every time. 
The hotel is a beautiful clean boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin in Temple Bar area. 
Great time.  ",5,2023,05,29
244,Ideal location & accommodation,"The Fleet was a wonderful experience.  The atmosphere was welcoming & charming - especially the reception area & bar. Staff was friendly & helpful.  Getting to our room the first time was a bit of a maze, but all future trips were easy.  The room was comfortable with great windows to view to the Street activity below.  Quiet at night.  Nice breakfast room & options.  Will definitely stay here during our next visit to Dublin",5,2023,05,17
244,Not going back,"Lobby was lovely as per pictures on websites. Check in took longer than it should have done. Had asked for no stairs in the original booking and had even telephoned before arrival to ensure that there would be no stairs. Upon arrival found that we had to navigate 4 separate sets of stairs. No assistance offered by staff to rectify or even care. Room was shabby with peeling paint and ""tired"" looking decor.",2,2023,05,14
244,Excellent Location and Breakfast,"We stayed here 5 nights and had a great experience. The location is easy to get to from the airport via the bus and near everything in the Temple Bar area. We also got the breakfast added to our stay and it was so worth it (so many selections to choose from). 

The staff was great! We paid for breakfast but was not able to grab it before our day tour trips - the staff was able to prep a cold take away breakfast for us instead of the hot breakfast buffet. I would definitely love to stay here next time I am in Dublin. Location Great. Staff Great. Breakfast Great.",5,2023,05,13
244,"Nice, convenient hotel.","Nice bar and restaurant was very good.  However, when I needed to go to the airport, the front desk suggested the airport blue bus for 8 Euros.  Said it had a stop just around the corner.   The also sold tickets on the bus, but charged 10 Euros--not sure why.  Took my ticket around the corner to the bus stop with the blue sign for the airport bus.  Tried to board when driver told me my ticket was no good--it was on a competing bus line.  Had to buy a new 8 Euro ticket.  Well worth 8 Euros for the convenience of a trip of less than 30 min.  Hotel should have disclosed the dual, competing busses so I only needed to buy one ticket.",3,2023,05,12
244,Cozy and comfy,"Lovely cozy interior and within walking distance to restaurants, pubs and shops. The staff was efficient and friendly.  Bathrooms and rooms were nice and clean.  We enjoyed our stay in The Fleet very much. ",5,2023,05,08
244,Dublin Jolly,"What a charming little boutique hotel.
Well placed, right in Temple Bar - intimate and a nice atmosphere.

The staff are pleasant and attentive.",5,2023,05,06
244,Dublin 2023,"Great hotel in the centre of Dublin!
Love the lobby and the breakfast was great.
The only bad was our room 210 that had it¬¥s windows too a street that was very lively at night. 
We will come back but book a another room. ",4,2023,05,02
244,Great Hotel in heart of Dublin,"This is a lovely old hotel, fantastic entrance lobby, comfy seating with 2 open fires.
We stayed Room 305, a large room with triple beds. Nice & warm & comfy bed.
However, we were woken up at 2am to a loud humming noise, similar to an aircraft engine noise. It was constant. Rang reception & he agreed it was excessive & blamed an extractor fan on roof on constantly.  Next day we were moved to a lower floor, which was nice & quiet. Bed seemed short in length, feet overhanging & we're not tall.
Breakfast was amazing, great choice. Staff very professional and curtious.
This hotel is ideally situated in Temple Bar & walking distance to all attractions.  Definitely stay again",5,2023,04,27
244,The Fleet Hotel in Dublin,"A great hotel, located in the heart of the Temple Bar area.  Easy to walk to many of the attractions around Dublin.  In fact we walked everywhere for 5 days.  Hotel staff were all professional and helpful when we had questions or needed a recommendation for restaurants.  Bar and lounge are were warm and comfortable, loved the fireplaces.  Breakfast was superb and the staff very friendly.  I highly recommend this hotel.  Only a small suggestion is the WiFi for the TV needs a stronger signal as the programing went in and out periodically.  ",5,2023,04,22
244,Location is great but not the best experience,"The lobby are was beautiful. Great to sit and relax by a fireplace. Breakfast was easy and delicious. Only a few rooms have climate control. Mine did not have that and so it was too hot from the radiator. The pillows weren‚Äôt soft, more like rocks. The room keys were wiped clean any time you had them near your phone. I had to have my room keys replaced multiple times to go to my room. ",3,2023,04,22
244,Too old for me,"I'll start with the good. The location of this hotel was excellent. It's in the Temple bar area, close to everything. Grafton Street is nearby, along with the river and the walking bridge. This was an older boutique hotel with a beautiful lobby with fireplaces and lots of seating. The hotel restaurant was ok, nothing great. The staff was also excellent and accommodating. 
Now for the not-so-good. This hotel is older, which means it comes with old hotel problems. Many hallway elevation changes made toting our luggage upstairs and downstairs, even after getting off the elevator. It's a dark and old-feeling hotel, not light and bright. The rooms were tiny. The beds seemed short compared to the other four hotels in Ireland. We thought we had reserved a queen bed, but no, it was a double bed! Very small and uncomfortable. 
The worst part, though, was the heat in the room. We turned ours off, opened the window, and could not cool the room down. There is no a/c, so we lived in a sweatbox for three nights. It was almost unbearable. 
Would I stay there again? No, I would not. ",3,2023,04,20
244,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly.  The lobby is gorgeous and we loved hanging out with a cocktail on the comfortable couches by the fire.  It is in the heart of temple bar, so it was noisy at times outside our room.",5,2023,04,17
244,Hidden gem of Dublin.,"Went here this week as a birthday treat from my daughter. This hotel is a wee hidden gem in the middle of Temple Bar. The rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. The breakfast was amazing. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They are friendly, welcoming and do everything to make your stay as fantastic and comfortable as can be. Will definitely be back soon.  Cathy M",5,2023,04,14
244,A great experience in Dublin!,"Absolutely wonderful hotel with a great, friendly and helpful staff. Great location, really great breakfast.  Beautiful lobby and lobby bar (cozy and comfy sitting area with 2 beautiful fireplaces) nice restaurant and bar. Nice room . This is the perfect hotel for your stay in Dublin.  I highly recommend!!!",5,2023,04,13
244,There are better options in Temple Bar area!,"This hotel failed to  live up to expectations. Check in was not available until 3:40. The room we got was very small and smelled of sewer throughout the stay. The bed had an old uncomfortable mattress and the furniture in the room was dated. The bathroom was modern but was not practical for holding towels. The reception/bar area was gloomy. And in need of modernisation. This hotel did not represent value for money. 

On a positive note, the hotel did offer  a very good Irish breakfast in the basement and the hotel had a great location",2,2023,04,11
244,A nice place to stay,"While overall the hotel was lovely, the fact that there was construction on the 1st floor was extremely inconvenient and noisy.  The location was perfect. And the lobby, bar and breakfast was above avg.",4,2023,04,11
244,Lovely peaceful stay at this hotel in the heart of Temple Bar ,Took my husband to Dublin for his 50th Birthday and chose The Fleet.  Despite being right on Temple Bar the hotel was so very quite and peaceful.  I requested birthday decorations be put up and on arrival these and banners were in the room along with a cake.  The room itself had high ceilings and a lovely large shower with two shower head options. The bed was extremely comfortable and plenty of storage to keep our things for a 4 day break.  The hotel lobby and bar are beautiful (although we didn't spend any time here).  I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. ,5,2023,04,10
244,Disappointment ,"The hotel is beautiful and beautifully located, but the service is horrible and not attentive. There was only one spot in the room to charge the phone. There were works in the hotel next to my room, even on Sunday. The elevator was small and slow. There was no wi fi in some of the rooms. ",2,2023,04,09
244,Great location,"We stayed here last night, the hotel is so nice. Great location, walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. The hotel bar is fab, very cool vibe, nice to chill here if you want to just relax, staff were very good, rooms were spotless. Look forward to staying here in the future.",5,2023,04,06
244,Recommended hotel in Temple Bar,"We stayed at The Fleet Hotel for six nights.  The hotel is in the (popular) Temple Bar district in the heart of Dublin.  That area can get a bit raucous and rowdy, but the hotel is located at one end of it which is a good bit quieter. We viewed that as a definite plus.  The location is then also ideal as it is close to many attractions (Trinity College, EPIC, etc.) and many transit hubs.  Almost all the tour buses and the public transit buses have a stop within a block or two, including buses from the airport. 

The hotel itself appears to be the result of accumulated, attached buildings.  Several staircases are needed to account for the differences between floor levels as you pass through previous exterior walls.  Traversing multiple levels actually adds to the charm that you will find at The Fleet.  We had one of the ""Elegant"" rooms.  It was snug with a queen-size bed, but certainly generous enough for our needs. While the view from the room wasn't impressive, looking over an internal courtyard instead of the street probably helped dampen much of the noise to be had in Dublin.  The room was very clean, and we noticed many, many staff constantly working at the hotel, cleaning everything, manning the front door, etc.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

As a final note, we can heartily recommend the full-breakfast at The Fleet.  The breakfast area was extremely pleasant and large, and the food was delicious and the wait staff was fantastic.  Loads of variety, hot items buffet, espresso machines, etc.  We even would recommend that proffered take-away breakfast that we needed one morning as our tour to the Cliffs of Moher began before the breakfast buffet opened. ",5,2023,04,05
244,Must stay!,"Amazing stay! Bar was a great place too. Night manager was amazing!  Right smack in the middle of everything! You can walk, bus, taxi..we preferred the walking side.  GREAT place to stay and we would stay here again. ",5,2023,03,26
244,Stunning hotel ,"Lovely stunning hotel, stayed for 3 nights in march 2023, beautiful Decor,, rooms spacious, will defo be back !!! 

Highly recommend this hotel and it‚Äôs location, and a great bar next door too, will be back later in the year ",5,2023,03,26
244,The Fleet in Dublin,"All staff besides the hotel bartender were extremely rude, not friendly, and were not very accommodating. Everyone I met in Ireland was super welcoming besides the staff that work here. The hotel itself was nice; however, the staff made my experience not worth the stay at this hotel. ",2,2023,03,21
244,5/5 All Around ,"5/5 all around. Lovely little welcome plate when we arrived. Any staff we met were pleasant and professional.Food was lovely, especially loved breakfast. Cannot fault anything. The fleet is always my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù hotel in Dublin and will remain that way üòÉ",5,2023,03,15
244,"Good location, few things that could be improved","Great location in Temple Bar and the lobby of the hotel and bar are lovely. We came early to leave our bags after an early morning flight & they let us have the room several hours early despite check in not being until 3, which was very much needed and appreciated. 

The room itself on the 1st floor was very small and felt a little dated, weirdly the bathroom looked a little newer but had a really unpleasant smell, like stagnant water throughout our stay.

The room was either very cold or very warm with no in between and sadly opening the windows did little to help with the temperature and of course let in all the noise from the alley - however if you‚Äôre choosing a hotel in this prime location then you have to expect noise and it really wasn‚Äôt that noisy all things considered. I would agree with other reviewers you may want a room on a higher floor.

I understand the hotel was refurbished in 2019 and it feels that the money was spent downstairs (as I said bar was lovely and basement where you have breakfast and bathrooms felt luxury) rather than in the rooms so perhaps that could be looked at.

Overall, I was happy with our stay and staff and service were great so I would visit again but would ask for a different room.",4,2023,02,20
244,Lack of storage,"Lovely foyer and bar area, however, lots of building work being carried out on the 1st floor. Helpful staff that were happy to move us to a different room as originally we were given a room on the 1st floor. On a different note, there aren‚Äôt  any shelves in the bathroom, we had to store all our stuff on the floor, even the towels were left in our wardrobe as there wasn‚Äôt anywhere to put them. Was really strange because the bathroom was modern, not sure why storage was overlooked. Tissues and toilet rolls were not replaced with full replacements. We had two tissues fluffed up in our tissues box, why bother? Small tweaks would give the hotel a luxury feel. All staff were very helpful and pleasant and breakfast was tasty. ",3,2023,02,17

244,Luxury in downtown Dublin,"This was the most luxurious hotel of our two-week vacation. It was worth every penny for a good night's sleep before our flight home. We chose this hotel based on it's proximity to the bus stop (half a block away) we needed to be at early in the morning to catch a ride to the airport. Our only complaint was the noise from outside but there's not much the hotel could do about that and we were so tired, it didn't keep us up for long anyway. We also loved the proximity to the bars and downtown area. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all those wishing for a comfortable stay in Dublin.",5,2023,02,12
244,Nice hotel in Temple Bar area in Dublin,"The hotel has an excellent central location so you can walk to almost anything in central Dublin. It is a charming old hotel. The lobby area is cosy with a little bar. And there is a good restaurant also in the house.
The rooms are small - we had a socalled Elegance room on second floor. Towards the street, but the noise was limited and we slept well.
Breakfast was fine, WiFi functions. The staff is kind and helpfull.
We liked it - only problem is that you will have to walk up several stairs in the house depending on where your room is. Elevator system is far from several of the rooms.",4,2023,01,24
244,Centrally located elegant hotel ,"Elegant hotel in the heart of Dublin within walking distance to all places in the city. Its at the start of the Temple Bar district.
Beautiful reception and lounge with a bar to relax in with two fires to warm up from a day's sight seeing. Staff all very smart in appearance and attentive and courteous. 
Breakfast was spot on with a great choice and high quality, we also had evening meals in the restaurant attached and the food of a high class restaurant standard, very impressed.
Room was of a high standard and so was the daily cleaning, the only let down was the room was cold when we arrived and there were no instructions for the heating which was not very good.
I would definitely stay again if I return to Dublin.",5,2023,01,16
244,Stylish and tranquil,Excellent location everything was within walking distance. The staff were so helpful and friendly. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice it was so elegant and tranquil with stunning stain glass windows and bar. We headed back to the bar for some peace and quiet before getting our flight and warmed up in front of the open fires. The bedrooms were really clean and bathroom looked newly fitted. Absolutely loved the lavender shower gel and conditioner. Can‚Äôt fault it and will definitely be back. Thank you,5,2023,01,15
244,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed here for a work trip, for 1 night. The stay was fantastic. The hotel itself was beautiful, welcoming and the staff were incredibly friendly. I look forward to returning for a longer leisurely stay.",5,2023,01,15
244,Lovely pre Christmas shopping trip,"My friend and I stayed here for 3 days as a little shopping trip before Christmas. The hotel was absolutely lovely from the staff to the food to the rooms there was not a single fault. The self service breakfast was extensive and very fresh each day. The food in their bar was was very good with again a good variety. I am a vegetarian and there was plenty of options for me which is obviously a plus. Big shoutout to Kevin on reception, he helped me with changing dates prior to arrival and was very helpful throughout our stay. I will definitely stay again!",5,2023,01,10
244,A nice place to stay in Dublin,"This is a very nice hotel in The Temple Bar area in Dublin
It is in a great location, within walking distance of many pubs and restaurants 
 Also the bus stop is not far away. The lobby was decorated beautifully for Christmas 
The room was a bit small, but it had great service 
 ",4,2023,01,04
244,Christian at The Fleet,"The staff at the Fleet were some of the best I‚Äôve ever known. So friendly and helpful! The hotel is delightful, the food great, the location perfect for enjoying city center! If I am lucky enough to return to Dublin, I will stay here every time!",4,2023,01,02
244,"Lovley hotel in a good ,llocation","The Fleet is well situated close to O'Connell street and various oubs and restauants. It is a beautiful hotel and wonderfully decorated for Christmas. The breakfast was excellent, the staff were friendly. We enjiyed our stay",5,2022,12,29
244,amazing fleet hotel,"super location , very large room ( elegance)
   very good breakfast but most importantly
the staff is so obliging , so helpful simply amazing.
 thank u so much for everything  especially to Tamana and the whole reception desk
",5,2022,12,24
244,Christmas visit,"Cannot fault our trip. We were greeted by a very nice man on reception who had us checked in in minutes. The whole check in area is warm and welcoming and a great first impression. Located in the heart of Dublin, Grafton St, OConnell St and George's St are a short walk. Templebar with the pubs and restaurants are a stones throw.
Breakfast the next morning was very good. Buffet style with lots of selections.
Didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant but will give it a try next time.
Couldn't recommend the Fleet more. You won't be disappointed",5,2022,12,20
244,Beautiful Hotel ,"Brilliant  hotel good location centre of temple .The staff is very friendly and professional and always helpful. Clean and beautiful reception. 
Restaurant food was outstanding and tasty. I can't wait to get back the summer 
Clean tidy and clean room üëå ",5,2022,12,12
244,Stay Here! This Is the Best Place in Temple Bar,"From our first step inside The Fleet hotel, it was the real deal. Doorman at the entrance, exquisitely decorated lobby (with Christmas finery adding to the beauty), attentive staff. If, no, when we go back to Dublin, we're staying at The Fleet again. It's stylishly grand.

Perfect location to all the touristy stuff. There's a little grocery store across the street so you can stock up on basic snacky needs (try those double-chocolate cookies made by Tesco . . . outrageously delicious).

We enjoyed some drinks in the hotel bar--really liked chatting with the bartender. Lovely breakfast spread downstairs the next morning with a wide variety of offerings: pasties, meats, fruits, juices, espresso machine.

You can pay essentially the same price for one of the other hotels but why bother? They'll just be average. Go the next step up and stay at The Fleet. I promise you will not be disappointed.",5,2022,12,04
244,Style and Comfort A +,"Super location with a very friendly staff, we had a great first night introduction to Dublin here on our recent visit. Highly recommend - price was right and a valuable find. Will recommend to friends.",5,2022,11,30
244,The Fleet Hotel is in the perfect spot in Dublin for me,"The Fleet is in the perfect location for me in Dublin. Located just at the street leading to The Temple Bar district, this is the prefect place to get to my tour company, PaddyWagon Tours, Trinity University, St. Stephens Square, Dublin Castle, and the National Gallery of Ireland. Also close to shopping, food & pubs. The hotel is quiet, has a nice bar in the lobby, and great staff. I will stay here again. There is a restaurant on in the basement with a continental or full breakfast and serves lunch and dinner as well. I recommend The Fleet.",5,2022,11,24
244,1st recommendation in Dublin,"Top hotel, definitely recommendable. Nice hotel, bar and accommodation. Staff very kind and the style is extraordinary. Would definitely use this hotel again in Dublin. It takes only 20 minutes tongue airport and is direct in temple bar in the city center.",5,2022,11,22
244,The Middle of Everything,"The Fleet was very nice and clean. The front staff was friendly especially since we got in late due to flight delays. They very accommodating and we‚Äôre able to help us with our travel itinerary. The room was smaller, but had lots of amenities. For being in a centrally located area, it was very quiet inside.",5,2022,11,10
244,Excellent Hotel,The room was very comfortable and the hotel is situated right in the heart of Temple Bar so you can walk everywhere and see a lot - we really enjoyed our stay and the staff were all so friendly as well - I would book there again when I come to Ireland.,5,2022,11,10
244,Great Location - Good Hotel,"Service was very good... front desk personnel were very helpful and accommodating. Rooms were on the small side - however, very clean and comfortable. Grocery store across the street for incidentals. Temple Bar is only 2 blocks away...",5,2022,11,08
244,Amazing hotel in fantastic location,"Amazing stay. Great location - so central but also quiet. 

Lovely desk staff managed to get us checked in early. 

Lovely porter helped us with lift as we were too giddy to listen to the instructions! Top customer service. 

Lovely night barman (Day?) looked after us after the chilly walk from 3arena. 

Breakfast- phenomenal.  The cooked breakfast was awesome and the nourishing smoothie helped set us up for the day. 

Room was spotlessly clean. Central location.  Will for sure be back. ",5,2022,11,02
244,Lovely hotel with friendly staff.,"Lovely hotel, very friendly staff. Bed really comfy. Quite small rooms and no air conditioning but perfect for a short break. Close to pubs, restaurants and shops.  Great cocktails and the baileys coffee was delicious .  Didn't eat there so can't comment on food.",5,2022,10,28
244,Another fabulous stay at the Fleet,"Stayed at the Fleet last week and as usual it did not disappoint! Any of the staff we met were so friendly and helpful as always. Special mention to Keelan and Sal who had us entertained in the lobby bar until the early hours. Breakfast was exceptional, can honestly say that the set up is definitely a favourite. Only negative is that we didn‚Äôt get to stay longer! (Already planning another visit)

The Fleet is an ideal hotel to visit whether it be for a night or a weeks stay, from staff, food and location, you honesty can‚Äôt find a better place to be!",5,2022,10,19
244,Excellent location,"We were in room 454!  Beautiful room overlooking the street with lots of action.  It was well set up, plenty big enough for my husband and I and clean.  We would go back without a doubt.  A few things to consider that where not a big issue for us but could be for others.  The room was very warm.  We went in October and being from the deep south I was afraid we would be cold.  The temperature difference between NOLA and Dublin was about 20 degrees.  However our room was on the top floor so it was very very warm.  So warm we slept with the windows opened most nights.  That was actually enjoyable.  Second thing (we found this added to the charm but others may not).  Our room was on the fourth floor.  The elevator goes up to the the 3rd floor.  Not a big deal but it is not as simple as going up a flight of stairs to get to our room.  When you get off the elevator you take a right and then go down 10 stairs walk approximately 20 steps and turn down a hallway.  The first two doors are 306 and 307.  I know this because this is where our friends were at.  The next room is 350?  Okay...then you take another 15 steps go down 3 stairs (yes I said down) and then walk a little more and go up a total of 45 stairs and down a hallway to your room.  Again we found the odd layout charming.  After a few Guiness at the pub it feels like Dr. Seuss built the hotel.  While on this trip we travelled all over Ireland and stayed in various hotels.  And while all of them were quite nice this was by far our favorite and we will go back to.  ",5,2022,10,15
244,Wonderful hotel with great location,"We stayed at The Fleet Hotel in October 2022.  The staff was wonderful from the start, they responded quickly to my e-mails and were great with a room change we needed after arrival.  Breakfast was delicious and the service great.  Rooms were clean and modern.  Think the best part was location, walking distance to everything in Dublin.",5,2022,10,14
244,Perfect Perfect Perfect!!!,Fantastic hotel.  Fantastic.  Located perfectly for walking around Dublin. Impeccably kept.  Great morning breakfast.  Lovely staff.  Great restaurant.  Mega Burger was delicious.  I highly recommend this hotel for your vacation in Dublin.,5,2022,10,14
244,Great hotel with amazing location,"We had the pleasure to stay for 4 night at the Fleet hotel. It's just next to the Temple Bar area and in close distance to most of the ""things to do"" in Dublin.
The room was big, clean and offered everything needed. The bar was very nice and the staff friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town. ",5,2022,10,12
244,Great location!,"So I looked long and hard before booking here - apparently being centrally located comes with a price - which is street noise. I thought I had vetted that problem pretty good, but this hotel still had some.
The pros: Great location! Off the beaten path on a quaint side street, but still walkable to EVERYTHING! Lovely lobby, friendly staff, I especially loved the security - you need your key to get in after 11 but also need your key to get upstairs to your hallway at any time. The rooms were clean, we loved our very comfy single beds (travelling with my daughter) and the bathroom was spacious.
Cons: The street noise! Or I should say the alley noise!! It was impossible to have our window open due to it, and the noise still made its way in anyway. The alley seems to be a favorite hangout spot for workers on break, passers by, plus the garbage and delivery trucks that service it. We were there for only 2 nights but it was kinda rough. I'm not really sure what the solution is - possibly request being on the other side of the building? It's a shame NOT to stay here but it's a tough tradeoff.",4,2022,10,10
244,Disappointing and noisy hotel,The hotel room was so ridiculously noisy. Appropriate windows would have taken care of this noise from an elegance room. For ¬£400 a night the room was sub par and the breakfast mediocre at best. I was completely underwhelmed and very disappointed.,2,2022,10,08
244,Hated the room but nice staff and great location,"I went through these reviews during my stay as I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was the only one having a bad experience but I saw someone else reviewed the SAME exact room I was in, room 203. This room must be what they give solo travelers and/or those who book via third party. It‚Äôs pretty small, bathroom towels smelled like body odor/sweat, shower has panels that only go halfway so water leaked out at the back half, heater didn‚Äôt work so they gave me an electric radiator heater and though the heat turns on, it doesn‚Äôt spread in the room. By the time i went to sleep, the heater had been on for 2 hours and it was still cold in the room. (By the time I woke up many hours later, the room was warm). The towel rack I believe had an option to be heated but I couldn‚Äôt turn it on. There were no outlets near next to the bed so you can‚Äôt use ur phone or any other device and charge in bed. The floor and room I was given was also too noisy. This room is in a hallway all by itself. I had just come off a long flight and wanted to nap but there was a lot of foot traffic and it always sounded like someone was outside my door and trying to come in. There was also someone cleaning/vacuuming right outside the door, which didn‚Äôt help with my nap. Oh and I could hear my neighbor walking in their room, almost sounding like they were in MY room! Super creaky floors. On a side note: quite a few people posted about it having been their bdays and the staff surprising them with something. I would‚Äôve appreciated a gesture of the same given it was my bday just 2 days prior to arriving and they checked my ID upon check in. 

All in all, just not a good fit for me. The staff were really good though and location can‚Äôt be beat. If you plan to book, read all the reviews so you know what to expect.",2,2022,10,04
244,Perfect location & nice hotel!,The Fleet was a wonderful place and very centrally located! Close to many sites and easy to walk about! Room was comfortable and clean and the staff was lovely. The on-site restaurant was delicious and the bar lobby was super cozy! I‚Äôd definitely stay here again!,5,2022,10,04
244,Holiday in Dublin,"Such a delightful Hotel.
Staffs could not do enough for us.
Tamana (Main reception) Upgraded us, left a Birthday Treat (see pic), and was there clear instructions on Parking at Park Rite, concession rate as deal with the Hotel.

Lots to do. Location is excellent.
Staggered home from a good dinner with old friends.

Next day Breakfast was great.
Jane served us, made to order eggs.
Defo coming back!",5,2022,10,01
244,Great location,Boutique style of hotel located close to all key tourist areas of Dublin. Excellent breakfast and comfortable bar and sitting area. Rooms have tea and coffee making facilities and free bottled water is provided.  Helpful and friendly staff.,5,2022,09,26
244,Location Location,"Nice room with big en-suite.
Very clean with Wi-Fi .Great open balcony on the second floor with great seating .Breakfast was great plenty of choice.We was surprised there was no air con in the room (must) considering it was so hot and the windows don‚Äôt open. they did provide a fan but it didn‚Äôt really help .",4,2022,09,25
244,Great location,We enjoyed this hotel.  The staff was great and really helpful.  The location is perfect for almost every attraction in Dublin and in walking distance to most things.  Lots of great pubs and restaurants close by.  The breakfast is good and worth adding to your room price.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  There‚Äôs a great bar and a lovely lobby.  And a free drink when you check in!,4,2022,09,24
244,"Location, Location... and Lobby!","We had only one night in Dublin ‚Äì an extended layover, so the location was important to us. And The Fleet delivered on that. Our room was clean, but did not match the description in the booking ‚Äì it was TINY, with a single frosted window that indicated that there wasn't much to view. Our room was also out of range of the hotel's wifi, but we were able to access it at the bar, and in the breakfast room. Breakfast was included with our room rate, and that was very welcome: nice variety, good quality, and worked well with our travel schedule & the need to get back to the airport.

We didn't realize we were in town during a sold out (Garth Brooks ‚Äì ??!) concert, and our room rate was very expensive, but we were grateful simply to have a room and we understand the concept of Supply & Demand.

We asked for recommendations on where to go for dinner, and Isabella referred us to a fabulous restaurant ‚Äì we were incredibly impressed with how well she matched us to such an absolutely perfect place (Fade Street Social) for what we were seeking. And though the restaurant was turning away other walk-ins, they had a table for us!

The lobby is chic and cozy place to relax ‚Äì we had a round at the bar to close out our evening, and we enjoyed some time the next morning as we were preparing for the ride back to the airport.",4,2022,09,22
244,Good 1 night stay,A very comfortable room but a bit of a hike round the building to reach it ! Liked the main reception area - very comfortable and welcoming. Breakfast - a broad range of cooked and buffet dishes. Good location for the busy Temple Bar area.,4,2022,09,20
244,One night stay in the Fleet Hotel,"I would have NO complaints about the Fleet Hotel whatsoever. I really enjoyed my stay there. I was only there for one night and the hotel is absolutely beautiful. It deserves the four star rating, definitely. Staff members that I came into contact with while staying in the hotel were particularly pleasant and helpful, I could not fault any of them. The breakfast was beautiful, buffet style, you could have as much as you wanted. I will definitely be back and I give this hotel a five star rating.",5,2022,09,20
244,Elegance Double Rooms are roomy and comfortable,"We stayed at the Fleet at both the beginning and end of our time in Ireland (hiked Kerrry Way in between), and we enjoyed both our stays equally. 

The Elegance Double Rooms are roomy, comfortable, and well-appointed with large windows. It's a bit of an up/down maze to get to them but the wayfinding is excellent. We enjoyed the ""game"" of maneuvering to them. For those who say they are quieter rooms because of where the windows face: I'm sure that's true, but it's also Dublin so don't expect silence. You'll still have boisterous revelers at 1am and insanely raucus seagulls at all hours. We left our windows wide open to enjoy the luscious sea-adjacent breezes and embraced the street sounds as part of the Dublin experience. 

We didn't eat at the restaurant or the bar, but both look immensely appealing. Fantastic folks at reception. Great location. Will stay again for sure, and will request same room type.",5,2022,09,16
244,Very helpful crew,A comfortable hotel close to pubs and bars. Very  friendly and helpful people working in this hotel. We had an unlikely event during our holiday and they helped us a lot. Beautiful and relaxing rooms. The hotel is welcoming and charming.,5,2022,09,15
244,Fleet somewhere else,"Great location, super nice people. As we entered our room there was a pair of dirty socks on the floor and our bed was made, but ruffled as it appeared someone had been sitting on top. I called reception and a super polite lady, ‚ÄúIsabella‚Äù arrived, apologized and gave us some free drink tickets and a fan. There is no AC. The hotel is Old, musty. Our room was on the 1st floor just above a merging alleyway. Very little sleep, the alley was the location for drug use, pissing, yelling, cussing at all hours of the night. Additionally, starting around 0330 trash trucks would run, then beer trucks loading empty kegs, then recycling trucks, then street sweepers‚Ä¶ of course We could have changed rooms for an interior room so that‚Äôs on me. So I would suggest a room far away from the street or alley. Dublin never sleeps so as a tourist, we didn‚Äôt either. 
We ordered a charcuterie board that was not good. It may not be a popular item so the meats appeared dated, had a few bites and stopped eating out of fear of spoiled food. The price of $259 per night for FLEET is NOT Worth it, go somewhere else. If you are a bougie American traveler like me and like your quiet nights and cold AC then go to a chain hotel, there are plenty.",2,2022,09,07
244,Nice relaxing couple stay,"I recently stayed at the Fleet hotel with my girlfriend as we were attending a wedding in Dublin.  The staff are very inventive and helpful. The location is great as it‚Äôs in the centre of Temple bar and everything is close proximity.

The room is excellent and very decorative. Bathroom is very spacious and room is very quite.

We had no problems sleeping and we will definitely be returning when we arrive back to Dublin. 

We stayed for three nights and it was very relaxing. We ate in the restaurant 1 night and had breakfast every morning which had a wide variety of options. The food is delicious and very satisfactory.

Highly recommend.",5,2022,08,29
244,Amazing stay at the fleet,"My family and I come allot to stay in the fleet when we come to Dublin, I also stay here as a business traveller and the staff and quality are first class. 
The rooms are always very clean and the lobby area is very comfortable to sit in the evening. The staff are all very friendly and helpful also they serve a great breakfast.",5,2022,08,29
244,Beautiful hotel in a really central location,"We arrived as a group on 18th August, with 2 rooms booked (it was my birthday surprise).  Myself & husband were allocated a lovely room to the rear of the property, which, apart from a dodgy toilet sear & faulty extractor fan in the bathroom was stunning.  The only noise issue we had was from the kitchen fan (I think), but that generally went quiet around 10pm.  Our friends however, were at the front of the property and had a very different experience, especially on Saturday evening.  They could hear every noise, from the late night revellers to the bin vehicle emptying/collecting rubbish.  

The above taken into consideration, the hotel is stunning & the staff always very courteous.  Prices at the bar were also very competitive.

The property is very central for all locations & Dublin has a vast array of restaurants & caf√©s which cater for all budgets.  A very lively & cultural city, which must be visited at least once in a lifetime",5,2022,08,25
244,OK but we would stay elsewhere next time in Dublin.,Great location close to the train and bus stops and Temple Bar area. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was smaller than a cruise ship cabin but clean. There is no AC so the window had to be open to all the street noise. Not worth the cost compared to other options in the area.,3,2022,08,21
244,Good food and service,"My sister and I went here fir our evening meal. I had the leek sausage mash and red jus. My sister had the coconut curry. It was a lovely ambience with very nice service. The food was lovely never had sausage and mash that tasted like that.
Julie Lynne",5,2022,08,18
244,No A/C despite website claims,"To be fair, the lobby and restaurants are quite nice and the room is fine, though small. My disappointment is that I was specifically looking for air con and though it says they have it that is only for some rooms and not the ones with two beds. The staff is completely unapologetic. If it‚Äôs warm out you might wish to choose another spot. I wish the website were honest as we‚Äôre now stuck paying over $350 per night and are uncomfortable hanging in the room.",1,2022,08,18
244,Perfect Location - Super Polite & Helpful Staff,"We stayed here on our first trip to Ireland and the experience couldn't have been better. The staff was able to accommodate us for early arrival from our international flight from the US. In addition, everyone we interacted with from the front desk to the breakfast staff were exceptionally kind and helpful. As to location, it is on the edge of Temple Bar and we faced the O'Connell side on the first floor above the street. We did not have any issues with noise from either side of the building and slept comfortably. We highly recommend building breakfast into your choice because it was quite hearty and kept us from having to get up and leave the property to hunt for breakfast elsewhere. A full Irish can fuel your day! The bar was also a nice option to enjoy a Guinness in the lobby. We did not visit 1920, but it looked busy at normal times, so I'm sure it's decent fare as well. The only thing we'd have liked to have seen was maybe some shelving in the bathroom for storing toiletries and dopp kits, etc., but nothing we couldn't work with. We plan to return to Ireland for a more extensive exploration, but we will certainly stay at The Fleet while and whenever in Dublin.",5,2022,08,17
244,Alleyway/side passage - BIG issues with drugs,"The hotel is ok.  Rooms small. Construction a bit flimsy (when next door room door slams our bed shook). Noise at night but to be expected in this area and not a problem.

The real issue was our room was at the side overlooking the side street but also another alleyway.  The drug-taking locals were a problem at every time of day.  During the day, they constructed a ‚Äòden‚Äô out of bins and dealt/took drugs - completely visible from our room. 

On the Friday night/Saturday morning an almighty fight broke out between them at 3am with threats of stabbing and screaming/shouting for 1/2 hour.

The worst was Sunday morning when a large group congregated at 6.30am and for an hour screeched, yelled, shouted at each other.  Multiple times people yelled from various hotels and rooms for them to move on but they paid no attention.  Eventually an extremely angry man appeared threatening them and they moved away.  About 1/2 hour later two of them started screaming in the alleyway again - calling for help/saying they were dying.

It was, at the very least disruptive, but, in reality, actually it was very upsetting and distressing.  

I don‚Äôt know what the hotel can do to stop it but it was really unpleasant.  I would never stay here again.",1,2022,08,14
244,Amazing Birthday Stay!!!,"By far one of the best experiences I've had in Dublin. We stayed at The Fleet to celebrate my daughters birthday and the team went above and beyond to make it so special. Upon arrival into our room, we received complimentary prosecco and some dessert. Such a lovely gesture! The room was nice and beds were comfy. The lobby was stunning and we had a few drinks after dinner there. It was such a lovely atmosphere. Definitely will return again on my next trip to Dublin!",5,2022,08,12
244,Clearly under the standard ... not a 4 star hotel! Room 203 is a disaster,"We have stayed twice during the week, and this hotel is clearly under the expectations and the promises of the website. Worst of all, the bathrooms, which was ok-ish in one of the room (it was apparently renewed recently) but a real disaster in the other 3. Small, with the smallest sink I have ever seen and a flushing water system for the toilets that was so weak that you had to try 4 times to get rid of what you had just deposited (no kidding), and a shower that is not worthy of a hotel of this supposed standard. 
We spent almost 2000 EUR for the nights we spent, and we are very very very¬†disappointed. If you are forced to stay there, AVOID absolutely room 203 and 303: noisy, small, and the worst ever seen bathroom ... The breakfast is poor. The sheets were dirty twice (a sticky sensation...).
A positive point? yes, the location ...",1,2022,08,05
244,amazing hotel with the greatest staff,"I have to start my review by what an exceptional team Fleet hotel has specially the team in front desk:) there were next level of hospitality, empathy and understanding. 

we stayed in fleet for 4 nights and loved our room and our experience in the hotel, abit noisy side of the town but expected, very close to all attraction. Breakfast was great, the team in the breakfast are were the nicest too.

I would definity recommend fleet to whoever traveling to Dubin.",5,2022,07,30
244,In the heart of Dublin,Stayed one night at The Fleet Hotel  to attend a show at The Olympia Theatre and it was a most pleasant experience.  Beautiful large airy room with an extremely comfortable bed.  We included dinner and breakfast in our package and both meals were excellent and very good value.  Musy also add that all members of staff we met were extremely pleasant and professional.  We definitely will be using this hotel again in the future.,5,2022,07,30
244,"Nice place, loud, but that's to be expected","The reason to stay at a place at Temple Bar is because of the location.  The night life is abundant, and it goes well into the morning.  If you need quiet in order to sleep, that can be an issue, so be aware of it when you consider where to stay.

The hotel itself is beautiful and the stairs and pathways are fun and quirky.  The breakfast is good, the service is good, the lobby feels like a mini-museum.  No issues with any of it.

About the only other thought is we had a shower only, no bathtub, and the latter would have been nice.",4,2022,07,21
244,Not worth the money,"The beautiful lobby is deceiving. Rooms are dark, have no ventilation (no AC or fans made it feel like a sauna during the heatwave, and couldn‚Äôt open windows), beds are uncomfortable, and the wifi is weak.",2,2022,07,18
244,Great location but very noisy,"I wanted to stay in a beautiful in Dublin centre, the hotel is very clean and staff very friendly. There is no air con in the rooms and nor is there a fan, the only option for cooling is the windows which lead to a side alley. The alley has very strange activities throughout the entire night.",3,2022,07,18
244,Great Location,"Great location comes with a lot of noise. Ask fro a room more towards the back. We were so tired from traveling didn‚Äôt make much of a difference. Rooms are small and fairly basic.  We chose it initially because it is one of the few places that have 3 twin beds in a room. We left our bags there for several days while we went on a hiking trip. They were very accommodating. Breakfast had a lot of choices. There is a elevator, but 2 different buildings and different levels in between. May have to lift luggage on some stairs. I would stay again.",4,2022,07,17
244,Disappointing,"We arrived to be welcomed with a 35minute queue for check in. Only 1 person infront.... The hotel itself is in a great location. On the busiest tourist trap in Dublin. 12 beggers approached us in an hour whilst sitting outside opposite temple bar.

Paid for an executive room, disappointingly basic. TV didn't even work and bed was not a king size and very small. I'm 6ft 1 and feet were hanging over the end.

Front of hiuse Staff were young, inexperienced and pretty much disinterested to provide good service. 

I had to mention 3 times that i'd been charged for 2 people in my room.  This was eventually sort of fixed upon checkout.  (Still down 10euro). 

Lounge itself was comfotable and sampled all 3 redbreast whisky. 

Breakfast was also quite good,  pastries were excellent. Not a big variety however. Mostly yoghurt and red meat.  

I'll stick to the hilton next time.",3,2022,07,13
244,Exceptional!,"It was my 2nd time staying in The Fleet and it just gets better every time! The staff are all so welcoming and accomodating, they couldn'tdo more to help us. The location couldn't be better for exploring Dublin city, it's right in the centre. Our room was lovely, really bright and spacious and the bed was super comfy! The breakfast is so delicious with everything you can think of. We have to give a special mention to John, he always goes above and beyond when we stay. We will certainly be back!",5,2022,07,12
244,Family Vacation,Wonderful place to stay!!!  The decor in the lobby was old school character.  Really loved it.  The location was ideal especially for our Belfast Tour which bus picks you up next block up.  There were amazing restaurants right on the same street and lots of action going on in the shop.  The only thing I didn't like was there was no a/c but I called down to guest desk and asked for a portable fan and was delivered within 10 minutes.  The shower door entrance was quite tight so we all had to enter into it side ways,4,2022,07,10
244,Couple break,"We stayed in the hotel in June, fabulous hotel and superb location. The room was finished stunningly, down to the last detail in the bathroom. Spacious rooms, large bath tub. We went on a Sunday and it wasn't noisy at all. You're in the heart of Dublin city. The barman and concierge desk provided amazing service and catered to all of our needs. The Fleet will defiantly be my go to hotel from now on when visiting Dublin (although it looks like it gets booked up fast).Well worth the money and will be revisiting when back in Dublin.",5,2022,07,07
244,"Small, wonderful, well-located, historic hotel","We recently spent 3 nights in this wonderful historic hotel and highly recommend it. The Temple Bar location is perfect.  It is about two blocks from the pub scene and walking distance to many museums and good restaurants. The lobby is large, comfortable, well-furnished, and quiet with gorgeous old stained glass windows. Staff were helpful and friendly.",5,2022,07,07
244,Highly recommended,"This place is an absolute little gem just on the outskirts of Temple Bar.

The rooms are clean and the bed is comfy. It is a short walk of about 2 minutes from all of the great pubs of Temple Bar and a short walk from from Grafton Street for the shops.

The only point to note is that the room can be quite noisy in the early hours of the morning as it is close to Temple Bar and there is a bin lorry most mornings and i think the pubs are re-stocking the barrels.

We were woken at about 5am. This is no fault of the hotel and purely down to the location. I spoke to reception the next morning and we were moved to a quieter room for our second night.

The rest of our family had a rear facing room and had no problem.

We did not have the breakfast as we booked room only, but it looked nice.

I will definitely be staying here on my next Guinness filled weekend in Dublin, but recommend travellers request a quiet room when booking, to avoid being woken in the early hours.

Thank you Fleet Hotel for a lovely stay and a brilliant family weekend in Dublin. I hope to see you very soon.",5,2022,07,01
244,Great spot if you are visiting Temple Bar district.,"Great spot to visit the Temple Bar district. Near the corner with Moreland, which has easy access to busses (including AirCoach route 700 to/from the airport) and the local light rail tram.  It‚Äôs right next door to the famous Palace Bar and a short walk to The Temple Bar.  The hotel is very comfortable, great staff.  Wile the listing says free WiFi in common areas the free WiFi is now through the hotel including the rooms.  

The rooms are small-ish (I had the standard twin) but comfortable with a nice bed.  The bar is small and of limited selection, but it‚Äôs also nice and appropriate for a small hotel. I had one meal there (fish chowder) which was excellent.

There can be some street noise at night since this is the bar district.  But it quiets down nicely around 11pm. My room was away from the Steet and it was never too bad.",5,2022,06,30
244,Excellent standard and central location,very easy check-in/check-out and friendly staff. Very historic building with charming atmosphere. Central location right in the Temple Bar district. Easy walking distance to the river Liffey and major attractions. Also bus transport nearby.,5,2022,06,29
244,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","The hotel is in a very good location, although we weren't there on a Friday, or Saturday night during peak party time.  When we arrived in Dublin at 6:00 AM Sunday morning, the area was literally covered with litter; it looked like the Bronx during the 1970s.  I guess that's typical for a Friday and Saturday night, so beware!  It was later cleaned up and the neighborhood was very fun.  

The hotel was clean and the staff friendly, although they weren't locals and didn't seem super knowledgeable.  Our room was a bit small, but otherwise nice.  I happened to notice while opening the windows (no air conditioning) that the curtains were ragged on the bottom and were not carefully placed on the curtain rod.  A bit messy.  I chalked it up to the Covid Days.  

There was trash removal on the adjoining streets during the night!  It was loud! 
 Otherwise it was quiet and we slept well.

It was fine.  I didn't think it was great.  Perhaps it was compared to other hotels in its price range.",3,2022,06,27
244,Ideal location for a stay in Dublin,Lovely hotel situated in the heart of Dublin. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms were newly renovated  and were very clean and comfortable . Lovely breakfast served in a bright and spacious dining room with plenty of options for breakfast. Definitely would stay here again,5,2022,06,24
244,Fleet Hotel,"Amazing hotel, beautiful lobby, close to everything you'd want to see in Dublin! Check in went smooth, and we got to our rooms shortly after arriving. Room was beautiful, although a bit small. We went down for some recommendations for restaurants and started talking with a different receptionist this time. Blonde girl, with braids (Sandra i think). Absolutely hilarious girl. She walked us through what there is to do on our trip to Dublin and gave us some tips about navigating the city. She recommended the restaurant in the hotel for food and the food was absolutely brilliant. The wait staff just lovely and delightful. We went back to the front desk again for a map and the same lady was there. She showed us on the map the best bars and restaurants for lunch for the next day and how to get to each of the attractions we wanted to see. We were there talking to her for good 10 minutes before we realised how much time has passed. It was hard to walk away from this lovely girl! She ordered us a taxi and we headed out to the city. The nightlife in Dublin is very close to the hotel which we loved! The breakfast in the hotel was amazing. Loads of options and the breakfast room was beautiful and bright. We went up to say thank you to the same receptionist from the day before on check out but she wasn't there unfortunately. Hopefully the staff working that morning passed on to her how much we appreciated her help. Amazing hotel, would definitely come back!! Especially for the lovely reception staff and the food.",5,2022,06,23
244,Nice place to stay,"The Fleet is a very nice hotel with friendly staff. We got in later than expected, and they were very accommodating. The rooms are not huge, but they‚Äôre very clean. The breakfast buffet is nice and has a wide variety of foods to choose from. There is a hair dryer available in your room, however the shower is small with only half a glass door. This seems to be typical for Ireland though.",4,2022,06,18
244,Great location,"If you are looking for a decent hotel in the middle of temple bar, this is for you. 

Pros
-excellent location 
- welcoming lobby and bar area 
- Spacious rooms 
- lovely breakfast, varied and plentiful 
- huge rainfall shower 

Cons
- no air conditioning, which when the towel rail is constantly on makes the room much too hot in summer
- very hot water with no warning signs - the first time we used the hot tap someone nearly scalded themselves 

We would definitely return if we went back to Dublin.",4,2022,06,15
244,Completely over-rated,"Of all the hotels I stayed in in Ireland, this was by far the worst.  The staff is very lackadaisical and unapologetic for their shortcomings.  I made a reservation for a double room (at an average of over $300 a night including taxes) and expected a certain level of comfort, which was not forthcoming because of the type of room they gave me.  The website does say that rooms would not be ready until 3pm, and I arrived at 12:30.  My room was not ready until 2:30pm.  I cannot fault them for that, and I did pester them a bit about getting my room, so I did not complain when I was given a room that was designed for someone in a wheelchair, including a roll-in shower and a toilet, the seat of which could not be raised for a man to urinate.  The next day, after some hard touring with a lot of walking, I returned to the hotel at 4:30, expecting to relax a bit before dinner, but my room had still not been cleaned.  I went down to the front desk to express my dismay and was told that rooms for people staying longer than one night are not cleaned until after 4pm.  Nobody had informed me of this when I had checked in.  At that point, I complained about the room and the fact that the staff just didn't seem to care.  The girl at the desk told me that most people prefer the room for disabled people because it's larger.  It's not!  The bathroom is because of the ludicrous roll-in shower.  I told her that she should have informed me of all these issues in advance. At no point was the word ""sorry"" ever heard from the desk staff.  At that point, the hotel manager came out to offer his apologies and to see how he could make things right.  He asked if I wanted to change rooms.  I said that I did not want to repack and that the only way he could make things right would be to inform all guests of these hotel eccentricities when they check in.  In all fairness, he was very nice and professional, and he invited me for a free drink at the bar and a complimentary dinner.  He also asked at what time I would like to access my room on the next day to make sure that it had been cleaned.  When I returned the next day at 5:30 or so, the room had been cleaned.  Over all, it was an unpleasant experience, and I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2022,06,05
244,Brilliant hotel and staff,5 out of 5. Brilliant hotel! We booked this hotel for a friend's hen party. The hotel staff were fantastic. I organised room decorations with the hotel a couple of weeks before - nothing was too much for them. The hotel is so handy and very central to Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  Dinner and breakfast were lovely. Will definitely be back.,5,2022,06,05
244,"Fun location, great staff","We took our adult kids to Dublin and stayed in Temple Bar.  The hotel is interesting, it kind of winds up and around with narrow hallways and stairs.  The room was decent size for Europe, and the bathroom clean and fine.  The staff was very helpful, the reception was nice with a bar.  They offer a breakfast buffet in the mornings as well.
If you love to bar hop and the festive atmosphere of Temple bar this is a great choice to stay.",4,2022,06,05
244,Great stay,I stayed in the budget single room. The room was more spacious than I was expecting. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast is fabulous! And you can't beat the location - central/walking distance to the main attractions. Staff were also very kind and welcoming.,5,2022,05,28
244,Tranquilly in the hustle of Dublin,"Walk into the beautiful lounge area, afternoon tea being served and welcoming staff. A quick check in and headed to my room, beautiful, plenty of natural light, original features and a bathroom that offered a great shower and room to actually swing a cat in!

I travel a lot and for me a good nights sleep and great breakfast always gets my vote - I had a totally restful sleep followed by a delicious breakfast of bacon (crispy) poached egg, mushroom and roasted tomatoes.

Great central location offering easy wanking to all the major shops. 

Would i stay again - absolutely,",5,2022,05,23
244,Wonderful Hotel in a great location,"We wrapped up a nearly 2 week visit to the North of Ireland by spending our last two days in Dublin at The Fleet.  We have another hotel that is our ""go-to"" for visits to Dublin but it was fully booked this time and we weren't sure about picking an alternate.  The Fleet turned out to be ideal for us.  Convenient not only to Temple Bar but also to all of the other important sites of Dublin. 
The hotel was extremely comfortable and well appointed with fabulous breakfast and a convenient lobby bar to relax after a day out and about.  As is the case with many older hotels worldwide, the floors are not contiguous meaning that there are various up and down short stairways to remain on a single floor.  Also a little difficult to arrive in a car due to all of the ""taxi only"" and ""bus only"" lanes around the hotel.
We will definitely put the Fleet on our list of hotels for future visits to Dublin.",5,2022,05,18
244,Lovely hotel on edge of Temple Bar,"Lovely hotel.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Nicely decorated and welcoming lobby.  Rooms were typical city sized with well appointed bathroom.  Saw a lot of reviews about street noise but did not hear any of it.  We had outside room, but they do offer inside rooms that are apparently more quiet.  Very good breakfast with made to order eggs.  In my opinion Temple bar is not a great area to stay in, but this hotel is on the edge of that area.",5,2022,05,15
244,Beautiful Hotel Noisy Location,"A beautiful hotel with a fabulous breakfast, gorgeous lobby with a bar to get a drink after a day of exploring. I hate to even add this because it's not the hotels fault its in the heart of temple bar but it is incredibly loud at night. If it is cool enough to close windows at night it would help but it wasn't quite cool enough when we stayed for that. The hotel staff, beautiful architecture, and charm make up for it but it is a factor to consider. Additionally rooms and bathrooms are very small but I don't spend much time in it outside of sleeping anyway when on vacation.",4,2022,05,09
244,Mid term night out in the city,Returned to the Fleet with a friend for a night out during the half term -we didn‚Äôt use the bar on this occasion as we had dinner plans in city centre -location excellent for this.stayed in a lovely elegance room and breakfast the next morning was excellent as it had been previously -few new additions also making it better !,5,2022,05,08
244,"Central location, good hotel","Very convenient, comfortable rooms (could use an extra hook for towels), helpful and friendly staff. Pleasant bar/lounge area.

We were here on a bank holiday weekend, and the taxi driver advised us to ask for a quiet room as the area can get quite loud. It was not possible to switch rooms, but in the end not an issue -- the rooms were perfectly quiet.",4,2022,04,30
244,Fabulous! Highly recommended ******,"We are here on Day 2 of a 3 day stay. 3 rooms , mixed age group from 24 to 67. Cannot recommend highly enough. Staff so welcoming , cannot do enough to help . Clean rooms, exceptional breakfast (book in advance for best deal ) . Location perfect and amazing afternoon tea . We will be returning!",5,2022,04,27
244,A decent stay in the center of Dublin,"The lobby, bar, and restaurant of the hotel are beautiful and appear to be newly renovated. While the design is pretty, the hotel is lacking a bit in other areas. Their cleaning schedule is random and erratic. They may come at 9 am or they may come at 4pm. This may not bother you, but when I walked into my hotel room at 4pm and heard a knock for cleaning, I was a bit irritated. Then, after the cleaning, another woman, who I assume was management knocked to ask if my room was cleaned. I feel like that‚Äôs something that should be handled between staff, but there‚Äôs a bit of a lack of communication it seems. Because I also asked the lady at the front desk for a breakfast to go for the next morning, because I would miss breakfast time. She agreed and told me to pick it up the next morning. The next morning, I went to pick it up, there was a not front desk attendant, and he had no idea what I was talking about. To me, little details like that separate 3 stars from 4. Also, it‚Äôs a bit loud, because it‚Äôs in the middle of temple bar, plus the heater is just extremely loud. If all of that doesn‚Äôt bother you, go for it. The location is spectacular!",3,2022,04,23
244,A Quiet Oasis in Busy Temple Bar Dublin,"The Fleet Hotel is a quiet oasis in hectic and noisy Temple Bar.  A wonderful lobby with glowing fireplaces make you want to spend an afternoon reading a book or chatting with a friend.  My room was generously proportioned and the front desk service was friendly and helpful.  The lobby is especially lovely, with a quiet bar and and a welcoming quality.  It's walking distance to many of the highlights of Dublin, and close enough to the action of Temple Bar, but far enough away to avoid the noise. If in Dublin again, I'd make the Fleet Hotel my home.  Oh, there is a lovely outdoor terrace which would be wonderful in good weather.",5,2022,04,22
244,Not what we expected.,"This hotel was our last stop on a road trip through Ireland.  We dropped our rental car as we didn't want to attempt maneuvering through Dublin.  Because of that, we had to carry all of our belongings from the trip through the hotel.  When we arrived we commented on how beautiful the lobby was, and were excited to get to our room.  The front desk person, told us to go to the 3rd floor and we'd have a few stairs to get to our room.  Keep in mind we have quite a bit of luggage, we headed up the lift to three, and proceeded down a flight of stairs, walked down a corridor and were lost.  With help from a housekeeper we found we missed our turn.  So we went down another corridor and down a few steps, to find that we needed to carry our luggage up 3 very narrow flights of steps to get to our room.  The room was clean, but a a bit dated.  The bathroom was small, poorly lit, and the shower drain did not drain as quickly as the shower water ran causing a spill over in to the floor with every shower. Every step was a loud creak from the floorboards, it didn't really bother us, I just felt bad for anyone that might be under us.

As for location, it's perfect for getting to Temple Bar, Trinity, and lots of other great tourist spots.  The staff was mostly helpful and friendly.",3,2022,04,21
244,Afternoon Tea in The Fleet,"I have had afternoon tea here twice in the last 6 weeks. Fabulous food at a reasonable price. Beautiful surroundings in the lobby by the open fire, pretty delph and very helpful and friendly staff. Cannot recommend enough.",5,2022,04,12
244,Absolutely lovely,"We had a fantastic time.  We had three rooms for our family and they were nicely appointed (although unsurprisingly small given their old-world location).  The lobby was hands-down the best lobby ever.  It was comfortable, warm, and we gathered there often just to relax.  It had real fires and a wonderful bar.  We were all sad to leave.  Lastly, the breakfast buffet was top notch.",5,2022,04,08
244,Don‚Äôt stay in room 350!!,"Had to move at midnight as room 350 is right under the hotel fans on the roof and it was honestly like a helicopter was permanently hovering over my room! I wear earplugs and that didn‚Äôt keep the noise out.
Was tired and grumpy having to move to a lesser room, with no air con so was extremely hot. I managed to negotiate a free breakfast for the inconvenience, but not sure I would have been offered it unless I asked!",3,2022,04,07
244,"Friendly Staff, comfortable room and good communication.",Just the one night stay but good communication about when to check in and an Iron available plus friendly Reception and late bar staff made this a comfortable and smooth stay. Guinness was good and went down a treat as a nightcap!,5,2022,03,28
244,A must stay‚Ä¶..,"Lovely stay at The Fleet‚Ä¶.if you  haven‚Äôt been‚Ä¶then it‚Äôs a must‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs building alone is worth the stay‚Ä¶not to mention the wonderful staff who make your visit very accommodating‚Ä¶..nothing is too much‚Ä¶.breakfast is a delight‚Ä¶.wonderful choice of continental‚Ä¶ and of course hot selection too‚Ä¶.a quick, but lovely stay!",5,2022,03,21
244,Lovely boutique hotel in a great location,"A great central hotel.  Everything was clean and well maintained. Lovely breakfast room.  Friendly, helpful staff. A couple of minor gripes would be that we were told the chef had gone home and we couldn't have dessert having prepaid for a two course half board. It was resolved however.  The room was nice, but a little noisy (from outside) and had 30 steps up and down to get to it once on the correct floor which we weren‚Äôt pre-warned about. Room wasn‚Äôt cleaned until late afternoon. However, these didn‚Äôt distract from an enjoyable stay overall and I would go back again.",5,2022,03,13
244,Wish I could give it 6 stars...,"Writing this review a year later because my friend & I can't stop reminiscing about how amazing our stay at The Fleet was! We stayed for 2 weeks during the peak of lockdown, so we certainly spent a lot of time at the hotel. Every single staff member went above and beyond during every point of our stay... they were truly some of the nicest people I have ever met! They helped me through some of my... not brightest moments in the temple bar district, and even gave us girls a little bag of Irish souvenirs because they knew how sad we were that we couldn't find a shop open. I really cannot emphasize enough how much the staff really made our stay an unforgettable one!!!

For a hotel breakfast, they have a lot of options! There was a variety of cold & hot options and I felt there was enough to not get sick of it even after 2 weeks. The rooms and hallways were always clean, and if we ever needed anything the front desk was just a call away. The room isn't huge, but it was big enough for 2 girls with huge suitcases! The room included a desk, the Wifi was good enough for us to both work & attend class remotely, and I never had any problems on Skype or Zoom calls.

I would fullheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to experience Temple Bar! It's location couldn't be better, right in the middle of everything. It was a short walk to Trinity, St Stevens Green, the Cathedral, etc. And even being in the middle of it all, the hotel has a robust security system that made us feel safe at all times. It was central to any place in the city we wanted to go to, and is close to many bus stops if you want to ~get out~. 

I really feel like we stumbled upon a hidden gem and I hope everyone who comes to Dublin gets to experience it! 

P.S. If you get room service, we personally recommend the chicken melt & caesar salad! Seriously.. we can't stop thinking about them, even a year later.",5,2022,03,12
244,Location and Character,Very central location near temple bar but away from the noise. It still has some original features which gives it nice character. which give the go bed it iWe have stayed twice in the last few months and rooms are spotless and comfortable and contain everything you‚Äôll require. Breakfast is really good with a wide selection. We were greeted on both occasions by Federico who is very helpful and pleasant and also other staff we encountered were all pleasant. There is a car park nearby and hotel residents get reduced rates. So overall this hotel is a good choice.,5,2022,03,04
244,Good services but facilities not worth the price,"The breakfast was great and the location was very central and convenient.

However the spa facilities are not attached to the hotel and we had issues with the water temperature in the shower for the room. It was way too hot. The views were pretty awful from most of the corridors which overlooked rooftops that were not well managed

The product was not worth what we paid.",3,2022,03,02
244,Salem is a legend,"Had a terrific stay at the Fleet Hotel. 
All the staff were brilliant but a special thanks to Salem. What a legend. Friendly, approachable and great local knowledge.

244,First rate hotel,"From quick, friendly and efficient pre-booking Email correspondence thanks to Ashleigh through to excellent reception staff, our stay at the Fleet hotel was excellent. Spotlessly clean. Better size than expected bedroom. Lovely boutique and restful lounge area which is as good as pictures suggest - we indulged in a cocktail and hot whiskey (note the 'e' for a proper spelling of the drink!) Breakfast I would describe as superb both with respect to variety and freshness which included freshly cooked fried eggs on my request. Hotel is extremely central to Dublin attractions with wide choice of pubs/restaurants/supermarkets seconds walk away. Highly recommend and would return without hesitation.",5,2022,02,25
244,Wonderful Stay,"I would highly recommend this hotel. The hotel is in the middle if aTemplebar, so close to loads of nightlife and resturands. Hotel so clean and  fresh. Staff are  friendly and helpful. Manager was very kind and

A pure gentleman.",5,2022,02,15
244,Ticked all the boxes,"This hotel is ideally suited for those wishing to enjoy all that the city centre has to offer.

244,Warm welcome,"We were looking for a midweek get-away in Dublin. We decided to go with The Fleet and I have to say it was a great spot.  Very central, we received a warm welcome on arrival and check-in was straight forward. Many thanks to Marko who really made sure our stay was perfect and was accommodating to our every need. The overall experience was perfect. The fleet is  possibly the best hotel for a mid-week break in Dublin. Thank you to all of the amazing and friendly staff.",5,2022,02,04
244,Lovely hotel just noisy in the night,"Lovely hotel right in the centre of Dublin. Hotel is lovely and clean and the room and bathrooms was nice. 
Only downside was it was noisy in the night, may have been where our room was positioned but we were woken up at 3am by bins being emptied.
We wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sleep if we didn‚Äôt happen to have earplugs with us.",4,2022,02,04
244,Fantastic from start to finish,"I booked the hotel for my wife and I as we had a hard January with some bad news throughout and needed a break, it was also our anniversary.

244,Last minute night away..,I decided to take my mother & 2 kids away for the night to Dublin City as its been awhile for obvious reasons! We had a great time.  We were greeted at he desk by a lovely gentleman. The reception area was beautifully decorated. Our room was comfortable & very clean. There was an outdoor terrace which the kids loved! It would be lovely to sit out in it in the summer. The breakfast room is nice & bright. The breakfast was nicely laid out with hot & cold buffet. The staff were very friendly & helpful. It was a short stay but I hope we get back up soon. Thanks for looking after us!,4,2022,01,25
244,Value for money and an unbeatable city-centre location,"The hotel is in a fantastic location, close to everything. It was spotlessly clean and really comfortable.

Room was great with a nice comfortable bed and clean bathroom.  Shower was very good too.  
Dinner was very nice with well cooked food and staff friendly but not over baring.  
Residents bar was great, comfortable, reasonably priced and not overly busy.  Probably a lot busier in peak season.

Breakfast was very nice.  Lots to choose room with hot and cold foods and all well prepared.  Staff also seemed to be removing hot food that had been sitting for a while and replacing with freshly cooked food.",5,2022,01,06
244,Great last minute find!,"What a lovely spot! The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful- especially Marko! The food at the restaurant was tasty and the cocktails delicious. The Christmas ambiance in the lobby was cozy. The room had everything we needed for a nights stay, was clean and the bathroom modern. Would certainly be back.",5,2022,01,05
244,We always choose the Fleet,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Fleet a few times now, but let me assure you the customer service there is amazing, starting off with the lovely receptionist Isabella who checked us in and all the waiting staff. Marko was extremely helpful with tips on what could we as a couple do in Dublin, and always made sure our stay was going great. Rooms were spacious enough with very comfortable beds, allowed us to get a good night sleep. The bathrooms were absolutely stunning (possible my favourite part). We will be definitely coming back again in 2022. Thanking the Fleet Hotel for such an amazing stay that they provide each time",5,2022,01,05
244,Great location in the city centre,"Stayed here with my friend for a city break. Amazing staff who are always on hand for any requests. The lobby is beautiful, the rooms are modern & fresh. Breakfast is amazing value and I would highly recommend it ! We also had dinner here on one evening - beautiful dishes, almost not expected from a hotel restaurant, as in many Dublin hotels can be very hit and miss.

All in all this is a great value hotel and one that stands out to me on the Dublin Hotel scene!",5,2022,01,05
244,Lovely Christmas stay at The Fleet,"We spent a lovely 6 nights at The Fleet. It‚Äôs location can‚Äôt be beat; the lobby/bar is beautiful and invites you to kick back and relax. We were delighted to drink at such a hotel bar given that due to Covid restrictions the city bars closed at 8pm. Moreover, the service was impeccable; the staff very helpful. No issues whatsoever. Would stay again!",5,2022,01,02
244,Awesome stay with friendly and hospitable staff!,I stayed at the fleet hotel over Christmas for my honeymoon. It was truly the best experience as the hotel was so cute and charming in a great location downtown Dublin. The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly throughout our stay. By far exceeded my expectations!,5,2021,12,31
244,Mr Mrs,"Another beautiful stay at the fleet. We just love this hotel, its staff, and the hotel its self. Always so friendly with its old world meets the modern  world charm. Always so clean fresh, relaxing and located right in the heart of Old Dublin. Really don't waste your time booking any where else.",5,2021,12,30
244,Annual Family Gathering,"Myself and extended family booked to stay at the fleet street hotel on the 23rd December. We book an overnight stay in a city hotel on this date every year. This is the first time we booked this hotel and it couldn't have gone any better, considering the covid restrictions currently in place. The hotel lobby was decorated like a scene from a dickens novel, setting the scene for a festive family evening around the fire. The restaurant whilst adhereing to all covid restrictions in place, made the evening about what was possible for our family evening meal, and not about what covid prevented us from enjoying. The staff at this hotel, from reception to the restaurant and breakfast room are an example of customer service at its best. Its not the hotel ( although it was beautifully decorated) that make a stay memorable, it's the people that work there that work so hard to make visitors (like our family) stay, such a great experience.  Being from Dublin I am familiar with what Dublin has to offer it's visitors, I can advise that this hotel is located within walking distance of most city centre attractions. Public transport  is located round the corner from the hotel. You can walk out the door of this hotel and literally step into temple bar ( bars and restaurants too many to mention) and within 5 mins walking distance be at the top of Grafton street (shopping area). The staff at this hotel are a credit to themselves for the work they do. Will definitely re-book this hotel again.",5,2021,12,27
244,Fleet Hotel Dublin,"A friend recommended The Fleet Hotel to me. A lot of care has obviously been put into the interior design of the Hotel, there is an understated luxury about the place. The reception area has a lovely lounge and bar and a restaurant is attached. We were received by a very professional receptionist, the majority of the staff were welcoming and friendly . The hotel is centrally located at the top of Temple Bar . To be honest this will be my hotel of choice when staying in Dublin again. If you are coming by car the car parking is at the discounted rate of 19 euro a day. We both really enjoyed our stay.",4,2021,12,19
244,Wheelchair Friendly,"When I made a reservation at the Fleet Hotel, I was a bit nervous about how accessible it is. 
The building is an old Victorian house in Central Dublin. Generally those kind of houses are not fully and well accessible but I was surprised on how the establishment put a lot of effort on making this place accessible for people with limited mobility.

The bathroom, which is in my opinion the most important area to check the  accessibility when booking a hotel room, is very good.Accessible hotel
This place has been remodeled recently and we can clearly see that they focused on making it accessible with all the security and safety we can expect.

I would like to say thank you to the amazing staff always were ready to help!!!

You can‚Äôt follow my journey on my Instagram account @determined_traveler",5,2021,12,18
244,Nice bar/reception area but very cold room,"the hotel is very well placed and very pretty with all its Christmas decorations. The staff is nice enough and the breakfast very good.
My room was very cold though - even with a spare blanket -  and it was impossible to increase the temperature.",4,2021,11,30
244,Would definitely never return,"Can‚Äôt believe this standard of room is still available in 2021, appalling. Room tiny, freezing and dirty!  Bathroom so outdated there‚Äôs no way I would use the shower! Wouldn‚Äôt stay here again if I was paid",1,2021,11,27
244,Lovely visit with friend ,"Mid week visit with my friend -staying in lovely twin room on 2nd floor - very nice breakfast and friendly staff -nicely decorated for Christmas.reception area is lovely to relax and have a drink by the fire.good vibe around Dublin -,it is nice to be back ",5,2021,11,25
244,"Excellent stay, will definitely stay again","Stayed for 1 night in the fleet street hotel, the atmosphere is so welcoming, reception area is inviting with cosy fires and decorated lovely with Christmas decor, 
Rooms are clean, while a little tight on space, have everything that you need, with comfortable beds. Breakfast was lovely, lots of choices with continental and a hot buffet. The adjoining cafe also has the relaxed and inviting atmosphere with tasty food, All Staff were efficient, friendly and very helpful throughout the hotel and cafe.
This is my second time to stay in the fleet hotel, and I will definitely be back, thanks a million for making the whole experience enjoyable, welcoming and relaxing, the perfect getaway!",5,2021,11,25
244,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Temple Bar. ,"Beautiful hotel!
Reception area is exceptionally beautiful. Breakfast room is very well appointed.
Rooms are not large, but very tastefully done. Shower is excellent and bathrooms are a good size. Buffet breakfast was lovely, as were staff. Reception staff were not the friendliest, either on check in, or check out, unfortunately, but as those were short  interactions, we didn't let it impact our stay. ",5,2021,11,23
244,Good hotel in the city centre,"Good and cosy hotel in the middle of the city centre. Perfect location, close to musea, shops, restaurants and pubs. Nice breakfast and beautiful lounge with bar. Friendly staff. We will definitely go there again.",4,2021,11,18
244,Nice Hotel Near Temple Bar,"This hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin, right where Temple Bar starts.  It is a very nice building, in good shape and has that higher-class feel to it.  The rooms are good, compact but have everything you need and have very nice bathroom with Italian shower. The only minuses for the actual room are the bad mattress which I would expect only in a 2 star hotel and the strange pillows.  The room has not only normal Irish outlets but also one mainland Europe outlet, very useful for visitors! If your room is facing the inner area, expect a constant noise from the big machine outside.  The reception desk definitely needs some kind of sign to guide guests to it, as it isn't quite clear if one needs to go up the stairs or into the bar area first.  The staff in the breakfast area were great (especially Cecilia!) but the reception staff were a bit odd. Lastly, the breakfast buffet  selection, although very satisfying, could be improved with more choices of bread and cold cuts (very limited as to what you can put on your bread/toast).",4,2021,11,16
244,"Wonderful Lobby, terrible mattress","Quiet end of Temple bar. Well lovely lobby seating area and bar, excellent whiskey selection. Quite an abyss of a hotel, got lost down the room corridors. The room! Good size, kettle, coffee, tea etc. No Iron / Ironing board, but I'm sure reception would provide one. Bath / shower, adequate, albeit a little tiered. Towels all good. Vey hard mattress and pillows 1/10!! Woken early hours due to recycling bottle collection. You wouldn't want a room on the high-street to Temple bar. Breakfast very good, plenty of choice and a hot buffet. All in all 3 star, but biggest let down the bed mattress & pillows...both very uncomfortable, I'm afraid.",3,2021,11,12
244,Global disappointment,"Sorry to say but NOTHING good for the hotel.
Sanitary broken, the room was not that clean, we ask to change the room because of the noise in the street (very noisy) and the reception pretended to be full, Breakfast room was empty though‚Ä¶
Would never recommend and go back there.
Price is expensive.",1,2021,11,10
244,Luxury perfection delivering exceptional service and value for money,"Every time I fly into Ireland I will always stay at The Fleet in Dublin as it ticks all the boxes. A Tastefully restored modern luxury hotel that pays homage to its 19th century history with the fine attention to details such as the original fireplace, coving and wooden window shutters in room 156 instead of standard curtains you would expect in a modern hotel. 
My en-suite bedroom was perfectly cleaned, well proportioned with a large comfortable bed, double shower and all the modern conveniences you would expect in a Five Star hotel including a large flat screen TV that‚Äôs at least 50‚Äù.  I love the quirky old style telephone and the additional extra power points for charging my laptop, tablet and phone etc. 
Located a short walk from O‚ÄôConnell Bridge on the doorsteps of Templebar it‚Äôs the ideal place for the corporate traveler and tourist alike. Nearby is the Fleet Street car park that allows you easy access to all the main traffic routes in and around Dublin. 
Opposite the hotel is a Tesco‚Äôs for all your forgotten items on the main thoroughfare of Templebar, which is one of the main destination spots in Dublin. 
If you feel like exploring the culture and main attractions in Dublin The Fleet is the best place to base yourself as around the corner is the National Wax museum,  Trinity College, Stephen‚Äôs Green, The GPO, Christchurch Cathedral all within easy walking distance plus The Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery are also easily accessible from here. 
All the main shopping and nightlife attractions are all on the Fleet‚Äôs doorsteps too. 
Within the hotel you will find the 1920‚Äôs Bar serving creamy Guinness, tempting cocktails, delicious and tasty fare. Next door opposite the reception desk you can enjoy a nightcap or coffee in an understated sophisticated lounge which is my favorite place to relax. 
The breakfast room is downstairs near the business center and I‚Äôm delighted to see that despite all the restrictions enforced by the pandemic that a full Irish breakfast is still available with all the safety protocols in place. 
All the tables had sanitizer dispensers and the staff were consistently cleaning all the equipment and fixtures. The cereals were individually portioned and wrapped. The flow of guests was well controlled, organized and overall I felt comfortable and safe here and able to enjoy my breakfast at ease. 
Aside from all this luxury, I cannot mention the staff and managers enough for all their hospitality, professionalism and friendly service. 
And I look forward to returning again very soon",5,2021,11,06
244,Excellent stay,"Had a great time here. The hotel is on the edge of Temple  Bar The few minutes walk to shops at O‚ÄôConnell Street and Grafton Street.
You can walk to Dublin Castle and the University.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and let us in early and provided us with everything we needed.
The breakfast was excellent. Lots of choice.
Room had everything we needed and if anything was too warm . 
Would recommend staying here .",5,2021,11,05
244,Let down,The main reception is beautiful however that is where it stops. Our room on the second floor felt very outdated and had a horrible damp smell. It was freezing the whole weekend with no way of turning the heating on or off. My partner paid ‚Ç¨40 euros for some decorations as it was my birthday and all they supplied was a banner and about 3 balloons. They did however give us a brownie with happy birthday on the plate although it could have been there for a week it tasted that stale. The room was dirty and had paint chipped away on the bathroom walls. The taps were falling apart and Our towels had holes in them. There was no cleaning service the whole time we were there and had to use the holy towel and slept in bed sheets our entire visit. We were right next the elevator which made a Big Bang every time someone used it and could hear every conversation of the people in the corridor. As well as that the noise from the street was so loud we barely had any sleep the whole time. Would not stay here again.,1,2021,11,02
244,Wonderful stay once again,We had a one night stay. It is a fabulous hotel in a perfect location. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast was delicious. Very clean and the rooms a very nice. Have stayed before and never any complaints and will definately stay again üëå. ,5,2021,10,31
244,Lovely hotel,"We had a wonderful one night stay at the Fleet - it's a perfect spot to explore Dublin and the rooms were really comfortable and modern. We stayed in an elegance double room, which was very spacious. The bar was great for a pre-dinner drink (they even made me an off-menu mocktail!) and breakfast was really tasty.",5,2021,10,31
244,Top hotel,"Top hotel..... great value... superb lounge and breakfast offering. Friendly and professional staff

Close to all the temple bar pubs and restaurants .....

Recommended .... excellent option for a trip to dublin.

Top place..............",5,2021,10,28
244,What a gem....,"Absolutely beautiful - and spotlessly shiny clean.    Elegant, comfortable, lovely staff - so welcoming.
I desperately needed a cup of tea after my coach trip from Galway.   
No trouble.    And it's so central - just off O‚ÄôConnell Bridge.   One min walk to the AirCoach stop for my return to the airport.   My bedroom/bathroom too were immaculate.

I didn‚Äôt have dinner as was meeting family but breakfast was scrumptious.   And the staff so attentive.  Almost reluctant to tell anyone about it in case it‚Äôs not available next time I come to Dublin....

There are some questions below about languages spoken.     I met several staff who were not Irish but spoke excellent English as well as their native tongues.  The restaurant manager was from Brazil so speaks Portuguese as well as excellent English.",5,2021,10,26
244,Very nice hotel,"Friendly staff, great location, comfortable bed, strong water pressure, and excellent breakfast..  didn‚Äôt get to try the restaurant.. the bar does a good Negroni too.. only welcome addition would be a gym on site.. will be my go to when next in Dublin",5,2021,10,26
244,Location!!,"The location is perfect, right in the city center and still a multistory car park just next dors (almost). Lobby looks faboulous and breakfast i excellent. nice friendly staff. Simple and small room but you have everything you need.",4,2021,10,24
244,"Nice hotel, noisy room","Really nice hotel, friendly staff, warm atmosphere. The room was quite spacious, clean and modern. The bathroom was clean and modern as well. The lobby was inviting, with a fire and comfortably furniture. The only negative was that I had a room facing the street. It was quite noisy and I woke up several times during the night.",4,2021,10,24
244,Dublin weekend,"Me and my wife stayed here for a long weekend in July, we travelled by train from Newry and when we arrived at Connolly Station we took a taxi to the hotel which was reasonable for price, on our return we walked, it was only about 15 mins, The hotel check in was simple and we dropped our bags in the room, the room i thought was fairly small eg the bathroom door couldn't fully open because it caught the bed. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet at night and there were tea making facilities available. After getting ready we went to the lounge for a drink, table service at that time because of covid, the bar area is very nice with comfortable seats. The hotel is well located on the south of the Liffey just on the edge of the Temple Bar area  so near plenty of pubs and restaurants. We went to the Dublinia museum which was only about 15/20 mins walk and found it very informative and would recommend for a few hours visit. A lot of the public park areas unfortunately were taken over by public drinking which could be off putting and we noticed a lot of blatent drug use in public areas and also one night a big disturbance outside Fitzgeralds on Aston Quay, what we also noticed was the dirt of the city with lots of litter and even the amount of bags plastic bottles etc floating in the Liffey itself as well as that the unkempt streets with weeds and grass growing ,small things to some maybe but very easy to control if the effort was put in. In saying all that we had a good weekend the pubs were open and the weather was sunny and warm so everyone was drinking outside which created a really good atmosphere in the pedestrianised places. Conclusion, would i go back, answer yes Dublin is a great city if expensive but probably I would base myself somewhere else .",4,2021,10,22
244,Excellent Service at the Hotel / Dining not so good,"Stayed her for 1 night. The service at reception was excellent, they had my room ready early and the room was of a very high standard. The hotel was spotless and the communal areas comfy and cosy.
However the service in the restaurant was below par with it taking them over an hour to serve our food and serving the table next to us first who hadn‚Äôt arrived until half an hour after us !! The food was also sub standard compared to the Hotel. 
In saying this the young man who dealt with our complaint was excellent and gave us the drinks on the house and couldn‚Äôt be more apologetic, he was however the second staff member we raised our concerns with as the first one unfortunately did nothing!!
On the whole I would definitely stay at this hotel again but may choose a different venue to eat at",4,2021,10,13
244,perfect boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The rooms are comfortable, but it's the lobby, bar and restaurant that are excellent.  Elegant and beautifully furnished with two cozy fireplaces.  The staff was always willing to help with anything we needed.",5,2021,10,06
244,Central location,"Great location if you want to be in the center of all the activities but can be an issue because of the noise.  Our room was in the first floor and facing an alley.  There were a lot fights going on in the alley.  If noise is any issue for you, request a room that is not facing the street or alley.  
Beautiful public spaces but the rooms were small and outdated.  No air conditioning so you will need to open the windows for fresh air.  Breakfast was very good.  Staff were helpful.  The hotel has a lot of dining and shopping options nearby.   Most attraction are within walking distance.  There is a Tesco right in front of the hotel.  It is in a very convenient area.",4,2021,10,03
244,Very central hotel,"Clean well furnished rooms. Room a bit on small side but it‚Äôs a city centre hotel. Breakfast lovely.

Few issues, no bath, rooms need better soundproofing and only 8 tv channels.
Some staff were bit stand offish and hard to understand. While others couldn‚Äôt be more helpful.",4,2021,10,03
244,Weekend stay,"Rooms, beds, bathroom tight. Stuffy, no air, so limited open air ventilation....but, if on alley, extreme noise from party goers and drunks/fights.
Breakfasts are good, with attentive staff.
Restaurant food is fine, but staff inconsistent in their attention
Front desk staff good...staff appear to rotate every few weeks
Location good for Trinity, park, temple bar",4,2021,09,30
244,Elegant Hotel in a very convenient Area. ,We recently stayed in the Fleet Hotel and were very pleased with our stay. The public areas have all  been renovated and are beautiful  The staff are very  helpful and professionally.  The hotel is located in a very central Area close to Grafton Street and the Teple bar. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2021,09,27
244,El hotel m√°s amable en el coraz√≥n de Dubl√≠n / The friendliest hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Me aloj√© en The Fleet del 17 al 23 de agosto de 2021. El hotel se encuentra en la entrada de Temple Bar, y a tres minutos andando del principio de la calle O'Connell; la ubicaci√≥n es inmejorable. Todo el personal con el que trat√© fue extremadamente amable y servicial. Quiero felicitar especialmente a las personas que atend√≠an el comedor por la ma√±ana, que siempre me recib√≠an con una sonrisa y la mayor simpat√≠a. Me han atendido maravillosamente en este hotel y espero que tengan habitaciones disponibles la pr√≥xima vez que viaje a Dubl√≠n.
La √∫nica pega que podr√≠a poner es que,  al estar situado en una zona de ocio, las noches del fin de semana sub√≠a bastante ruido a la habitaci√≥n. No fue muy grave porque los pubs cierran relativamente pronto, pero la pr√≥xima vez pedir√© una habitaci√≥n que d√© a un patio interior si es posible.
PS - El jab√≥n de cortes√≠a es el mejor que he encontrado en un hotel en varios a√±os, y el t√© de la ma√±ana era exquisito.

I stayed at The Fleet from August 17-23, 2021. The hotel is located at the entrance to Temple Bar, and is a three-minute walk from the beginning of O'Connell Street - you can't beat the location. All the staff I dealt with were extremely friendly and helpful. I want to especially congratulate the people who attended the breakfast room in the morning, since they always received me with a smile and the greatest kindness. I have been treated wonderfully by this hotel's staff and I hope they have rooms available next time I travel to Dublin.
The only downside I can see is that, being located in a leisure area, the room was quite noisy on weekend nights. It was not very serious because the pubs close relatively early, but next time I will ask for a room that faces an inner courtyard if possible.
PS - The complimentary soap is the best I have found in a hotel in several years, and the morning tea was exquisite.",5,2021,09,20
244,"Excellent room, breakfast & service","Just a quick stay, one night in Dublin,  and I couldn't have chosen a nicer place to stay. The room was clean and had everything I needed. The breakfast was hot and delicious with huge choice. Mostly though, the staff were fantastic, so welcoming and friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend.",5,2021,09,14
244,Highly recommended,"Recently stayed in this beautiful hotel. The staff were so friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. 
Food & cocktails were top class. It‚Äôs in a great location also. Our room was fab and had a spacious bathroom with an amazing shower. Spotlessly clean.

Highly recommend staying here.

244,Lovely hotel with an even lovelier staff,"The Fleet hotel is a lovely hotel, with comfortable rooms and an excellent location. What makes the Fleet hotel stand out is the staff, with each member of the hotel crew being nicer than the last. A massive shout out to the lovely man working behind reception at night time who was so kind to my friend and I, making us toast and delivering it to our rooms. We can't wait to go back.",5,2021,09,05
244,Extremely Welcoming Staff,"Recently visited The Fleet Hotel, from the moment we arrived & until we left, we were made extremely welcome. That goes for all the staff we met, everyone went above and beyond for us. 

The hotel was very clean, and had a real boutique feel to it. We stayed in a Deluxe room, which had a huge bathroom, with a large tub also. 

Dinner and drinks were really nice, and very reasonably priced for Dublin. 

The cocktails are a must if you're having drinks. 

Nearly forgot the breakfast, option of poached eggs, award winning sausages etc. Really good. 

Thanks again guys, and see you again soon.

Daith√≠.",5,2021,08,31
244,Boutique but not in a good way,"We clearly caught them on a bad day but this hotel has huge management and staff training issues. There is no effective communication between departments and it is a chaotic and unpleasant environment to stay in. 

Arrived shortly after 1pm having travelled through the night, so exhausted. Checked in (full payment taken for 4 nights) and after some discussion between reception and the restaurant (6 feet away) it was established lunch was still being served. (Why wouldn‚Äôt it be at 1pm?) So we made our way into the restaurant to eat and wait for our rooms to be ready for occupation at 3pm. Lunch was average but fine and just after 3pm we went to collect our room keys. This however turned out to be an unreasonable expectation, as at The Fleet,  check in time is between 3pm and 11pm. The receptionist became quite defensive and I didn‚Äôt appreciate her assertive over-talking style. Having arrived almost 2 hours earlier, I expected some sort of initiative to have been employed to get the rooms ready. We were the only guests around in the reception and restaurant so people were not queuing up for rooms at this time. The Manager came to talk and asserted this is normal in the hotel industry and that as the hotel had been full the day before and they were also short staffed they were quite rightly, exercising their stated flexible check in slots, yep.. 3pm to 11pm. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and have never come across this policy or customer service style before. I imagine full occupancy is the goal and whilst I sympathise with staffing issues, it‚Äôs not really my problem having booked weeks in advance and paid in full. I had read 3pm to 11pm on the website but took it to mean check in not available after 11pm not that it was a sort of time lottery depending on hotel occupancy and staff levels. Eventually 2 serviced rooms were found and we made our way through the labyrinth-like maze of corridors and stairs to get some much needed sleep.
I didn‚Äôt personally find the elegance rooms elegant. The diamant√© studded head boards and tacky wood veneer furniture is not to my taste at all, they also didn‚Äôt feel fully clean. 
Breakfast was very good, although chaotic, but definitely the high point of our short time at the Fleet. 
The reception area and bar are quite pleasant but the upstairs of the hotel is a different matter. The quality is just not there. It has all been very carefully photographed. 
We cut short our stay at the Fleet after 1 night (checkout was also farcical) and moved to The Morgan, which, having a more traditional approach to the hospitality industry suited us much better.

244,"Fleet Hotel in a great location, in one of the iconic Bewley's  cafe buildings","My 2 sisters and I shared a family room. We bought the 'Summer Sizzlers' package of welcome drink, bed & breakfast, which was good value. The bar has beautiful stained glass windows. The staff were friendly & helpful.

244,Exceptional Staff during an exceptional stay!,"Stayed at The Fleet at the weekend to celebrate 4 milestone birthdays within our family of aunts and nieces.

From booking via email with Mike to check out with Pavla, we were blew away with this gorgeous hotel and their staff. They could not have did enough for us to make our stay extra special.

Location was absolutely perfect - no taxis required. walking distance to bus station, all the shops and bars.

Entire hotel and room decor was nicer than some 5* hotels I‚Äôve stayed in recently. We felt very safe during our stay - all rooms and public spaces were very clean and you could see staff cleaning these areas, handles and doors during the day.

We booked their bed dinner and breakfast package -  there was something for everyone on the dinner menu - full of variety and absolutely delicious, clean plates all round which can be difficult to achieve in a large group! 

We were able to get a late breakfast sitting and again the selection was fantastic - the waiter even come around our table with fresh sausages and bacon from the kitchen.. service none of us had ever experienced at any hotel before!

We want to thank the hotel for everything they did for us - especially Mike, Samantha, Pavla, Kevin and Sarah. We can‚Äôt wait to return!",5,2021,08,19

244,Fabulous Family Weekend Away,"Beautiful hotel in such a central location. All staff from house keeping up to management were extremely friendly and went out of their way to make you feel so comfortable. Front of house staff Pavla and Sam gave us such a warm welcome which added to our trip. The room was very modern and comfortable, perfect for our family. There was a welcome plate and beverages on arrival which was a lovely surprise as we were celebrating a special anniversary. We loved the idea of self service breakfast which offers such a variety of delicious food. We all felt very safe when staying in The Fleet as the Covid procedures in place of the highest standard. We will definitely be visiting again. Thank you for a great weekend",5,2021,08,18
244,Excellent personal service at this hotel,"The hotel was in a great location close to all the bars and restaurants in Temple Bar area. Upon arrival Pavla at reception went out of her way to assign me a great room, make all the reservations for breakfast and taxi service. Unfortunately it was raining too hard to walk very far so I decided to eat in the bar at the hotel. Pavla made the reservation and arranged for Marco to take care of me at dinner. Marco was excellent. He guided me through the menus choices according to my tastes and appetite. His recommendations were perfect. The next morning when I arrived for breakfast I was again met by Pavla who confirmed my taxi pick up time and guided me to the breakfast room. She introduced me to Sevtap who is in charge of the breakfast room. She made sure I had the hot foods immediately available and also the continental breakfast foods that were extensive and very tasty. As a note to hotel management, Pavla, Marco and Sevtap are a real asset to your hotel. They are the face of the hotel and represent the hotel exceedingly well. They deserve some recognition for their efforts.",5,2021,08,16
244,Great location to Temple Bar and shopping,"Pretty lobby and bar. Friendly staff and very helpful. They stored our luggage until our rooms were ready. The rooms are regular with nothing extra- no coffee, tea but we did have 2 bottles of water on table. The rooms are very small with no temp control, small window opens up a small amount but we did call down for a fan, which makes a big difference. 
The shower was really nice, plenty of water pressure and hot water.  There are no ‚Äúface rags‚Äù wash clothes so take your own , along with tissues. 
You are given room cards, this gets you to your floor using elevator or walk up and card needed to open double doors to get onto your floor.",4,2021,08,15
244,Great hotel and perfect location,"Very beautiful and in the heart of Dublin. A short walk to everything you want and need, including the Guinness Storehouse. Stayed in the Elegance Double Room, which I would recommend. However, a bit of a maze finding the room, especially when drunk; and couldn't imagine it to be very accessible for some people.  Only wish the room had a bath, but it is a historic building. With the room, robes and slippers should have been provided but they weren't, however, we didn't challenge it. 

Stayed for a long weekend with my partner. Location can be a little noisy of course, but that's expected when you're in the location. If you can't beat them... join them. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking. 

Booked prior to COVID, easily rearranged and cancelled for free with no hassle. And they even let me rebook again and guaranteed the same rate.",5,2021,08,12
244,I would stay again!!,"Nice hotel well located in Temple Bar. The ft desk staff was a mixed bag of great and not so good (had an issue with miscommunication about the breakfast times, which lead to a bit of frustration)  but was understanding when I missed my connection in the UK showed up a day late! the lobby and dining areas are beautiful, it gives you a break from the pubs and is classier than most establishments in the area. (Bar staff is delightful btw). Rooms are ok. I‚Äôve stayed in traditional and chain hotels before in Ireland I would say this is middle. My room was an updated one but I would say it would need another update.. my bed was super uncomfortable it slanted to the side, it felt like I was sleeping on hill. Water took forever to warm up. Couple of negatives. My room was located next to an ally super, super noisy all night and into the wee am with pub goers. The music in the lobby was weird. I left at six am and the guy was playing heavy metal club music. Breakfast room lady was not very friendly,helpful, or delightful was kind of rude and annoyed I was there first thing.  I would stay here again the awkward beat out the few negatives.",4,2021,08,10
244,Overnight Stay,Had an overnight stay with my family recently.  The Hotel is ideally located in Dublin City Centre.  We had a triple room.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.

Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to any of my friends or family and will stay again next time in the City.,5,2021,08,10
244,Wonderful hotel and friendly staff,"This was a trip I took on my own and I have never felt more welcome. The staff were so warm and friendly, eat and drank in the restaurant and was looked after by Sarah and Keith they chatted away to me each night and made sure I was ok for a drink. Both Sarah and Keith 10 out of 10 on their own I will definitely be returning as it was such a warm friendly atmosphere.",5,2021,08,09

244,As good as any 5 Star Hotel!,"I stayed here for the first time for 2 nights this week for business. I chose the Fleet based on its central location and its B&B rate.  The location is perfect if you want to be right in the heart of the city, you can walk to any part of town. On entrance you walk through the main front bar to get to reception. The bar is one of the nicest Hotel bars I have ever been in. The furniture, the Decor the layout etc, its very inviting.  My room was above average for a city centre Hotel, it was spotless and of a high standard in terms of pillows, mattress, utilities. Breakfast was a cold and hot buffet in again a very clean and well run restaurant. 
Finally the staff, all members of staff are clearly trained to make the customer feel welcome and have made the Fleet my number one choice in the city.",5,2021,07,23

The Fleet's location is unbeatable with O'Connell Street, Temple Bar and Grafton Street all seconds away. From the moment you walk through the door, the experience is wonderful.  The lobby area is plush and inviting, the bar is great craic and the rooms are amazing.  We stayed in two rooms in the older part of the hotel. The were beautifully decorarted and even had quaint little fireplaces and window shutters.  The breakfast was fantasic (and I have eaten a lot of hotel brekfasts) and we ate in the hotel one evening which was also really excellent.  But what made this hotel was the team.

We booked a two-night stay with dinner on one of the evenings. As with everything over the weekend our dinner was exquisite. On the second day we were looking for a TV screen to watch a rugby match and with restrictions there was nowhere showing live TV. One of the staff in the hotel, without any fuss set us up in a conference room with a screen and bar service...!!! This was the level of service we experienced for the duration of our stay.",5,2021,07,12
244,Absolutely Fantastic!,"Post- lockdown I have been uncertain how a hotel stay would go but this place has got it perfect. When you walk into the main lobby you have an instant ‚ÄòWow‚Äô moment. The hotel has been decorated to a fantastic. Standard.

Rooms are nice and spacious & the beds are extremely comfortable. The food is fantastic, well priced and so tasty! The drinks are well priced too for the location.  Great selection for breakfast too. 

I had read a few reviews about noise levels being an issue and to be honest apart from some traffic noise there wasn‚Äôt much noise for the busy area the hotel is in!

On entering the hotel the aroma is gorgeous, we were then greeted by 2 lovely girls at reception and given our rooms.
The rooms were nice and clean with an amazing shower.
In my sisters room was a treat plate for her birthday and 2 bottles of processco [full of bubbles ;) ]
We had a gorgeous meal in the restaurant. The staff were very friendly and so helpful. I think it could have been Kevin serving us but whoever was working the 3rd July went out of there way to make it a really special birthday celebration for my sister.
A big shout out to Keenan and Salim, fantastic guys, so friendly and helpful.

244,Good location but a bit noisy to get a sleep,"The hotel is at the entrance to Temple Bar so it is noisy. The staff were very welcoming and public areas  very nice. The bedroom was just okay. The bathroom was a bit pokey - I kept knocking into the wash hand basin when using the toilet.  I had a room at the back of hotel and onto a side street - it was noisy in the early hours of the morning - then you could hear bottle collection - I got about two hours sleep. 
Given the current restrictions the food was quite nice - if limited in choice. The breakfast was excellent and the staff very polite.",4,2021,07,03

We arrived early, and the front desk person let us check in early; I wish I could remember her name- I sincerely thank you, and I am grateful- My mother is 82 and was exhausted after the four-hour drive. I didn‚Äôt have the means to print out one of the required travel documents. I called the Front desk and asked if they could print it for us, and I would run down to pick it up.  Pavla said she would bring it to our room. Pavla went above and beyond for us. Cecile, our waitress, the next morning is wonderful. My husband and I loved talking with her.

The fleet took me in and was my home throughout my two-week quarantine period after having just arrived in Ireland. I thought two weeks in a hotel would lead to the end of my sanity but the staff at The Fleet are cut from a different cloth. I want to say a special thanks to Kevin, who made sure any need was met and Salem, the cocktail genius that will make you crave drinks you didn‚Äôt know existed.

I will be recommending the hotel to all my visitors from abroad as the hotel had an ideal location, excellent food and drink service at reasonable prices, and an overall appealing and fresh aesthetic. Along with reasonable rates I consider this hotel a slam dunk. I can not recommend this hotel enough and I know it will definitely not be the last time i'll be behind those doors as those cocktails are like catnip for the soul.

A small buffet to start breakfast off and the choice of various  cooked breakfasts. Would definitely stay again. 
",5,2020,08,15
244,Excellent weekend,"first time staying in the Fleet and will definitely be back.
I have to say more than anything the staff are amazing.
One of our rooms was on the small side and the receptionist who 
has a great sense of humour, upgraded us to a much bigger room.
The bar staff where so attentive and went out of their way to make us feel
comfortable nothing was a bother. food was also very good. Beautiful hotel and so close to everything.",5,2020,08,05
244,Lovely escape to Dublin city,"We stayed here for one night and it was simply perfect for a night away. From check-in to check-out, every staff member we encountered were friendly and helpful. The girl who checked us in was very chirpy and made us feel welcome. All the necessary safety precautions were in place and we felt very safe.

The bar and lounge area is absolutely stunning. We were blown away by the interior design and attention to detail. We enjoyed a few drinks in the lobby and our espresso martinis were amazing! 

Our hotel room was on the small side, but it had everything we needed for one night to enjoy the city. The shower was very powerful and clean. 

We had food and drinks down the street in a live music bar and restaurant called Buskers - it was fab! Great food, lively atmosphere and the guy singing was excellent. We spent the whole evening there. 

We will most definitely stay again at The Fleet Hotel, the location and hotel setting is perfect for a staycation in Dublin.",5,2020,08,02
244,Great for barfood ,"Met a colleague here for bar food for convenience but glad I chose it. Nice comfortable surroundings and the Bar menu has good choice, I had the carbonara which was excellent. 
Not a place I had been before but will definitely be back. ",5,2020,07,26
244,Possibly the best hotel stay since my honeymoon!,"Maybe it's the past few months of COVID lockdown, maybe we just needed a break.. either way, this was an amazing hotel stay! Loved the experience, atmosphere, the service was fantastic and the reasonable price was exactly what we were looking for. Had a wonderful evening of drinks and chats with some of our closest friends with the lobby bar staff looking well after us. I'd suggest anyone with an extra evening free and the will to adventure to check out this gem of a hotel.",5,2020,07,17
244,Excellent one night stay,Stayed in an elegance room with an unbelievable en suite. Rainforest shower and an amazing bath. Comfort was exceptional and service provided was to a very high standard. I will definitely be returning again in the near future,5,2020,07,11
244,Exceeded expectations,"I've booked this hotel several times but unfortunately never got round to actually stayed. After the lockdown was eased we saw a good deal and thought why not. Firstly, if you are planning a visit during this ""new normal"" the hotel has made practical and helpful adaptations without removing the charm of the old building and of the accommodation.

Staff were lovely, Pavla on reception was super efficient and friendly. Two great bars and great surroundings. Room was first class, comfy and couldn't fault it. Location is perfect, in the quieter end of Temple Bar and in the heart of the city centre.

Glad we gave this place a go, we will definitely be back.",5,2020,07,06
244,Excellent post-lockdown getaway,"I stayed in an Elegance Double Room the day after hotels reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown. I had fallen in love with the idea of that huge soaking tub and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Staff were absolutely fantastic, every measure was made to ensure I felt safe. I ate down in the bar as I wanted something that wasn‚Äôt on the room service menu (their delicious carbonara), and the wait staff wore masks when delivering my food and wine to the table. Hand sanitizer was plentiful as were signs about social distancing but they didn‚Äôt take from the experience - it‚Äôs just part of life here at the moment. I was impressed by the anti-microbial material used on the stair rails, door handles and remotes in the bedroom too as a safety measure. I ordered room service later in the evening (a delicious cocktail and dessert!) and was pleased at how reasonable it was and prompt! Literally the only thing that was missing from my room was either a tv or something to hold up my phone so that I could relax watching a show in the bath! Room wasn‚Äôt the biggest but it was plenty for just me, and the bathroom was massive. Shower nice and powerful! If you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing escape look no further!

(I stayed in room 158, which looked out onto the terrace so was perfectly quiet overnight).",5,2020,07,02
244,Excellent Customer Service!,"I booked with Expedia, for my recent trip which of course had to be cancelled due to Covid-19. Expedia informed me their policy was  to offer a future credit at the hotel, which will expire within 1 year of issue. Since i live 8,000 miles away, and travel abroad is now in flux, this was useless to me.  I had Keenan Wynne, The Fleet Hotel Operations Manager, contact me personally and was able to resolve this issue with Expedia and I have been credited back my pre-booked room completely. I have to say ""THANK YOU"" to Keenan who went the extra mile for his customer. When I return eventually to Dublin I will stay at The Fleet , and I hope you will do the same in your future travels.",5,2020,06,05
244,Celebrating my sisters 40th,"The hotel is lovely. Rooms clean, staff are very friendly. They upgraded my sisters room for free and decorated it with banners, balloons, chocs and prosecco (we paid for this). At breakfast they staff went out and got balloons and cake at last minute which was much appreciated. Location of hotel is perfect for bars.",5,2020,03,08
244,Highly recommend ,"This hotel is perfect for a stay in central Dublin. The hotel‚Äôs location is ideal - just a few minutes walk from Temple Bar but not at all noisy. The staff are so welcome and helpful, foyer/ bar area is beautifully decorated and the rooms are great. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more from a hotel, especially at the price! Would definitely stay again if ever in Dublin. ",5,2020,03,05
244,Amazing,"This delightful Boutique Style Hotel in the heart of the City is simply delightful. The attractions of Dublin are all within walking distance and parking minutes away, subsidized by the Hotel. The outstanding features are many including wonderful architectural aspects and stained glass windows which are all protected. Add to this a wonderful bar, the best breakfast in Dublin in a light cheery room, and a very friendly helpful attentive staff and one has a memorable stay indeed.Rooms adequate size with great beds and spotless with great bathroom and shower.
I totally recommend this Hotel and just to sit  in their beautiful reception rooms  with a welcoming fire sipping a glass of wine watching city life go by is a delight ! rush to book ... wonderful place !",5,2020,03,02
244,Great time ,"Great hotel. We had a great stay.  We had a standard room with twin beds, loads of room not noisy at all,  shower was great hot and powerful.  Spotlessly clean throughout.  Lobby is beautiful and very comfy.  Lovely breakfast,  we had the full Irish,  plentiful and tasty.  Would I return,  hell yes it‚Äôs a good hotel in a fantastic location ",5,2020,02,28
244,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for one night, really liked the place, the refurbished room was lovely. Amazing location and very friendly staff. Didn‚Äôt find it too noisy at all despite the central location. Very nice smoking terrace too if that‚Äôs of interest. Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2020,02,17
244,Fantastic location hotel,Stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. Rooms were lovely and clean and small in size( which I knew when booked and which did matter at all). Great bar and lounge area and friendly staff. The hotel is located on Fleet St in the middle of Temple Bar and within easy within easy walking distance of most locations and attractions that Dublin has to offer. I would gladly recommend this hotel. ,5,2020,02,17
244,Small Rooms but in the Center of the Action,"The lobby is gorgeous, we were offered tea upon arrival. The property seems to be 3 buildings combined. Our room was at the end of the hallway which meant going up and down stairs to half levels and etc. The room itself was small but not bad - we weren't in the room much anyways! The shower was tight, the water pressure was great though. The place was clean and respectable, but the main reason to choose this hotel is because you are in Temple Bar area - right in the action. Easy to find after a night out at pubs too!",4,2020,02,11
244,Good if you don't mind really small rooms!,Stayed here for the first time. Thankfully had paid for a room with some windows but even then the room was very small. No wardrobe. Hooks on the wall is as much as you get. Beautifully appointed but I could not walk around the bed! On my own it was ok but had there been two of us it would have been difficult. The wind and cheese is excellent and could be your evening meal depending on how much you eat!! Would I return: probably not but definitely yes if there were larger sized rooms. Staff very friendly and good.,4,2020,02,10
244,Lovely entrance and then... ,"Checking out this morning. After a lovely arrival and being totally wowed by the lobby and reception... Our room was a bit of a surprise.

The room was tiny and cramped and looked out onto a graffiti wall. When we walked into the bathroom it smelled strongly of smoke. We told the staff at reception about this and were immediately moved which was good... Although the room was smaller with a cramped and outdated bathroom.

When I angled the shower head it fell off onto the floor.

The toiletries were basic and had no other amenities (asked for a toothbrush).

We were out of the room all day. Came back at 4pm and no housekeeping had been. When we sat down they knocked on the door. We said we needed 15 minutes and they said they were leaving now so needed us to leave the room or no housekeeping. We'd had the sign on the door all day to please make up the room.

Water was not replenished, there was 1 pencil and 1 envelope but no notepad or paper... It was all just extremely average.

The walls are paper thin. The plumbing rattles and bangs when neighbours take late showers. And we seemed to be situated in a tradesmans Alley outside as each morning there were early deliveries with a lot of noise.

Bar was lovely. Lounge area beautiful but it felt like we stepped into another realm once we left the elevator.

Sadly have to say would look for an alternative next time. ",3,2020,02,06
244,Warm welcome,Very well welcome from receptionist Adrian ! Celebrating my birthday and Andrian surprised me with a complimentary drink and through out my stay made me and my friend very comfortable!! The room was excellent and clean as well,5,2020,02,05
244,A hidden treasure!,"We stayed at the Fleet overnight and would certainly come back for a longer stay! What a beautiful hotel, lovely decor, our room was very clean and the shower was fantastic! 
The espresso martinis from the bar were üëåüèª and we enjoyed relaxing in the lobby next to the fire. 
Our room was on the front of the hotel so understandably was quite noisy until late night. It was a big weekend in Dublin with rugby and races on so this didn‚Äôt bother us at all really, though may be of note to some. 
Overall we were very impressed and would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2020,02,05
244,"Great location, nice lobby, good waterpressure","* Stayed with friends during weekend for a whiskey-trip.

* Location is excellent. We walked to Jameson distillery, Teeling distillery, Liberties distillery and guinness museum. took about 20-30 min to a destination.

* Hotel lobby is amazing

* Rooms are small and carpet floors.
* Try to get a room in the end of a hallway, otherwise you will hear people passing by.
* Shower is great. Real hot water and great water pressure. But it is a small shower cabin.

* Breakfast is not so impressive but it works

* Service is great

* I guess this is higher than average irish hotel standard so I wouldn't give bad rates. I am used to international business hotels with better bathrooms and bigger rooms in the same price range though",4,2020,01,28
244,¬£100 more expensive than expected. Dreadful wait at check in.,"Booked on line only to find in ¬£100 cheaper on the day.  Massive queue at check in and only one receptionist. Very poor value for money considering breakfast NOT included in this. Two hundred characters, really?",1,2020,01,24
244,Small but perfectly formed,"I stayed here for one night in a twin room with my daughter. The location is excellent. Really easy for the airport bus and next to an excellent pub.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was small but perfect for one night. The beds were comfy and the bathroom was clean and had a good shower with nice products. Breakfast also very good with black and white pudding (yum) and lots of other  options. Such a beautiful hotel. I would recommend and stay there again. Slept soundly with no noise.",4,2020,01,24
244,Christmas present break,Fantastic hotel in regards of location. Stayed here as was watching comedian Paul Smith at Olympia theatre. Easy walking distance from hotel. Rooms were excellent and bed was brilliant. Excellent nights sleep. Highly recommended,5,2020,01,17
244,"Great location and breakfasts, shame about the rooms","This hotel is in a great location, just at the right end of Temple Bar. The staff are great and the public areas are beautiful. The breakfast was outstanding and I have to say the best hotel breakfast I have had in a very long time.

The disappointment was the room. I am not sure if it was because we booked through Booking.com but we had a pokey room at the back which looked onto the back of another building but with large extractor fans running 24/7. Ear plugs were needed. The rooms look nothing like the photos on the website and it was tiny. The bathroom plumbing barely functioned with virtually no water pressure from the cold tap. The shower was ok but I would not class it as a power shower, as stated on the website and the toiletries were not as advertised either.

It is a shame the room let it down as otherwise it is a great place to stay.",4,2020,01,11
244,"Lovely atmosphere, lovely chill out area and great staff","Staff at the hotel were very friendly and professional, with a quick check in and there were also a plate of treats with happy birthday left in the room for my friend, which was an added and pleasant surprise. As it was just before christmas, the hotel was full of lovely christmas cheer and decorations, the bar area is a lovely chill out area with open fires and cosy atmosphere. Rooms were adequate for what we needed, a one night stay and it was perfectly located just off temple bar. while it is in a busy location, our room and hotel was very quiet. this was overall, a lovely stay and i will definitely will be back, thank you",5,2020,01,07
244,"Unexpected Gem, hidden delight ","A great new addition hotel for Dublin and in the perfect location. Just park your car in Fleet St and walk across the cobbles of Templebar. The hotel design, layout and management are worthy of 5 stars and more. Checking in was seamless and all the team throughout my stay displayed their professionalism and high standards of training and customer service. This level was also complimented in the accommodation and the food & beverage teams. Even if you don‚Äôt have the time to stay in this beautiful hotel just pop into their bar for the black pudding and blue cheese burger. Thrust me you won‚Äôt get a better burger in Dublin!! I will definitely stay again on my next visit to Dublin. ",5,2020,01,03
244,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for one night with a friend as we were attending an event in Dublin. We advised the hotel that we would be returning late and they explained the procedure to gain access to the building after 11pm. Overall pleasant stay, the location is amazing. The only issue I had was with the parking, we selected the hotel as they had advertised hotel parking online but as we arrived in Dublin we rang ahead to find out there is no hotel car park but a few car parks situated a walk away from the hotel. This wasn‚Äôt a major issue but just advising for anyone booking as this was the reason we picked the hotel.",4,2020,01,01
244,"Bad Wifi, Noisy, Bad Housekeeping - some good points too","Wifi was really bad (had 3 rooms, some rooms got patchy reception, and it was very slow - can't stream anything). Housekeeping missed our room completely on day 1, and we had the sign out for 6 hours on Day 2 and it wasn't done by 3pm. 

Can be noisy too as many rooms are onto a side street with a late night club. 

Otherwise, the hotel is in a great location at quieter end of Temple Bar. Rooms are much smaller (even Deluxe Rooms) than they appear online but were comfortable - think Paris size rooms (very small for UK/Ireland). 

Reception staff were very friendly and helpful - and any issues (except Wifi and Housekeeping) were resolved, and they were always keen to help. 

However, housekeeping was so poor (well we didn't get any) and wifi so bad that as well located as it is, and as comfy as rooms are I wouldn't stay here again.",3,2020,01,01
244,Laurie,"Hotel was an excellent choice. The staff was amazing, friendly and helpful.  We stayed over Christmas and loved having the great lobby and bar to come back to each day.  Beds and room we comfortable.  Great breakfast.   Pavla and Jessie were two very helpful staff members",5,2019,12,29
244,Theatre Trip,"Spent two nights, had a very comfortable twin room which was very quiet. The staff members were extremely friendly and helpful. As the weather was so bad we spent much of our time in the hotel and on one evening ate in the bar. The food was tasty, well served and the bar staff most accommodating. The foyer seating area was beautifully decorated, warm and comfortable. This was our third visit and we hope to return quite soon.",5,2019,12,23
244,Great hotel for a city stay,"Myself and my partner stayed for 2 nights mid december, and had a great time! The hotel is a bargain for what you get. The lobby and bar are beautifully decorated and feel very luxurious, breakfast was great with a good selection, the room was  nice, particularly the bathroom (we stayed in a small double), and the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. We had a few drinks at the bar and ate at 1920, which was very tasty and reasonably priced for a hotel smack bang in the middle of dublin. Only thing with being so central is it can be noisy, we had a car alarm going off outside from very early one morning,  but that's not the hotel. Overall a great stay.",5,2019,12,13
244,Best customer service in dublin,"The price of this hotel is amazing. The best part of my stay was my experience with Martin in the residence bar. His customer service is second to none, he made me feel very welcome and he was great to talk to. Best service I‚Äôve ever had in any place I‚Äôve stayed",5,2019,12,08
244,Very unexpected customer service,"I came to the fleet on a whim it was a nice cheap hotel and that was at the time satisfying enough.Then we met a lovely young man called Martin, he made it feel like home. If you're Irish or Spanish or whatever the place feels like you never left your home. Thank you fleet for the lovely hospitality and thank you Martin for the great laughs and great drinks! I'll be back soon",5,2019,12,08
244,A Weekend Break.,"Looking to go somewhere for a long weekend? look no further than The Fleet in Dublin. 
We have just returned from our long weekend.
The hotel is based right in the middle of the amenities i.e. bars and restaurants. 
The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The staff on all levels are fantastic and of course very helpful.
The breakfast room has everything for breakfast that you can think of !!!
We definitely will be returning to The Fleet, thougherly recommend this hotel with no reservations!!! (sorry!!)",5,2019,12,04

244,Lovely Hotel!,"We stayed for one night and this hotel provided the perfect location!

The communal areas of the hotel are very nice, the room was extremely clean and the bed was comfy! Would stay again!",5,2019,11,21
244,Excellent location and great price for a city centre hotel,"Situated at the edge of temple bar, near the main tourist sites, this hotel is an oasis of calm in an otherwise hectic city.  The hotel is beautifully and tastefully decorated,  the bedrooms are clean, quiet, comfortable , modern with all you need for a comfortable stay.
Hotel staff are just LOVELY and very helpful. Breakfast is buffet style and varied but with all you need to start a busy day sightseeing.  Highly recommended and great value too for such style in an expensive city",5,2019,11,19
244,Amazing hotel & Location,"This hotel wow's you from the moment you step through the doors into its impressive lobby. However it doesn't stop there, the rooms are equally as impressive. 
We stayed here for one night on a Saturday night and we had a great nights sleep. The staff and service at this hotel was amazing. 
The hotel is located on Fleet street which has lots of bars and restaurants on it. However the second you step through the doors, its calm, tranquil and relaxed. Its like entering another dimension. The breakfast is served buffet style but this doesn't detract away from the great quality of food and the service received. 
Highly recommend and would stay here again.",5,2019,11,18
244,Lovely hotel,"I started my holiday to Ireland in a hostel and ended at The Fleet. Best choice! The staff were incredibly kind, especially when I showed up soaking wet after the walk in the rain from Connolly station. The hotel itself was spotless and gave a very relaxed vibe. The maze to get to the room was interesting, but once I found it, I didn‚Äôt have any problems. The room was perfect. It was spotless and was kept that way each day. It was a perfect size for me to sleep and do occasional school assignments. The location couldn‚Äôt be beat. So close to Temple Bar and O‚ÄôConnell Street. I was very pleased with my stay and will happily stay again upon my return. ",5,2019,11,18
244,Beautiful Hotel & Great Location,"We arrived in Dublin from our early flight at 9am and thought we would ask the hotel if we could leave our suitcases with them until check-in later on. Upon arrival we were blown away by how gorgeous the lounge/bar/reception area was! Some of the photos on here & Booking.com are outdated, the hotel has had a huge renovation and it's stunning! We were greeted by very friendly staff who told us a room was available straight away (6 hours earlier than check-in time!) & we'd been upgraded to an elegance room free of charge. The room was very spacious and spotlessly clean, we loved the old original shutters on the windows! Breakfast the next day was lovely, lots of choice and very fresh. We were a stones-throw away from the main strip of bars and pubs of Temple Bar but were never disturbed by noise at night/early morning. It's an ideal location!",5,2019,11,14
244,"Brilliant hotel, great location","Fantastic hotel, superb room, quick check in and out, fantastic staff. Brilliant location although the traffic in Dublin meant a long time to get here. Great welcome from reception even brought my case in while I parked the car in the car park across the road and kept it while I had a drink at the bar with a friend I was meeting. Lovely bar area, used when I brought said friend back for a night cap.",5,2019,11,09
244,Great location ,"Really nice hotel in the city centre. Close to the more raucous end of town. Lovely reception on arrival and nice rooms furnished with modern fittings. 
Breakfast was ‚Äòstandard‚Äô on the menu but the quality of the bacon/sausage etc was top class. Really tasty breakfast 
Bit tricky to find your way around the building. I‚Äôm sure there is a Minotaur in here somewhere!",4,2019,11,09
244,Dublin overnight,"Perfect location for a Dublin City break, room spacious, & quiet despite being central location. Good value for B&B, great choice for breakfast.

244,Dublin Marathon Weekend!,"Excellent location!!  Beautiful hotel.  Found most of the staff very friendly & helpful apart from the Bartender Austin who was extremely rude when we dined in the bar/restaurant on one of the nights of our stay!!  After speaking to friends that were also in the bar/restaurant they mentioned that he was also rude to them!!
He wouldnt put me off from staying in the hotel but he would put me off from dining in the bar/restaurant",5,2019,10,31
244,Dublin Marathon weekend,"Our group regularly travel to Dublin for the marathon and so far, this was our favourite hotel. Clean, cosy and if you get a room at the back, quiet.
Excellent location.
 Very helpful staff and overall, great value. We would try to book here again if we come back.",5,2019,10,29
244,Fabulous customer service,"The hotel couldn't be better located in Dublin's city center. Rooms are quite tight, but I guess being an old building meanwhile recently refurbished, and well retro-decorated, that is the best they could make it. What I really got impressed with was all the friendly staff and fabulous and high-level customer service. People make the difference! Thank you and well done!",4,2019,10,28
244,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here in August 2019 to see the Foo Fighters at the RDS. We stayed for 4 days and it was perfectly situated just by the Temple Bar. area. The staff were really fun and very accommodating. Upon check in we were told that our room had a few stairs after the lift and they offered to carry our luggage up for us. The room was a little tired but it's an old building. They have a late night bar in the reception area which was really great for us as we had been out each night. They have smoking terrace upstairs which I recommend you use if you want to smoke in the late evenings as there are a lot of beggars outside, not just outside the hotel  but everywhere at night.  I really liked staying at this hotel as it is small and they make you feel like it is your home.",5,2019,10,27
244,Excellent ,We stayed at The Fleet for two nights in October. We arrived at 10am and unfortunately our room was not ready but the very friendly staff looked after our bags until our room was ready. Staff were very friendly and attentive. I was slightly worried as some of the pictures on previous reviews were dated but this hotel has had a major refurbishment and it is stunning. One of the most beautiful hotels we have stayed in. I will be recommending this hotel to my family and friends. Location is great and breakfast was gorgeous as well. ,5,2019,10,19
244,Amazing location and hotel.,Stayed here for one night. Twin room with dinner and breakfast included. Well worth the money. Great location and friendly staff. Room was lovely and clean. Decoration added to the experience. Would definitely stay again!,5,2019,10,19
244,Nice hotel,"Booked ‚Äúthe Fleet‚Äù for a weekend away in Dublin. We booked through booking.com and it was all very straight forward- paid when we arrived and easy check in. 

The hotel has lovely decor at the bar in the lobby. The breakfast here is fantastic and was included in our price- choice of full hot breakfast, continental, fruit juices, coffee machine etc. Great service too and not too busy. It‚Äôs open 7am-11am on weekends, 6:30-10:30am in the week.

Our room was a small double which is ample but the decor isn‚Äôt as nice as I was expecting having looked through pictures on booking.com and tripadvisor. The bathroom is looking a little tired too (I don‚Äôt think this is the same in all of the rooms). Our room was quite noisy in the evening (which I‚Äôd expect as it‚Äôs in the centre of Dublin in Temple Bar) and we were on the second floor, so be sure to take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. 

If we were to stay again we would probably pay more to stay in a bigger double room or the executive rooms, however it‚Äôs perfectly fine for our little weekend getaway as we aren‚Äôt staying in the hotel much. 

The rooms contain sparkling water, coffee making facilities, hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and hand soap. ",4,2019,10,19

244,Nice and best located Hotel,"The location of the hotel is superb. Direct on the Temple street and close to eveyrthing in the city. The personnel is very friendly.

244,Fantastic Hotel,"The Fleet Street Hotel is by far one of the Best and nicest hotels I've ha the pleasure to stay at. The service is specyaular, a great restaurant and bar. Also a bar in the lobby. The food was very good with a full breakfeast served every morning. Enjoy!",5,2019,10,08
244,"Perfect location, very comfortable, great staff","The location is at the edge of Temple Bar close to Westmoreland, which places it away from the fray, but so close to everything.  We walked to the Guinness Storehouse, Trinity College and places between.  Older pictures show a TGIF's restaurant on the street level, but it's not there.  It's a gorgeous, large lobby with a large bar.  The girl who checked us in was personable and friendly and the guy who checked us out was equally engaging.  The room was spacious, although we couldn't figure out the shower, and quiet and comfortable.  Again, perfect location to be close to everything without the hassle of being in the hustle.",5,2019,10,07
244,Lovely hotel in the centre ,Stayed here for my mums 60th in December last year. It‚Äôs a lovely hotel right in the centre in temple bar so ideal.

Our room opend up on a rooftop and since there was no A/C we had to open the window.  A party below was very noisy but that may be the perils of the location.  People walking down the hallway was quite loud in our room and various steps in the halls made hauling suitcases a bit of a chore.",3,2019,10,01
244,Unfortunately unwelcoming,"Pros: the hotel is beautifully furbished and beyond sparkinly clean.

Old style luxury rooms are modernsed beautifully with a glorious glam bathroom with a massive free standing bath, rainforest shower and even a mirror with attached make up brish holders.

Cons:No plug sockets by the bed just one (or an extra one if you plug out the lamp by the door) at least in room 260 and staff seeming stand offish, which is unfortunate as its a lovely hotel. 

Im not sure if the public mistreat the staff or what's going on there, but they seemed afraid to have banter with us or approach us, if we were looking to order a drink. 

Major con was having a staff member walk into the room at 8.30/8.45am without knocking. (Check out being at 12pm)

Was not expecting this after a late night, and I was very embarrassed and frightened to be woken up to someone bargining into a locked room without at least knocking first, this made me even check out early as couldnt get back to sleep after this and was utterly exhausted.

Told staff at check out about this, and I felt they didnt really care by the level of apology recieved, again really unfortunate as I wanted to love and enjoy my break away. And being friendly to your customers is free. 

Also felt spoken down to while trying to order room service the night before and feeling like I was just being a burden for asking about ordering room sevice, I gave up in the end as I was to tired and just went to bed hungry. 

Never really leave bad reviews so kind of sad writing this. 

Wouldn't go back, wouldn't recommend.",1,2019,09,24
244,Centrally situated - Temple Bar area,"Short trip, but stayed 2 nights as it meant cheaper flights. This place is a bit of a rabbit warren, lift seems to go 'in-between' floors so I either got Moffat the 2nd and went up a small flight, or got off on the 3rd and went down a small flight, then went the length of the hotel to get to the 4th floor. Room was very small, bathroom sink had a big crack in the basin, limited toiletries (shampoo, hair and body wash, conditioner), nothing else, no flannel (I don't travel with one as I expect one in the bathroom), linen nice and crisp though. TV was next to useless. Breakfast offered a fair selection to choose from, full irish to healthy options. Queues for the one coffee machine though. This place was good for me as I had meetings close by. Temple Bar really is party area, so plenty of tourists.",3,2019,09,23
244,Wonderful hotel,"Walked through the door and what an amazing foyer-stunning. Got to the desk informed we were given an upgrade- happy days.
Room bit small the on suite was huge. Roll top bath,walk in shower.
Slept like a log very quiet at the back of the hotel.
Breakfast was self service and absolutely top notch.
Very friendly staff.
Right smack in the middle of Dublin.",5,2019,09,20
244,Very good location,"We stayed at the Fleet for our last 5 nights in Dublin. It was a lovely hotel and had a very good location. Though we were in the Temple Bar district, our room was very quiet.  Check in was easy and quick. The reception area is lovely. 

The lift was up and down while we were there. It is very small and if there are 2 people with luggage, no one else can use it as it is overloaded. Our room was on the second floor and quite a ways from reception. Room was small, but clean. One day housekeeping forgot our room and we had to ask to have it cleaned. 

The lift requires your room key to operate and that was never explained properly. Every time we got in it, we seemed we had to show someone how to use it. 

We chose to include the breakfast and it was quite good, lots of selections. There was always a line at the coffee machine since there was one for everyone to use. 

Overall, a good experience and a very good location. You can walk to most everything. Lots of places to eat and drink in the blocks around it. I had a gin and tonic in the restaurant and it was perfect! ",4,2019,09,18
244,Lovely city centre hotel,"We stayed here for a 4-day break and were very impressed with the hotel overall.  The room and bathroom had recenly been refurbished and both were very pleasant, although the room itself was quite small.  It's in an excellent location in the city centre with easy access to the airport by service bus.  The breakfast room was very pleasant with a good choice of food which was very good.    All the staff were friendly and helpful too.   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",4,2019,09,16
244,Lovely....if you don not mind stairs,"The Fleet is a beautiful hotel that had been completely restored while respecting the historic buildings it occupies. The staff was very helpful and welcoming despite our predawn arrival.  It is very conveniently located, near the fun of Temple Bar and just steps to O‚ÄôConnell Street. 

Our room was accessed by a small lift, a flight of stairs down, two hallways, another shorter flight down, followed a few feet later by a flight up and a short hall. To the hotel‚Äôs great credit, they arranged to have our bags delivered to our room.  

The breakfast was good, similar to other hotel breakfasts.  The WiFi was spotty, poor to no reception in our room while just two stair cases away, the reception was good.  A signal booster might solve the problem. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel but suggest potential guests who have mobility issues to request a room close to the elevator.  ",5,2019,09,13
244,Excellent stay in Dublin,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying at the Fleet hotel. The location was fantastic and the staff were incredible. They went out of their way to provide us with suggestions, to books cabs, and to store our luggage after we checked out. The hotel was also very beautiful. Thanks again!",5,2019,09,12
244,The Fleet Street Hotel...Great Dublin Location!!,"We recently stayed at The Fleet while in Dublin on vacation. It is a charming hotel on Fleet St at the quiet end of the Temple Bar area in Dublin.  The lobby and front room and Reception are lovely!  The lift is very small but that is to be expected in Europe! Our room was very small but comfortable.  This hotel is within walking distance to many Dublin attractions...Ha'Penny Bridge, Trinity, Dublin Castle, St Patrick's Cathedral and of course Guiness.  We walked the length of Temple Bar and tasted many of its pubs and restaurants!  I would recommend this hotel!",4,2019,09,10
244,The Fleet Street Hotel,"The Fleet Street Hotel was great. Great hospitality staff was great very helpful and very pleasant. 
Impressive lobby area with 2 fireplaces; high ceilings; comfortable sofas/chairs. 
Very clean and neat. Room was good but shower was small and might be difficult for a large person. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great place to stay and with a full breakfast menu including the typical Irish breakfast. 
Great location; walking distance to a great number of pubs, restaurants and shops. 
Located in Temper Bar area of Dublin.",5,2019,09,07
244,Great location,"We spent 4 days in The Fleet hotel. It's location is great. The bus stops from/to airport are nearby  (O'Connell Str & Westmoreland Str). Also there are plenty of pubs around. The breakfast was good enough for us. There were Irish breakfast too. The room was spacious (elegance type) and very clean. The only drawback was WiFi. It was impossible to find even hotel's hotspot in our room. After second complain the staff lady was so kind to offer to change the room, but we we decided it wasn't worth it to do for the remaining two days. I think the problem was the room which was on the last floor and there was not coverage. 
Anyway I recommend this hotel and would book again.",4,2019,09,04
244,bar,"Had the displeasure of having two drinks here yesterday. My review is of the bar only. Was met by one of the most rude young women ever  serving behind the counter. She actually shouted at me.Was about to leave when keith served us without any fuss.  To the blonde young one serving behind the bar, managament would want to send you on a course on being civil. Working in the service industry is not for you.",2,2019,09,02
244,3 night stay in Dublin,"You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. The reception area and bar looked stunning, unfortunately our room was not! It was small, hot and quite shabby. We were given a complimentary bottle of 500ml water on our first night and a tiny shower gel, shampoo and conditioner none of which were repeated for the secon and third night. The room was so hot even though the weather wasn't, we had to ask for a fan as it was unbearable. Breakfast was included, it wasn't too bad although the bacon made your jaws ache as it was tough. The best thing about the hotel was the location but to be honest I'd rather stay further out and walk to Temple Bar. It certainly wasn't worth the money, I've had better Travelodge rooms.",2,2019,09,01
244,Great location!,"Location simply couldn't be better - you can walk everywhere! Hotel rooms and service were good, yet nothing extraordinary. Breakfast buffet had really great variety and good quality (with the notable exception of the coffee, which was not good... but it's really hard to find good coffee in Dublin!)",4,2019,09,01
244,"Good, But Not Perfect","I cannot praise the staff enough. 

I just want to say - firstly - the staff here were polite, professional, and passionate. They were able to help with all enquiries, including recommending different sights to see, and they were also more than helpful in resolving an issue with the rooms (as one had a bit of a bad smell, so we needed to change rooms). I would give the staff 5* in their own right, as they were the best hotel staff I have encountered in travel. 

It is also a perfect location, in that you are very central. The castle, parks, and major museums are all in walking distance. The elegance suite also has an air conditioner, a lot of space, some lovely decor, and gorgeous shutter windows. Both rooms we were in had a good selection on TV, as well as tea-making facilities, and there is room service should you so choose. It was also spotlessly clean. 

That being said, the rooms are less than ideal:

- the standard double-room has a glass door on the bathroom, which overlooks the bed, and this leaves zero privacy for those within the room; it is frosted, but the figure of the person inside is still very clear

- the cafe fails to offer options to those with allergies

- there is huge issues with noise; in both rooms, we heard everything from those above and to the side of us, as well as outside . . . footsteps, drunks in the street, cars, bags being wheeled -? It was all audible and often kept us awake

- the standard rooms are ridiculously small; so small, in fact, that I've been in some generic chain hotels and had three-times the space (some on par with the elegance room, which costs more)

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a Dublin experience, but would recommend upgrading to an Elegance room and avoiding perhaps the cafe (should they have allergies or other issues). It's absolutely lovely inside, and the staff really do all that they can to make it feel more like a home than a hotel. We enjoyed our stay in the hotel, although - due to the glass doors - would perhaps not return to the standard rooms again.",4,2019,08,29
244,Well located,"The hotel has clearly done a lot of renos recently and it looks great. The rooms are small but clean and new. The showers are heavenly. There was unfortunately no AC in the rooms so we had the windows open at night and were treated to the lovely sounds of garbage trucks, drunks, and general mayhem, but we were able to sleep through it. The breakfast was excellent, above expectations. We were there are part of our honeymoon and it was not acknowledged but the staff was otherwise really helpful and friendly.",4,2019,08,27
244,"A Charming and Quaint Old-Style Hotel, Completely Modernized, at a Great Location","This is a fine three-star hotel which, since it's renovation, absolutely deserves another star. Here are the details:

First, you cannot beat the location; it's great. You'll be right in central Dublin in the heart of the lively, pub-lined area called Temple Bar. The roads are narrow; they twist and turn until your head spins. The hotel is adjacent to the river walk, only a short stroll from St. Patrick's cathedral and only a slightly longer walk to the zoo or to the fascinating Jeanie Johnston ""famine ship."" In terms of access, we took at taxi from the Dublin Airport in 25 minutes for about 30 euros, which seems very reasonable to me (we had a stack of suitcases). 

The hotel is an old brick building. It's actually five old structures kludged together into a a single hotel. It was completely remodeled in 2018, and a lobby restaurant was removed and replaced with handsome sitting area which is perfect for afternoon tea or snoozing or waiting for your buddies to arrive. 

Check-in was fast and easy. Most of the staff seems to be from Eastern Europe and their language skills are excellent. They also are extremely professional and welcoming. 

As part of the renovation, the hotel features TWO lobby bars and a very handsome and spotlessly clean breakfast restaurant down the stairs. The restaurant offers great food but a weak coffee service: there's just one machine making a cup at a time, which serves the entire hotel. I think they should spring for a bit more coffee capacity.

Getting to the rooms can be a gallop of Olympic proportions; handicap access would be an issue. As noted, the hotel is not a unified modern building so there are many different stairs linking the vintage structures together. In our case, it took 29 stairs to get to room (see photo), after getting off the elevator. Follow the signs and you'll get there eventually. If you have lots of bags, let the porter bring them up and give him a nice tip for his exertions. There is only one lift. Eventually, we just used the stairs and got a workout while avoiding a long wait for the elevator.

Our room was small but very well updated and more than sufficient. I loved the fact that the windows opened. There was a very comfy double bed, lots of pillows and the room was very quiet, with no traffic noise. (Rooms with street views should be expected to be much noisier in this popular, pub-filled area.) The bathroom was super-modern and very nice with an excellent shower, It also offered a HEATED towel rack, one of the world's great inventions. 

The WIFI was a little shaky, irregularly available in the room. Speeds were borderline slow: 3.9 mbps download, 2.4 mbps upload. That means it's good for email but not sufficient for chatting or video. Also, it does not automatically re-connect as you move around the building.

The TV offered only 12 channels ‚Äî¬†¬†hasn't management heard of satellite TV yet? There was a luggage rack and a safe, a small desk but no clock in room. Also, there was no coffee pot in the room; which means you have to go to basement breakfast room. That's slightly annoying but at least it is available 24/7.

We spent a fair amount of time in the lobby bar (see photos) and I recommend it highly. They also serve great snacks and condiments there, and the staff can't be beat.

All in all, I think this is a fine city hotel, reasonably priced and with a focus on tourists. I would definitely go back.",4,2019,08,27
244,On Holiday,"Great hotel, close to everything we wanted to see.  Room was clean, and the staff very helpful.  If you have mobility issues let them know as many of the rooms require using short stairways after arriving on your floor via the lift.",5,2019,08,27
244,Extra charge ,Was attending a wedding across the road in the Westin hotel and booked a double room on booking.com for ‚Ç¨185. After the wedding my friend decided to stay with me I didn‚Äôt think this would be an issue as I paid for a double room. Was charged ‚Ç¨30 by the night porter for my friend to stay as he said I had only booked for one person which I was not aware off . Feel ‚Ç¨215 was too expensive for the room. ,1,2019,08,24
244,Very nice hotel and close to everything!,"Weekend stay at Dublin and enjoyed stay at the Fleet. Central location close to everything, next to bars and restaurants, close to river, Trinity College and shopping street. Nice deco and good breakfast too! Highly recommend!",5,2019,08,20
244,Great hotel,"The hotel is in a fantastic location, really close to an airport shuttle stop.
We arrived about twenty minutes before the check in time, but luckily our room was ready.
As I had put a note on my booking advising it was my partners 40th Birthday, we were also given a complimentary upgrade which was fantastic.
The room was clean and comfortable, the only downside to the room was that the shower didn‚Äôt seem to drain very quickly so if you had a long shower you were in danger of flooding the bathroom.
We had breakfast in the hotel every morning, which was lovely and there was a good choice of foods available.
We would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,08,14
244,Fabulous Fleet.,"What‚Äôs not to like about this hotel. We arrived my 10:30 in the morning, but decided to go to the hotel to drop off our bags. Checked in and without asking our bags were stored safely for us, so we could go out and about. 
Room was lovely, modern and spotless. We had to open the windows to allow some cool air in and this meant that we could hear the noise outside. Not the hotels fault, we were staying in the heart of Temple Bar so yeah it could be noisy. 
The Breakfast was amazing, the breakfast room itself was way better than I was expecting. Continental breakfast and Full cooked readily available and the cooked was brilliant tasty and you could tell decent produce had been used. 

Location 10/10
Staff 10/10
Room 10/10

I will be back at this hotel.",5,2019,08,12
244,"Some good, some bad...","This is a beautiful hotel.  The lobby and bar are impressive as is the reception area and the wonderful staff.  Unfortunately, the hotel check in time is 3:00 pm and we arrived off an overnight transatlantic flight at 11:30 am, so we had to hit the streets until our room was ready, but were able to store our luggage.  We arrived back, exhausted, again to friendly staff.  They offered to take our bags to our room, but we declined.  Wishing we had accepted the offer as our room on the third floor had many small flights of stairs that we weren't expecting.  The room was small, but clean. The bathroom also small, but the water pressure in the shower was fantastic!  It rivals most hotels I have been in.  Unfortunately, our room was beside an alleyway. It was very warm and humid so we had to leave the window open.Temple Bar is a noisy area, but into the night there were drug users meeting up under our window to use, and score.  They were loud and frequent.  There were also garbage trucks emptying bins and delivery trucks delivering goods to the hotel early morning.  It was not a restful few nights. If the hotel invested in a security guard or police patrolling the alley to keep the unsavory characters away, that could help.
The breakfast room is absolutely wonderful!  Very clean and modern.  Delicious hot breakfast, the best pastry I have ever had and a lovely room to enjoy it in.
If I were in the area again, I may book at the Fleet if it could be guaranteed to not be alongside the alleyway.",3,2019,08,07
244,Great Location,"The Fleet is located near the edge of Temple Bar and is clean, modern, attractive, and friendly. We spent three nights here and were very comfortable. The chambermaids were so very helpful. The breakfast was superb - if a little expensive. Although a buffet, we were not rushed or squeezed, and the coffee was excellent. The staff were very friendly and answered all questions with smiles and accuracy. Try to book away from the noisy alley adjoining the hotel; it can get noisy. A pleasant stay.",4,2019,08,05
244,Can't beat the location,"Stayed here for two nights over a weekend, so central, walking distance to everything and anything you need! 
Reception and the bar for me are the real selling points, a great place to have a quite drink with friends and laugh the night away while being served amazing cocktails.
The rooms are alright, more of a place to lay your head then relax in, would I go back?
Probably!",4,2019,07,27
244,Very good overall ,"The personnel were extremely helpful, the hotel very nice and clean.  Location was terrific and within walking distance of restaurants, bars and sights.  Our room was quite small but comfortable.  Only downside was that it faced a street and was extremely noisy at night.  ",4,2019,07,16
244,Nice hotel in a very central location ,"Had 2 nights at this refurbished hotel in the heart of the Temple bar area of Dublin. The hotel has been completely refurbished or at least the areas we saw, which were bright modern and well decorated. The lounge area is top class and the bright modern breakfast area provides extensive  breakfast buffet options. A good mix of hot and continental fare available. 

There are 2 bars and a roof terrace to enjoy.

We had executive rooms which had a great waterfall shower although limited soaps on hand. The room however for the extra money was quite small and therefore disappointing and with no AC rather hot.  

It is in the night time very close to Temple bar so was very noisy well into the small hours. Therefore may not be for all tastes.

There is no car park at the hotel. However the Fleet St  Car Park about 200 metres away is available at a discount. 

Other than the noise and the small rooms, it was a pleasant stay.",4,2019,07,15
244,"Great location, breakfast, staffing...Rooms need a spruce up!","Truthfully, this should be 3 1/2 stars and rated ‚Äúgood‚Äù not average nor very good... The hotel is very functional and bottom line, it works...the hotel‚Äôs location is very solid, top of Temple Bar area, close to the tram, steps from Grafton, and right down the alley from the Liffey, Ha Penny bridge, etc... There is a Tesco supermarket directly across the street...the breakfast is a very solid buffet filled with American style breakfast items and then Euro options like meats, cheeses, etc..The reception area is right inside the front entry and there are comfortable couches and seating options, to relax, have an adult beverage, or just chill out... Hallways and such are fine but the rooms and bathroom in the room need some updates... I‚Äôm a solo traveler and don‚Äôt need much  but the room was pretty stripped, no outlets next to the bed as the bed was up against a wall and the side table was very small and basically useless... Stall shower and there were virtually no soaps, shampoo, etc on the pedestal sink...Staff was friendly, helpful, and while I would consider staying there again, it would need to be for the right price on any of the search engines...Noise from Temple Bar was not an issue as I had a room on the inside/back side of the hotel...",3,2019,07,12
244,Really nice place and great service,"Had a 3-night city break here and really enjoyed the room and comfort. Staff and passing management were extremely polite and helpful. Breakfast was very good and the setting is very relaxed. Try their porridge, I loved it. The location couldn't have been better for us, right in the heart of Temple Bar.
Came across 2 issues that were dealt with very efficiently and were treated with the correct level of attention. 1. an adjacent door clattered shut every time anyone used it which wasn't welcome at 6am - 8am. When I mentioned this at reception it was attended to same day. 2. Using the main showerhead the tray filled up and overflowed very quickly. Again reporting that was responded to same day.
If I was to be critical....the lightwell outside room 252 is in my opinion (and I would suspect many others would think similarly) an eyesore. What a pity because everything else was to our satisfaction.",4,2019,07,05
244,Terrible room,"My recent stay was so disappointing after paying over $400 for a one night stay. 
The room was small, no air conditioning & the window was jammed shut, shower drain was mostly blocked & black sludge was seen on checkin, complimentary water couldn't be opened as the opener was broken. 
Overall a shocking experience. 
The foyer was lovely and the hotel is well situated close to shops and pubs. Perhaps check your room as I'm sure they would have better ones. It was fully booked or I would have asked for an alternative.",2,2019,07,05
244,"Central location, helpful staff, clean and functional","We were booked into the Fleet as part of a G-Adventures tour, but we also booked separately before and after the tour, so stayed 3 separate times in 3 different rooms. First of all, I must say check-in was great, the front desk staff are very helpful. They allowed us to store luggage both short term and for 3 days during a short side-tour to N. Ireland.  They were also very responsive to any issues we had, including a phone problem, where they had to come and knock on the door instead of a wakeup call. However, they did make a mistake about the time for a taxi order. Not every room has a safe, so they looked after our valuables during one stay. The restaurant is good for breakfast although it is expensive.  The buffet is complete, the coffee is good, and the staff are very helpful and will take special orders. 

All of the rooms were clean, with lots of towels and comfortable beds.  The TV's worked well and there was plenty of space for storage. None of the rooms have air conditioning, and so if you want to open the windows, you will have to deal with outside noises.  The carpets are laid on the old floors, so are uneven and the underlay tends to crinkle when you walk on it.  Also the phones in the hotel either do not work or are not dependable.  Our last night, we asked for a wakeup call, which came 20 minutes late because of phone problems. 

In  general, the rooms do not come with shampoo and conditioner but rather a combination in a dispenser in the shower.  The sink soap is also from a dispenser.  Both of these products were fine, as long as you do not mind the dispenser.  We had brought face clothes and so were able to use those with the dispensed soaps. 

Now, I have to say, each room had its issues. Our first room was a wheel chair accessible room on the 3rd floor overlooking the central courtyard.  The bathroom was of course huge, but there was no shower curtain and no matter how careful we were the floor was wet to the door, so no wearing socks or slippers in the bathroom after showering.  Also the phone in this room was not connected, and this was the room where staff came and knocked on the door to wake us in the morning. I think this was also the room that did not have a safe. 

The second room was at the back of the hotel on the third floor. It was smaller, especially the shower, and had one window, also opening onto the courtyard.  This room was a bit cramped with an extra single bed which we use to store our luggage. Also it was a fair walk from the elevator with heavy luggage, with several short flights of stairs. 

The third room was on the second floor right off the elevator and overlooking Fleet Street.  The elevator was quite noisy as was the street noise, and we wore earplugs each night.  This room was a good size, had a large walk-in closet and as big bathroom with a long shelf to hold toiletries. Despite the noise this room was the most comfortable. 

There are plenty of restaurants all around the hotel. There is a Tesco market across the street which will supply basics, although I would recommend avoiding the pastries. We found a wonderful breakfast place, Cafe Nero, down the street a couple of blocks towards Temple Bar.  The hotel is also a quick walk east to Trinity College, Nassau Street and St Stephens Green, where the revolution started.  West is Temple Bar, the Castle, Christ Church and St. Patricks and further on the Guiness Storehouse and a couple of distilleries. North across the river are more restaurants, the Luas street car track and various museums. 

As long as you have a facecloth and earplugs, I would recommend the Fleet when staying in Dublin.",4,2019,06,30
244,"Location, luxury & lively environment","Love the location, we are right on Temple Bar. Close to restaurants, cafes, bars & shopping. The hotel is fabulous, the decor is stunning, the staff very friendly & helpful. My only negative is I can't get the free wifi in our room which is on the third floor but if I walk out side to The Palace Bar I can get the guest wifi out there & all the steps you have to walk up & down to get to your room.
I would definitely rerecommend this hotel for service & location.",4,2019,06,30
244,Great Staff and Great Location,"The staff were all amazing!  The breakfast is standard fare but if you get it included in your room price its worth it.  Rooms we ok.  Not great but not bad ether.  Beds were standard European beds (hard as a rock).  There was no air flow so it got very hot even though it was low 50's.  No fan or AC so it got very very hot at night.  You are really paying for the location which was perfect. You are staying right in the middle of the action and because of the layout of the hotel, it remained very quite even on Saturday and Sunday nights.  A bit pricey, but like I said, you are in the heart of the action.",3,2019,06,29
244,What a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We unfortunately were given a room on the 4th floor (lifts only go 3)so there were a number of stairs to go up, Bieber the room was quite spacious and we appointed. Comfy bed.
Great location and the staff were very helpful. Excellent breakfast with quite good coffee.",4,2019,06,23
244,Unique and Homely ,"We quite enjoyed our time at this hotel, the decor and open fire place made us feel nicely welcomed and comfortable.

Rooms are a good size but quite a walk from the entrance and the elevator struggled at best.

Great location, and nice and friendly staff. We would definitely return ",4,2019,06,20
244,Disappointing ,"We were really looking forward to the stay after seeing pictures and reviews,
similarly when we entered the lobby as it was beautiful, as was the breakfast area/cafe downstairs, but it did not live up to the expectations. The 'small double' room was ‚Ç¨260 for one night, which is outrageous for the standard of room we stayed in. The room was quite dated and in need of renovation. We were immediately hit with the smell of greasy food as we entered. The window had a sliding partition which was faulty, although the view was terrible so we just kept the curtains closed. No AC. The basin and tiles in the bathroom were chipped, and one of the taps was loose and dripped. The photos on here show bath products from rituals, we had a 2-in-1 dove dispenser in the shower. The breakfast was good, as was the location. 

Maybe we were unlucky to have a room that hasn't been renovated yet, but the price should reflect this. We have had much better experiences in budget hotels, for less than half the price of this one.
",2,2019,06,17
244,Almost perfect stay,"I was asking for as quiet room as possible when making the reservation and the elegance room we had was facing the inner yard so there was absolutely no street noise whatsoever! It was also a corner room so there was very little noise coming from the corridor too. The size of the room was ok and it was very clean. Everything worked perfectly. There was even one Euro-standard electrical outlet in the room in case you forgot to take an adapter with you. The TV was very big for the room size (we didn't use it though). The WiFi could have been faster and more reliable. The hotel corridors can be a bit tiring to walk up and down if you're not in good condition.

The location of this hotel is excellent as you can walk to most of the major sights. The breakfast was pretty good too. I would definitely recommend The Fleet but get the elegance room instead of the standard room some people seem to complain about...",5,2019,06,14
244,Great central location. ,Fabulous hotel in a great central location. Super lobby and reception area. Lovely bedrooms beautifully clean. Good staff and excellent breakfast provided. Only downside is the one slow lift which always seems to be busy. ,5,2019,06,14
244,Fantastic!!,"This hotel is in the perfect location in the centre of Dublin and it is so nice with so many dominant features being an old historical building. Rooms are so nice and comfortable, very clean and the Staff very nice and helpful!! I will definitely stay here again. This really helped to make our WE remarkable!! Thanks The Fleet!!",5,2019,06,10
244,Perfect location for a Dublin visit,"We spent 4 nights at The Fleet and it was perfectly located for everything we wanted to do around town.  Due to the location there is some noise from Temple Bar but it wasn't as bad as I expected.  Our room was very small, especially the bathroom and shower; however we didn't go to Ireland to sit around in a hotel room!  It worked just fine for what we needed which was a place to drop our luggage, sleep, and get ready.  Everything looked newly renovated and had a very cozy feel, especially the lobby area.
The staff was wonderful!  Every person we interacted with was warm and gracious.  Would definitely recommend this property!",4,2019,06,06
244,Perfect! ,"Perfect location in the centre of Dublin... As its so central, it can be noisy but if you're aware of that then it's not a problem. The hotel even leaves ear plugs in the room!
Rooms and bathrooms are modem and spotless, albeit a little on the small side.
The lobby /lobby bar is a fab place to chill. Reception staff were excellent, so genuine. ",5,2019,06,05
244,Located on a busy street with a lot of pedestrians/noise,"We spent 2 nights here- the room was incredibly spacious, the bathroom and shower was modern--- I have absolutely no complaints about the room itself. The odd thing about the hotel was that our room was supposedly located on the 4th floor, however the elevator ( incredibly slow) only went to the 3rd floor, so we had to follow a maze of hallways that went downstairs first, then upstairs and all over the place before we found the room. It was a little bizarre, but at least they offered to take our bag up to the room to avoid dragging it up the stairs. This hotel is located right on a very busy street- Temple Bar- so even though we were high up on the 4th floor, I could hear noise from people outside well into 2 am, or possibly later. It is also near the river so early in the morning I could hear what I think was a noisy seagull that sounded like it was right outside the window both mornings so it made it a little hard to sleep in. Overall-- the room was very nice, just a little noisy. Also the reception area is very comfortable with 2 fireplaces and seating and the reception desk staff was nice and helpful as well.",4,2019,06,05
244,Staff and Location make the spot Perfect,We got lucky with this choice of hotels.  The location is perfect for the buses and also is within walking distance of most attractions.  We had 2 nights in one of the rooms that opened onto the alley and there were some partying noises there but nothing that kept us awake.  Our second stay was only for 1 night and we had a great room then.  The layout is a little strange and does include some stairs but they are ready to bring your luggage up to you.  The staff was knowledgeable and very helpful about anything we asked.  The 1920 restaurant is a great spot for dinner and reasonably priced.  There is a grocery store out front and another one along side of the river Liffey.  If I go back to Dublin I would not hesitate to book this hotel again.,5,2019,05,28
244,"Lovely, cozy hotel with wonderful staff","We read that this hotel was very noisy at night so we requested a quiet room.
Asked and received!
We were situated in The back over the center of the hotel area and it was total, blessed silence.
We had a fabulous nights sleep.
The bathroom has towel warms mounted on the wall. 
Room was very clean and tasteful 
The staff here is amazing
I lost an earring somewhere between a nearby restaurant and the hotel and the manager actually RAN down the street to see if he could retrieve it from the restaurant! Our cab was waiting to take us to our cruise ship and he came racing back sorry that he could not find it.
A huge thank you him!
Amazing!
Loved the hotel, the area around it, the restaurants nearby
Do NOT hesitate to book Here!",5,2019,05,27
244,Fine spot for partying - nothing else,"Good location, on the quieter end of the famous Temple Bar. The rooms are quite small and the walls are very thin. You can hear everything. There is no air con in the room and it gets very hot. The interiors are rather stylish and the beds are comfy.",3,2019,05,26
244,Check out 1920 bar. ,"Perfect location, hotel itself even better than photos. A short walk into the main Temple Bar area. Was very cosy/ welcoming when we arrived with fires lit etc. Love the decor, we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are nicely sized and comfortable, the staff do everything they can to help. Would also like to thank the staff at the 1920‚Äôs bar who were so friendly and put up with us before we went out every night üòä We would definitely return to this hotel whenever we visit Dublin again. Thank you all. ",4,2019,05,25
244,Absolutely Amazed,"Knowing all European rooms are a little smaller compared to the US and my wife is 7 months pregnant she was feeling a bit cramped.  I went down to the front desk asking to be upgraded stating ""I don't care what the cost, a happy pregnant wife is a happy life"".. without missing a beat the hotel bent over backwards for 2 simple travelers. They upgraded us to a premium suite with a city view for 0 cost... could not be more pleased with the service. This place is amazing",5,2019,05,23
244,Average ,"My wife and I stayed here for holiday purposes
Positives- good location, good breakfast, friendly staff
Negatives- very small rooms, construction works going on 
I would Probably look elsewhere at this stage",3,2019,05,23
244,Fabulous Hotel,"We had read online that the hotel was noisy so we asked for a quite room.
Asked and received!
We were given a quiet room overlooking the back/courtyard area and we slept with total silence around us.
The hotel is lovely and the room attractive, spotless and well appointed 
Bathrooms were great with warming towel bars in the wall

Hotel manager went above and BEYOND 
I had mentioned that I had lost an earring on the street or restaurant and he actually ran out and down the block all the way to the restaurant we had dinner in that night to check for me
I cannot praise him enough!
The hotel is in a busy interesting area which is exactly what we wanted
Don‚Äôt hesitate to book here",5,2019,05,21
244,NO air conditioning!  Room stifling!,"We are on a two week trip to Ireland and booked this hotel for two nights in Dublin. I booked directly with the hotel based on the reviews with trip adviser. The hotel website stated that the building had  been updated and remodeled. Upon checking in today we get to our room  and it is miserably hot.  We discovered there are no AC vents. We go to the lobby and are told that there is no AC in our room. They refused to move us to a different room and offer us two fans. We go out for a short time and come back to a stifling hot room with two small, cheap fans.  One fan rattles terribly and neither produce much air. I had to use a ribbon to tie the fan up to keep it from rattling. We are totally miserable in this room and the hotel refuses to do anything about it, including giving us a break on the pricing. I have stayed in hotels and Airbnbs all over Ireland and no one has treated us this poorly. The room is beautiful to look at but miserable to be in. Based on the extremely uncomfortable room and the total lack of caring by the hotel, I cannot recommend this hotel.",1,2019,05,15
244,Fantastic stay!,"Staying at the Fleet in April was a great experience: central location, beautiful vintage decorations, nice rooms and even a lovely staff guy welcoming me in my native language (romanian)! That was definitely something rare that made me feel at home.
I recommend a stay at the Fleet to anyone!",5,2019,05,14
244,Very pleasant stay,I stayed at the Fleet as I was on a training course with work. From the moment I arrived it was apparent that this quirky hotel is all about the staff! The room I stayed in was lovely and the breakfast was also nice. I ate in the 1920 bar each night and the quality was high. The menu is limited but I would recommend the burger or the club sandwich (make sure you are hungry). There is a great selection of drinks. The bar staff were exceptional. There is a young guy and a blonde lady (both Dubs) who are exceptional! The icing on the cake was that there are free brollys (I left mine in the car!!) and this was essential for one of the days in changeable Dublin! I would recommend this hotel mainly due to the wonderful staff and the location. 4 out of 5,4,2019,05,10
244,Beautifully renovated old hotel.,"The Fleet has a beautiful and comfortable lobby, excellent service and modern, clean and comfortable rooms. We saved some money by booking a smallish room, but it was adequate to our needs. We booked the included breakfast, which was fresh and delicious, and the breakfast room was well-tended, bright, clean and welcoming. The breakfast included both hot and cold items and would please most patrons. The elevators were shiny, worked well, and provided security in that they required a key-card to operate. 

Our only complaint is that the hotel was a renovation, and the floors of different wings are not on the same exact level, so their was a half-flight of stairs to access our room. People who have physical challenges would be advised to request a room on the same exact level as the elevator.",5,2019,05,09
244,Perfect for a hen weekend,"I booked this hotel for a hen weekend in May 2019. There were 17 of us so trying to find a reasonably priced hotel in the centre of Dublin for a large group had its challenges. After booking I emailed the hotel and enquired about an upgrade. They offered us an amazing rate and we secured 9 elegance double rooms. I also followed up with a few changes and requests for our group and the hotel were very accommodating to that. 

When talking to hotel manager over email about the rooms, I informed them that the trip was my friend‚Äôs hen do. They surprised us on arrival with decorations in her room and 5 bottles of Prosecco on ice - it went down very well with our group! Throughout our stay the hotel staff were amazing - very attentive and going above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful stay. 

The breakfast is amazing, there‚Äôs a beautiful lobby area with sofas and an open fire, and above all else, the location is perfect. We did a few activities throughout the weekend including life drawing through Funktion events (took place at the Mercantile Hotel), dinner and karaoke at Ukiyo (the dinner is delicious!), and a cocktail masterclass at Temple Bar hotel (right next door to this hotel). 

We had a group of very happy hens and an incredibly happy bride. ",5,2019,05,07
244,Amazing Hotel & Location,"I booked a trip to Dublin in December for my partners 30th Birthday. I found this hotel through booking.com and it did not disappoint. 
On arrival, we notified the staff it was a special trip and they automatically upgraded our room and sent complimentary bubbles to start celebrations. 

The hotel is modern, clean and great location in Temple Bar area with easy links (the closest Luas stop around 5 min walk) to the rest of the City. It was often very busy outside but you couldn‚Äôt hear the noise from our room.
The lobby and bar area was our favourite part to relax and have a few drinks after a busy day exploring. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Dublin.
",5,2019,04,30
244,Prime Location!,"Lovely hotel in Prime Temple Bar Location.  Beautifully appointed boutique hotel, is centrally positioned for walking throughout the city center.  Staff was outstanding.  They were friendly, warm, welcoming, accommodating.  The best in Ireland!",5,2019,04,24
244,"Central location, nice hotel",I stayed here for two nights on a solo holiday in Dublin. The hotel is very centrally located with access to Temple Bar neighborhood and Trinity College. Despite being in the middle of the party my room was very quiet at night even though I had just left the raging party outside. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and the room was small but perfect for my solo trip.,4,2019,04,23
244,"Nice place, great location ","Stayed there for three nights, enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic, just a few steps into the busy side of Temple Bar, yet mostly quiet. The rooms are small but nice and clean, and breakfast is good. The lounge area is a good place to hang out before going out, and right next door is a good pub. ",4,2019,04,23
244,Fantastic!!,"Me, my brother and our partners have returned home today having stayed at the fleet from 15/04/19 - 18/04/19.

The hotel itself was stunning, decoration took our breath away very vintage and classic and the bar area was fantastic! 

My brother's room had 1 single and 1 double in it and was very spacious and my room was a double much smaller but it was perfect for just us two. 

Staff were all so friendly always said good morning and always smiling and you could tell they were so proud to work there! I felt like I'd known them my whole life haha. 

Location was central to everything, I would usually purchase a hop on hop off pass but wasn't needed with where we are based, we even walked to the zoo which only took 30minutes which was a lovely scenic walk.

All in all it was perfect - anyone looking for a hotel central, classy and going from home to home then The Fleet is the hotel for you. ",5,2019,04,18
244,Great location in Temple Bar area. ,"The best part of the hotel were the helpful staff and the location.  Heaters have to be adjusted by staff, only soap dispensers so take your own shampoo/ conditioner.  The lighting in the room is ok and not the best for make up. Overall good place. ",3,2019,04,18
244,Great Location for Exploring Dublin,"The Fleet was great! They worked with us on an early check-in, and the location is great. Your central to so many things you want to check out in Dublin including the Palace Bar which is next door. The breakfast is really good. The rooms are small, but they were clean and gave us enough space to sleep, shower, keep our things and have a little room to move. If you're in your room a lot in Dublin, you're doing it wrong.",5,2019,04,15
244,Great stay,"Great deal at The Fleet Hotel.  Lovely staff very helpful. Delicious breakfast (sausage, black pudding and roasted tomatoes üòã) great shower and really comfy bed. Will definitely be staying again. Everything is on the doorstep, yet a very quiet hotel.",5,2019,04,09
244,One night stay recently.,Stayed for one night recently. Great location. Fabulous lounge and reception area. Stayed in room 317. Room small but ok. The outlook from the room was abysmal and we were directly next to an extraction system that was constantly on and me being a very light sleeper was awful. Had mentioned this to a manager earlier who had told me that it stopped at midnight and started again at 9am No it continued all night.,2,2019,04,09
244,Great location!,"I was very happy with this hotel because it is located in a prime location, but was also quiet and private.  The staff was all excellent - front desk, service and breakfast.  Breakfast was excellent with a hug array of goodies to try.  I definitely recommend this hotel for every reason!",5,2019,04,07
244,Excellent place to stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Dublin for the first time. The room was small but clean and as I was only there to sleep it fit my needs perfectly. The staff was friendly and helpful as well. The best part of staying here was the location. Trinity College, Grafton Street and many other places to visit are all located within a 10 minute walk. I will definitely stay here again the next time I‚Äôm in Dublin.",5,2019,03,26
244,Be careful.,"We booked an executive room. When we arrived these had changed to another name and we were left paying a lot of money for a poor double with very poor hygiene standards.
This hotel excelled in poor guest service.
After a great night in the city we had a coffee in the cafe bar.
After asking for another we were told the. coffee machine had been turned off. I asked when the bar closed, to be told not for another hour.     Go figure.
I made my way to the main reception where there is another bar and coffee machine, only to be told by the Duty Manager that this bar was closed.  When asked what time the other bar was open until, he astounded me by saying that he would have to go and ask!!!!!!!!
This hotel could be wonderful. If only the managers and staff were taught to look after guests.
",1,2019,03,26
244,Average ,"Stayed here for 1 night recently. Quite overpriced for room only rate. Breathtaking decor in the lounge & reception area. Receptionists very friendly & helpful. Rooms basic & quite small. Great location, within walking distance of everting. Surrounded by great pubs & restaurants. Didn‚Äôt opt for breakfast at ‚Ç¨20 per head. Good service in bar. Lucky to have public car park located 200 metres up road which is available at a discounted rate. However found night porter Ivan extremely rude when we returned back to hotel. Paying guests deserve better treatment. ",3,2019,03,24
244,Great hotel,Good central location on the edge of Temple Bar. Beautiful boutique hotel with 1930‚Äôs style reception/lounge area. Very stylish room with high bathroom.

244,A miss from me unless desperate ,"I was not desperate but the location I thought suited location is good if you want to go to temple bar not where I was going 
This is a guest house nothing more room is functional in the French 1/2 star category the price is extravagant the memory will linger for long a skip for me",1,2019,03,13
244,Weekend away,"Weekend away in Dublin. Hotel was in a great location for temple bar and beyond. 
Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Room was clean and serviced daily. Breakfast was good. Bar is a must even just for a cheeky drink before going out. ",5,2019,03,11
244,"Great hotel, great location and super great staff","This hotel is greatly located in the heart of Dublin and walking distance to shops, pubs and fine restaurants.  
I stayed in room 202 which is next to the elevator but it did not bother me much, room was clean and spacious.  
Breakfast was good and the staff extra nice and polite and the same can be said about all other members of staff.  
I would highly reccomend this hotel.",5,2019,03,06
244,Long weekend with son,"As i do a lot of business in and around Dublin I thought I would have a few days in the city with my son and do a little bonding.

First of all the location was great right in the middle of Temple Bar. 

Unfortunately this hotel did not live up to its stars and reviews.

¬£125 per night x 3 for a twin room that you could not swing a bat in, freezing, a hole in the wall, wardrobe broken, bath not draining and shower dripped constantly!

At the end of the stay we were not asked how our stay had been and if there was any issues.

As time was precious I did not want to wait on service calls so I emailed the hotel later in the day. No response.

It seems to me that if you are a hotel in this area you do not need to try as someone will be daft enough to pay the rates.

Really dissapointed especially as I was looking forward to a good weekend with my son.

Next time I would stay further out of the city next at a hotel with better rates and higher stars.",1,2019,03,05
244,The only place I‚Äôd stay in Temple Bar,"I stayed here on the second night of my trip to Dublin (I had stayed in another hotel the night before, long story why I stayed in two different ones). Was very impressed with the decor as it was the holiday season so the place was looked very festive. One thing I think travellers should know, particularly those not carrying a passport, is there is you will be asked for a form of photo ID. This doesn‚Äôt happen to me often but I read a review where someone mentioned it and that meant I was prepared when I was checking in.
Before knew it I was getting a complimentary upgrade as my booked room wasn‚Äôt available which I wasn‚Äôt complaining about, I hadn‚Äôt gone to the room - I just relaxed in the lounge after I‚Äôd arrived. I loved the quirky decor in the room, but the bathroom was something else. Amazing! I had three baths in that thing (see pic). I like to relax and unwind in my hotel especially if it‚Äôs a working trip and that‚Äôs what I did here. I‚Äôm usually sceptical of staying anywhere in or near Temple Bar because of the noise but I had no problem with that. Staff were very helpful and friendly, called me a cab, gave me some directions and overall were very pleasant. I had a lie in so skipped breakfast but it was included in the deal I got when booking the hotel which was ‚Ç¨110 for the night. I would definitely stay here again, the location was great, my room was lovely and I would recommend paying more for that upgrade as a treat if you‚Äôre like me.
I think the only slight issue I had during my stay was that it was kind of tricky to find the room and I got a bit lost a couple of times. Also no room service, which is something I do like to avail of at hotels. But neither was a big deal. ",4,2019,03,01
244,Style over substance,"This is our 2nd time staying at the hotel. 
Good points- the renovation of the ground floor is outstanding! Really tasteful decor. The new breakfast room is gorgeous. The style and thought into every detail is fantastic. 
Bad points- all this is completely let down by customer service. 
I called to book direct as a repeat customer and was advised by mike that yes he would give me discount absolutely as a returning guest. He could book me a double room for 280 euro for 2 nights. I had to ask if breakfast was included and he replied that yes he could throw that in to. Luckily I went online to their own website and booked the same deal for 252 euro. I should have probably expected  things not to be customer focused after this. 
When we checked in the reception is polite but curt.  No irish welcome,  no question of have you been here before,  did you drive here.  I mention the driving as the website states if you book direct you receive discounted car parking. I also had to ask if we received discount at the new restaurant which the website states. Luckily I had visited the website or I would never have known. I'm still waiting to hear of any of the other benefits of booking direct.  
Our room has not been renovated yet which is fine except.. All other rooms on our floor are currently being renovated.  This means workman working each day until 7pm and starting with an actual buzz saw at 7.58am this morning.  No where were we advised of this and feel this is what we receive if booking a discounted online deal.
We also wanted to relax in the lobby after our journey and have a drink when we arrived.  My husband waited at the empty bar for 10 mins to order but gave up. I would have been ok with this as the bar man was obviously busy elsewhere if It wasn't for the two staff members standing with no customers at reception 2 feet away ignoring my husband also. There was literally just the 4 of us in this beautiful room but we seemed invisible. 
Breakfast although in a beautiful location with friendlier staff was cold each morning.  Our table was not cleared during our visit meaning we had to clear our plates up ourselves and continue to our next course on a dirty table. Only 2 other tables were occupied so time was not an issue for the staff. 
I am currently writing this review whilst it feels like the workmen are actually hammering in my room as my bed shakes. 
Location great. Renovation lovely. Service poor. Lacking in any customer focus. Many other hotels in a lovely town to choose from which I advise that you do.",2,2019,02,25
244,Great location,"Great location, easy to get around town from there. the rooms as a average size for a Midtown hotel, but the bed is really small, tight fit for two persons if you got a little extra weight.  Also was a couple of stains on the bed blanket and on the walls,  someone might have overseen that when cleaning the room.  Our room was with a view to a backyard with the air system fans, straight outside Our window so you should avoid that if Your sensitive to noise.",4,2019,02,19
244,Not as expected,"We stayed at the fleet from 11-15th feb this year, we wanted a hotel in temple bar and the pictures on the website were exquisite! We arrived, the lobby was stunning just as the pictures had suggested. However when we got to our room it was nothing like the pictures. It was very basic. This was fine as we would only be sleeping there. Our room was ridiculously hot, as the radiator would not tuen off, we had to open the window which was filthy with dirt and mould. In 5 days our room was only made up once and we only recieved clean towels once which wasn't great. Our key cards consistently stopped working which was very annoying.",3,2019,02,16
244,Perfect location ,"Visited here for my 30th birthday with my fianc√© for a long weekend. When arrived the reception area was lovely & greeted by a polite blonde lady (can‚Äôt remember her name sorry) check in was quick and efficient. 
When arriving to our room it was lovely, small but clean however soon as we opened the door we can heard this terrible noise - looked outside the window & there was an air con machine right outside. 
My partner when to ask the lady on reception if there was any other rooms. She was lovely about the situation and their well aware of the noise in that room but unfortunately there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it as it‚Äôs from the building next door. She showed my partner 2 room the other was exactly the same as ours just the floor below us which you could still here the noise but not as bad then the final room (360) which was one of their best rooms it was fantastic- I loved the bath üòç we was so pleased they offered us this room it made my birthday a little bit more special & we wasn‚Äôt asked to pay anymore for it! So thank you for your kindness! 
This hotel is a old building so you could easily get lost especially if you have one too many Guinness üòÜ
I loved it, added character to the hotel. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel to disable unless you get a room near the lift. 
They have a lovely little roof terrace. 
We didn‚Äôt have breakfast here as it is expensive (19) where you could go down the road for ‚Ç¨10 plus we didn‚Äôt plan staying in the hotel much. 
The hotel is perfect location near all the main pubs, restaurants but we didn‚Äôt hear any noise from the street in the hotel! 
We walked to the Guinness Storehouse it was about 30mins & the prison is about 40/45mins walk. Molly Malone is only a 5 min walk. Taxi rank around the corner (we walked their 440am to get a taxi to airport - easy to get a taxi & was only ‚Ç¨24 - cost us ‚Ç¨29 from the airport) although air coach bus stop is right by the hotel we don‚Äôt did know this until leaving & seen it was only ‚Ç¨7. 
Basically would we stay here again - absolutely! 
Thank you staff at the fleet, hope to visit again soon ",5,2019,02,15
244,Depends on what you are looking for,"We stayed three nights in this hotel. Location is perfect and just for that I would recommend it. The rooms are good, beds are comfortable and the staff is very friendly. Also we tried the breakfast (additional fee) and it was very good.
Now the less than exciting parts: the rooms don't have a safe, if you care for one. The floor plan is a bit confusing so if you have mobility issues please ask for a room that is easily accesible - you will have to go up and down stairs and long corridors otherwise. But the biggest issue is the state of the bathrooms. Showers work great and the water temperature is hot. But the toilets are terrible. They don't flush properly, and I mean it. You need to hold the flush down for quite a bit and pray that the water flushes. We exchanged rooms and the second room had the same issue. So unless they fixed them or if you are constipated this might be the perfect hotel for you.",4,2019,02,12
244,Great stay bit couls be better,Stayed for 2 nights in January. Friendly staff and nice welcome. Room very small but comfy. Shower nice and powerful but if don't want to wash hair is difficult to shower as fixed in place. (No shower cap provided even when enquired). Breakfast was lovely and good quality for buffet style. Location is fantastic and didn't have a problem with any noise. Would reccomend for short stay but any linger than few days would require larger room. ,4,2019,02,04
244,one night in Dublin,"The location is great, no doubts.
Arrival, it took few minutes to get somebody to open the main door (23:30).
Check in was easy. I had to ask about the breakfast, no info was provided.
Carpet at floor and in the room (...), room big. Room temperature a bit under the confort.
The heater in the bathroom was not working, terribly cold!
In the morning I tried to prepare a coffee, but the kettle was not working...
I have notified at the check out, little apologize.
Really not a good experience.",2,2019,01,30
244,Perfect location ,"I was meeting friends in Dublin and booked here for three nights. 

The location is perfect a car park right close as well as Tesco‚Äôs opposite. Being right on Fleet Street you are close to the bars and restaurants as well as many attractions being in walking distance. 

I was given room 201 which is in the front overlooking fleet w and was huge! I had a massive wet room as it‚Äôs clearly a disabled room. Beds were comfortable and even though they provide ear plugs (which I‚Äôm sure in the height of the season are needed) the noise from the street was okay. 

The staff were all friendly and helpful and the breakfast was a buffet style full Irish. Great base for a short or long break. ",5,2019,01,26
244,the perfect place to stay,"As a travel I have just returned from a week in Dublin and I stayed at The Fleet St Hotel. I have sold this many times but never realised how good this hotel actually in .

Its in a perfect location for either end of Dublin and is easy walking access to the shopping of Henry St , O‚ÄôConnell St and Grafton St. It‚Äôs in the quiet part of Temple Bar but close enough to stroll to the many bars , cafes and restaurants . You have a large car park just down the road and a Tesco Express across the road . You can easily walk to Connelly Station ( about 10 minutes ) and about 7 - 10 minutes to Trinity College , Dublin Castle and the Medieval Area . 

The rooms are great ( although a bit small ) and well fitted with a shower that had amazing pressure and good lighting in the bathroom. I had a single room but would have preferred to be in a large Double Room ( just for extra space ) Double Glazing to keep the noice ( ?? ) out and heat in . There is a great sitting lounge  in the Reception area and a very well stocked bar . Breakfast was amazing with a large range of choices of hot or cold with most items homemade . 

Combining location , quality , breakfast and quirkiness ‚Ä¶ stay at the hotel you wont be disappointed",5,2019,01,21
244,New favorite!,"I‚Äôm in Dublin about every 2 to 3 months. I‚Äôve stayed at a couple of other places in Dublin,but the fleet is my new favorite.  This hotel has great charm and is located close enough to walk too all my favorite places but far enough away to be quiet, and all for the right price. Amazing helpful staff and gorgeous lounge.  Can‚Äôt wait to go back in the spring",5,2019,01,16
244,Incredible location ,"What an absolutely fabulous hotel. Been to Dublin a few times and this is the best place we have stayed. The hotel was very plush. The bar area was great and really well designed the bar is beautiful. The rooms were spacious and clean, fab layout and great bathroom. If you are coming to Dublin I would definitely recommend staying here I can‚Äôt wait to go back. ",5,2019,01,13
244,"Conveniently located, Small rooms, Nice Staff","The staff and lobby of The Fleet Street Hotel were both very nice and accommodating. However, the hotel is built wonky so to get to rooms you may need to go up and down small (3-4) stairs as you walk down the hallways. We had to change rooms twice. First on the shower would not work, second they placed us in a small room with a single small bed. Not going to work for two 6'2"" adult males. The eventually got us to a room but a little bit of hassle for us. That said, it was a nice stay. They have a very nice lobby and lobby bar.",3,2019,01,12
244,"Calm place, not too far from the fun","everything about this hotel was 5 stars, clean, nice rooms, near everything yet far enough to avoid the crowds. walking distance from all the fun on Temple street, we walked all over Dublin from this hotel.",5,2019,01,06
244,Lovely place,"Nice hotel and location , the only thing Is the room was right next to the lift and it kept going on all night , so had a bad night sleep. 
The room was clean and the staff lovely .
I would visit again .",4,2019,01,05
244,Warm & Welcoming,"The reception area was amazing- warm fireplace, Christmas decorations, comfy couches and lovely bar staff serving us with Irish coffee's and lovely meals- very professional and friendly. We really enjoyed our stay- Thank you.",5,2019,01,05
244,Christmas Break in Dublin,"I booked the Fleet Hotel in Dublin several months ago, the reviews and pics on their website looked really good. On arrival I was very impressed with the location of this hotel and the entrance/reception and bar area are stunning.  Unfortunately for me this is where the good experience ended.  I had booked an executive double room, the room we were allocated was nothing more than a cupboard with a bed in it and a huge air conditioning unit outside the bedroom window, certainly not what is advertised on websites.  Paying almost ¬£250 for this I was not happy and complained and asked to be moved, we were moved very quickly and the staff could not have been anymore helpful.  We were allocated a triple disabled access room.  There was not even a small complimentary bar of soap in the bathroom or iron/board in the room.  The room overlooked the front of the hotel, which was noisy, however there are ear plugs provided in the room which helped a lot.  We hadn't booked for breakfast as their are so many reasonable cafe's and bistro's in the area.  Overall I would not book this hotel, I have been coming to Dublin for many many years and have stayed in far better accommodation.",3,2019,01,04
244,Beautiful hotel,"Brilliant mid price hotel in the middle of everything in Dublin, spacious comfortable luxurious rooms, beautiful lounge area, fab bar and brilliant breakfast, Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,01,03
244,Great spot if you can handle the noise,"The staff at this hotel was amazing, they were so friendly and helpful -- it never seemed like we were bothering them with our questions. We loved the convenience of the location as well, it was so easy to get to the main sites in Dublin and easy access to transit was also great -- including the stop for the Airport bus. The Lobby was gorgeous and very inviting. Unfortunately, because the hotel is right on Fleet Street it was extremely loud -- the hotel at least provides complementary ear plugs but it would have been better if there was upfront notice about it. The noise is beyond the usual poor soundproofing you find in older European hotels, it was extreme bar goers noise until 5am every day. As we booked quite early in the year so we thought it was kind of strange that were weren't assigned a better room. We seemed to get a handicap accessible washroom that gave us more bathroom space but a very uncomfortable toilet. There were also huge dust bunnies under the curtains and furniture and we did not opt in for the breakfast as it was quite pricey.",4,2019,01,02
244,Pictures are very deceiving,"In regards to location, this hotel is located nearby the famous Temple Bar and other attractions but this hotel lacked a lot in comfort.  We booked this hotel based on their pictures...boy, were we in for a surprise!  The rooms are very small and noisy.  Doors are made of thin plywood and you could hear everything from the hallway.  The bathroom looked nothing like their pictures.  The shower is like a phone booth (for you younger viewers, a phone booth is a tiny box you use to make phone calls in).  Walking to your room was traveling down hallways with more stairs. The only bright spot was the staff.  They were helpful.",2,2019,01,01
244,Stunning Lobby and Pleasant Stay,"On entering the hotel, the first impression is fantastic with the lobby and bar decor being very striking and stylish, including a couple of warm fires and comfy couches. The Reception team were friendly and personable.
The hotel location was excellent, a short walk from all the bars and restaurants on Temple Bar, and yet, for us at least, not too noisy to disrupt our stay.
The rooms themselves were a little on the small side with a very cramped shower and a bathroom that probably could do with some modernisation. There was also no shower or fridge in the room. However, this didn't detract from our stay and we'd recommend this hotel for a good value short visit.",4,2018,12,26
244,return the next time im in dublin to fleet hotel," hotel.very nice .all the staff  are  very friendly and helpful.very nice foyer with a small bar ,lovely warm fire was on,with plenty of couches to sit around fire.also has  lovely bar restaurant. breakfast was good and food in bar was good.bed rooms very clean,ensuite,phone,tv,hairdryer and tea or coffee can also be made.",5,2018,12,17
244,Top class handled like fine china ,"I had the pleasure of staying at this great hotel , great city location has a car Park next door.Great welcome by the team there has been a full refurbishment of the ground floor and its five star , breakfast area and offerings the best I have seen in a long time.I had arranged afternoon tea on Friday afternoon in the luxurious lobby area the sandwich selection pastry , sconces , mince pies were all made in house served on beautiful china service was excellent my friend that joined me said she was blow away by the friendly staff and great food well done Team Fleet hope to see you all soon on my next visit to Dublin City.",5,2018,12,15
244,Superb stay ,"The hotel lobby and bar area are stunning and we were welcomed by very friendly staff, fantastic central location and two great bars. 

Out first night we sat in at the bar for some pre night out drinks, perfectly poured pint of Guinness by the main man Sean, top barman and a top guy, he complained about being too quiet and with in ten minutes his prayers were answered when the bar filled up, unfazed our man Sean stepped up to the plate and kept that bar going, one minute he's serving gin the next whisky and before you know it some fruit tea.  If you go ask for Sean and a drink from the top shelf. He also brought our attention to a spice bag... an Irish Chinese secret and a must have. 

Great staff and a great stay ",5,2018,12,09
244,Wow that lounge,"At the start at this lovely street. So nice lobby and reception and the caf√© or backbar IF you want to was so great. Rooms nice, but could be a little bit noisy outside, not the music but the garbish-guys :-). The breakfast was extraordinary and relaxing. Cant complain, Will stay here again. ",4,2018,12,08
244,Fantastic hotel,"After staying here on my own I came back with my mum for a visit. It was her first time in Dublin and I knew we had to stay at this hotel. Fantastic location right in the centre of Temple bar. Comfortable rooms and friendly staff who can‚Äôt do enough for you. What more do you want? Definitely wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in Dublin, can‚Äôt recommend enough! ",5,2018,12,07
244,Very average,This worked for us as we were only staying for one night but it was very basic for the price. The room was tiny and tv signal not great although we weren't in the room thar much anyway. No extras that really made this place standout. The lobby was very welcoming but again as we wanted to get out and about this didn't make much difference. We didn't have breakfast as it was very expensive and there are loads of other much cheaper places to eat. Staff were lovely and helpful.,3,2018,12,03
244,Amazing! Will definitely return.,"Excellent hotel, in the most perfect location, 2 minutes from Temple Bar Pub. We were able to check in 4 hours early which was lucky and grateful for after an early morning flight. The staff were really helpful with directions and any information we wanted to know. We never ate breakfast as we wanted to get out, bed comfortable, good sized room, dove body wash in the shower, yes there can be nosy times throughout the night but we literally got woken up once throughout our whole stay and we kept our windows open all the time, this is out of the hotels control so stay in a quieter area if this is going to bother you. The reception area is beautiful and looks amazing. There is a luggage room to leave luggage, we used this when we checked out as we still had all day to explore Dublin and didn‚Äôt want to carry our suitcase around.  

We ate at The Elephant and Castle, La Gondola, Hard Rock Cafe & Bobo‚Äôs Burgers all were really nice and would definitely return, they are all walking distance.  

We used the Airlink bus to get to and from the airport which was ‚Ç¨7 each way per person, although we did see a sign saying that it would be around ‚Ç¨25 in taxi to airport.  

Also recommend a visit to the Guinness Storehouse which is a 10 minute bus ride or 30 minute walk from the hotel. Bus costs ‚Ç¨2.10 per person. We never got taxis throughout our visit so unsure how much these cost.",5,2018,11,29
244,Cafe 1920 afternoon lunch,"I am a Dubliner born and bred.  I was returning from a wellness mindful course.  I was feeling positive but hungry.  I wasn't ready to catch a 66!  I went into Cafe 1920, which is part of this beautiful hotel. However, it is not part of their business.
I was taken by the high ceilings and sumptuous but tasteful decor.  The seats and tables were comfortable.  There were Christmas decorations but they were tasteful. 
There was a lunch menu and I asked Sebastian the bar man if he could recommend the chowder to me.  He said he could proudly stand over it.  Simona was my waitress and she laid the table beautifully.  The cutlery was shiny, beautiful and spotless.  There was a beautiful glass receptacle for the butter.  I thought it would look good on my table if I could source it somewhere.  There was eating and drinking on the chowder and is tas full of fish and shells. Very authentic and very fresh. The homemade brown bread was delicious too.  There were other people there but I felt like Simona and Sebastian were my personal attendees for the day. I ordered a flat white and something sweet which was not on the menu.  Quelle belle surprise, et quelle gourmandise when Simona gave me y coffee and Sebastian served me three home made mince pies!!!  Bliss absolute bliss.  I actually brought two of the mince pies home as I wanted to share them with someone special.
I am proud to be a Dub, and to have found this bijou of a restaurant.  Yes it was great value 6.50 euros of the soup and bread.  Well worth it.",5,2018,11,28
244,Very good! ,Its location is so good and it is city centre. You can walk from hotel to tourist attractions. Room was nice and staffs also . I think Breakfast is quite-expensive and sometimes can be a little bit noisy. ,4,2018,11,27
244,Very noisy- do not stay in 119!!!!,"On checking in we were given room 119 which took ages to find as its tucked away through doors and has no signs to it!!! The room is absolutely tiny but fine (however if you are given this room I advise asking if another is available). In the morning st 7am we were woken by two people having a very loud conversation right below our room and loads of very loud banging. The room is so noisy you can hear everything- even a door opening. At 7.40am I went down to reception and in fairness it stopped but not the best start to the day when on holiday ourselves!!

However the hotel is in a great location and at the least the reception is stunning.",2,2018,11,26
244,Excellent and ever improving,"This was my second visit to this hotel, it was very good the first time, but in the intervening period it has been substantially further improved. 

The hotel is perfectly located for the river, the shopping district and the restaurant and bar activity of Temple Bar.  It is also well appointed for the multi-storey car park in the same road for which guests receive a substantial and welcome discount.

I also think that, given the relative luxury and comfort of the public areas and the bedrooms, this is hotel offers great value for money.  I will certainly return when next in town.",5,2018,11,25
244,I only went for eats,"In Dublin for a couple of days and this hotel is just over the bridge from the bank that I happened to open a company account at. I went in the first day for a latte and a sparking water. I spied the mussels on the dinner menu, alas it was not to be, I wanted to go shopping.

The next day I found myself passing again so caught up with those mussels. Mussels + cider + bacon + cream + shredded cabbage and carrot = a wonderful Irish twist on a Belgian classic. People mess around with food but this worked 100%

Weirdly the mussels despite being a perfect light lunch are not on the lunch menu. Huh? I only noticed the previous day because I was teased with the evening menu.

The d√©cor at this place is spectacular, the service is excellent and they are throwing themselves into the festive spirit already with a christmassy playlist and a lady that seemed to have bought a large paper star from Ikea. 

I will have to go back to Dublin as our company has relocated there. This will definitely become my preferred tranquil mussel stop off. I might just try and stay there too.",5,2018,11,24
244,Supper hotel and best all-Irish breakfast ever,"This is a super little hotel right in the heart of Dublin, close to Temple Bar but sufficiently far away so as not to be too crazy.  The Air-coach stop, from the airport, is about a 3 minute walk away.  The bar area has a nice traditional style about it and the rooms clean and spacious.  The breakfast is absolutely fantastic, one of the best full-Irish I've ever had.  Just want to give a special mention to Mike on reception, as my brother and I travelled over for the rugby and had specified twin beds, when we arrived we found we were in a room with a double bed.  Mike worked hard to move things around so that we got a room with twin beds, which made for a decent nights sleep.  That and Ireland beating the All Blacks meant we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2018,11,24
244,When completed it will be perfect,"Lovely hotel in a central location.

The hotel itself is noisy at night, if you want a peaceful sleep stay elsewhere! As I had an ok-ish sleep! 

As soon as you walk in the hotel is lovely, nice lobby area with a bar, prices of drinks extremely reasonable.

I love the lift where you have to put the key in to go to the floor, makes you feel extremely safe on a busy tourist area! 

Breakfast was ok, lots of the food was lukewarm, and looked liked it had been sitting there sometime! We went at 8.30am! 

Definitely recommend if you want a central location! ",4,2018,11,23
244,Nice communal areas and great location ,Very nice reception area and staff. Perfect location for exploring Dublin but the room left a little to be desired. Free ear plugs were provided for the constant drone of the external aircon unit... This didn't actually bother us too much as we were out a lot but some could find it difficult to sleep with the noise I imagine. ,4,2018,11,21
244,Great location,"Beautiful lobby, reception staff were pleasant and helpful, location was second to none - so many good bars and restaurants close by.
The room was a bit smaller than we had expected, other than that we had a pleasant stay.",4,2018,11,19
244,Ok experience,"Great location, slightly weird lift situation. Parking in a lot near the hotel worked. Great location in the temple bar District, central to just about every major attraction. Was a very Lively fun vibe, and the Dublin Market was truly beautiful in the evening. A lot of great pubs and restaurants nearby to choose from. Beautiful hotel room was average size style and appointments.",3,2018,11,18
244,Good and close by,"Stayed for one night with the wife. The hotel itself, entrance hall is very well decorated and it‚Äôs pretty much on Temple Bar and a few steps away from O‚ÄôConnell Street. 
The room however was very small while being nice.
Breakfast was ok, some of the ‚Äúhot‚Äù food bit on the colder side a things though.",4,2018,11,13
244,Great location and staff,"The Fleet is in the heart of the Temple Bar area. It is well connected to everything you may want to do in Dublin. The staff were very helpful after our luggage was left at Frankfurt by the airline. The room was smallish, clean and well presented. Their is a great laundry a block away on the river embankment (Temple Bar Laundry). Keep the windows closed and the street noise disappears. Highly recommended.",5,2018,11,12
244,Couple,This hotel has a beautiful lobby area to meet up with friends. The rooms are super clean and bedding is comfy. Location is perfect because it's walking distance to everything! It's our second time staying here in 2 years.,5,2018,11,07
244,Loved this!,"Great location! Temple Bar area but without the cost, chaos and crowds.  Easy access to our pickup locations for daily tours and for buses around the city.  There's even a great grocery store across the street! This is a sweet hotel, very clean.  Helpful and friendly staff, delicious breakfast, a beautiful lobby to relax in with a glass of wine or spirits, and 24/7 cappuccino machine.   Have recommended it to friends planning to visit Dublin.  Would definitely return.",5,2018,11,06
244,Stay here,You can‚Äôt get a better location. It‚Äôs close to all the bars and the main pickup points for the tours. As 2 girls traveling alone we felt so safe here. They were so accommodating and helpful! Yes you hear people screaming on the streets but I never had trouble sleeping and cmon your in Dublin! Everyone‚Äôs always having a good time! Highly recommend!,5,2018,11,05
244,Extremely Disappointed ,"We had paid approximately 140 Euro per night for a three day stay and when we recently checked the hotel‚Äôs website, we are at a loss as to why we were given a basic double room which is about 96 euros per night. The room was noisy, dirty and extremely basic. Chairs were torn, walls damaged, grouting dirty, tiles broken, over-looking scaffolding. We found it difficult to sleep with the noise of furniture being dragged across rooms (the floor above us) and the noise of building work and bins being emptied at 6am. When we queried the complimentary industrial ear plugs, we were told that every room had them. 

We decided to give the room one night. After little sleep, we went out only to arrive back to locked key cards. When we queried this at reception, we were met with ‚Äòwe hear that you don‚Äôt like your room‚Äô. We said that it was incredibly noisy and were given an ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô to an Elegance room. Looking back, the nightly rate for this type of room was not much more that what we had paid (and made to pay up front) so we don‚Äôt view it as much of an upgrade. As this was our first wedding anniversary, we feel extremely disappointed and out of pocket. The second room was nice with period details, comfortable bed and complimentary Rituals toiletries. On check out, we were not asked about our stay and staff seemed disinterested. We are extremely disappointed and feel very much out of pocket and robbed of a wedding anniversary stay.",1,2018,11,04
244,Mixed emotions,"Rarely had I in the evaluation of a hotel as mixed feelings as the Fleet Street Hotel.

Let's start with the good stuff.

The hotel has obviously been completely refurbished recently. The rooms are clean and modern, the ambience throughout the hotel is very tastefully designed. The lobby is one of the nicest I have seen in this price range in recent years.

The breakfast is five stars! Although the breakfast room is in the basement, it does not seem dark at all, as everything is very bright, friendly and airy. The quality and choice of food is first class. Especially the scrambled eggs are not prepared industrially and the backed beans are fortunately not from Heinz (which of course will deter the British) and taste great.

The service is friendly and accommodating and made the stay very pleasant.

Now for my two criticisms. For one thing, it's incredibly noisy at night on Fleet Street. We knew that through the description in advance and the closed windows keep the noise (which goes on until the early hours of the morning) largely outside.

But what annoyed us most was the room allocation. We booked an ""executive double"", and no matter what the manager might comment on here, never was a room a class higher. The room was good, but so compact that there can never be a class below in the hotel. We had already complained to the reservation confirmation, as only a standard double was listed here and at the check-in again, but unfortunately not received.

With the noises you have to live in this area, but with the room class leads to the point deduction, unfortunately.",4,2018,11,04
244,Nicely done,"The hotel would appear to have gone through some renovations (currently the front has scaffolding around it).

The lobby and desk area is gorgeous and the staff were very helpful and lovely.

We booked for one night as in town for a concert.  They upgraded our room which was a nice touch.

Getting to the room, upon entry it looked lovely, but you could smell the kitchen from below.

Having made the decision that we wouldn‚Äôt be in the room when the kitchen would be open long enough for it to truly bother us.  We got freshened up and went in a mini pub crawl.

The room was very well decorated, bright, clean, and comfortable, a bath would have been appreciated but go one night, not an issue.

The breakfast was lovely.

All round a really nice hotel and would definitely recommend as the location is excellent.",4,2018,11,03
244,So helpful,This place is amazing. This was the first stop on our honeymoon and the airline lost one of our bags and the reception desk staff were so helpful in helping us get it back. They had great recommendations on what to do and see and shop. The building is old and kinda quirky with its unique floor plan and lay out and stairs. But that is part of the charm we fell in love with. Yes you have to go down stairs to go back up to get to our room but that was part of the fun of our adventurous trip. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants a unique place to stay. We weren‚Äôt terribly bothered by any noise. The bed was comfortable. Overall I‚Äôd stay here again. ,5,2018,10,25
244,Great central location!,"We stayed at The Fleet Street Hotel for 2 nights.

Here is what I liked:
-excellent location in the Temple Bar area and close to everything, including Trinity College
-room consisted of a double and twin bed. I took the twin bed and it was extremely comfortable
-towel warmers in bathroom were a nice touch
-even though the hotel was located in a very busy area, the room itself was quiet for sleeping

Here's what I didn't like so much:
-hotel was under construction and i was not notified in advance. this means we could not take advantage of what looked like a cute little bar and lounge area
-the shower took forever to drain, to the point that i tried to take a quick shower so that the water wouldn't overflow at the bottom
-no amenities (shower gel, shampoo, etc.) provided in bathroom",4,2018,10,25
244,Excellent Location,"We stayed in The Fleet Street Hotel for 2 nights, located in the heart of the city, currently undergoing renovation, staffs are friendly and helpful. The room is bright, clean, comfort and quiet. Comfortable bed, wifi connection not fast but stable.",4,2018,10,23
244,PERFECT LOCATION.  THE NEW FACILITIES WILL MAKE IT EVEN BETTER,"Location
Only 1 min from Temple Bar pub, 4 mins from Trinity College, 4 mins from Liffey ruver,  5 mins from airport shuttle bus stop.  So location is nailed

Staff
Very friendly, helpful and informative.  

Facilities
Free tea, coffee and fruit juice at reception is a nice idea.  While we were there they were in the middle of relocating the reception and breakfast room to a ground floor location.  This will be a massive improvement as the current breakfast room is too small and we we had to wait for people to finish before we could eat.  Corridors were light, wide and carpeted.  Good security.  There are a few steps in the corridors.  Wifi worked well

Breakfast
Not bad, but would have like to have had grilled tomatoes.  the choice is (or was) sausages, bacon, black pudding (all good quality), baked beans, scrambled eggs  and potato pancakes (like hash browns)  There was the usual breads, croissants, jams etc  Also, ham, cheese, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, yoghurts, cereal.  Coffee was good.  Orange juice was very watery.  I believe it costs 17‚Ç¨ pp

Room
Our room was small and dark (119).  The size was not a problem but next time we would ask for a room with a bitter wiindow.  It was quiet though.  The bathroom was clean and moder.  The bed was comfy and we slept well.",4,2018,10,22
244,"Perfect location, great rooms","We stayed for just one night and this hotel was in the best location, right at the top of Temple Bar.   Our room was on a busy street yet you could not hear anything when the windows were closed.  Huge comfortable king size bed, and quite a large room.  We stayed in the Elegance Room.  They are renovating the pub downstairs but there was plenty of choices just steps away to find a great pub with great music, food and drinks.",5,2018,10,21
244,Great stay!,"Recently stayed for two nights - didnt quite know what to expect in the busy Temple Bar area.  Hotel is undergoing a lovely renovation - lobby is beautiful with a nice bar.  I had asked for - and recieved - a ""quieter"" room.  The room was fantastic with an enormous and beautifully outfitted bath.  Very good location to walk to nearly everything you could want to see.  I would definitely choose to go back here!",5,2018,10,21
244,"Great Location, will be better once renovation is done","Convenient to tourist area.  
Car Park just around the corner and close enough to lug your luggage from/to.
Bed was comfortable and bathroom was a great size.  The room was tight with furniture and bed.  There was a hairdryer, and I'm pretty sure we definitely toiletries.
Our room was on the 3rd floor and after taking elevator up, after reception on 1st floor, we still had to go down 6 steps to get to our room.  If our room was further, it would have required more steps.
If you are handicap, be sure you request room accommodations. 
It was quiet and I would stay here again.",4,2018,10,15
244,"Located right in Temple bar, lots of rambling corridors to comfortable rooms","A quaint little entrance on one of the trendy exciting streets of the Temple bar area. It has a little lift and a staircase at street level, Reception was on the 1st floor and our room was at the back of the building along rambling corridors and stairs up and down, the place is like a rabbit warren, but our room was very nice upstairs at the rear and very quiet. Breakfast was OK in a separate room downstairs.",4,2018,10,13
244,Party central Dublin,Very central to Dublin nightlife and quite comfortable. Unfortunate that the bar and lounge is being renovated atm and are closed. The rooms are pretty well noise insulated from outside noise but the walls inside aren‚Äôt so good - but we slept well anyway.,4,2018,10,09
244,Perfect from start to finish!,"Group of 16 stayed for 2 nights, the staff have been great from the moment we booked, yeah some work is happening down stairs but that is all improvements and doesn't affect ur stay! Beds soooo comfy! Only thing is the lift and the card to get to your room after a few gunniess can be a fiddle ha! But defo worth staying right where u need to be but still quite enough to sleep! Thank ypu fleet street staff for having us... hope to see you again..",5,2018,10,08
244,Just... no.,"The whole lobby is under construction and it‚Äôs hard to navigate anywhere. Though the location is great, the rooms are terrible.
No toiletries! I‚Äôve never stayed at a hotel that didn‚Äôt provide shampoo and conditioner - glad I had my own.

The whole pace seems damp.
Would not recommend.",1,2018,10,08
244,Hotel to repeat,"The Hotel is located in the best area of Dublin, close to all the monuments to visit.
The staff at the front desk and the office were excellent.
Ana was very attentive throughout.
The hotel is in the Temple area; for those who like live music, you can always listen.",5,2024,10,09
244,Cold and poorly soundproofed room,"The hotel's strong point is its welcoming lobby. Good breakfast with very attentive and friendly staff. The bad thing is the room where we spend very cold and bad soundproof. There was only a small radiator in a triple room. The bathroom radiator was not working. The room had a blind window - badly soundproofed - that overlooked the ventilation machinery of restaurants. And the last straw, I had the misfortune to leave my wristwatch in the room and it disappeared!",1,2024,09,30
244,"General rate, corporal stay","The central location is in the heart of Temple Bar. The common areas of the hotel are very well maintained and welcoming. Breakfast has a good choice between savoury and sweet. The availability and courtesy of the reception and waiting staff. 
These are the only positive notes. 
The single room was without air conditioning, small and with a window that gave into a crevice placed a short distance from the aerators of a local neighbor that I even had difficulty opening. 
The stench of windowless bathroom and efficient ventilation.
In short, an accommodation certainly not consistent with a 4-star structure and the rate paid (175 euros for one night). 
I protested to the management: they promised to write to me and after three days of my stay I receive an apology email in which I ‚Äúacknowledge‚Äù a refund, but only on a possible future Reservation. To laugh and never go back",2,2024,09,17
244,Very small rooms,"4-star hotel offering 2-star rooms. Lovely lobby, excellent location, friendly staff but.... Standard room very small, tiny bathroom, no air, no minibar. Endless stairs and corridors.  They are not in line with the hotel category.",3,2024,07,22
244,Central with potential for improvement,"The hotel is very centrally located but still quiet.
The bed was comfortable, but not what I expected for a king-size bed (it doesn't correspond to an American one, apparently only European ones). The lobby was cozy. The negative thing is that this hotel is very convoluted, there is no direct elevator to the desired floor. We had to carry our suitcases down the stairs and then back up the stairs to get to our room. Breakfast is in the basement, but very friendly and warm, the breakfast itself is very average. In general, the hotel was very clean.",3,2024,06,19

Very well located in the down town of Dublin, close to everything, ideal for the temple bar area and for a week in Dublin.
The rooms, although small, are pleasant and the
Very chic lobby.
Correct prices and perfect breakfast.

244,Sch√∂nes Hotel mit schrecklichen Zimmern,"Eigentlich stimmt an diesem Hotel alles, ausser das wichtigste. 
Super Lage. Freundliches Personal. Wundersch√∂ne Lobby. Gutes Fr√ºhst√ºck‚Ä¶aber‚Ä¶.die Zimmer sind absolut schrecklich und die publizierten Bilder sind Irref√ºhrend!!!!!
 Winzig kleine Betten welche auch noch schr√§g sind. Fenster lassen sich nicht schliessen, an dieser lage echt sch‚Ä¶.e da es in Temple Bar durchaus mal estwas laut sein kann auf den Strassen. Allles wirkt verbraucht und schmudelig, schon fast ekelig. Der Teppich scheint seit 100 Jahren der selbe zu sein. Radiatoren funktionieren nicht. Wiederum andere Radiatoren sind mit Tape ‚Äûrepariert‚Äú.  Und das ganze f√ºr stolze 320‚Ç¨ pro Nacht ohne Fr√ºhst√ºck!!! Da stimmt das Preis/Leistungsverh√§ltnis √ºberhaupt nicht.
Und da die Zimmer das wichtigste an einem Hotel sind gibt es nur 2 Punkte.",2,2023,07,17
244,Leider entt√§uschend,"Die Fotos auf Booking.com con den Zimmern waren meilenweit von der Realit√§t entfernt. Unser Zimmer war alt und schmuddelig.  Die Fenster liessen sich nicht mehr ganz schliessen, da war keine heizung und dinge waren mit Tape repariert.

244,"CHECK IN H 16:00, PULIZIA STANZE H 18:00, SCORTESIA ALLA RECEPTION, PESSIMO RAPPORTO QUALITA‚Äô/PREZZO","ASSURDO: CHECK IN non prima delle ore 16 e PULIZIA DELLE CAMERE anche alle 18. SCORTESIA e ARROGANZA ALLA RECEPTION. Arriviamo la mattina, ma il check in si fa alle 16. Ci dicono di provare comunque prima. Passeggiata, alle 15 torniamo: la stanza non √® pronta. Aspettiamo seduti nella hall. Alle 15:30 arriva una comitiva di 15/20 persone. Si mettono in fila alla reception per il check-in. Nel frattempo c‚Äô√® stato il cambio turno dei receptionist, temo che i nuovi non siano stati informati della nostra ‚Äúattesa‚Äù e inoltre, vedendo i signori in fila, temo possano ‚Äúscipparci‚Äù la stanza. Al che mi alzo, supero la fila non per fare il furbo ma per chiedere informazioni. Il ragazzo alla reception mi chiede se faccio parte del gruppo, gli rispondo che voglio solo sapere se la camera √® pronta e lui, capendo che sono italiano, in italiano mi dice, alzando la voce, che deve prima pensare a questi signori e poi a me. Mi risiedo. Alle ore 16 esatte il ragazzo ci chiama, chiede scusa per il comportamento di prima, ma ci√≤ non toglie che √® intollerabile: mai capitata in vita mia una cosa del genere! Dei due italiani alla reception, √® quello con la barba (non molto folta). PESSIMO RAPPORTO QUALITA‚Äô/PREZZO. Senza sconto Genius la matrimoniale Deluxe sarebbe costata 300‚Ç¨ a notte, senza colazione (soggiorno 13 al 16 giugno, nemmeno vera alta stagione). 1) Piccola come la ‚Äúsemplice‚Äù (la differenza? Unicamente la testiera del letto in finta pelle) 2) Letto stretto (poco pi√π largo di una piazza e mezza) e corto (2 cm in pi√π dei miei 180 cm e i piedi sarebbero ciondolati fuori) 3) NO frigobar 4) NO ARIA CONDIZIONATA, vero che Dublino non √® calda, ma in questo giugno le massime hanno insolitamente toccato e anche superato i 26¬∞ e nella nostra stanza c‚Äôerano anche 2¬∞ in pi√π; 5) NON INSONORIZZATA: chiasso dal corridoio; pur chiudendo la finestra, rumore di un condizionatore forse del ristorante dell‚Äôhotel (l√† s√¨ che c‚Äô√®) 6) Bagno privo di aspiratore funzionante...

244,Fr√ºhling in Dublin,"Zuerst m√ºssen wir das tolle Personal loben!! Alle superfreundlich und hilfsbereit...ausser das Zimmerm√§dchen! Zwar freundlich, aber mit dem Zimmermachen hat es etwas geharkt. Ein Bettbezug war kaputt bzw an den N√§hten aufgerussen und ein Handtuch Bad ausgefranst. Nachteil in unserem Zimmer war, dass die Fenster sich nicht richtig √∂ffnen lie√üen und nachts im Innenhof sehr laut brummend st√§ndig die Klimaanlage zu h√∂ren war.  Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffett h√§tten wir uns etwas liebevoller arrangiert gew√ºnscht. Nur 2 K√§sesorten, immer die selben, anstatt der auf der Karte angebotenen 5 , kein Fisch bzw Lachs, Brot h√§tte auch etwas mehr Auswahl sein d√ºrfen. Das Personal war allerdings auch dort topp!!",4,2023,04,03
244,Gutes Hotel mit Luft nach oben,"Grunds√§tzlich ist es kein schlechtes Hotel. Gro√ües Zimmer, gro√ües Badezimmer, die Zimmer zum Hof sind ruhig. Das Bett bequem, gutes WLAN.

Abends gibt es einen Security vor dem Eingang. Die H√∂flichkeit von ihm hat Luft nach oben.",4,2022,12,02
244,PERFETTO +++++,"Hotel fantastico sia per la posizione veramente comoda sia per visitare le pi√π importanti attrazioni di dublino sia per i locali serali , buona la colazione con varie scelte di dolce e salato, camera spaziosa e ben pulita, una menzione particolare per√≤ la vorrei fare al personale veramente gentile in ogni occasione, se torno a dublino andr√≤ li sicuramente.... CONSIGLIATO +++",5,2022,11,11
244,Delusione,"La delusione si riferisce alla stanza. Posta al primo piano, veramente troppo piccola, con nessuno spazio per riporre gli indumenti. Non √® stato possibile svuotare la valigia. Inoltre pessima l‚Äôinsonorizzazione; rumori dello scarico del bagno della stanza al piano superiore, come pure dalle voci degli occupanti. Inaccettabile per un hotel di questo livello e soprattutto per il costo della stanza.
Le parti comuni sono carine, mentre la colazione non merita una menzione particolare.",2,2022,08,27
244,SCELTA TOP,"Ottimo hotel nel quartiere Temple Bar, vicino a locali e ristoranti.
Comodo alla fermata del bus per l‚Äôaeroporto, la fermata √® Austin Quay.

244,Entspricht nicht den Erwartungen,"Gut war, dass wir ein Zimmer zum Hinterhof bekamen, insofern ruhig. Das Fenster konnte man allerdings nur 10 cm √∂ffnen und es gab keine Klimaanlage. Auch war, anders als auf der Webseite beschrieben kein Safe im Zimmer. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war gut und die Mitarbeiter im Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum waren extrem freundlich und hilfsbereit. Im Nachgang gab es eine nicht gerechtfertigte zus√§tzliche Kreditkartenbelastung. Ich hatte das Hotel dann angeschrieben und um Stornierung gebeten. Der Betrag wurde dann auch storniert, allerdings kommentarlos. Von einem 4-Sterne Hotel w√ºrde ich mir einen deutlich besseren Servicegedanken erwarten.",3,2022,04,23
244,Buon posto per alloggiare in Temple Bar,"Abbiamo scelto questo albergo per la posizione centralissima nella citt√†, nel cuore di Temple Bar, a due passi dal Trinity College, a poco pi√π di 10 minuti a piedi dal National College. La struttura √® molto grande e la Hall risulta con i suoi divani e i suoi due caminetti (a gas) molto elegante. La camera singola non era molto grande e anche il letto era quello a una piazza (non troppo comodo per la verit√†), per√≤ era dotata di tutto l'essenziale: armadio con dentro teiera e un fon per capelli, una sedia, una scrivania e un bagno con box doccia. La finestra purtroppo dava su  un piccolo spazio vuoto (e sporchino) e non sull'esterno, quindi la camera rimaneva tendenzialmente poco illuminata. Il box doccia per quanto pratico, non  permetteva di staccare la doccia dalla sua posizione, rendendo pi√π antipatico il risciacquo. Abbiamo preso questo albergo comprensivo di colazione. La colazione offriva diverse cose molto buone: dal classico bacon alle uova strapazzate, dalla frutta allo yogurt, vari tipi di marmellata e miele, muffin e altri dolci con marmellata o crema. Per bere c'era la spremuta d'arancia, acqua, sidro alle mele, latte, cappuccino e the. Insomma la colazione era ben organizzata (anche se al settimo giorno un pochino stufava). Il personale della struttura √® stato molto gentile e disponibile a tutte le nostre richieste: mi √® stata stampata la carta di imbarco il giorno prima della partenza, ci hanno chiamato un taxi grande per 5 persone fino all'aeroporto e altre cose di burocrazia varia. In particolare Andrea, alla reception, √® stato molto carino ad aiutarci e prezioso nelle sue informazioni. Sicuramente √® un bell'albergo che va tenuto presente per qualche giorno nella capitale irlandese. Per la spesa, non proprio di fascia economica, magari mi aspettavo qualcosa di pi√π. Ma si pu√≤ prenotare senza problemi.",4,2020,03,02
244,Pintoresco hotel,"Hotel muy bien ubicado en Dublin en pleno coraz√≥n de la ciudad, cerca de todo. Excelente atenci√≥n por parte del personal. El desayuno es muy bueno. La relaci√≥n entre calidad y precio es aceptable teniendo en cuenta su ubicaci√≥n.",5,2020,01,31
244,Alles ganz wunderbar,"Das Fleet-Street-Hotel liegt direkt am Eingang zu ""Temple Bar"" und damit fu√ül√§ufig zum Ausgehviertel und zur Innenstadt von Dublin. Trotzdem kann man dort entspannt schlafen und wird nicht vom Trouble der Stadt wachgehalten.
Das Personal ist ganz besonders freundlich, sehr zuvorkommend und wirklich hilfsbereit.
Die Zimmer wurden k√ºrzlich renoviert und sind wirklich sch√∂n und auch die Sauberkeit l√§sst nicht zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet bietet alles was das Herz begehrt: Frisches Obst, Joghurt, verschiedene Brotsorten und -Belag und nat√ºrlich auch alles, was zu einem klassischen Englischen Fr√ºhst√ºck geh√∂rt, wie Baked Beans, Hashbrowns und W√ºrstchen. Wirklich top und alles war frisch und ansprechend angerichtet.
In der Bar gibt es klassische Barsnacks, die wirklich lecker sind.

244,Tutto perfetto!!!,"La nostra esperienza al The Fleet Hotel √© stata assolutamente positiva!
Camere bellissime, spaziose, pulite. La Hall dell‚Äôhotel √® magica, confortevole e rilassante. La struttura √® centralissima e vicinissima al rinomato Temple Bar. 
Il personale veramente molto gentile, abbiamo organizzato tramite loro un‚Äôescursione alle Cliff of Moher e Galway, ci hanno dato ottime indicazioni e preparato il pranzo take away per la giornata. 
Consiglio vivamente questo hotel!! Una meravigliosa esperienza nel cuore di Dublino. 
",5,2019,12,04
244,Ottima Posizione,"Hotel a 3 stelle che si trova all'inizio di Fleet street, l'inizio del quartiere Temple Bar. Il famoso pub rosso ""temple bar"" dista solo 150 metri, ancora pi√π vicino il pub Oliver St. John Gogartys (per intenderci quello colorato di verde)
Anche le altre zone turistiche della citt√† sono facilmente raggiungibili a piedi (per chi arriva con il bus airlink 747 consiglio la fermata di ""college green""...dall'hotel dista circa 300 metri).
Proprio davanti all'hotel c'√® un grande supermercato Tesco e anche un ristorante in stile american diner.
Altri punti positivi sono:
-gentilezza dello staff e possibilit√† di lasciare il bagaglio dopo il ceck-out fino a sera in custodia.
-wi-fi gratuito e  veloce
-stanza e bagno puliti e abbastanzanza spaziosi (considerato gli standard di dublino)
-camera riscaldata alla temperatura giusta, materassi e cuscini comodi.
-camere sicure (per usare l'ascensore o entrare nei piani bisogna inserire la chiave magnetica della stanza)

punti negativi: 
-le camere sono su pi√π livelli, non √® facile capire dove si trovi la camera
-ascensore lento, si fa prima a piedi con le scale
-camere poco insonorizzate, si sente il rumore del corridoio sopratutto quando alla mattina fanno le pulizie nelle altre camere.

Sul prezzo della camera non do un giudizio ne positivo ne negativo..dublino come strutture alberghiere si sa che √® carissima e quindi se vuoi alloggiare in centro c'e' poco da fare..",5,2019,11,07
244,Ottimo!!!!,"Ottima struttura, curata in tutti i dettagli. Personale gentilissimo e locali super confortevoli. Vicinissimo alle fermate degli autobus per l‚Äôaeroporto e alla stazione Tara st per raggiungere Howth.

244,Posizione valida,"La posizione dell‚Äôalbergo √® sicuramente il pro da sottolineare. Molto buona anche la struttura, l‚Äôallestimento e l‚Äôarredamento delle camere. Ottima l‚Äôaccoglienza e la disponibilit√† da parte dello staff. L‚Äôunica nota negativa, la rumorosit√† della stanza che si affacciava sulla strada all‚Äôangolo con il prince bar (pub noto per festeggiare partite sportive e zona di passaggio di molti bus), non abbiamo il sonno leggero ma abbiamo fatto comunque un po‚Äô fatica a riposare. Da chiedere se possibile una stanza che non dia sulla strada.",3,2019,08,24
244,Nettes Hotel in hervorragender Lage,"Das Hotel liegt am Beginn des Viertels Temple Bar und in wenigen Gehminuten erreicht man das Trinity College und die Restaurants in der Innenstadt. Das Haus ist alt aber wohl mehrmals erweitert und renoviert worden. Innerhalb der Geschosse gibt es noch kleinere Treppen und das Haus ist etwas verwinkelt, was ihm aber den Charme verleiht.
Einen Punkt Abzug geben wir wegen des sehr schmalen Betts (140 cm). Ansonsten sind auch die Zimmer sehr klein, was aber f√ºr wenige Tage ertr√§glich ist, das Bad ist ordentlich und alles ist sehr sauber.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist - gemessen an irischen Verh√§ltnissen - gut, etwas √§rgerlich ist es, wenn man am Kaffeeautomat fast 10 Minuten anstehen muss, um sich seinen Kaffee selbst zu machen.
Insgesamt w√ºrden wir wieder hier absteigen, wenn wir nach Dublin kommen.",4,2019,07,26
244,buena ubicacion y personal muy amable,"Nos dieron una habitaci√≥n con una sola cama y pedimos que nos cambiaran a otra de dos camas.

Pues bueno... me dieron una habitaci√≥n que era de una categor√≠a inferior, que luego mir√© en su p√°gina web y costaba 60‚Ç¨ menos que lo que me hab√≠an cobrado a mi. La habitaci√≥n era tan peque√±a que la puerta del ba√±o cuando la abr√≠a tocaba en la cama y si abr√≠a la maleta ten√≠a que ir saltado por encima de ella para poder pasar.  La cama min√∫scula y el colch√≥n s√∫per duro. El ba√±o es bonito pero igualmente s√∫per peque√±o, sin repisa para poder colocar los enseres personales.

La hall √® bellissima, con due caminetti, grandi divani e lampadari di cristallo. Raggiungere la camera all‚Äôinizio non √® semplice perch√© i corridoi sembrano un dedalo, ma ci si abitua velocemente. La camera era perfetta, bel bagno e un letto comodissimo. Un po‚Äô rumorosa perch√© dava sulla strada dove si fermano i bus. Consiglio la colazione inclusa, c‚Äô√® la parte irish breakfast, con salsiccia, bacon, uova, fagioli, funghi ecc. ma anche la parte continentale, con yogurt, cereali, pane, brioches, marmellate e almeno due tipi di porridge, frutta e altro.",4,2019,04,10

Cuando nosotros estuvimos estaban en obras, por lo que imagino que ahora habr√° mejorado el hotel.  
La habitaci√≥n era un poco peque√±a pero se compensaba con un ba√±o grande y muy c√≥modo. Estaba completamente renovada tanto la habitaci√≥n como el ba√±o.  
Lo peor es el laberinto que tienen para llegar a las habitaciones, ya que el ascensor no llega a todas las plantas y tienes que ir subiendo y bajando escaleras cargando con las maletas. 
El desayuno escaso para ser buffet. ",3,2019,01,10

244,Habitaci√≥n peque√±a y ruidosa,"La habitaci√≥n que me dieron era peque√±a y con un ventanuco que daba a una salida de aire.

En las caracter√≠sticas del hotel figura que tiene ascensor y no se nos avis√≥ de que para llegar a nuestra habitaci√≥n (Elegance, de mayor precio) hab√≠a que subir y bajar much√≠simas escaleras cargando con nuestros equipajes sin ayuda.
