26,Looks great but a bit soulless - breakfast poor,It’s a nice enough looking hotel - very modern and clean. Doesn’t feel greatly personal or welcoming. Rooms are spacious and as per the rest well done out throughout. Top deck bar was not open which is a shame as that for me is one of the reasons you book a hotel like this. Breakfast very poor in selection and choices - scrambled eggs like a porridge. For the price I wouldn’t recommend and feel you could find somewhere more engaging.,3,2024,09,25
26,11-15th August trip,"CHECK IN - Arrived at the hotel at 9pm exhausted and hot. It was very quiet but we were not offered a welcome drink or water. Check in took ages then almost had a heart attack as the person at check in was about to charge us an extra £800. Luckily I had the printout of the cost - I booked direct with the hotel.  He didn’t have a clue what he was doing. Then charged £800 on my debit card as a deposit. I was not advised anywhere in the booking process this would happen. He said booking.com should have told me. I reminded him again I booked direct on the hotel website!! Less spending money for us as £800 was taken (and not returned until 8 days after the trip). TERRIBLE check in experience.
ROOMS - these were truly 5 star. Beds were comfortable and wash room lovely with everything you need eg hairdryer, toothbrush set, nice toiletries.  We booked two rooms and were next to each other with a huge window and beautiful view.
SERVICE - Tried calling reception multiple times even at quiet times with no answer. I was trying to get an iron and asked for one three times. After 48 hours I finally got one but it was so old I couldn’t see the markings on the dial! When I plugged it in it sparked out! Another two calls for another iron which finally worked. Rooms were cleaned really well daily.
STAFF - were really friendly and a lovely lady called Camile showed us around the hotel when we mentioned we were a little lost as to where everything was. She also said she would feedback our bad check in experience although we didn’t hear back. 
BREAKFAST - was great and one of the best I’ve had with quality food. A wide variety with a huge choice although does get repetitive after day 3
FACILITIES - Pool was nice but a little muddy. The pool advertised is the one you have to pay €75 for. When Camile showed us around we were told that the sauna was open and steam room not ready yet.  When I went to use the sauna I was advised that it was €25 and only free for Red Level! So seems like staff give conflicting information. Gym was small but suitable. Lobby was really grand and nice.  They could do with a few water dispensers or tea/coffee facilities there as it is a nice place to relax outwith the room
TRANSPORT - great Metro links. We got the metro from airport straight to Zona University which is about 5 mins to the hotel.  We got the t-usual card and made good use of the buses and metro to get to our destinations. A bit far from the city centre and some metros do get a bit overcrowded and hot at peak times. We also used the free shuttle van (capacity of 7 people) once that took us to Pl Catalunya - this is only one way.
Unfortunately this was my worst check in experience ever and resulted in me giving 3 stars (as well as some lacking customer service) instead of 5.",3,2024,09,22
26,Beautiful resort in the city,"What an amazing place for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. I loved every aspect of my stay! The staff was exceptional, the breakfast was delicious, and the rooms were comfortable and beautifully maintained. I’ll definitely be returning!",5,2024,09,15
26,Excellent hotel,"I stayed in Torre Melina last week on a business trip to Barcelona, and I want to clarify some things mentioned down by fellow travelers. I guess some of them were annoyed by some hotel policies so they wrote their reviews in affect, as imo, no chance you can rate this hotel bad.
LOCATION - not so great for tourists - on the western end of Diagonal. It is far away from main tourist sites, however the nearest metro stop (Zona Universitaria) is 7, 8 min walk and Line 3 takes you quickly to main sites. Also, there's a free shuttle bus on the hour taking you to Pl. Catalunya - sole city center.
LOBBY - enormous and amazingly beautiful with huge open air V shaped atrium. Check in fast with extremely kind staff - that applies to all staff members I encountered throughout the hotel for two days.
ROOMS - spacious, clean and modern. Ask for EVEN number room, as those have city center views - Montjuic, MNAC, Plaza Espana, downtown,....very, very nice view from my 612. Beds were extremely comfortable, as well pillows. Everything in the room is new and digital. Separate shower cabin and attached toilet.
BREAKFAST -  wonderful. Huge and quality choice of cold and warm dishes, great selection of fresh fruits, pastries, cakes,...you name it.
POOLS - there are two of them, and yes - there is a small misleading fact, but is well explained.
The pool you see on the website and booking platforms is the charging one. You need to spend 75 Euros there per person in order to enjoy it. So, it is not paying like some say here, but you get food and drink for your spent money. How much you get and what are the prices - I don't know. I didn't check the prices, just chatted to a young kind hostess who let me walk around. This pool looks more inviting with better sunbeds, cabanas, sand and grass, restaurant by it,....
However, just across the lobby there's a free pool, bigger than the paying one, and closer to the hotel. Surroundings are not that fancy, but well maintained and clean with ordinary sunbeds, yet same quality towels.
So, it's up to you to choose. Imo, what's lacking is the indoor pool for colder months as Barcelona is a year round destination.
To conclude, great hotel to spend your Barcelona vacation.",5,2024,09,14
26,Wonderful in so many ways,"What a beautiful hotel with good size rooms. We stayed for two nights. Room has lots of little extra to pamper you. What a stunning lobby too.

Breakfast has an excellent spread and staff were friendly. 

Hotel is a little further away from the main tourist streets but I love being away from the hustle and bustle.

Tip: Hotel provides a free shuttle to town. You can find out the timing from concierge. Do make a booking if you are travelling during peak season.",5,2024,09,04
26,A beautiful hotel with great swimming pool,"The hotel is located very close to the Nou Camp and Barcelona University campus.

There are excellent transport links via the metro or bus to the city centre (20 minutes ride) and the hotel offers a free shuttle service. The metro L9 also goes straight to the airport without the need to change.

The hotel itself has a grand luxury feel as you walk into the hotel, with a spacious modern design. Unlike central City hotels, the hotel is surrounded by beautiful botanical gardens and is much quieter and more relaxing.

Our bedrooms were large with plenty of storage space. The outdoor swimming pool is probably the largest for a hotel in Barcelona, with plenty of sunbeds and fresh towels.

There is also plenty of choice for breakfast.

However, there are certainly areas for improvement to give this hotel a 5 star rating:
1. Check-in took 30 minutes when we had already completed an online check-in form. The front house staff appeared to be relatively inexperienced.
2. Despite my correspondence with the hotel before arrival, our bedrooms weren't ready at 3pm and we only got them at 4.30pm
3. Despite informing the hotel in advance about our allergies to bird feathers, our bedroom duvets had feathers, which caused my daughter and my respitory problems. The hotel was apologetic and resolved the serious issue  but should have paid much closer attention.
4. The grass area surrounding the pool needs to be replaced as it made the pool area dirty.
5. The hotel has a magnificent bar area, but wasn't being serviced which was a real shame.
6. There appears to be many managers but not enough experienced staff to provide an excellent client experience.

Overall this hotel has so much potential to be the best in Barcelona,  especially with its grounds and facilities. It will certainly improve over the next year.",4,2024,09,01
26,Nice But Too Far From Key Sites,"Stayed here a few years back and it was an enjoyable stay but not near any of the key sites one would want to visit. A long expensive cab ride to the Familia Sagrada, Park Guell or Las Ramblas or any of the Gothic Quarter sites. Rooms were spacious, concierge helpful and the on site restaurant was very good.",3,2024,08,18
26,Disappointing Experience Due to Misleading Advertising and Lack of Plant-Based (Vegan) Options,"My wife and I are currently staying at Torre Melina and were initially excited by the beautiful pool advertised on the hotel’s Google listing, Booking.com, and their website. However, we've been disappointed to discover that the pool is actually part of Beso Pedralbes and requires a daybed rental costing €100 per day to access.

Additionally, the hotel mentions having two outdoor pools, but in reality, there is only one. The second pool, which is prominently featured in their marketing materials, is actually the one at Beso Pedralbes and not freely accessible to hotel guests.

The pool they do have is an unfortunate state of affairs. It’s dirty and muddy, and doesn’t have enough loungers or umbrellas for most guests. They have another area with dead grass that houses some overflow of guests but it’s separate and relatively depressing. We’ve unfortunately had better pool experiences in 3 star hotels — surprising when you consider Gran Meliá at the top end of Melia’s offering.

Another major disappointment has been the lack of plant-based options, even in the Red Level lounge. We have been misguided a couple of times on what is truly plant-based, including a suggestion for a salad that we later found out included shrimp. Since there are no proper vegan options available, we’ve had to remove almost everything from the meals offered, leaving us with little to eat. This has forced us to dine out for almost every meal, making our €50 food and beverage credit essentially worthless.

The lack of transparency regarding the amenities and the poor dining options for those with dietary restrictions have significantly detracted from our experience.

We strongly suggest that the hotel updates its listings to accurately reflect the true costs and availability of their facilities, and to improve their plant-based offerings so future guests aren’t similarly disappointed.",2,2024,08,15
26,This hotel is not for me,"This is not a 5 star hotel 

me and my partner arrived on 26/07/2024 Upon our arrival We were made to pay nearly  400 eruo
Immediately For a mini bar which We did not even want Still waiting for my refund for this
also had strange people Letting themselves into our room whiles me and my  partner wer in  bed

The Lift MelFunctioned several times
Which was really scary considering how high the lifts went up inside the building

The pool was disgusting Really badly designed and bits of paving slabs Moving under your feet as you are walking over them , not very safe For kids or for elderly people.

Also, the breakfast. The only thing that me and my partner thought was edible. Was the toast as everything else was disgusted?

Also the taxi rank outside the hotle is a con They charged me 35 euros To drop me in my partner 5 kilometres Down the road and when I finally got another taxi back to the hotle  From the town they only charged me 15 euros could not believe this

Baysicley This is a 3star hotel
Most definitely not a 5 star
And we will not be returning",1,2024,07,31
26,Good not great!,"1st things first, don’t be misled by the pool pictures as the nicer ones are of the beach club next door which cost €75 per swim!
The hotel pool is far less appealing, although a good size, it is crowded, hastily and poorly constructed with cheap pool furniture which sits on the mud surrounding the pool.
Other than that the rest of the hotel is great, peaceful, fantastic breakfast and staff, nice sized well appointed rooms with great views and not far from the airport or downtown.
The nearest Metro station is only a 7 or 8 minute walk away with a 15 minute ride to the airport or to downtown.
Enjoy your stay!",4,2024,07,27
26,Pool Photos Were a Bait and Switch (photos have since been changed),"They recently changed their photos and removed the beachclub so i will give them 3 stars instead of two.

I booked my stay based on photos they advertised of a beautiful pool which turned out to be the beach club next door. You have to pay 75€/ person/ day. It is NOT INCLUDED even with a red level suite. The hotel was fully aware they were misleading people and continued to showcase the beachclub as the main photo on all their listings and ads despite many complaints..

The second 'free' pool - which you see in the photos now - is much less appealing. It appears to be a hastily built above-ground pool with some kind of steel platform surrounding it and lounge chairs in the dirt around the edges. Very strange setup. And there are horseflys that bite... We went to the pool once during the 4 night stay.

After several discussions with hotel management they refused to offer a refund for the misleading photos. They even tried to deny using photos of the beach club at first. Very shady..

One night the hotel hosted a corporate event which had very loud music right outside the hotel windows until midnight. They gave us a 50% refund for this night, but nothing for the misleading pool photos.

The staff was lovely, the food was great, the hotel itself is very nice, but overall this was a very disappointing trip. We feel a bit scammed. For $500/ night I expect more.",3,2024,07,23
26,Torre Melina,"The Torre Melina is a new hotel in Barcelona. It was formerly the Fairmont but it was undergoing a full refurbishment when we stayed in April.

It meant some parts of the hotel were not operational such as the swimming pool, spa and the gym. There was a temporary gym.

As we booked a Red Level room we had lounge access and we checked in at the lounge.

Our room had a mountain view. The room was new. It was well sized with amenities ranging from television, kettle for tea and coffee, Krups coffee maker, safe, refrigerator.

The bathroom had a shower, sink, plenty of bathroom toiletries that were Carner branded such as shampoo to perfume. Other items ranged toothpaste to razor.

There was a separate toilet with a jet spray instead of a bidet.

I found the bed large and comfortable. USB sockets to charge the phone, even a UK style 3 pin socket as well as the continental 2 pin ones.

Lounge access was worth it. We spent a lot of time in the lounge with tea/coffee as well as soft drinks. There was also light food and cakes/desserts available.

I did think the food could be better labelled. I was never sure what it was, whether it was suitable for vegetarians or other dietary requirements.

The breakfast was nice but again I felt it could be a better experience. As Red Level members we are told we get a better breakfast served in a separate area. It was the same as the rest of the guests.

We could order omelettes if we asked the serving staff. Generally there was a good range. Croissants, breads, cereals, cakes. I just expected a little bit more.

The hotel itself is rather grand. There was work going on while we were there and I expect it to be impressive once it is all completed.

The location is away from the centre. We got here easily from the airport. There is a Metro line that stops directly from the airport to a stop that is less than 10 minutes walk to the hotel.

Being near a Metro stop meant we could easily navigate Barcelona such as the Ramblas. We could walk from the hotel to the Nou Camp which is the nearest stop for the HOHO buses.",4,2024,06,23
26,Great view of the city and lovely staff,"A very nice hotel. It is quite a way from the city centre, but an easy Metro ride and the hotel has a shuttle one way (although I did not use it). It also has two restaurants on site and if you are happy to walk 20 mins or so there are plenty of restaurants and shops near by.  Its a huge hotel and very grand, definitely a good fit for any business conference but has a pool and lovely gardens, so still worth it for tourists, but I suspect not cheap. The staff is what makes this place, everyone greets you with a smile, especially David the breakfast guy. Also concierge (Andres and team) were beyond helpful and went above and beyond to help me with the chaos left to me by my airline, when they lost my luggage. I was very upset and without his help would not have got very far in my enquires, he helpfully called in Spanish, and recalled and assisted with my troubles. I ate here, the pool area was nice and the conference food was amazing - thank you and I hope I get to stay again in the future.",5,2024,06,16
26,Worst manager,"The breakfast manager Jose Maria someone should tell him that he should be polite not to customers but to people generally and when it comes to small kids 5 minutes being late is not so important 
If it wasn’t for a girl named Tupee, at the service , with her smile she made our day here better . Thank u Tupee!",3,2024,05,11
26,Nice property but needs improvements,"Stayed for 4 nights during a business trip.

Property itself is nice and everything looks recently renovated. Room was spacious, WiFi worked well and breakfast was also good. 

There is construction going on during business hours, so if you have to work or rest during the day, it is very tough because of the noise. Gym is unacceptable for this type of property, only a few treadmills and very light weights. 

Service is subpar for the price, I was staying with a large group and they all complained about it. Contacting reception or room service is almost impossible, check-in/out always takes a long time, I asked for an iron for my room and they never brought it. Also the toiletries in my shower were never refueled during my stay.

Overall, this property has potential but it is way too expensive for the type of service they offer.",3,2024,05,10
26,Lovely Stay!,"We had booked the Torre Melina Gran Melia for our anniversary and my birthday, and we enjoyed our stay.  Christian at the red lounge front desk was an absolute joy , attending to our needs with genuine attention and care, along with a lovely smile!

All of the staff were attentive, in particular Mikela and Tutee, such beautiful waitresses with gorgeous smiles and genuine care for our needs, thank you both so much.

The suite was meticulously clean and a lovely touch to leave a cake for our anniversary and birthday was really appreciated, along with a beautiful note too.

All food was absolutely delicious , breakfast was beautiful too and we thought that the afternoon tea set up was perfect for a quick 'pick me up' before dinner!

The only thing we would suggest is notifying guests maybe during the booking process that the hotel is still incomplete and onsite work is still taking place.  Although our room was stunning, the view of the building materials etc down below did slightly take the edge off the experience.  We were informed that work would be complete during the summer months.

Thank you all for a lovely stay!",4,2024,05,06
26,DO NOT BOOK HERE,"DO NOT BOOK HERE!! TERRIBLE STAFF!!
Front desk staff is incompetent. I had two reservations and they messed up both. The first one (after a long flight) they messed up by giving me one room instead of two connecting rooms that I booked then spent an hour trying to find me the correct room. I received no apology for this. For the second reservation, which I checked in 3 hours after check in time, they sent me to a room that was being cleaned and it took them an hour to find me another room and then my luggage took an hour to get up to the right room. I had to go down twice and wait for another hour to fix this. I wasted so much time and energy trying to get this staff to fix their mistakes. To make matters worse the manager told me I should cancel reservation if I’m not happy with their offer of a minimal voucher at 9:30pm at night by knocking on my door as I was sleeping. Where am I supposed to go? Truly unprofessional behavior. Absolutely despicable how they treat their customers. Instead of being apologetic they have been so incredibly rude in how they are handling this. I have never experienced this type of disrespect from hotel staff in all my time traveling. Don’t waste your time, energy or  your money here. 

Also this hotel is so far from city center and has no restaurants around it, they hardly answer the phone when you call the reception or room service numbers, and they give you water bottles with dust all over them.",1,2024,05,02
26,Worth the stay just outside city centre to relax,"Very impressive pull up lobby area and friendly checkin. Impressed with info on car lease and shuttle services and directions to the city. Lots of restaurant options and the breakfast choices were amazing and high quality. Nice to have the outside area option too. Some renovations happening around the pool/gardens and rooftop but will be well worth the wait. Rooms all remodelled and very high standards and extra touches - I couldn’t find fault anywhere, especially after having an amazing power shower and fantastic sleep… awesome hotel.
Free shuttle to city centre and a 7min walk to University metro station. A nice walk to a shopping mall or park area",5,2024,04,27
26,A grand waste of money...,"This hotel was recently renovated and should not have re-opened.   The room rate was 650 Euros.  The television and phone did not work, shower water temperature cycled between hot and cold and the electricity in my room went out at 11 PM.  After saying it was repaired, they finally relocated me to another room after midnight.  The next morning, the manager told me that they had done everything right, offered me coffee and asked me to book another stay to give them another chance!",1,2024,02,28
26,The oasis within Barcelona.,"It is an oasis within Barcelona, with very friendly staff and an extraordinary Erre restaurant. The hotel has been completely renovated. Era el Juan Carlos I. The views of Barcelona are still unbeatable, but everything else is new.",5,2024,10,08
26,Melia but no BIG Melia.,"We have spent three nights in this hotel and as a client of the Melia chain and knowing all the hotels of the chain in Barcelona we wanted to try what is GRAND Melia and after the stay Gran Melia stays in just one Melia period.

Our stay was in a Red Level with mountain views, 12th floor with views as indicated and diagonal and tennis courts nothing attractive but it is what I had booked, but when doing the online Chek-in they offer me the room seen to the city an upgrade for being a member of the program of Melia, but upon arrival Miss told us that she had a better option a super upgrade but that it was seen mountain but the room was better than the hired, we go a Chinese story that gave us the same we had hired that we want to turn around to get to point 0. 

The room all the details of a 5 star hotel now the bathrobes are from a Chinese spa use and throw nothing to do with the bathrobes as a Melia as a hotel of that category put those bathrobes high quality and everything remaining to a room of a 5 star hotel, we also put in reviews of not having connecting rooms were so friendly that our room communicated with two rooms that cool the super upgrade room 1219.

The Red Level Lounge the attention of 10 all its staff, the quality of food and drinks of 10 here if the Rating is high, now the situation of the Lounge is like being in an airport people enter and leave the Lounge without being a Red Level customer and no one asks for identification and being so exposed you do not notice the privacy and exclusivity that Red Level Lounges usually offer.

Breakfast here if we go very bad and simple things and that this Hotel overlooks it, if you think to go to breakfast and you like the pastries this is not your hotel the selection of pastries is limited to 4 kinds of buns and to top it off I have never seen a Buffet in a Melia that the pastries are limited and on top of very bad quality hard the small croissants and everything else and that in the Red Level but I went one day to see the Buffet of the hotel and they had the same but with doughnut nothing else.

The Red Level breakfast gives you a menu with dishes and everything is quality like fruits, cold meats, everything is excellent and the service the same but there are hotels of that category that their breakfasts are 10 here with a 7 are fair.

The gardens and condition of the hotel is impeccable worthy of a GREAT as the Beso Beach.

Conclusion breakfasts can improve a bakery worthy of Melia, more privacy and exclusivity to the Red Level, put bathrobes of the quality of the hotel if they want to be a Gran Melia because the Grand Hyatt Barcelona beats you to just two blocks.

I stay with the Melia Sarria Barcelona their breakfasts are excellent, Inside Airport their bathrobes are quality and reopen a Gran Melia and fail in these details when there is a team of managers and directors and that have those failures there is nowhere to take it.

To pay those prices there are other options in Barcelona.",4,2024,10,07
26,Magnificent renovation.,"He knew the hotel when it was the Hotel Juan Carlos I and then Fairmont.   I slept one night and the room on the 10th floor was magnificent, with stunning views of Barcelona.  I want to highlight especially the attention and treatment of all hotel staff. I had the opportunity to meet Ivan, hotel director, and his willingness for any need was absolute.  Carolina showed us the rooftop for special occasions and it is really awesome.
We ate at the hotel pool kiss restaurant.  Very nice and magnificent decoration, atmosphere and service.   Perhaps the food has not met the expectations we had, because the menu we found very good .. . the Red level of the hotel is very quiet and with great spaciousness and attention. 
To finish, we forgot some jewelry in the room safe, and before we knew it we were warned from the hotel.
Definitely my favorite hotel in Barcelona.",5,2024,09,28
26,Luxury!,"Beautiful and impeccable facilities. A la carte dinner was luxurious, with varied dishes and a very welcoming atmosphere, Robert and Mihai always friendly and attentive, thanks to their attentions to my father. The expectacular rooms, we got the rest we deserved. Thanks to reception for your welcome, Irene very attentive and Pro! Joan the button, with her kindness and disposition, accompanied us on the way out with an umbrella all the time as it rained. We'll repeat!",5,2024,09,04
26,Hotel in Barcelona,"There are no words to describe this super hotel.! Located in the upper part of Barcelona, with easy access from the Ronda de Dalt, it has all kinds of services and details that make your stay a real dream. Everything in Torre Melina is impressive, the hall, the gardens, its gastronomic offer, the rooms, everything is designed to make you feel in a real paradise. Thank the entire hotel team for their treatment, and especially the Red Level team (Gex, Reception, F&B) and especially Ivan (General Manager) and Airam (F&B Director). Definitely a place to go back to.",5,2024,08,24
26,We expected much more,"We expected much more from this hotel. We chose this hotel to spend our anniversary. When I made the Reservation on Melia's website, I said we were celebrating an anniversary. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel had no details for our anniversary. Other times in hotels in this category have put in the room some details such as chocolates, cava, fruit or flowers. 
Another thing that has disappointed us a lot has been the pool. On the hotel website you can see photos of 2 swimming pools one of them is spectacular and the other also beautiful but simpler. The hotel if it has 2 pools but in order to access the pool that we liked it turns out that you have to make a minimum of 75€ per person in the bar of this pool, so in the room price is only included access to one of the pools. The condition of this pool is unfortunate, grass burned and without any maintenance, old and dirty hammocks, the floors of the pool area very dirty... I honestly didn't really want to be in the pool. I do not believe that these facilities correspond to a hotel of this category and such high prices.",3,2024,08,20
26,"Great hotel with things to improve, but you understand...","The first thing to do, is to thank Meliá for the effort to reopen this iconic hotel after 4 years closed, the investment will have been strong.Being my wife Meliá platinum rewards always treat us great.The hotel in general is very good, all the gleaming common areas and the new room, very complete bathroom and bed of 10.But for our opinion, it lacks shooting and does not comply yet to be a Grand Meliá, great style Meliá sea or palace of Isora.Yesterday through the room The Level walked people without shirt, barefoot, fresh out of the pool... and no one caught their attention!!!
The pool area totally detracts, areas with scorched lawns, others of 
Land ....looks like the pool of a neighborhood ....not at all the pool of a Great Meliá....should be the investment this winter, totally change that area.
Good breakfast at The Level with a volunteer staff and not arriving at the moment...
They park your car if you want in the outdoor or indoor parking.
That said, it has much to improve, but it must be understood that it is the first summer after reopening, we will return!!",4,2024,08,12
26,Very good,"Hotel gran Meliá torre melina, a very good hotel, no shortage of details, amazing staff, always very attentive, one of Top-rated hotels you can find in Barcelona, amazing red level service, as always the Meliá chain does not fail. Greetings to the whole team.",5,2024,08,11
26,"The luxury reference hotel in Barcelona. As a Platinum client, and having stayed at the rest of melias, the best","The hotel is great. Sublime staff, excellent rooms and one of the Top-rated services the Level currently has the Meliá chain.
We enjoyed breakfast so much, Johanna is wonderful and her brunette companion too. I must also say that Marta, who is at the entrance to the Level breakfast, should treat other employees better. I know you have experience and you want to control everything, but you imputed a mistake to a worker when she had been mine over breakfast... sometimes human quality must be palpable...
The rest of the workers and receptionists at Level are incredibly attentive and helpful. I wouldn't change any of them. Now, I must mention Antonio Maiz, his attention has been sublime during a payment error and he has patiently managed to solve it. Believe me, these types of workers are not found in virtually any other luxury hotel (not even in a Four Seasons), with that, I say it all.
As a deficit, and simply in order to improve, the pool area does not have sufficient hammocks. The facilities are dated and the garden area quite neglected. I’m sure they’ll gradually make it better.
In any case, the latter does not in any way tarnish the quality of the Hotel, which is simply sublime",5,2024,08,05
26,Amazing hotel,"We loved this hotel, the whole experience from the time you enter until you leave is 10. A luxurious room, restaurant food, workers' attentions. We rested great, enjoyed the pool and also its gardens.",5,2024,07,21
26,More appearances than his ...,"Unfortunately, things are being faked here that do not correspond to reality. 

The beautiful pool, which is also shown here at TA first, was the reason for me to book this hotel. This great poll is also available, but it is part of a separate club. Cost of use with couch €100/person/day. I find this very borderline .... so not the costs of the club but that there is advertising with things that are not part of the normal hotel operation. Here it is imperative to point out, then you can decide beforehand.

If you book a normal room for “only” ~€300/night, you will be whisked off to a windowless, dark dining room without natural light for breakfast in the morning. Most canteens have more atmosphere today. As a Red Level guest, on the other hand, you can have breakfast across the street in the beautiful, bright room including beautiful terrace. It’s not about more service for status guests, that’s OK, normal guests who still pay decent money just can’t be treated like that.

The room itself was very nice ...",2,2024,06,25

Excellent restaurants and pool service with very kind staff, even at reception.",5,2024,06,12
26,Magnificent hotel for urban tourism,"We were at GM Torre Melina for a weekend and we loved it! The staff is very friendly, attentive and very efficient. It's the best thing about the hotel, of course. But we also liked the facilities, for example, the restaurant where they offer breakfast, full of light, with clear views. The hotel garden is truly wonderful. And the room with the very well-designed bathroom is one of the best we have seen lately in this type of hotel. 
The hotel is not in the center, but in a luxurious area of Barcelona. Via Diagonal Avenue you can walk to Av in 20 minutes. Sarria and 5-10 minutes by taxi you are in the center. It is perfect for a romantic weekend and also ideal for a business trip.",5,2024,05,27

26,Finally a great Meliá in Barcelona!!!,"A haven of light and peace with all the comforts, ideal for disconnecting in a city like Barcelona. This new hotel is a surprise that recalls the grandeur of the old and emblematic Juan Carlos hotel with the exquisite treatment of the hotel staff. The rooms are so good decorated. The bed is the most comfortable we have enjoyed in a hotel. The breakfast buffet is a spectacle. We are looking forward to returning in the summer when their pools are open. The feeling of peace and luminosity that the hotel and the rooms have is appreciated. Impressive garden with an old building, the lobby is a light show after dark. Looking forward to returning.",5,2024,04,08

26,The Best experience ever!,"We reserved two rooms for a special occasion. This spectacular hotel is undoubtedly a great luxury. At check-in we were assisted at the Red level reception (fully recommended) by Patricia and Alejandro, with a contagious smile, professionalism and closeness, we felt at home. The Red level, the very cozy and calm atmosphere, transmits peace and great quality of the products they offer. The beautiful rooms were on the 14th floor, decoration, amenities, they take care of every detail during your stay and this makes it stand out and make it unique in this beautiful hotel. We had dinner at the Amaranta Restaurant and everything was super delicious. Very good breakfast. I have to highlight that all the service from the workers is exceptional, it is clear that they like their job and do it from the heart. Upon check out we met Luis and Ana from the GEX team, they treated us with professionalism and delicacy, they invited us to come back and come in the summer to try the pool and spa. Thank you very much to the entire team, we will return, we will recommend 100%.",5,2024,03,04
