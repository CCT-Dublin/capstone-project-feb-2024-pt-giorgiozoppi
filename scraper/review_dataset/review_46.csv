46,"Prepare to wait a long time, and don't bring your pet dog!!!","I went to have a café con leche and sat at one of the four tables that are not even on the property, but rather are below it, overlooking the sea. My two little dogs (3kg and 8kg) were with me, on leashes.

One of the wait-staff saw me almost immediately, but when neither he nor any of his colleagues came to the table, after twenty minutes, I waved to get his attention. A few moments later, a waiter approached. I said ""Buenos días"" and he responded that dogs are not allowed. The tables are placed on dirt, and are not on the hotel property.  Absolutely ridiculous and appalling.

I have just read other reviews prior to writing this one, and see that there are many complaints about the service and attitude at this hotel.  I strongly encourage you to go anywhere else.",1,2024,10,09
46,Much better than anticipated!,"I was really worried about staying here after reading the reviews! I needn't have worried as they do not in any way reflect was we came across when we stayed. The hotel is modern, clean and on the hill so the views of Barcelona are phenomenal. The staff were friendly, accommodating and couldn't do enough for us. Our room was spacious, clean and every day when we came back there were complimentary chocolates waiting for us! The swimming pool area was clean too. Please don't worry about staying here as you will have a lovely time!",5,2024,10,01
46,"Very nice hotel, please update the hot water system","Really nice hotel in a great location a very short taxi ride from the centre of Barcelona but high on the hill so as to give not just great views but some real peace and quiet after enjoying the hustle and bustle of Barcelona.

Having read some negative reviews about the hotel was a little concerned but shouldn't have been, was completely reassured from the moment we walked in.  The hotel is well maintained and quite stylish.   The hot water I see referred too many times is a slight issue, it took forever to come through so maybe people weren't patient enough and this does need to be rectified as it did take several minutes to get hot but beyond that slight delay we enjoyed a wonderful long weekend at the hotel.   Breakfast was great and so was the outdoor terrace.  Beyond breakfast we didn't eat at the hotel for no other reason than we wanted to enjoy the best Barcelona had to offer.

When we come back to Barcelona, we will be staying here again.",4,2024,09,25
46,"Please avoid, for your sanity, your security and your wallet!","Here’s the deal, I have a room which is a bit shabby in a hotel that could do with a refurb, the door is broken and the room can be accessed by anyone as you don’t need a key, it has a bath and a shower but no hot water and when you wake up in the morning you find a homeless person has slept on your balcony all night, how much are you going to pay to stay in this bargain room? If you said €425 per night sounds like great value, I highly recommend the Miramar Barcelona! If you don’t think you fancy sharing a cold shower with Barcelona’s  homeless I’d suggest you steer well clear of this hotel. If you do ignore this advice you can expect an argument on check out and no response from the hotel despite trying to resolve this before departure and requesting a call from the manager 5 days ago. Unlike everything else in the hotel however, they do provide that service for free",1,2024,09,02
46,Great Location. Poor Service.,"Sadly, like many other reviews, the service from the staff (apart from one hardworking, male luggage attendant & one female member of desk staff) was non-existent. Other front desk attendants either ignored you, as if you were invisible, even when standing directly in front of them, or were clueless when asked questions about bus routes etc. 
Housekeeping services were also very poor. We had to constantly ask for top up toiletry products and replacement coffee and milk and whilst you might get a bottle of complimentary water on day one, we didn’t one our second night, despite still paying the same room rate. 
This said, the rooms are spacious, if in need of touching up decor wise here and there & the shared areas are calm and well presented. 
The pool area is also a bonus. A lovely place to relax. However, the music that booms loudly from the bar speakers all day by disinterested bar staff, is not at all enjoyable. Let guests just enjoy the peace! 
The most enjoyable feature of the hotel is the setting and the location. Great views, lovely grounds and a lovely escape from the bustle and noise of the city.",3,2024,08,28
46,Hotel need overhaul and a NEW STAFF especially the front desk individuals.,"Worst hotel staff, front desk horrible.  Hotel overbooked and understaffed, HOT, no a/c.  Room had lots of issues, bathtub with valve. One one-man elevator.   No regard for guest(s).  Do not recommend.  Overpriced, unclean, unhelpful, on and on.   Beware!",1,2024,08,15
46,Not a 5 star hotel!,"We had the worst experience at Hotel Miramar Barcelona. We visited this hotel 5 years ago, and had a great experience, but the quality and service have disappeared since then.. This time we were there for 3 days and it was a horrible service, which started with a very poorly check-in where they forgot about people, and service in terms of giving people a room, but making people line up like in a supermarket. We received our room where the AC didn't work, the water wasn't running in the shower and the door to the terras couldn't lock. We changed our room, and experienced how they changed our lock, out of the blue, put an extra bed in our room, without us asking and moving all our belongings around, when going to the reception they were extremely rude to me. Breakfast not a 5 star hotel worthy, but here the service at least was good, and they tried. Overall this hotel is not worth of the 5 stars, the service is poor, and the hotel is worn out and appears old and not updated. The amount of mistakes was unbelievable, and almost a joke.  We will never return.",1,2024,08,15
46,Shockingly incompetent,"Other reviews have mentioned a change of ownership. This doesn't excuse a disastrous performance by the management during our visit for a family wedding. The wedding day itself went like a dream, but we understand that this was run by an outside company. Everything else was dogged by an incompetent front desk. Check-in took literally hours. They couldn't seem to understand that some of a large family might have the same name, even though we'd booked separately. In our case our room was firstly given to my brother (because they had only allocated one of the two rooms he'd ordered), then taken back. As I waited for the room cards which I could see plainly on the desk, I was told that my brother had the cards! We were then asked for passports, which they'd already copied and the copies  were also clearly on the desk, next to our room cards. Next we were directed to the wrong lift by the desk clerk. Fortunately one of the house staff noticed and put us right. The desk didn't know how much to charge us although we provided the booking reference. They said they would check and contact us in our room. Later the desk clerk went into the bar and summoned my wife to the front desk to arrange payment. Is this five-star service?

The bride-to-be cried each of the first two days at the sheer incompetence. When people got annoyed at this the response was to say we were too aggressive. In fact we showed great patience, as the only female member of reception staff made clear.

My niece asked for a baby cot and was told that one would arrive. It didn't, despite repeated reminders. Incredibly, the second night she again reminded several times and was assured by the front desk that housekeeping would arrange the cot. It didn't arrive.

Next day our room cards failed to work. We went down to the front desk, where the manager disappeared with them into a back office. When he emerged with our cards, he stopped for a conversation with a colleague, leaving us standing waiting a few yards away. Is this customer service?

Many of our family group had similar mind-boggling experiences. This was the most incompetent front desk I've ever come across. They left us a bottle of cava, which we didn't drink, as an apology, but this came from the female member of staff. I got the impression that the male desk staff just saw us as an annoyance. The hotel itself is nice but not five star. Also our Premium Room shower didn't work properly (we didn't waste time reporting it, obviously).",1,2024,08,13
46,Don't stay there at the moment as nothing is working or being maintained,"WARNING _ DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL AT THE MOMENT!
We have just returned from a three day stay and were shocked to read that our experience matched the earlier reviews from July this year  as STILL nothing is working or has been fixed! All of the staff are new and say that the hotel has been sold to new owners (Hyatt group) and admitted to us that the management is reluctant to conduct any maintenance at the moment, as they are looking to completely renovate the hotel in the future. As such, many, many guests were complaining that there was no hot water or air con in their rooms, the spa facilities (steam room, jacuzzi, sauna) were not working at all, the telephone system to complain to reception also didn't work, the room terraces were really dirty, chairs were dilapidated with cigarette burn holes and bird droppings on them and some people were even finding cockroaches on the top floor suites, there was also constant drilling all day to works on the roof that could be heard from the poolside, so it was not relaxing at all. (Personally, the most important maintenance should have been to address the missing tiles at the far end of the swimming pool and the mineral salts seeping through the ceiling of the spa corridor). These low standards are unfair to guests and consequently, hotel websites are completely misrepresenting the quality of this hotel. I would say that they should close until further notice, as this isn't even 1 star at the moment.",1,2024,08,06
46,Top class hotel but on a high mount.,"This is a great, high-quality hotel. The rooms are a decent size and well appointed. The air cond isn’t great but it wasn’t that hot (only 27 degrees) when we were there so not a big deal. The layout of the hotel is nice and the outdoor pool area is lovely. A great pool with a lane for swimming not just floating. Pool food and drinks were both excellent. 

Be aware that this hotel is slightly to the edge of town overlooking the port from a high mount. This means you will need to either walk down into the town (Las Ramblas is about 15 minutes away) or get a cab. Walking down is quite pleasant, walking back up is slightly tougher!",5,2024,07,06
46,5 Star Hotel? 1 Star Service,"It’s pretty I will give it that but that’s about all. The hotel has new owners and a myriad of problems. It started when we opened the door to our room and it was 26.5 degrees Celsius (very hot) inside. The front desk person made a point to telling us how they check each room before guests are put in rooms..The A/C was broken but apparently nobody knew. When I called both the front desk and the operator I got a recorded message that said everyone was busy and to call back later. They weren’t  busy. It is a problem with the in house phone system.

I went to the front desk. The front desk person said it was a housekeeping problem and he would let them know. Left to his own devices, we would have sweltered all night. I asked him to send a maintenance person. He did and confirmed the A/C was broken. The attitude of all the employees seemed to be they don’t care. So we changed rooms to much smaller room.. The hotel graciously said they would not charge us the differential rate between our old room and our new smaller room. They expressed this as a concession…

If you like to charge your electronics while you sleep, this is not the place for you. In our room, you turn off a main switch to turn off all the lights. When you do that, the electrical outlets turn off. It took us awhile to find two outlets that didn’t turn off when the lights went out..

There also little things. There is an electric outlet only on one side of the bed. Something I am not used to. Given the prior problem, it doesn’t matter. I needed a new key while my partner was out. I asked if they could do that without disabling my partner’s key and the front desk said yes. Of course, that didn’t work and my partner returned while I was in the shower.

My partner wanted to use a treadmill in the fitness center and found out there was only one available because the other was broken and not repaired.. 

When I wanted to talk to the manager, the front desk people refused to call her and I had to sit at the front desk until she arrived..

I should note that my trouble is getting me free breakfast..

If you come for the view, great. If you are expecting five star treatment you are likely to be disappointed..What is particularly galling is an attitude that isn’t helpful. You don’t expect that from fine hotels…",2,2024,07,01
46,Poor hotel with maximum 3 stars,"Hotel Miramar is old and need restoration in many things. Service is ugly - we asked to make the beds outside near swimming pool and nobody cared, the same with ventilation inside gym and pool which is inside building (they just dont work or there is no ventilation). This is hotel maximum 3 stars and only because of view on the port and the sea. Condition of the walls and furniture are also maximum for 3 stars. The breakfast is with poor choice, coffee is also disgusting. And all that is for 500€/night (totally paid 3500€ even for this price u will must pay for parking extra). Ah yeah, I ordered boquet of flowers to the hotel and asked delivery company to say that they bring the flowers to the room, but nobody brought it - they just stayed on the reception for 2 hours before I came to take it by myself.",1,2024,06,18
46,"Great room, but not a 5 star customer experience.","Stayed in Miramar for an on-site event for 2 nights. I was given a great room at the corner of the property with spectacular views and a big terrace. The room itself was also spotless. It was of a huge size with all the 5-star attributes. They even had a separate en-suite room for wardrobe, minibar and ironing. The bed was also very comfy. It was an absolute gem, but it must be expensive for regular stays. What I found not up to standards was customer service. Very hectic front desk and slightly arrogant in treatment. They told me that they would bring my luggage up, and it took an hour and a reminder phone call to get this moving. For this level of hotel, this is absolutely unacceptable, so knocking a couple of stars off for that.",3,2024,06,01
46,Stay away from this hotel!  The pool is full of mold and you can not use it and there is bird crap everywhere,"Stay away from this hotel!!  We just arrived and booked this hotel as we wanted a nice pool to relax around after our cruise. The pool is closed and they didn’t tell us and would not give us a refund to book at another hotel or any type of refund for their lack of service. The hotel stinks of mold. There is a constant noise of what sounds like fireworks or a gun being shot every 5 minutes.  The front desk is of no help and they don’t care. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.  We paid $2,600 for 4 nights and they did nothing for us!!!",1,2024,05,26
46,Unfortunate,"We stayed at Miramar for a couple nights prior to boarding a cruise. The views and grounds are beautiful. Rooms are nice, pillows could be nicer. The staff is very nice. 

We were disappointed that the outdoor pool was closed for “maintenance” it appeared it was more because of a wedding held near it. The same wedding that was right by our room and played loud music and crowds running the hallway loudly until 3 am. If planned better it could have been simple to put the wedding group in rooms on one side near the wedding and other guests away from it. 

For the high price, a good nights sleep and use of the facilities was expected and would have been appreciated. We will likely stay elsewhere next time.",2,2024,05,11
46,Great for pre cruise accommodation,"Visited hotel Miramar in June 23 as a pre cruise two night stay. The hilltop hotel has fantastic views over the Mediterranean and city. 
The hotel is of an high standard and the room we were allocated was large with a luxurious bathroom and a impressively spacious balcony.
The restaurant, a little costly, seemed popular with guests and Barcelonians alike and recommend you reserve your table early.
The hotel has lush gardens and the cruise ships can be seen from the restaurant terrace.
Bus stop yards away to allow easy hop on hop off city tour access.",5,2024,04,06
46,Will NOT return ,"this hotel has been used heavily used over the years and I believe insufficient attention to needed capital improvements.. ex . scratches on old furniture. closet doors not closing.. torn deck dividers, etc .. Toiletires that did not work (bottles so small they would not pour) , TV did not work, etc .     HOWEVER, VERY friendly front desk and restaurant servers and bar staff. .. except that front desk neglected and then denied, that when they called us a taxi it was automatically 7 E more  (x2)..seems like all customer facing employees were well trained.. just maintance lacking .. I would expect this level at a 2 star hotel. ",2,2024,01,06
46,CHARMING – RECOMMENDED,"We stayed here for 1 night for its convenient location near the cruise ship terminal (we were joining a cruise the next day). We had a lovely, very big, well appointed room with a view of the sea. We ate dinner there. The restaurant is a bit like a banqueting suite/wedding reception venue and the furniture has seen better days, but the food was good – though the sizeable set menu was almost too much for us to handle. But the general atmosphere is nice and the location with a beautiful park in front of the hotel is lovely. It feels a long way from the city sights, but actually it isn't. Actually itt would probably make a tranquil haven at the end of a busy day of tourism in Barcelona.",4,2023,12,05
46,No where near 5 stars! ,"Lets start with the positives:
Big and spacious room with lovely views, comfortable beds and nice bathrooms
Very friendly staff - they are definitely the highlight!

And that's where the good stops.
When you enter, you are hit with the most horrible and sickening smell. It's suffocating! And it's throughout the hotel, corridors, rooms, etc! 
It took 3 days to fix heating and even then the temperature was around 24 degrees c after being fixed. Once it was fixed, the heating system sounded like an old broken engine rattling throughout the night. 
The furniture is dirty with stains, the side tables and desk were old and chipped amd didn't match the room. The carpets were toen, the wall papers had stains or were torn,  the marble on the outside pillars were broken.....the list is endless!
Breakfast was also really poor....for a 5 star Hotel, it was terrible! 

I cannot stress or get over them smell! ",1,2023,12,02
46,If you want your items to feel safe do Not stay here,"Nothing 5* about this hotel. The photos are very deceiving and the service is appalling. 

When I stayed here with my boyfriend we left our room closed in the morning and when we came back at 10pm we were greeted with a widely open room door.  When we approached staff about this security breach they all smiled it off and one male member of staff even accused us of leaving the door open ourselves. They offered no solution and actually seemed offended we were angry and worried for our items. What a joke of a hotel. 
Honestly do not stay here.

 Nothing is clean about the hotel the rooms are dirty so is the outdoor pool and the spa. I’m surprised l’Occitane would want to be associated with such a dull, dusty and tired spa. 

The Maid service is pointless. When we arrived on the first day there was a dead moth on the floor in our bathroom that had been killed and it remained there the whole stay. The room was always dusty. 

",1,2023,11,17
46,Really dirty and terrible service,"This place could not possibly be classed as a five star (or even four star if I’m honest) and I can only believe the positive reviews are paid for. The rooms and areas away from the main lobby and bars are dirty, old and often broken. 

The location although it does have a good view is so far away from Barcelona you have to take a taxi everywhere. 

I saw a seagull ripping a fish apart in the pool and all the stuff just walked by and didn’t seem to care at all. 

The service in the hotel is a joke. No one answers the phone, there was no receptionist at the spa every single time I went past.

 I also got locked on the roof and staff just looked and didn’t help. The breakfast (which had been described as great in other “reviews”) had stale croissants, some tough yet and some scrambled egg, undercooked sausage and mushrooms and broccoli as the only hot options. 

Please don’t stay here, there is nothing going for it at all and there are literally thousands of better options.",1,2023,11,09
46,Relaxing stay,From the moment we arrived and given complimentary drinks we knew we were in for a treat. The room was enormous and the bathroom and walk in shower was amazing. Breakfast was delicious and so many choices. Easy to walk into the centre and loved the views from the hotel.,5,2023,11,04
46,Outstanding hotel in Barcelona ,"What an absolutely amazing hotel. The staff are friendly, helpful and professional. They respond respectfully to your privacy but provide a wealth of information about the tourist attractions in the area. The pool, gym and spa areas are immaculate and a welcome break after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel has a wonderful view of the whole of Barcelona with stunning sunsets. The staff are always friendly and work tirelessly to keep the hotel clean . I was given an amazing surprise of cake and a bottle of Cava for my Birthday. We came back to find this lovely surprise in our room. This extra touch made my stay in Barcelona in the Miramar one to remember. Keep doing what you are doing it makes you a very special hotel - with a dedicated staff team who are always smiling. Thank you. ",5,2023,10,23
46,Views fit for a queen.,"We spent 4 nights in this elegant hotel.  Although the room was dated ( circa 2000 modern), the view from our large balcony was spectacular.  The staff was immensely accommodating and  pleasant.  We had dinner out in the terrace one evening and the food was prepared with care and skill as was the service.  One of the best meals I have had out of our 3 weeks in Spain. 
Our room was super clean as was the gym and the pool. 
We would walk to town each day, down the winding path.  Walking back up the hill, allowed me to eat another croissant without the guilt.  
I would strongly recommend a room facing the harbor/med.  the rooms on the backside are just for sleeping I imagine.",5,2023,09,27
46,Fabulous City ,"This is a lovely hotel, situated overlooking the City and a quiet getaway from the hustle and bustle with a lovely garden and pool - a 10 euro taxi ride into the centre.   Unfortunately for us, our stay involved no hot water in our room for the duration of the 4 day stay.  The front desk staff were lovely and tried their best to rectify the plumbing issues.  I do however, feel we were overlooked until we made a fuss which is a shame.  Management should have been a little more proactive with their customer service. 

   ",3,2023,09,20
46,Excellent Views,"We had a short break to Barcelona this time so only stayed here for 3 nights. We loved this hotel. It is a bit of a steep walk down and back if you are up for it. It has a lovely far eastern influence and atmosphere. We only had breakfast at the hotel which was very good as we ate out in the city. Luxurious, clean rooms with amazing views of the sea. The staff are quiet and discrete and the place has a sense of calmness. I want to return already.",5,2023,09,05
46,A perfect weekend!,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, loved our stay here. The location is perfect for exploring the city. The room is clean and spacious.. not to mention the views!! Breakfast was lovely and the staff were friendly and helpful. The spa and pool were excellent. Highly recommended. ",5,2023,08,19
46,Highly recommend,Brilliant experience. Breathtaking view. Delicious food. Helpful staff. Clean and modern rooms. Great location. Highly recommend and we will definitely be using this hotel again if we ever go back to Barcelona ,5,2023,07,29
46,Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff,"Rooms are large, baths were luxurious, and grounds beautiful.  However, my favorite thing was the helpfulness and friendliness of all the staff. The only negative is that this hotel is a bit out of the busy city and one day we could not get a taxi to the city.  The trade-off of of this is the great waterviews!   ",4,2023,05,24
46,Great,"Good customer service, quality food love those tea bags too.  Still dreaming of the shrimp roll i had, delicious, so nice. 
Love every part of this hotel, the view is also nice although at the back of the hotel is quite hilly not for those without energy or strength.
Thumbs up",5,2023,05,09
46,Great Impression,"For full disclosure, we did not stay at the hotel but discovered it while visiting the lovely Gardens adjacent to the hotel.

We did have a late lunch at the hotel and had several interactions with different staff members. Each staff member was pleasant and helpful and lunch was quite delicious.

The ambiance for lunch was quiet and peaceful and a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of downtown Barcelona. 

Because we were so impressed with the hotel and the area and felt we would much prefer the hotel to others we have stayed in downtown, we questioned a couple we met who were actually guests. They spoke highly of the hotel , indicating that they have stayed here several times. 

After lunch and looking around; we asked reception to call us a taxi. They happily obliged, and the cab came promptly. 

In essence, the hotel did all they could to make us feel welcomed and to reinforce our interest in staying there. And we will on our next visit.",5,2023,05,04
46,Stunning views,"Excellent hotel, stunning views, very clean. On arrival you are greeted by a staff member opening the car door, you are directed to check in while they get your luggage, reception is polite and easy. 
We had bed and breakfast and a room with a terrace, can not fault the room, breakfast is amazing, lots of choice, well prepared. 
The only fault which is not the hotels fault was I didn’t realise it’s up on a big hill,  the walk down is lovely, the walk back is challenging which didn’t help my wife with long covid. 
Just be aware before booking if this may cause and issue, having said that if you can sort it then the hotel is worth it!",5,2023,04,25
46,First time visiting this hotel.,"I was super impressed with everything about my stay at Hotel Miramar. From the moment we arrived and a reception staff member met us at the door, helping us in with our cases, to our checking out, we received exemplary service throughout.
The room was large and spacious. Very clean and ample amount of towels. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard.
The breakfast was just superb with staff remembering your order each day and providing gluten free bread for myself and my daughter. The choice available was incredible and tasted amazing. The evening meals were very delicious and service very quick. Also catering for my grandson's dietary requirements. 
The reception staff were amazing and so helpful. They would go above and beyond to check if you needed anything and were very friendly,  acknowledging my family as we returned from our daily activities each day. 
I plan to visit Barcelona again and will not be staying anywhere else but Hotel Miramar. 
This hotel made my holiday very memorable. Thank you to all the staff.
",5,2023,04,17
46,Excellent,"Loved this hotel. Although on business could easily stay here on long weekend. 
We upgraded from room facing the front entrance to fabulous top floor room over looking the bay. Very large terrace. Weather was great for March spent hours on our terrace rather than by the pool. 
Breakfast excellent on balcony of restaurant. At last great toaster. Self serve hot breakfast although eggs etc available to order. Good service. Lovely ambiance. Reception service excellent. 
Biggest plus was upgrading for small extra cost. 
Would stay here again.",5,2023,04,14
46,"The best hotel we have ever stayed in! If visiting Barcelona, won’t be looking elsewhere!","Everything about our stay was absolutely incredible. The facilities were phenomenal and the level of professionalism in every area as well as the attention to detail signifies how great a reputation the hotel continues to have. The staff were incredibly obliging at every step and as a family with a 1 year old it was the perfect city stay that still had plenty of space and safe areas for him to enjoy. A cot was available on request and confirmed via email well ahead of our stay. 
The breakfast was incredible and very reasonably priced for what you were getting. 
Thanks for an incredible stay! 
",5,2023,04,14
46,Fabulous dinner at The Studio,"Had a really lovely meal here at the Studio Restsurant before going to Palau Sant Jordi for show. Salmon tartar & burrata to start, followed by Pork Cheeks and Monkfish with prawns and mussels, then strawberry shortcake and tiramisu for desserts. All washed down with a nice red wine and water. The welcome and service here was great and we saw they do a taster menu for €56 which we would definitely return for, for a special occasion. Highly recommend, especially with the 30% being offered at present through The Fork.",5,2023,01,16
46,Birthday visit with friends and wife,"After an initial mix up with our booking (they had booked us 4 rooms instead of 2) Helena on reception was extremely helpful and sorted out the issue, she also had lots of recommendations of. What to see on our stay,and explained where everywhere was on the map, as well as how to get to places.  The staff overall were friendly and professional, and very helpful. Breakfast was a buffet style with plenty of options to fill you up for a day of sight seeing.

There were a few minor negatives - heated towel rail wasn’t working in our room,the pool indoors was a little chilly, and we were charged for items from the mini bar we hadn’t had on check out (but to be fair when we go,d them that they knocked it off no quibbles

Overall we had a fantastic stay, and would visit again (though we would ask for a sea view room next time)

Thanks to all the staff for making it a great holiday, and especially Helena",4,2022,12,31
46,Could do with a good renovation,"We stayed here for business for a few nights.  The check in process was very slow but painless.  There are two very slow lifts in the hotel and once I got to my room it was very warm..  I set the temperature down to 20 deg and came back a few hours later to a room at 26 degrees and climbing.  I went back down to reception and they sent up a maintenance person who ended up in the roof taking everything apart to fix it but they offered me another room which I accepted.  The new room was really nice, but didn't have a bath, but had a great shower and amazing views of the harbour / ocean.  

The food at the hotel was good (breakfast and dinner) and the free sweets was an added bonus (both to the hotel and the weight).  I suspect this hotel may have been a 5 start hotel many years ago, but it's in a dire need of some maintenance now.  My business partners and I all had to get our access cards re-validated at least 3 times (some of them even more).  

The link between the restaurant and the front desk electronically wasn't working - We were told one thing but the bill said something else so had to check everything.  Barring those few annoying pieces the stay was very pleasant except a little far out from the city or even the nearest subway station.  A good 15 minute walk to get to the closest one.  The cactus garden nearby was a bonus and the walk to the cable car was quite an uphill walk, but very pretty..",3,2022,12,26
46,Service beyond excellence,"Best hotel and best staff ever ! We had some gorgeous views of Barca from our room , the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful . I honestly cannot think of anything negative to say about this property ever only love and more love ! My husband and I promised that if we ever visit Barcelona again we’re heading straight to Miramar thank you so much guys for ensuring we had a lovely stay at your beautiful property ❤️",5,2022,12,22
46,Martin makes this hotel something wonderful!,"Martin took our trip from exciting to amazing!

We stayed at Hotel Miramar for our 25th Anniversary and had booked a nice room, but through a third party. We booked for a king bed, but the third-party company had sent through a booking for 2 singles - no thanks! Not only did Martin make sure we got a king bed, he upgraded our room with a view overlooking the sea and the city. What a lovely treat! The larger room and extra space made us feel comfortable and relaxed, the sights were incredible, and the balcony was a real treat to sit on and enjoy the sunny mornings while having breakfast, watching the ships sail by and the people move about. 

While the hotel itself was not a 5* by Canadian standards (it had some odd quirks, a few things didn't work, and the indoor pool wasn't open which was disappointing as one of the reasons we chose this hotel was for the pool), it was a nice hotel with a comfortable bed, beautiful views, friendly service, and helpful staff. We didn't eat at the onsite restaurant as we wanted the real local food experience, but often saw others there. 

Martin's care and attention during our stay made our time in Barcelona so nice! He was pleasant to chat with, helpful with our many queries, and quick to assist with taxis, restaurant recommendations, sightseeing tips...     

Thank you Martin, for making our 25th Anniversary in Barcelona even more memorable than it would have been!

46,"Was propably a 5 star 3 years ago , not any more","Early November 2022 , 2 night stay, arrived at 11  am (as part of a package) told room would not be available until 3pm . At 3.40 we went to reception yo get our key, was told room not ready due to broken shower, expressed my unhappiness about this. Found another room (after we paid for E100 for an upgrade !  Room very tired looking , big crack in bath, poorly filled step into the shower so door would not close properly  and main bathroom sliding door missing, Most wardrobe doors didn't fit well. Indoor pool dark and dingy and white mastic all around the glass. The location of the hotel is great but the hotel itself is tired and in need of wood and soft furnishings renewal. 4 star at a push .",3,2022,11,07
46,"This is not a 5* hotel, far from it.","We had a 3 night stay in a deluxe room that was meant to be suitable for 3 adults, we arrived very late on the first night and just checked in and went to bed, the main bed was a good size, the extra bed was a kids bed, our son is 6 ft 2 and was about 1.5 foot longer than the bed, we were then told the swimming pool, spa and hamman was all closed (which was one of the reasons we booked the hotel) and also breakfast was not included (we stay in a lot of 5* hotels and I can’t remember the last one that didn’t include breakfast and paying €85 for 3 for that is a joke) the room was very tired and the room only had provisions for 2, I.e 2 towels, 2 waters etc, so clearly not a room for 3. We spoke to someone about this and after really pushing we got offered breakfast and a refund on the upgraded room, however when we went to checkout the lady was saying something different and wouldn’t back down, when then had to come back to the hotel later after a meeting which was totally out of our way just to resolve this with a manager, that’s a manager who just wanted to argue and talk over us, all in all this was a dreadful experience from a 5* hotel, I get better service in budget premier inns in the U.K., this is absolutely not a 5* hotel, the hotel is pretty tired and very tatty outside the front and the outside pool area etc is all very poor, the service level / attitude overall was pretty poor, even when we went to the bar to get our free welcome drink it felt more like an imposition so we didn’t stay for more drinks, We come to Barcelona 2-3 times a year on business and stay in a lot of hotels here and put guests up as well (we had 37 people with us we all put up in another hotel - thankfully ) and this is one we definitely won’t come back to, such a shame and noting like what we were expecting and or the website etc makes you believe. Checked out extremely disappointed.",2,2022,10,20
46,"Great location, not living up to its potential","I visited this hotel in 2019 when it appeared completely refurbished. We always said that we would stay here if we ever returned to Barcelona. I love the location overlooking the city and the pool area is lovely.

Suffice it to say that the past 3 years have not been easy on Hotel Miramar. All the soft furnishings and carpet in the lounge are stained and tired. They are in dire need of new furniture or new coverings at the bare minimum.

The room was in better condition. Furnishings were very clean. I loved the size of our room. There was a complete seating area and the bathroom was huge so it was very comfortable, but again there were areas in need of repair.

The door stopper was missing, so the door handle hit the closets and scraped the wood, the bathroom could use some retiling of caulk and grout to clean it up and paint was peeling in the shower stall.

It would have been nice if there was service at the pool but I don't think they have enough visitors at the pool. Suffice it to say, I was told at check in that I could order at the bar and the drink would be brought to me. Unfortunately, I think they are understaffed. Getting service at the bar took forever. Often I would just leave since it took so long.

Hotel Miramar has a lot potential. I hope they will look into it but I wouldn't be able to recommend it to anyone unless I knew upgrades had been done to the property.

46,Lovely short break,"This hotel was quirky in style, quiet, clean and an enjoyable stay for 3 nights. 
It’s situated at the top of the hill which made it far enough away from the busy centre but close enough for either a taxi ride into the centre or a leisurely stroll. 
Nice helpful staff. 
Rooms were clean and tidy. Loved the bathroom. 
Only down side was being next to the Olympic shooting range and so it was a bit noisy at times. Also we thought the breakfast was very expensive for what you get. It’s a steep walk back up that hill, but we liked that so it didn’t bother us much.",4,2022,09,27
46,Excellent overall experience but some TLC required,"Stayed here for 2 nights in 2 Deluxe rooms with our teenage children. The views over the city are stunning and the rooms are spacious and well-equipped. We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening which was excellent, the manager Fran was very welcoming and helped us select some excellent wines, praise also for Nestor in the bar area. 

The staff really made this place for us but sadly, I feel that the condition of the hotel in parts is letting the staff down. There were many areas which felt in need of a refresh, especially the outdoor and indoor pools - the carpets in the bedrooms were stained and generally this hotel feels outdated and very 'turn of the millenium' when compared to more modern establishments. Hopefully the owners take note and make some improvements as otherwise this is an excellent hotel and somewhere I woud definitely return to.",4,2022,09,18
46,"Lovely property, lovely setting","We were seeing Barcelona via the hop on, hop off bus.  We hopped off here to visit the nearby garden and were in need of a cold beverage.  The Hotel Miramar was nearby and the answer to our prayers.  The lounge area was beautiful and comfortable.  We enjoyed our cold beverages.  Wish we could have stayed for more.",5,2022,09,05
46,Lovely hotel in Barcelona,"Brilliant hotel in a tranquil location. It’s a 10 minute walk to the metro station and bus stop. You can use the same ticket for different modes of transport. I used to take  a taxi back, as the hill going up to the hotel is very steep. Lovely large terrace in the room overlooking the port. Lovely terrace outside the bar with views over the park and port. Incredibly helpful staff, and I wanted to particularly mention Xavi and Carlos in the bar who were always friendly and attentive. Everyone made me feel as though I was a returning guest, they were all so warm and nice. I also booked a 90 minute massage which was sensational. I booked trips through the Viator app and my favourite trip was Girona and Costa Brava. 
I loved it and it’s going to be my go to Barcelona hotel. Cannot rate it highly enough. Ignore negative comments, this is a lovely hotel, with lovely staff, in a lovely spot.",5,2022,09,03
46,Views and location,"The views from the better rooms (sea view, upper floor) are unbelievable. Super big terrace. Comfy beds. Great quiet location, many good restaurants within 15 minutes walking distance. Service is hit and miss - from professional and friendly to really bad. Food is not good, For example I don’t understand how they manage to buy bland fruit in summer - in Spain. Bad coffee. But the location and the beauty of the rooms (which should be better maintained) make up for everything. The swimming pool area is in need of urgent and extensive reconstruction-but why leave the beautiful room terrace in the first place?",5,2022,08,30
46,Please raise to former glory,3 possible 4 if the owner would spend some money to restore to former glory. Most public areas are well maintained but the pool area is in serious need of upgrade as well as maintenance it simply does not justify the star rating as well as the price. Rooms are in serious need of a visit by the management as they are worn down. On a positive note the view is great and location is most likely the best in Barcelona. Quality of food is excellent but on a service level it unfortunately lacks at tentativeness. There are some outstanding staff but unfortunately they are seldom on duty,4,2022,08,11
46,A quiet Retreat in a busy city,"A beautiful property in the park, this hotel offers a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona. The Rambla,gothic quarter and Barcelonetta are walking distance (under 15 minutes) but require some steps. We found the staff friendly professional and helpful. The hotel restaurant was very good and has a great view. The only downside, was the spa. It was a bit limited.",4,2022,07,25
46,Was once a 5 star hotel🧐,"Majestic, but worn down hotel. Maintanance has been kept to a minimum. Moist dameged panels painted over. A subtile smell of old carpets in all rooms. Spacy rooms, great service. Ok but minimalistic breakfast. Location is great, on hilltop. Was 5 star hotel, but not any more.",3,2022,07,24
46,Pre Cruise Stay,"We had a wonderful stay for two nights. The staff is awesome, so helpful and friendly. We loved the quiet location of this hotel, and the nice room and comfortable balcony. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,07,14
46,Great location and staff but poor maintenance.,"This hotel is in a really nice location with a great view and great place to stay close to Barcelona without the inner city trouble.
Unfortunately, the hotel itself has seen better days. For a class and pricing like this , it is an a bad condition.
The staff is great and friendly, but it seems as if the rooms and the hotel are slowly starting to fall apart due to bad maintenance. Nothing really severe but a lot of minor things that you would not want in a classy hotel like that. Broken windows, not closing bathroom doors and so on.",3,2022,06,30
46,3 star is too much for it,This hotel is really far away from a 5 star hotel. The waiters at the breakfast and bar are always with bad mood. Never smile. Bring a boring atmosphere. There is no water at the gym. You must hunt a bottle of water around the hotel because there is none at the frigobar inside the room. My gosh the cheapest thing in a hotel uns water and they make the access to water restricted. The inside pool is cold. 3 star would be good for it.,2,2022,06,03
46,Horrendous hotel avoid at all costs,"Awful hotel. Tired exterior , awful room and NOT A 5 STAR .
My room was over £220 per night 
Broken air con set and stuck at 26° for both nights even after asking for it to be looked at .resulting is hardly any sleep when I’m there for an important business trip .
Shower drips loudly all the time .
Mouldy bathroom that smelt awful 
Holes all over the wall where there have put the television on brackets and moved  it a number of times , not repairing the damage . 
One of the biggest points I want to raise is the small sofa in the room 
Covered in what looks like  blood and sweat stains all over the sofa . Disgusting and off putting 
I will NEVER return EVER .
I’ve staying in some of the best hotels in World and also some budget hotels 
I would rate this a generous 2-3 
Might look good down stairs when you walk in 
But behind that facade is a grubby dirty room that shouldn’t be sold to customers 
You should be ashamed of yourselves",1,2022,04,22
46,Birthday week at the Miramar not off to a good start,"Night 1.
Uncomfortable heat in the hallways and rooms.
Air conditioner not working in rooms
Hot water out of cold taps
Rear facing room terrible view. 
Noisy after 1am.
Smell of pool/ chlorine throughout 5th floor.
Mini bar half stocked.
Bird mess on balcony chairs and dirty balcony left from previous guest. Fruit and drink on sticky floor.
Only one member of staff was excellent  Italian barman/server in lobby bar. He was superb.
All the rest were poor.

Seemed like the hotel was half open and didn't even help with cases to the room. No information about eating drinking in the hotel bars restaurants given. Website just told you very little was open on Monday and Tuesday. 

Basically didn't care about the guests just took all the money pre paid for the duration of the stay  thousands of pounds for two rooms for 5 days and a further cost for of 50euros per night as room service charge taken up front then discarded the customer to fend for themselves. Must have a lot of guests who leave without paying.

Treated like we were intruding on them in their half empty hotel.

Waited 2 years to come stay at the Miramar for my 40th birthday... now 42 post covid and wish I'd chosen somewhere else to spend thousands of euros for 5 days at a so called 5 star hotel.
 

Night 2. To follow....",1,2022,04,19
46,What a load of rubbish,"When you walk in and be greeted by vases full of dead flowers you begin to wonder what’s next
In a terrible location where you are completely stuck mind you the views are great 
No facilities for a 5 star 1 useless very poor choice menu restaurant and a badly stocked bar 
Rooms are dirty no money has been spent ripped carpets beds falling apart dead flowers sinks without plugs a/c that’s fixed at 23degrees in the night 
Do I need to go on
Avoid is my review at all costs",1,2022,03,07
46,Outdated hotel,"Unfortunately this hotel is totally outdated and feels 30 years old. I had to change rooms since the first one was totally unacceptable, it felt like a bad motel in an old US movie. It also had a terrace with a high wall around it, hence no view at all accept for a closed view over the entrance/parking. Although the hotel felt totally empty they charged extra for another room that was only slightly better - had I had more time and without Covid circumstances I would have left. 
Staff did what they could to be helpful.",2,2022,01,17
46,This hotel doesn't desrve to be a five star,"I stayed here for 6 nghts with my family. We wanted interconnecting rooms. Before reaching Barcelona, we had confirmed multiple times with the reservations that they will give us interconnecting rooms. On arrival that didnt' happen. We ere given rooms on two different floors. The staff is rude especially the front office. House keeping is miserable and room service is pathetic. One room shown to us was stinking. It is a very old proprty and far away from he town centre espcially the Catalan Square. You need to spend Ten Euros in a cab at least 4 times a day each time, each day. The breakfast in monotnous. Same thing, same menu for 5 days. I hated this hotel and don't advise anyone to stay there.",1,2021,12,03
46,A deep clean is needed,"It’s a shame as in 2017 I stayed in this hotel and really enjoyed my stay so based on that experience, I stayed there for a day last week and the place is going downhill, the first room they gave me had stains on the wall and mould in the shower so I asked them to change the room but even second room wasn’t clean enough and had big stains on the sofa , really disgusting, I’m sure keeping on top of cleaning and removing stains and mould is not a hard job but the hotel overall needs quick touches and maybe refurb",3,2021,10,02
46,Wonderful experience,"I had read online that the state of hotels all around Europe were declining, especially after the pandemic, however the Miramar hotel offered us an excellent experience. From the reception, handled by Martin and Diego, which had never stopped providing us every needed information on the hotel and the city, and the tasteful restaurant that has a surprisingly complete and satisfying menu, all the way to the rooms, that were luxurious, soothing and spacious which is what i usually look for in a quality hotel room, I can confidently say that the Miramar hotel is amongst the best hotels I have ever been too. 

Best, Georges El Khoury",5,2021,09,29
46,Speechless,"I just spent an amazing weekend with my boyfriend in this wonderful hotel! The setting was incredible, the experience was amazing. We loved the care of the staff that offers a high quality service
The must is, of course, the view that we could enjoy from our balcony",5,2021,09,29
46,Wonderful!,"I had an incredible stay at the Hotel Miramar. The service was second to none, with a staff that was available and responsive. The location was perfect, and the setting elegant and sophisticated. My partner and I opted for the GRAN SUITE MEDITERRÁNEA CON TERRAZA, with an impressive sea view. I will gladly return for a romantic getaway! The food was extremely good, and i’ll keep an excellent memory of this trip.",5,2021,09,29
46,Exceptional,"I had an amazing trip at Hotel Miramar Barcelona,
A special thank you to Mr. Moustache, who really made me feel at home here at the hotel and has great recommendations! 

The breakfast was delicious and there are a lot of choices in the buffet! The indoor pool is amazing and heated. I also worked from the loby bar which has a beautiful contemporary design.

Overall amazing stay :)",5,2021,09,29
46,Relaxing Weekend,"In our first time visiting Spain and Barcelona with my girlfriend, hotel Miramar allowed us to really disconnect with our stressful lives with every part of the stay being optimal in comfort, staff interactions, food and views!! I want to thank Martin and Diego at the reception for constantly helping us out and making sure we worried about nothing. I want to thank all the team at the spa which were adorable when going for treatments and outline the great level of the restaurant! The fish was exceptional and want a special shoutout to Daoud for giving us extra fries. Overall, thank you so much Hotel Miramar and we are so excited to come back!",5,2021,09,29
46,An exceptional hotel.,"An unforgettable experience in this hotel, whether it is on the service: the hotel miramar and its employees are exceptional hosts, but also on the room in general. Indeed, to have such a beautiful room at a good price is rare: a large bed, a bright room, pleasant, not to mention the magnificent contemporary decoration.
I would also like to mention the restaurant and the lobby which serve delicious meals.
It's a pleasure to have had such a good stay.

I highly recommend this hotel, if you want to relax by the sublime pool, in the spa or even to admire the view over the whole of Barcelona. I will come back for sure!",5,2021,09,29
46,The Rusty Hotel,"Terrible service, extremely overpriced, for example, cáfe con leche - 5 euros, and cáfe solo - 4 euros, this is too much. Dark atrium, I would add more light, very old doors to the terrace bar or cafeteria, shabby paint on the doors, dirty cushions with stains in the chairs. The level of the hotel is 2 or 3 stars, but by no means 5 stars.",1,2021,09,26
46,A beautiful night,"First thing, I've actually booked a night at La Florida Hotel for a romantic birthday night; but due to the pandemics, the place was closed and the company kindly offered me a move to this hotel. 
Even though I was initially reluctant, the movement was actually an unexpected gift. We were located at the upper suite: a quite sophisticated executive-style room with two big separated spaces, a changing room, a nice bathroom (taps could improve though) and a large terrace with absolutely delightful views of the port and good part of the city's seaside. Breakfast was included and a bottle of cool local cava (""catalan champagne"") served as welcoming drink. 
The stuff was diligent and kind throughout our stay, and the breakfast was held in a nice terrace and had plenty of variety and quality. 
Even though I'm not personally a big fun of the contemporary and minimalist style  the rooms have, I really enjoyed the experience and had one of the best chances in my lifetime to stare at the moon and the sun raising over the see from a privileged watchtower in top of Montjuich (which is one of the most prominent heights in Barcelona). I also shall point the lovely back-garden with a perfect terrace to chill waiting for the night to fall and the easy access to the facilities and the proximity of the hotel to the downtown as strong points of Miramar. 
I definitely would come back again.",5,2021,08,15
46,Shocked at the under trained staff.,"I wish I could write this review with out giving any stars . let’s start with the cleaner binning my very important medicine, when I informed the front desk about it they had 0 concerns about it, and were extremely rude to me acting like it wasn’t their problem. On the second day our room smelled like sewage it was so bad we couldn’t stay in the room. I informed the front desk about it they told me and my friend to leave the room and they will sort it out . We left for over 10hrs .
Came back and the smell was still unbearable. Long story short the front desk was extremely unprofessional, rude , cheeky with us . Said they can down grade us To a smaller room or give us 50% refund . We demanded a full refund as we haven’t been in the room all day due to an issue that was meant to be fixed and no one told us it won’t be fixed when we are back. So they tried to SCAM US. The guy In the photo I will attach claimed to be the manager ( when he is clearly just a receptionist) and started doing things like giving me sarcastic and rude comments along with aggressively rolling a receipt into a ball in his hands to show
Me his anger . I have never dealt with more disgusting human being in my life . Clearly hasn’t been trained properly and has on going issues at home that he takes out on hotel clients . Don’t know who hired him and how he got this job but he shouldn’t be dealing with people he should maybe stay home from the anger and attitude issues he has. And I will be taking this matter further and warning everyone about this hotel as I have a huge social media following and I’m a public person .",1,2021,04,22
46,Thank you so much ,"The most professional and friendly service we have had in Barcelona and we have stayed in all the best hotels including the W, artz and others ! Diego, Jonathon, Carlas, Fabio and the friendly lady at breakfast have all been very service minded and have given my family the impression that we are at home here at the Hotel Miramar! Many thanks again -
Huet family ",5,2020,10,18
46,Fantastic views,"Writing this review as we were walking by the surrounding of the hotel without staying at the hotel.  Rating it accordingly to the area the mountain where it's sitting on.  Loads of trails to walk around up or down the mountain, down to the city center.  Big car park for people who drive in Barcelona, I would stay here if I didn't already have a place to stay.",5,2020,10,01
46,GREAT STAY BUT NOT PERFECT ,"We stayed at Hotel Miramar for a week whilst exploring the city of Barcelona , We booked this hotel for the sole purpose it had good reviews and was classed as a 5 star hotel. We booked a suite with a balcony and that's exactly what we got , the views overlooked the city and was amazing to sit out on the deck chairs in the sun and also enjoy the evening there. 

Whilst we enjoyed our time here , there was issues which dropped this hotel a score for us. Upon arriving to our room and wanting to head out onto the balcony we could not open the door and called for maintenance to come up and check it out as the balcony lock seemed to be hanging off its hinges and upon inspection it seemed like the lock had previously been fixed with just tape. Secondly the key to access our hotel room would not work which resulted in myself sitting outside the room with bags whilst my fiance went downstairs to sort this out and was told by one of the reception staff that ""He wasn't trying it probably and that if he came up himself it'd work"" even though there's only one way to use it and the staff wasn't taking reliability. Also if you want room service you'll be waiting over half an hour for just a cup of tea.

Despite all these issues , all  of the staff were soo friendly and helpful and the facilities they have are amazing. 

",4,2020,07,18
46,Expected More,"We were planning a weekend break in Barcelona and our son persuaded us to book the Miramar, as it was offering good deals as an incentive for clients, as Barcelona came out of Covid lockdown. Not sure if some of the shortcomings were due to Covid, or just representative of the hotel in general. We'd read online about a welcome glass of Cava on check in. This didn't happen (perhaps due to Covid). We wondered if a little bottle was left in our room, but it wasn't. 
The highlights of the hotel were the amazing views of the city and the port, the super comfy bed, the beautifully soft bed linen and the lovely bathroom (bath/shower/toiletries). The hotel is also committed to keeping their guests safe as far as hand sanitising, social distancing, wearing face coverings etc. 
As well as the lack of Cava at check in, we agree with many other trip advisor reviews about the lack of cleanliness of the pool bed covers and the general need for refurbishment. Some very friendly and efficient staff eg Carlos at the pool and Jonathan at reception. Disappointing service at breakfast in having to ask 3 times for a refill of coffee (maybe due to skeleton staffing because of Covid implications). Also a poor attitude from staff when you're made to feel like an inconvenience when the waitress tuts and rolls her eyes when reminded about the coffee! You need to check your bill. We were overcharged for breakfasts (which we'd prepaid) and some other random bill at checkout. This was resolved, but an unnecessary time consuming inconvenience when you're rushing to get to the airport.",3,2020,07,14
46,Peaceful hotel with fabulous views,"My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel. We loved that it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but not too far, and it felt very peaceful even though it was clearly busy.
The staff were very kind and friendly and everywhere was spotlessly clean.
Breakfast was excellent, with plenty of choice, and served in the restaurant overlooking the port and gardens.
We enjoyed using the spa swimming pool after a long day sightseeing.
Our room was wonderful, really large with two windows which overlooked the port and the city. The only slight downside for us was the lack of privacy in the bathroom and we felt this was a strange set up for twin rooms which might be shared by people who don't want to share everything! We were offered a room change but decided that we would stay put because we loved the view so much.
We would both love to come back to Barcelona and would definitely stay here again.",5,2020,02,18
46,First class hotel and staff,"Stayed for 2 nights last week with my husband and daughter. We had fantastic rooms, amazing views beautiful toiletries, dressing gowns, great location etc. What really made this hotel stand out though was the attentive staff. Nothing was two much trouble. Excellent restaurant recommendations both nights, taxis organised and tour bus tickets booked and best routes explained. Martin (?) even took the time to check and see what we had thought of the choices. Highly recommend.",5,2020,02,12
46,A room with an eagles view.,"Perched on a hill overlooking  magnificent Barcelona, this hotel is an oasis of calmness and gentlity.If you want to experience the livliness of Barcelona, but have a quiet retreat amid luxurious surroundings this is the place to go.lt's only 10 minutes by taxi to the heart of Barcelona, but a world away in terms of serenity and tranquility.
Go, and feel like an eagle, master of all you survey.",4,2020,02,10
46,A truly memorable stay over Christmas and New Year ,"We arrived early evening to a warm,  welcoming Reception, some cava and much information abt Barcelona in general and the hotel in particular. We loved our big room and view straight away. Our stay was notable for all the staff's friendly and professional help, good suggestions for tours, shopping, eating and transport. The indoor pool was a lovely experience each morning. Our Christmas Day lunch in the Studio was legendary. The bar and room service was always relaxed and prompt. Nothing was too much trouble.  We were sad to leave for home and must thank Kate and Martin in particular making sure we had a wonderful holiday in this  fabulous city. We will return. Highly recommended.",5,2020,01,19
46,Fabulous hotel,"Arrived for a post xmas relaxing break. As you drive upto the hotel it looks rather dated with a prefab type of building from the outside.....however, the inside is just beautiful, its ambiance is friendly, relaxing and opulent. We booked a room with a view and bath in the bedroom area....fab, fab, fab....
We didnt eat dinner in the restaurant as we enjoyed spending time exploring Barcelona with its many eating places.....But, we ate breakfast every morning which was just Perfect, both in choice, quality and I cannot recommend the staff enough. They are polite, friendly and super efficient. Hotel Miramar, I congratulate you on your hotel and the staff who made our stay such a pleasurable one. Thank you.",5,2019,12,30
46,Relaxing Oasis,"Lovely location overlooking the harbor in Barcelona. Very peaceful and quiet, yet minutes away from nightlife and downtown via cab (7 to 10 Euros). Our room included a spacious balcony with a spectacular view of the harbor; a great spot to relax after a day playing tourist. The spa pool was nice; we were unable to enjoy the outdoor pool due to the Fall weather, but the location and landscaping suggested that we probably would not habve left the hotel if it were open :-). The breakfast buffet was wonderful. Tapas in the lobby bar were excellent, and pricing seemed fair. Room service featured the same well prepared food. The staff was superb, attnetive to ur needs without once being in the way. When we return to Barcelona, this will be the only hotel we consider! We would suggest that some preventive maintenance is overdue, typical of a seaside resort and the effects of wind, salt, sun and sand. What a nice place to stay!!",5,2019,11,28
46,A palace on a hill,"Five stars -
1. Staff - friendly, professional, and will ""take you by the hand"" to make your stay in Barcelona more enjoyable - They will find out when and where Flamenco shows are and will make reservations for shows and restaurants without hesitation. 
2. Location - The best. Outstanding view over the entire city and harbor area. Taxis to most locations in town and to the Olympic Port are about 7-14 euros. T 
3. Room . My wife and I were there to celebrate my birthday. The staff (Ekaterina) assigned us an absolutely fantastic corner room with a terrace and an awesome view. In addition to the view the room (312 - get it if you can) offered a huge bed with a firm matress. The room was very comfortable, the bathroom was spotless and quite large. The maid kept us in chocolates and coffee for the Nespresso machine.  And the management sent up a bottle of sparkling wine to assist us in celebrating. This was special and very personal - as was our entire stay. We hope to return and combine a visit with a cruise. 
4. Amenities - A lovely indoor pool and Spa area. The outdoor pool offers a spectacular view. There is a bar and a restaurant and a very spacious lounge area offering Tapas. Internet connection was solid and free.
5. Price - totally fair - book/pay in advance for best price - Anna - the Reservations lady was very helpful. ",5,2019,11,25
46,"Lovely, but over priced and under delivers.","Scored ‘very good’ but the Miramar is more like a ‘good’
Overpromised and underdelivered, don’t get me wrong this hotel is beautiful, it’s in a peaceful location with fantastic views and the staff are very friendly, professional and helpful.
Food at the hotel is excellent, we had room service on our first night and ate it on the balcony overlooking the port which was beautiful, the next morning we had breakfast which is buffet style, quite limited but an ok choice of cereal meats and eggs. Was expecting more from a 5 start hotel, especially the price they charge per night.
Our room was a little disappointing, we booked the room as the photos showed a freestanding bath in the middle of the room, when we got to our room the bath was in the bathroom and it was just a standard bath.
The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom floor, clearly this had been happening for a long time as the skirting boards and door were all swollen crumbly and rotten, a problem either not picked up and reported by housekeeping or they knew about it and it was just left.
Little things also let this hotel down such as only having one Nespresso pods for two people, bog standard wineglasses rather than elegant ones you find in other five star hotel, It sounds a little petty but when you are paying these prices you expect more.
This is a lovely hotel, the location is peaceful but not the best if you want to pop out to a bar, restaurant or to the supermarket, prices in the hotel are extremely high, even for five star hotel standards.
We would stay at The Miramar again if we got a good deal but not at full price, for the price this hotel charges you can get better hotels in better locations.",4,2019,11,19
46,Should not miss attraction - Hotel Miramar,"Hotel Miramar is a leading hotel located on a mountain top overlooking the city, Therefore, you get a very nice view of the city from the hotel & garden. It is a popular attraction in Barcelona too. There is a separate cable car from the city that leads to Hotel Miramar. Also, city tour buses have a stop.",5,2019,11,17
46,The Best in Barcelona!,"I arrived after a daunting tour, spilled out of a taxi and was met by a young man “Welcome to the Miramar.  Can I take your bags?  Please, some in, sit down while you wait for check-in.  Can I get you a glass of water?  Wine? Champagne?  I waited briefly until the seats at registration were empty and sat to check in.  My room would not be ready until 3, but would I like to enjoy a latte in the luxurious lobby lounge until then?  My room had a deck, king size bed, fridge, luxury bathtub and huge walk in shower, designer bath products and quiet.  Located in Montjuïc Park, the view is spectacular and the blend of classical and modern architecture is elegant.  The Joan Miro museum and all sorts of other sites are within walking distance and the hop on hop off bus.  The pool area is relaxing and private, set within a L’Occident spa.  Restaurants and room service are both good.  So great I spent one day just enjoying the hotel and the park setting!",5,2019,11,02
46,Miramar and Barcelona,"Very helpful staff!! Amazing location!! Loved it!! You can take a cable car and you are at the beach.. tourist bus just outside.. great breakfast with views of the river and the city.. outside pool
Is stunning too 😊",5,2019,11,02
46,Lovely Hotel,"We arrived a couple of hours before the 3 pm check in to a very warm welcome and the offer of a cold drink.  Very pleased our room was ready early, since we were quite tired after a long flight from Vancouver, via Montreal. Only  spent one night prior to embarking on a cruise, but really enjoyed our stay, despite some of the inconveniences.
Stayed in a Premium Room which included  Breakfast Buffet.  Very small room, but a nice deck with great views of the park and Mediterranean.  No bathtub and the tiles in the shower were loose, making it very easy to slip.  Large plush towels, but the heated towel bar didn't work.  No Nespresso machine in the room, as some reviewers have mentioned.  A bottle of water was provided.  An ironing board was also  provided, however there was no iron.  If we had been staying more than the one night, I would have addressed these issues with management.
The park, cable car and a couple of restaurants, all with great views,  are right next to the Miramar.  
We enjoyed a nice, relaxing dinner on the Miramar terrace overlooking the park and received great service.  
The breakfast buffet was plentiful.  Lots of hot and cold selections.

46,Relaxing stay with great views,We booked this hotel for an overnight post cruise stay. The room was large with a balcony and a fantastic bath. The food is the restaurant was amazing. Unfortunately we were there during the protests but we were fine as we were just far enough from the centre as not to cause us any problems.,5,2019,10,23
46,Business or Pleasure! Amazing place to be!,We had a conference at the Hotel Miramar Barcelona in September 2019. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with the gardens and the architecture. The staff were so helpful and so pleasant. We worked with Marta on the sales team and she went above and beyond-she is absolutely amazing! The food was fantastic-the breakfast buffet was well maintained and great quality food! The hotel itself was very clean and sort of on the outskirts of the city-which really makes you feel a sense of calm. The banquet staff were so incredible for our events and were so accommodating. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to help execute our meeting! ,4,2019,10,22
46,Good hotel with a view,"The hotel had a terrific view right by the cable bar that takes you to Barceloneta beach. The hotel facilities were very nice with indoor/outdoor pool, spa and gym. Our room had a bath, shower, queen bed and a nice balcony. The breakfast buffet had a great view and good food. Within walking distance of Blai street (15 min) and Las Ramblas (30 min). Hotel service was very good but they do not have shuttle service from airport as advertised; they will help you set up transportation with a Taxi or private car service.",4,2019,10,17
46,Not worth the price !,"Having stayed in many hotels from 2 to 5 star over recent years this was not the quality we expected.  Room was adequate, nice balcony ( main reason for choosing the room) and bathroom did the purpose. Decor in bathroom was tatty in places, mouldy ceiling and glass door had to be fixed as it was hanging off. Nespresso machine in room  with one pod of coffee and one pod of decaf per day.. really!   Restaurant very expensive and choices limited, mainly meat and seafood. View was nice, outdoor pool freezing, covers on sun beds looked nice but having seen them being used and just straightened up rather than changed, yuk. 
Indoor pool ok, decor tatty there too tho, mouldy and slightly grotty.  At £1000 for four nights would not be planning to stay here again.",3,2019,10,14
46,Hotel Miramar,"A warm welcome, excellent hospitality and beautiful surroundings. A perfect combination of fine dining, beautiful architecture and relaxing atmosphere.Absolutely loved our stay. We will definitely be returning",5,2019,10,13
46,superb!!!!😊,"Great weekend in this Hotel, high floor, big balcony, Nespresso set and minibar daily charged. Super view from the pool and gardens. Very clean room and bathroom. Luxury amenities. Helpful staff and hotel well located near the city center in bus or taxi.

Kind regards from Belgium, we will come back!!!",5,2019,10,09
46,Hotel with a view,This was our final hotel after a ten day jaunt through Spain on a car rally.  We enjoyed a two night stay and wasn’t disappointed.  Our room was a good size with a fabulous en suit masked by a muslin curtain and separate shower and toilet. The room was well designed and clean and made for a very relaxing comfortable stay.  Our room had a balcony overlooking the sea and port.  The hotel was luxurious and housed a great in and outdoor  pool with an outside bar and sun loungers again overlooking the port. The food and breakfast were good and the service was friendly.  The location was a little outside the main town but there was a regular (open) bus service and cable car lift just outside the hotel to the port and harbour.,4,2019,10,09
46,"VERY unclean, urine-stained, rude management, great views","Asked for early check in several weeks in advance, which they responded to and said they would do everything possible to honor. Traveled all night to get to hotel. Upon check in, had no record of request for early check in.  Asked to sign documents reflecting a different guest's name. Worked thru that issue, then at 10am was promised room at 1:30pm.  Tired, but went out to occupy ourselves for four hours. Returned at 2:00, and rude Manager said no room until 3:00. Pressed issue, and a room miraculously became available 10 minutes later. Manager took stubs for 5 checked bags and said they would  be delivered immediately.  Waited 1.5 hours, time which was needed to rest and get ready for 5pm appointment, and no bags arrived.  Went down to front desk and manager was rude and clueless about our bags. I let him know about the many issues in our room, and at that point snuck off and wouldn't discuss any further. I then had to search their storeroom myself, and then carry 5 bags alone up to 3rd floor. I could have taken anyone's bags and they would not have cared. Same manager later called to say ""someone messed up"" and offered to send a bottle of sparkling wine. I told him we can't drink and were in a hurry to get ready for appointment, and asked if he could just credit our bill that amount for the wine. He agreed and we finished getting ready. On our way out, we stopped and questioned if the credit was done, and he said he would not do it. He wanted us to leave the lobby and ""go to another room"" and be late to our appointment while he ""explained why they were sorry"". Had no time for that to make our appointment. Tried to talk to manager later that night and again in the morning, and he just kept ducking us.  The room given us had too many issues...  

- Balcony door stuck, have to throw body into it to open or close. 
- Refrigerator door loose on hinges, thought it would fall off.
-  Bathroom sink doesn't drain, water stands for 10-15 minutes. 
-  URINE stains on toilet seat and floor. Had to clean seat ourselves.  Didn't appear like it had been cleaned in a long time. This was not filth from just one previous guest.
- Vanity top not clean.  Several stains that were easily removable proves it is not cleaned at all.  Lipstick marks over top that would come off easily if they bothered trying.
- Rolled up bath towel was wet, as if they just rolled it up after last guest used it.
- Toilet seat cracked at the hinge, thought it would fall off.
- Shower door hits shower head so that it doesn't open fully, so you must squeeze in. Could shatter if opened quickly.
- Shower door hits other glass when closing, also a shatter hazard. When we first came in, hotel had left a folded towel in place to keep door from fully closing due to this risk.  Same issue with glass door to WC.
- Pubic hairs in bathtub, easy noticeable if they had considered cleaning it.
- Old large animal feces on balcony (like dog or bobcat size). Dried up and whitened like it had sat there for a couple of weeks.
- At least two stray dogs were roaming the property. 

The Good:  comfy bed, sheets *seemed* clean, big room, great water pressure, great views.  Not enough to compensate for the nastiness and rudeness.

This is a poorly managed and poorly maintained hotel.  Staff is inept. Room was over $260 per night.  I wouldn't pay $30 per night to stay again.",1,2019,10,06
46,"A gem in Barcelona, ideal balance between luxury, service, location, and great views!","To get a good deal you need to plan ahead, but it is worth it. The fact of it being located on a hill makes it ever more attractive and exclusive, with a top service of each stuff member, great quality food, and many options to choose from.",5,2019,10,03
46,A pre-paid gift from my children for our 50th wedding anniversary. £1000 for 3 nights b and b,The hotel is rated as 5 star.  The price of food and drinks is very heavy. The military are shooting guns all day it's impossible to sit on your balcony. Guests should be informed of this. The hotel is situated on a high hill next to the castle where the shooting takes place. Feel ripped off,3,2019,09,29
46,Beautiful hotel with attentive staff - lovely stay,Highly recommned this hotel - it deserves it's 5 star rating. The outside pool area was beautiful and all of the staff we met were helpful and courtous. The location of the hotel makes it unbeatable as it has views of the harbour below. It is a steep walk from the centre and marina but 10 euros gets you a taxi back to the hotel. It is not a cheap hotel but you get what you pay for.,5,2019,09,24
46,Perfect,This hotel is perfect for couples who don’t like being down close to the tourist areas. It’s tucked halfway up mountjuic and has the best views of Barcelona and the water. Great service and amenities. My wife and i will return. ,5,2019,09,21
46,"Fantastic hotel, amazing location and staff who make you feel","My wife and I had a great weekend and can't thank you enough for making the weekend so special for us.

The room was fantastic and was a perfect base to explore Barcelona.  We found all the staff to go above and beyond their roles to look after us.

I have already recommended your hotel to friends and family and will certainly be coming back to stay with you soon!",5,2019,09,20
46,Wow!!!,"Historic hotel, located in Montjuic Mountain, from our suite room the views of the sea at dawn impress. Really wow!!!! Well connected to the city and tourist attractions. Two clean pools surrounded by gardens, bar with good service, spa services in the garden under the sun is one special experience. The suite room on fifth floor, spacious, clean and with adequate amenities: iron, bathrobes, coffee maker, terrace chairs, etc. Friendly and very helpful staff.",5,2019,09,13
46,Terrific Time,"Really terrific hotel. When arriving, take the road up the hill rather than the steps through the park (if on foot), that's my only piece of advice. 
Staff were delightful, warn, welcoming and friendly from arrival throughout our stay, really making us feel welcomed and at ease. The room was beautiful as was the view. Room was clean, well-maintained and very comfortable. Hotel amenities were excellent as was the decor and space. Really made a wonderful trip all the more better. Would happily visit again",5,2019,09,12
46,"Cockroach in the room, no reaction from staff","I would like to start saying that I’ve stayed at this hotel 4-5 times and it is a great hotel with good service and amenities. Last July I stayed with my wife (first time on vacation and not business trip at the hotel) and found a huge cockroach in the bathroom.

Worst thing was the lack of reaction from reception staff whom I showed the photo to. No apologies, no options, no clean up, no compensation, nothing at all, just “it is what it is” from 3-4 staff at front desk. 100% unacceptable from a hotel with this category that has to demonstrate its status not just by the room, pool, spa & amenities but also with a staff at the level required and able to handle a situation like this.

Problems can always appear, it is the way you face them what makes the difference.",1,2019,09,04
46,Spectacular views...but hotel not 5 star,"We stayed at this hotel after returning from a 5 day cruise. Upon arrival the staff was very friendly and checked our bags until our room was ready. When we returned from sightseeing and retrieved the key to our 6th floor room, we found out one of the two elevators was broken...the one that goes to the sixth floor, so we had to walk from 5 to 6 every time we came or left our room. The premium room is spacious with fabulous views, but that is where the fabulous stops. The bathroom has been upgraded, but it was done poorly. The glass door to the toilet opens out into the bathroom so you have to close/open it all the time and it's difficult to navigate at night. The shower door opens in and only half way before it hits the shower head hanging from the center of the stall, and dont even get me start on the water stains in the ceiling. The king bed is low to the floor and very springy/low quality. If you pay for premium and plan to spend your time on the terrace you wont be disappointed, but if you want to sleep well or use the bathroom facilities, this hotel needs a lot of work!",3,2019,08,31
46,Lovely hotel with superb service,"We stayed at the Hotel Miramar for only one night prior to a cruise.  I would choose this hotel over and over again not only for the lovely property, proximity to the cruise port (you can see it from the hotel) but for the exceptional service provided by the staff, especially Ginevra Garavagua.  She went above and beyond in getting us checked in early to our room following an overnight flight, but was the hardest working person in the hotel. She wore many hats, all of them exceptionally well.  Her attention to us made us feel we were the only people in the hotel.  Thank you Ginevra!",5,2019,08,14
46,Nice... but not 5*GL,"I stayed here for 3 nights with friends in July. The hotel is pretty and have a very pretty view of the marina and W hotel. In terms of location, it’s the perfect distance to the beach and city centre. If you’re getting taxis back to the hotel then that’s no problem but if you’re walking, be ready to walk up a mountain :/. The beds were comfy and the service was really good but the room, pool and overall hotel was not 5*. The shower had mould on the ceiling!!",4,2019,08,06
46,Very relaxing,"The hotel is 5 stars. Rooms are good with balcony. Staff is friendly and can speak english. The breakfast is ok not really much variety, first time no one offered different egg preparation next time they did. I would say spa and pool bar are really friendly and do what suppose to be in 5 stars! All in all hotel is good a bit far so u need taxi. But we went by walk back to the hotel from the center so , its possible if u want to do some exercises . For kids i would say a bit far and difficult if u have stroller. Beautiful location near by.  ",4,2019,08,03
46,Filthy! NOT a 5 star!,"I can't believe how dirty this hotel was. There was filth in the hallway in front of our room throughout our entire stay of 3 days without being cleaned up. There's mold and mildew on the ceiling and in the shower. The pool area was absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't even sit down on the chairs. Whoever is running this hotel needs to be fired. This is by far not even close to a five star hotel. It needs to be updated and CLEANED! Also, it is out of the way so hailing a taxi can be difficult. Customer service was minimal.",1,2019,07,29
46,En Route to a Cruise,"I stayed at this hotel during a two-night visit to Barcelona in late May and couldn't have been more pleased.  The hotel is modern, clean, comfortable, friendly, and located in a peaceful park-like setting high in the hills of the Montjuic section of Barcelona.  Day or night there were stunning views of the city and port area.  It is convenient if you are arriving by air, and it was only a short walk from the hotel to the cable cars running either up to the Montjuic Castle or down to the port area.  The Joan Miro museum is also only a short walk away.  At first it might have seemed a bit remote from the commercial and tourist areas of Barcelona, but the taxi fare into town was only about €15.00 and well worth the cost.  The taxi ride to port the next morning when going to meet join our cruse was about the same.",5,2019,07,05
46,Not a Five Star Hotel at all.....,"Made reservations with months in advance for 2 rooms (one room with two beds).  We were never given the room with two twin beds due to high demand and low availability despite being told at the time of checking we were getting those rooms, so my two teens (boy and girl) had to sleep on a king size bed with separate bedding only, not at all confortable for them.  The bathrooms are pretty but open to the room with no privacy at all, very uncomfortable for people sharing a room if they are not a couple. Every time one of my teens was showering the other one was outside the room in the balcony to give privacy to the one showering!  At the time of registering I was told they were charging my credit card the full amount of the stay (5 days) again!!, even though the entire stay had been payed in advance, they called it ""a precaution for mini bar or room service charges!!"" about 3700 euros were locked on to my credit card, thank God I travel with plenty of money and credit cards; of course they reimbursed 3000 at the time of departing (room charges were off the roof at this place).
At their restaurant food was average, with very poor service and very expensive tags. Breakfast was good (we had it prepaid also) and since it is mostly buffet style there were no issues.  Room service was awful, I was not feeling good so my husband and kids went downstairs to eat and ordered room service for me, it took close to 1 1/2 hrs to get my food, that was unbelievable.  The bar was the only place with good service, but only if you were at the bar itself.  If you ordered in the seating area by the bar brace yourself and bring a book to read, you will be done with your reading all your chores before a waiter comes by.  Some people left after more than 1 hr waiting to get their drinks, we were too tired to complaint (got drinks about 45-50 minutes after ordering them), I had forgotten what I had ordered.
From day one the phone in our room didn't work, requested to have it serviced every single day and never happened, that is unbelievable, since every time we needed to contact front desk we had to go there.
Hotel is deceiving in its location, don't expect a walk to the beach (you ned to take the Gondola and its expensive) your ""views"" are of the docks in the harbor.  They are located in a park, in the hills, so no matter where you want to go you walk up or down the hills, granted is a 10-15 minutes walk but on a steep hills the game changes.  The indoor pool had mildew or something green in the corners, and my daughter didn't want to stay there anymore, the outdoor pool (grass area) ricked with animal poop smell.  They claim to be a ""No pet Hotel"", but there was a lady with her pet dog there. 
Hotel is popular with weddings and there were a few while we stayed there.  Hotel has a Spa, but after the pool issue ( have to go through the Spa to get to the indoor pool) I didn't bother reserve a facial treatment or any treatment.
Maintenance is not a priority here, from my balcony I could clearly see the lack of fresh or clean paint in the balconies above me, the paint in the  railing in my balcony was peeling off and it was hard to put your hands or arms on it, because you felt the pinching on your skin.
Staff is very friendly and speak several languages, maids are very loud early in the morning while getting their chores done, not good when you want to sleep in.
Over all this is a very expensive luxury hotel not worth the money they charge and most certainly not a 5 Star Hotel, perhaps a 3-4 if that.",2,2019,07,03
46,Disappointing,"We were looking forward to a relaxing end of our trip at this hotel in Barcelona but it was disappointing.  The “view” wasn’t much but just the port of a lot of boats.  The hotel itself didn’t have any magnificent landscaping. The location - walking down (then back up) the stairs to the center under the scorching heat, although only 15 minutes, was miserable. Then we decided to stay at the hotel and used the swimming pools - another disappointment; the inside pool got sands on the bottom, and the outdoor one was small with grass surrounded which reeked of dog poops. The pool chairs were also filthy. When we didn’t want to leave the hotel anymore due to the heat, we tried the restaurant. A huge disappointment. We got there one day at 1pm, right at opening time. The restaurant was empty but we were told we could only sit outside since they were already booked up. We had no other option but to sit outside under the heat. We picked a table that was under the shade and were told that table was also reserved. We ended up eating with sweat dripping down our bodies. When we left at 2:15, barely half of the inside tables were occupied and there was no one outside but us. ( Thanks for the hospitality,) The quality of the food was nothing compared to the restaurants we ate outside, yet the prices were twice expensive. We also tried their snack bar - same experience. Overall, we would not return to this hotel. Yes, we were unlucky to get the heat wave but this “five-star” hotel wasn’t worth it in the first place.",1,2019,06,30
46,Not a 5 star I’m afraid,"Whilst the hotel location is great and the bedroom is great also, the rest of the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.

We ate on our second night in the hotel restaurant. 7 prawns for €33, I’m afraid not. Wife didn’t get the fish she ordered but got on with it. She also ordered a martini espresso but received just an espresso 🤣
On finally getting the alcohol version she wasn’t able to drink it. It was returned. Also charged for 2 bottles of sparkling water when we only had one. Not worth the price.

When we finished dinner we went to the bar and sat outside when a family of 5 decided to eat their take out meal from down the road next to us!!!!

The front of the hotel opens onto a public area where, which is fine, the public have easy access to the hotel but also the pool. Today we had 3 people who definitely were not staying in the hotel on one of the beds next to us playing their own music and being loud. 

I’m afraid you do not pay €275 a night for this carry on.

Would not recommend it as a 5 star experience.

46,Great visit to a fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for the Ed Sheeran concert at the Olympic stadium . Great hotel for anything at the Olympic stadium only 20 mins walk although is uphill.
Hotel very comfortable all staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms are a good size, we stayed in a deluxe room and the beds especially were very large and comfortable. We had a side view of the port, great to sit on the balcony and enjoy a beer.
Hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona , but only a 15 euro cab fare to the Marina/Port.
Great stay in a great hotel . Would not hesitate to come back .",5,2019,06,22
46,Good location.,"Location : Fantastic. Views to die for. A short walk down to the town for supermarkets / restaurants / tapas....a longer up hill walk back. The bus stop for the hop on / off are just up the road as is the cable car up to the castle. The views are incredible.Taxis park outside. The cost is reasonable and within 10 minutes you can be down at the Marina or many other places to eat...or just walk 

Room :Fine it had everything we needed. It was clean, a decent shower and a balcony with a side view of the city. We spent very little time in the room but if fulfilled its function.They supplied a free bottle of water daily..

Amenities : A lovely pool and grass area, an indoor pool, a spa (prices seemed reasonable but didnt have time to use)..and outdoor bar. Plenty of sunbeds and cabanas.It never seemed crowded

Restaurant and Bar : We used the bar but not the restaurants. Expensive but understandable considering the location.

In summary. For the location it was ideal for a short trip. I've no idea what the hotel was marketing itself as but felt it was a solid 4 star and the price we paid seemed reasonable for the location / views and facilities.  Staff were friendly and we had no complaints. We would probably return to sample the spa and explore the parts of the city we didn't see.",4,2019,06,18
46,Worst hotel I have ever stayed,"This hotel is so bad that I can’t believe it could even get 4 stars let alone 5 stars. When you arrive, no one is welcoming you in the front door and you have to carry your own luggage out. 
There are hairs in the bath tub and sink. Huge stain on the sofa. When you called the house keeping, they just came and grabbed the hair.
After I changed to another room, there are melon seeds and stains on the floor, crack in the shower floor.
The room is not sound proof and I have been woken up by people next door at mid-night.
When you leave, it takes forever to get a taxi. no one help you to carry luggage. 
It is a nightmare to stay here.
",1,2019,06,15
46,"Poor quality hotel, and poor follow up to all our issues ","Having just stayed at this hotel recently for 4 nights, we faced a number of issues that really made this stay poor. What made things worse was there was no concern or follow up in response to these issues with emails of complaint not replied to, and no follow up call or contact to our verbal complaint at the hotel. 

It's in a nice location but other than that the room smelled of drains, the views from standard rooms are poor, we had a number of defects in the room such as leaks, as drains, broken AC and nails sticking up out of the floor. 

Don't waste your money - stay somewhere that actually cares 

",2,2019,06,12
46,Very disappointing for 5 stars,"We were in a large group, 6 reservations celebrating a special occasion There were many problems. First, one of our rooms had a very loud AC motor and rather than move us, a repair person was sent in to repair while we were in the room, preventing us from being able to get ready for a planned dinner on time. while the dinner on property was lovely, the bill for the meal ($1000 for 18 people) was mistakenly added to the wrong room and that member of our party was forced to explain he was not responsible and the front desk actually argued with him(!!!) that he owed the amount until we insisted they double check the name on the bill. This mistake caused us to be late to check in for our flight and we had to pay to hold the taxi to straighten it out. The front desk was simply rude.  How embarrassing it would be for the hostess of our dinner if she knew this terrible mistake was made. Not classy at all and NOT 5 star service. The breakfast and drinks are overpriced, the rooms are dusty and aging. It’s a beautiful view, but this hotel is overrated and i can’t recommend it. ",2,2019,06,11
46,Perfect,"Discovered the hotel some years ago but only just had a opportunity to stay there. What views, what service, what style! A fantastic treat and a great place to stay to see and visit attractions in Barcelona. The service is excellent and all the staff are great assets to this lovely establishment. Daytime and night views are breathtaking and the nearby montjuic gardens and parks are great to explore",5,2019,06,11
46,Best Hotel Ever,"If you are loooking for pure luxery with an an incredible views and formidable hospitality, this is the best Barcelona can offers. Pure style and you get a feeling of traveling to "" man Men"" location in Europe. The Pool bar og the room we got (304) were magic. The employee was extremely service minded, and we enjoyed a wedding from an fairtayle! ",5,2019,06,03
46,Heaven in the hills,"Miramar is an oasis tucked away in the hills, a short stroll from the bustle of Barcelona. I'd informed the hotel of my intention to propose before arriving, and they kindly arranged a beautiful suite overlooking the sea. The staff are faultless and nothing is too much trouble. All facilities at the hotel live up to its 5 star status, especially the outside pool area, which is hard to drag yourself away from. We will definitely be returning in the future.",5,2019,06,02
46,Beautiful hotel and amazing service!,"Booked the premium room and had platinum service!!! Not only was the room amazing and clean but the staff members were all amazing from the receptionist, to the bar staff to the breakfast staff - 5 Star Service!! 

Will definitely be back :)",5,2019,05,21
46,"Amazing hotel with a helpful, caring staff!","Had a lovely stay at the Hotel Miramar in Barcelona. It was such a wonderful hotel and the staff was top notch!

We booked in to use the spa and had spa treatments. one of the best spas I've been to! The products are absolutely divine! They use L'occitane products! spa is definitely worth going! 

Location is Lovely!! The views are Amazing! only thing is I think it's too far to walk to the central, and we took a taxi to las ramblas. Barcelona is a beautiful city!",5,2019,05,06
46,Great as usual,"Fabulous place ( lovely views) and access to the funicular have a drink on the terrace <3
beautiful bedroom ( shower are exceptional) 
great service (warm and professional welcome )
The swimming pool is very nice too with a great bar ",4,2019,05,05
46,Very nice hotel,"This is the third time at the Miramar.
I love the location, the rooms.
The reception employees and the concierge are exceptionally nice and forthcoming.
The lobby is has a friendly atmosphere as well as the terrace with its outstanding view of the marina.
The food of the restaurant is excellent  too.
The only 2 drawbacks, is the hotel needs some partial reparations, and the breakfast needs some more variety. 

But definitely I will continue coming to this exceptional hotel",5,2019,04,28
46,Wonderful stay.,"We enjoyed our stay at your hotel very much. It is beautiful inside and out! Thank you for making our Barcelona days wonderful.

My husband and I ate in your restaurant both nights that we stayed. Silvia Montali was our server both nights. She is a fabulous person and an exceptional server. We enjoyed talking with her and we also enjoyed her recommendations for drinks and dinner. She is a lovely young woman who works very hard and were really appreciated her making us feel so welcome. Her English was very very good and being able to chat with her was great.

Thank you so much and if we are ever in Barcelona again, we will be stayng at your hotel!",5,2019,04,27
46,Not good value,"We arrived at this hotel with great expectations....our welcome was lovely. We did get escorted to our room and were pleased to see such a fabulous view over the harbour.
Pros......great view, 
very comfortable bed, 
nice shower
Cons......bathroom sliding doors didn’t close properly, 
no luggage rack or anywhere to store cases, 
coffee maker only had 2 coffee pods provided and these were only replenished once more on our 4 night stay,
The towels were clean but past their best and not what I expect in a luxury hotel,
The restaurant was very disappointing....on our day of arrival, we had lunch and dinner...the menu was the same for both services which seemed a little odd and this menu didn’t change throughout our stay. The food was ok but nothing spectacular.
Breakfast had a good selection of food and they were very accommodating of my need for a gluten free diet.
But...as the weather was nice, we chose to sit out on the terrace...the cushions on the chairs were so wet, my husband had to go and get changed...why did no one bring them in over night when it was raining?
The staff on reception were very friendly and helpful but it came as a huge shock on our checkout that we were charged over €4 each time they called us a taxi.
When I found out how much my husband had paid for this hotel I was horrified! It certainly isn’t good value for money.",3,2019,04,12
46,Perfect business hotel,"Amazing views, nice business facilities (had a 15 person meeting for 1.5 days), good staff, great restaurant.

Ill keep having business meetings here for certain!

Only minor downside for this hotel is it is not super easy to walk to other places in Barcelona, youre up on a beautiful hill though! Also, its slightly expensive (but still cheap compared to others in europe!)",4,2019,04,04
46,"Great staff, amenities and fantastic restaurant","I got lucky and got a room on the 6th floor with a beautiful view. The room was great with toiletries from L’occitane.
The staff was great all around, from the front desk to the bar, restaurant and meeting room.
What really stood out was probably the restaurant. We had a 7 course lunch with all plates totally exquisites.

I would definitely go back. Fantastic place !",5,2019,04,02
46,Lovely hotel....amazing views!,"Cannot recommend this hotel enough! The views are stunning and the hotel is beautiful from start to finish. The staff were so welcoming and helpful with every question and their recommendations for places to visit etc. I was equally hesitant as i have never visited a 5* and i am not one to dress up for every minute of the day. This hotel and staff however were very welcoming and did not make me feel out of place. The food was beautiful and i cannot recommend the lunch enough, the breakfast was equally brilliant with such a large selection of hot and cold food. The balcony was perfectly situated with panoramic views across Barcelona. If i make my way back to Barcelona, this hotel will be the top of my list!",5,2019,03,31
46,Enjoyalbe Hotel,"I opted to stay at this hotel for it's views of the city and sea.  I stayed for 3 nights.  Upon arrival was greeted by a front desk agent.  Check in was straightforward and easy.  A glass of water or glass of Kava was offered upon arrival.  

I thought the hotel was nicely decorated and elegant.  There is an indoor pool which I did not use.  However the warmth and smell of the pool and spa filtered into the atrium in the middle of the hotel which always felt warm.  It was rather lovely and comforting.  

My room was spacious and in the front of the building.  I did not have a balcony but I did have a door that opened and I was able to see some of the old facade of the building and out to the sea.  It was lovely.  

The room was clean, although as one other reviewer mentioned there was a lot of dust in the ventilation system.  I didn't use the ac or heat so wasn't worried about it.  As another viewer mentioned I also had some difficulty wiith the hot water in the shower.  Although on my last day there I figured it out (user error!).  I loved the big tub in the bathroom and the amenities.

I used room service, which was fast and delicious.  I tried to eat one evening outside on the patio but service was super slow and so I left.  The server was extremely apologetic and I understood as there were a lot of large parties.

Another day I ate inside and service was efficient and delicious.

I had a car and they offered free parking.  Walking into town includes walking down a hill and back up when you return.  For some this could be a problem but I found it to be a great way of getting some extra exercise each day.

I would stay here again as I enjoyed the ability to get out of the business of Barcelona after sightseeing and coming back to a quiet and relaxing spot.",4,2019,03,16
46,Spa,"Visited the loccitane spa today, with my mother and sister. We were a little late and the girls behind the counter were so helpful in anything they could do to assist us. Sabine and Cecelia helped us so so much in choosing our products, these and the other girls in the spa made our visit so comfortable and relaxing, nothing was too much or too little to ask! Would definitely recommend even if just for the service alone! Facilities were lovely and clean too.",5,2019,03,10
46,Hotel Miramar,Excellent location.  Wonderful and helpful staff.  Good and spacious and clean rooms.  Really enjoyed the stay.  The lobby is spacious and very nice terrace.  Spa is a must visit. I will visit again.  The city is a true tourist destination  ,5,2019,02,08
46,"Hotel was good, but..","Hotel is really nice located, amazing views to Barcelona and sea. Very quiet location. Staff  was very friendly.
Room was comfortable.
Hotel is bad maintained. Ventilation/air-condition in my room was full of dirt, they bring me destroyed towel... Please see attached photos from my room.",1,2019,02,06
46,Ideal for couples and lazy time,"Very nice staff and servicr. Good viewpoint and park around the hotel. Nice rooms, good food, good bathroom with large window from which you can see moon while bathing (they give L'occitane bath bomb). Very nice pool.  Nearly perfect example of how 5-star hotel should looks like.",5,2019,02,05
46,Ms,"Amazing hotel and staff very friendly we had top floor and the balcony was great, the view was just the best full glass window, definitely will return and defiantly recommend, pool and jacuzzi lovely to relax in after a day of walking",5,2019,01,04
46,Extraordinary Five-Star Hotel Experience,"Excellent experience. From the moment my cab pulled up to the hotel entrance, I was greeted by Armand. He walked us to the front desk and helped us check-in. We had just debarked our cruise ship and got to the hotel early. Normally, check-in is not until 3pm however, they checked us in early without hesitation. I was highly impressed with the whole staff and their willingness to go above and beyond. Highly appreciative of the extraordinary service. 

We were able to shower and head out to tour Barcelona for the day. The room is gorgeous. The bed and bed linens are extremely comfortable. The tub and large walk-in shower is very relaxing. They provided complimentary water and chocolates. Also, a robe to borrow and slippers. Wish I would have booked more nights here. 

The Garden and city view is gorgeous. The hotel is on top of a mountain. Conveniently located near an air tram. Or you may catch a cab, hop on and off bus, Uber, or subway. We chose the subway which, was only $10 for 10 stops and multiple-persons. I just needed to walk to the bottom of the hill leaving from Parallel “M” subway station. From there I could hop on and off to each location starting at La Rambla and checking at the gothic Catedral of Barcelona. 

This hotel is like a hidden gem. I’ll definitely be back and will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone I know who will be visiting Barcelona. 

Overall experience is 5-Stars! 

Thank you Miramar Staff for a wonderful experience. 

P.s. best cappuccinos I’ve ever had.",5,2018,12,08
46,Nice and friendly ,Very nice and friendly hotel. The front desk was always pleasant and helpful. The hotel is on top of a mountain about half a mile from the city. If you can't walk they have cab service 24 hours. I highly recommend them,5,2018,12,08
46,Execelent views and high class bar service,"we stayed at the hotel for couple of days for business meetings and we get surprised with the hotel location, views and awesome staff they were very lovely.
We want to mark extra the bar service was really good, high class cocktails. The barman ""Daud"" he made us feel at home, few hotels have a that good bar and a bartender.

We will come back.
John",5,2018,11,16
46,Fantastic,"After an extremely disappointing stay at the Fraser Claridge Hotel in Paris, we stayed three nights at the Miramar.  Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted and welcomed by friendly staff, checked in and taken to our beautiful room.  If the Frazier is rated a five star, then the Miramar is a 10 plus.  Beautiful room, great view of the city, easy to get around the immediate area, whether walking, by taxi or any tour options you might want.  Although we arrived on Sunday and the on-site restaurant was not open, we were able to quench our thirst and have some delicious tapas in the lounge area.  The rooms are thoughtful and well layed out, the shower is a walk-in with multiple options from rain shower, with installed jet massages, luxurious!  The bed was very comfortable and since my wife and I are over six foot in height, one of the rare times we both slept without discomfort.  We opted for the buffet breakfast and almost anything you can imagine was available, including eggs your own style or an omelet made to order.  I cannot recommend this hotel any higher and would definitely return for an even longer stay.",5,2018,10,27
46,1 day excellent stay - 5 star service/hotel,"We loved staying at Miramar in Barcelona. It was such a beautiful hotel, we were only there for 1 day pre cruise and wish we had extended our stay not only to enjoy more of the hotel but to also see more of Barcelona. Check in was very smooth, the girl at the front was super sweet, everyone provided excellent customer service. It felt like we were staying at a Four Seasons resort with the outstanding service I received. I would definitely come back and the price was very reasonable compared to the hotels we stayed in Paris/Rome pre and post cruise. We walked to a nearby restaurant down the hill, can't remember the name, and from there walked to a nearby metro station which was also super easy to get to/use.",5,2018,10,25
46,Was to be relaxing end to a cruise !,Whilst the room was excellent with views over the city our experience fell somewhat short of a five star hotel.  We only stayed for two days but would have expected the bed to be made.  Complained to Reception about the constant gun fire which went on for hours only to be told- yes there is a shooting range next to us but its not every day all day !!!  I really dont go on holiday to hear this sort of thing and why would a hotel of this stature allow this.  Breakfast was varied and plentiful but afraid the omelette was a little to raw for my liking and was almost clucking,3,2018,10,23
46,Day at Barcelona ,"The location is superb in the mountain. you feel like out of the city though it’s five minutes away. The hotel was clean , staff were friendly , exceptional restaurant crew and manager during breakfast.
",5,2018,10,20
46,Fabulous Location.,"In submitting this review, I should record that we were not guests at the hotel, and therefore, I cannot comment on the experience of staying there. However, because we enjoyed a walk through the gardens and the grounds of the hotel, which are set in a spectacular location overlooking the harbour, I thought it appropriate to recommend this as a place to visit and enjoy a stroll, before perhaps taking a cable car down to the port area. (See ""Teleférico Del Puerto, Avinguda Miramar"" for further details relating to the cable car rides.)

Although we did not have first-hand experience as guests of the hotel, it is a most impressive looking building situated in a great location, and if I was to visit Barcelona again, I would certainly consider staying here.",4,2018,10,17
46,5 Star Quality,"My husband and I absolutely loved this hotel; from the customer relations service to the beautiful scenery that surrounded us. I began communicating with the hotel prior to our arrival for restaurant recommendations, reservations and activities. They were so prompt, professional, and extremely kind to us. They certainly went above and beyond to make our anniversary extra special. Ignasi from guest relations continued to check in on us throughout our stay, offered to assist with additional planning, and even sent us cava the evening of our anniversary. He truly was wonderful to work and sincerely appreciate his hospitality. The hotel grounds were incredible, the gardens were so well kept, and our room had a perfect view of the ocean and city. It sits up on Montjuic, but it’s so close to the city center. The cable car is steps away from the hotel and you can take it right to the port/beach. It was perfect for us because we didn’t want to be around all the night life on Las Ramblas, but it was a short walk or cab away. We will certainly be back, and can’t say enough about the hotel and staff. We also observed high quality service with other guests, and a few weddings were also at our hotel during our stay. They never seemed overwhelmed and did everything they could to accommodate us. We will be back!! Thank you Ignasi and the team! 
~Mr. Elliott White & Mrs. Lindsay White ",5,2018,10,15
46,Worst customer service ever,"Far from a 5 star hotel this hotel has consistently been one of the worst I've stayed in for service. From a room that smelt of faeces to then being moved to another room above a wedding which went on until 4am this place continues to amaze. We were told by customer service that we could not be moved and that they thought we should be able to sleep through. If you could upload videos to TripAdvisor most of us would agree this is rude customer service. We were told that at least 10 other rooms had complained but that they could not wake the manager because it was deemed not important enough for him to be woken. 

For a hotel that claims 5 stars it's incredibly bad and when things go wrong things go wrong really badly. Like a Ryanair cancelled flight",1,2018,10,06
46,Planned my proposal here,"I contacted Hotel Miramar through email about a year before I planned to stay at the hotel regarding my intention to propose to my girlfriend here.  Without ever having gone to Barcelona or ever going to this hotel, I decided on proposing here because it had balconies in every room and a view of Barcelona and of the sea.  I was able to get into correspondence with there Booking department to set up everything I would need for my proposal.  Bringing a large group (16 total) to surprise my girlfriend was no easy task.  I requested specific room placements as to keep them out of view and to provide us with a room that had a beautiful view to act as the backdrop to my proposal.  I must say the hotel followed through on all of my requests and we had a very successful and happy proposal.  The facilities themselves were amazing and the view from our room was perfect.  Everyone working in the hotel was very helpful and very friendly.  They also hosted us for our post engagement dinner and my friends and family had a great and memorable time.  Thank you Hotel Miramar Staff for helping me pull of my proposal and treating my family and friends with the best service.",5,2018,10,02
46,Exceeded expectations ,"If I had to give advice for improvement , I would have nothing to say.  We absolutely loved this hotel.  Staff we very helpful and friendly. The room was amazing with a great view, very comfy bed and had everything we could possibly need.  The location was very close to the port and beach.  ",5,2018,09,30
46,Had much higher expectations.,"When booking this hotel, my husband and I slugged on this one. The pictures on the website were beautiful and I was incredibly excited about the run in the middle of the room. When arrive the service was good, not superior but good. Check in was a little after 3:30 because our room wasnt ready. This was fine we just explored the grounds which also were not amazing. The gardens have not been kept up with which was disappointing.
Upon arriving to our room, i was very disappointed. It was evident that the pictures on the site were taken many years ago and they room have not been kept up with. 
The tub was so dirty, the room smelt musty, the shower was dirty, not to mention I placed my shampoo in the holder and it broke immediately. The walls were dirty and I was so setbon taking a bath but by the time my husband was ready to start the water he hadn’t to pick out about 5 hairs before hand. 

The only positive I can say is that the speed for breakfast was way better than any American continental breakfast so that was a pleasant surprise. 

The location to this hotel is NOT prime if you are wanting to explore Barcelona. 
It’s not close to much of anything expect Ramblas. 

All in all not worth the price AT ALL!",2,2018,09,30
46,Hotel with great views of Barcelona,Stayed here for one night before boarding a cruise ship. The staff are very friendly and knowledgable. The rooms are spacious and well maintained.  Breakfast was tasty and could be eaten outside overlooking Barcelona.  I would stay here again for a longer break in Barcelona,5,2018,09,23
46,MR ALI,"Lovely and wonderful hotel on top of the mountain with very nice view helpful and pleasant staff. The rooms are very clean spacious. The gym and the swimming are clean and modern. Nice place will recommend to every one.

46,"Beautiful Visit to the Spa, Pool and Restaurant","This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Me and my husband had an exquisite visit. The staff was incredibly friendly, so kind and delightful. The pool is beautiful, overlooking the port and the Montjuic cable car. The service is prompt, the food is delicious (though not specifically Catalan). We had such a wonderful day!",5,2018,09,19
46,Beautiful Hotel to stay in,Myself and my girlfriend had just back from a week cruise around the western Mediterranean. We had decided to spend a day in Barcelona when we arrived back to see more of the city. We hadn't taken in to account how nice the hotel was and found it very hard to leave the hotel and do any sightseeing.,5,2018,09,18
46,Fantastic Stay at the Hotel Miramar - Barcelona,"My wife and I just completed a very memorable stay at the Hotel Miramar in Barcelona.  It was our first trip to Spain and we wanted to find the very best hotel.  We did!  The location was perfect with beautiful views of downtown Barcelona and the sea from our spacious balcony.  And yet it was only a 10-15 minute walk down the hill into the city.  We enjoyed the swimming pool each afternoon following lots of activities in town.  But undoubtedly the very best aspect of Hotel Miramar is the staff.  It didn't matter if our request was for a taxi, a cup of coffee in the morning, help with reserving a museum tour, or recommendations for a good restaurant, we were always met with a smile and a genuine willingness to help.  And while the entire staff was fantastic, I must take a moment to recognize the efforts of Ignasi in Guest Relations.  He was extremely professional and always ready to provide impeccable service.  We had several memorable experiences that he recommended.  Our next trip to Barcelona will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Miramar.",5,2018,09,18
46,Very pleasant stay,"Lovely stay in this hotel in June. Beautiful location with amazing views. Our room was just as expected and definitely up to a very high standard. The pool area was my favourite. 
I would recommend a visit to this hotel.",4,2018,09,17
46,Stunning Hotel and amazing views of Barcelona,"My family stayed in this wonderful hotel, set part of the way up a hill overlooking the City of Barcelona and the Sea! The Hotel is exquisite. The rooms overlooking the city are beautiful inside. The best thing about the hotel are the staff, they are very friendly and helpful and you always feel welcome and that they have time for you. They make you feel at ease and will answer all your questions. They make excellent suggestions. The outside pool and rest area is very pretty and restful.
The hotel is a 1 minute walk from the Hop on Hop Off Bus tour service around the city which you can use all day to get to the city or to restaurants in the evening. 
I loved this hotel and will definitely return!",5,2018,09,14
46,"Noise and more noise, dirty, pool was rented out","The location is beautifull: full view over the harbour and big parts off Barcelona from Montjuïc. Front desk is very friendly and helpfull and a good breakfast buffet with eggs and coffe a la carte, therefore still two marks. But the noise: the engines and loudspeakers from the ferry's, the ventilation, the airconditioning, a strange noise every half hour in the room, 1/4 ""bangs"" every 10 to 15 minutes at the swimming pool, the people in the rooom above, the people outside (there was a honeymoon party during our stay). The swimming pool was hired for a honeymoon party, so closed on saturday from 5.30 PM - We hate that: we also pay to use the pool! The cleaning staff was rude and it wasn't decent cleaned, nor decent turn down service and no new towels in de the evening. Also the area around the pool and the pool  was not good maintenanced. No shuttle to the city (and you're up the mountain), strange building due to the old front that they have to keep: our sitting space had a tiny small window, we had a ""dining"" room next to it in the ""new"" part which looked like a meeting room. Shower couldn't open completely end very strange concept for the floor: two big tiles with lots off space so you could see the drains, it smelled awfull. We didn't want to use the bath, it looked dirty. General cleaning from the room was very poor. This is definitively nog worth five start Grand Luxe!",2,2018,09,12
46,PROFESSIONAL TEAM,Good command of communication. supporting team. good food and view.  my clients every moment. and quality of everything was good. service team were kind and quick. they also made many favors on the event they.  we will definetely come back for future events.,5,2018,09,11
46,Lovely hotel!!,"Absolutely loved our stay at Hotel Miramar, the staff are so friendly and very accommodating. Our room was lovely and the breakfast and lunch was really yummy! The staff are always happy and help and gave us brilliant suggestions. The location is perfect too we walked everywhere only took a cab on a few occasions! You will love your stay here we will definitely be back.",5,2018,09,09
46,Outstanding,"We have just returned from spending our 40th wedding anniversary at the Hotel Miramar.  About a 15 minute drive from the airport the hotel is up a very steep hill which gives a fabulous view across the city.  We were met at the door on reception and seated with glasses of cava while we were checked in. We were assigned room 512 which had a lovely super-king sized bed opposite glass doors which led to a very big balcony.  The bathroom was the same size as the bedroom area and featured a bath tub, walk in shower, and separate toilet area.  We celebrated our anniversary night with dinner in the hotel restaurant.  We shared a starter of beef carpacio and tuna poke.  My main course was turbot and my husband had confit of suckling pig.  Both  were tasty and very well-presented.  On other evenings we walked down to the harbour and dined either in restaurants there or in the many squares along the way. We used room service for breakfasts so that we could make good use of the balcony area and look out over Barcelona.  We very much enjoyed our stay in this hotel and it made for a fantastic memory for our special wedding anniversary.",5,2018,09,08
46,Super hotel!,"We stayed for one night in May. It was just to spend the night after our flight was cancelled. This is a really nice comfortable hotel with very nice rooms. Bed is super comfy with nice duvet. The room also had a very comfortable sofa and a writing desk. Our room had a super spacious balcony, you could have a party there. The bathroom is also super and very spacious. Separate toilet. There is both a very big shower area and a very nice bath tub. And oh, the toiletries are from L'Ocitane!!!
They have an indoor pool but this is a bit of a let-down. Looks dirty/moldy and needs updating.",5,2018,09,06
46,Beautiful Experience,"The moment you arrive at the hotel, you are greeted by a perfectly chilled lobby complemented by luxurius aroma. Moreover, you are welcomed warmly by front-desk staff who make it their top priorty to transition you seamlessly to your wonderful room which ever room that might be. We first visited in June, and loved it it so much, we convinced the family to go at the end of August!

The hotel's aesthetics are beyond magnificent, making it difficult to choose between staying on the grounds or venturing so closely into town. The views from the hotel are second-to-none. The staff: from the front desk, to the bar, to the spa, to the pool side - all ensure that you are well catered and looked after

Whenever we asked for anything; we never heard the response ""no"", instead we were told; wait there, let me check... or here you go!

This hotel is everything it promises to be and much more, It's definitely worth an annual visit.",5,2018,09,01
46,Our home away from home when in Barcelona.,"First class facility! Front desk staff outstanding - welcoming, friendly and beyond cooperative. Our room was beautiful. Restaurant and food services exquisite.  You'll find the breakfast buffet amazing.  Walking distance to La Rambla and other major sites. Ease to and from airport a very big plus for us. Can't wait to get back to our Barcelona family at Hotel Miramar!",5,2018,08,26
46,Graceful elegance,"This hotel is located near the city center, but apart from it, in a beautiful location with awesome views.  The surrounding (public) gardens hark back to a mid-century golden age of European tourism.  The staff is clearly well trained to handle requests with grace.",5,2018,08,17
46,Family weekend,"That was the second stay at Barcelona Miramar hotel. The first experience we had 5 years ago and it was wonderful, now, the service was worse, the cleanliness also, only hot water in the shower and the staff was not helpful and friendly. Unfortunately we didn’t enjoy our stay as 5 years ago, but location is amazing, view from the window and park also, very comfortable with children",3,2018,08,15
46,Good hotel with exceptional staff,"When we initially arrived at this hotel and the staff were very helpful and could not have been more welcoming. Room seemed nice although our room didn't have the best view overlooking the entrance. Hotel seemed nice and good sitting out pool area. 
We had a few issues with not getting turndown service. We ate in the bar area one evening and had problems with the food. First off all they did us the wrong food and then food redone but wasnt very warm. Once again the staff were very helpful and did put it right and also eventually sorted out the turndown service. We also had one evening where we were told that the pool will be shut at 4:30 PM due to a wedding which we found to be annoying as we wanted to sit out late afternoon. Once again the staff did help us.
We had a few problems but the staff were exceptional in trying to sort out any issues we had. 10/10 for the reception staff only marked the hotel down due to the issues we had. 
If you want to use the sauna or steam room make sure you go and switch it on before you want to use it, or phone the spa and ask them",4,2018,08,14
46,Marvellous Montjuïc on the Hill,"We arrived in Barcelona by Train from Paris to this gorgeous hotel and found the most friendly check in staff, Sara who welcomed us and made us feel so loved. Thank you. We were staying here a week. That’s one of the longest on holiday that V and I have been in one property. We chose this place but you have to go there to see the wonderful Miramar. Perched on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. This place was a Palace in the 1920s, which was later renovated into the beautiful Miramar that is luxurious. The sit out had lovely furniture and we ate dinner in the coffee shop outside. My husband says the steak was fabulous and I enjoyed a prawn pesto pasta. Later, we walked around the magical gardens with stone statues and smiling seagulls flying above us. Our room had a breathtaking view of the Ocean, the Port, view of the Barcelona City below. We had the biggest balcony in the entire hotel which could have been as big as a cricket pitch! We sat out absorbed everything. The  Pool and sun chairs were perfect. Ekatrina, at the Hotel Reception was so helpful, always smiling while I asked her so many questions. V and I watched the Semi Final & Final in a local pub in Barcelona and came back so happy that France had won and so were all the staff, apart from one rude male staff who had the audacity to say Shhhh and never smiled in the days we saw him...Anyway, he alone can not change our love for this place at all, the breakfast was fresh and warm, the Room Service was very limited but nonetheless they did the best they could. We just have to come back again. 7 days and it’s not enough. Martinez a lively restaurant on the Palace Hotel grounds is outstanding. The Hotel has a Cable Car station, we had to try it, it took us down close to the Barcelonette Beach. 
Taxis is easier. A trip to La Roca Village was booked for us at the Hotel and we had planned excursions in Girona, Costa Brava. 
We shopped, walked around Passige de Garcia, V went to Camp Nou one day on a Virtual Tour and actually in the FCB dugout. We lived the week like locals and went to pubs, had hair cuts and fell in love with the Casa Batlo designed by Gaudi. The Miramar is a perfect escape from anywhere. Such great service overall. We shall be back when I plan Seville! Marvellous Miramar on Montjuïc. ",5,2018,08,01
46,Unbeatable gorgeous view,Absolutely beautiful hotel with a lot of character and the main lounges face the port with a wonderful walkway and gardens. Luxurious and comfortable. Good for business trips. Breakfast was good but it was the same spread every morning - a little more variety would have been nice since I stayed 4 nights.,5,2018,08,01
46,really nice place,"we have spent a really nice moment in thé hôtel. The room was exactly what i was expected for a 5 stars hôtel. Only few remarks : check in process is taking too long because there le Only 2 desk and we had to wait until 3pm To have the room. could be nice To have some rooms ready for early arrival.
next little thing : the glass on the water wall really need To be replaced because full or limestone.
the personnel of the hôtel is really friendly. ",4,2018,07,23
46,Best hotel in Barcelona,"They greeted me with open arms, I have been travelling around Europe on work, and the elegance of the hotel is stunning. Absolutely amazing hotel! Highly recommended! The staff are extremely friendly and nice about every possible option they had and could possibly offer. Will definitely be coming back!",5,2018,07,23
46,Great views,"I chose this hotel as it was walking distance from Palau Saint Jordi, so if you're attending a concert there it's possible to easily walk home afterwards.

What I discovered was that the hill upon which it's built is a really interesting suburb of Barcelona in it's own right. The views are incredible however, it was the variety of things to do ""up there"" that suprised me.

Joan Miro Centre, Olympic Stadium, Cable Car station and it's very pleasant to walk around.

Martinez is also here and an excellent place to eat.

The hotel experience was also good. Checkin was very efficient and as my room wasn't ready, I was shown to the spa and changed to go for a swim. The pool was really nice to spend an hour or two on a hot day.

My room was availible at 3pm. Not sure why it couldn't have been made ready earlier, given I'd arrived three hours earlier when the hotel was not a full capacity? My only minor complaint.

The rooms are huge and the bathrooms excellent.

I left early the next day and I'd recommend booking a taxi at any time of the day, as the hotel is a little way out of the centre.

I was travelling on my own, so not sure I would return with my wife but it was a great experience none the less. If you've been to Barcelona a few times before and fancy a change or just in town for a short overnight stay and aren't up for the heat of the city, this hotel is an interesting option.",4,2018,07,23
46,Great stay,Very nice hotel. Stayed 2 nights pre cruise. Hotel is up a hill and out of the main centre. But has fantastic views as a result and we enjoyed exploring and walking in areas we may not have visited otherwise. Breakfast was good and all staff friendly and helpful.,5,2018,07,23
46,poor,"Disappointed in 5* hotel

Locked out of room on two separate days advised to wait by reception staff and questioned about if we had anything important to do ? Yes - just trying to relax actually 
Injury to foot due to treading on broken glass in pool
Not at all impressed 
Won’t be coming back in a hurry",1,2018,07,19
46,It is really nice stay ,"I came from the cruise and I had a bad experience with other hotel in Barcelona, this Hotel is amazing for me the most important is the staff they are really friendly all of them and the one she helps us more her name is Natasha , I can’t say anything about the other I didn’t save there names but seriously the hotel is nice .
Thanks ",5,2018,07,16
46,Quite good,"Rooms ok but maintanance could improve quite alot. Not only in the rooms where we couldnt close the showerdoor resulting in flooded bathroom when showering. 
But the pool area was quite discusting and water not suited for swimming, water was full of things you dont want to swim in... music by the pool was for the staff, not clients, most suitable at a rave party.",3,2018,07,15
46,"Out of the way and untrained staff, expensive for the product","Boutique hotel a bit out of the way
Staff not trained as per 5 star standard
Have ""manyana"" attitude.
On making a point they don't take it seriously and make the customer feel small (reception staff) !!
Pool food is only reasonable and expensive for what is offered.
Perhaps a bad day!!",2,2018,07,14
46,A Perfect Stay,"This hotel is a gem and I really shouldn't be telling other people about it ;). Stunning views, friendly staff, excellent service. We went here for a 1-night stay but were wishing we could stay a month. Location seems a bit far away but it's really quite close to a lot of the sights.",5,2018,07,13
46,Most Amazing Staff,"I do not take time to write reviews; however, in this case I am making an exception. Let’s start with changing the name Miramar to Martinmar. Martin worked the front desk and his service was top notch. Moving on to Jonathan and Ms. Venezuela (you know who you are) the food and bar service, the laughs and extraordinary meal..... Thank you. You all made our experience and our trip special we will be back to that hotel for sure. (Spa was amazing and very relaxing also the piano music by Sebastian just a wonderful night)",5,2018,07,10
46,GREAT hotel with the perfect location in Barcelona,"This is the hotel that has it all. it has very nice rooms, great staff, fantastic location, large pool with a pool bar in a somewhat private garden where you can relax and enjoy the sun. the city centre is only minutes away in a taxi, or you can take the cablecar directly down to the Barcelonetta (beach) area directly from the hotel (!!). Absolutely NO need to stay at La Rambla - this hotel is my abolute preferred when I am in Barcelona. Perfect if you are a family on holiday, as well as on business.",5,2018,07,10
46,Amazing staff,"What a fantastic hotel to stay 
From the check in where I was met with a warm smile from Ekaterina who was so very helpful through my stay thank you. 

As for the bar staff Anais who makes a great cocktail ,Irene again chatty and attentive,  Pauline always smiling  and not forgetting Shauna for a young lady on 6 months placement at the hotel,she was a credit to the bar and waitrering team attentive and working with a professional manner throughout hope she will get the recognition she deserved from the Hotel 

In all a fabulous stay clean tidy and a great spot for views. I hope to be back soon 

Many thanks I would recommend

46,"BIG hotel, beautiful VIEW, but tiny room ... and STEALING left unsolved!  A SHAME!","HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT 
   We were here for 1 night, just a stopover between France and south of Spain. 
   We had chosen this hotel because of the comfort and the size of the Premium room they showed on photos; also because of the extraordinary view over Barcelona harbor.  
   We needed peace and quiet.
   After nice welcoming at front desk, we were showed our room. We felt disappointed because of the tiny size of the room. On the photos, the room looked really enormous, with bathroom far from bed, clear passages between bed, desk and chairs. Now, we had entered a common size room, bed too close to the desk, and especially no luggage rack! so we had to open our 2 suitcases on the floor, obstructing passage to bathroom and out side.. It was neither worthy of 5 STARS declared, nor corresponding to the photos we had been shown... We went on the terrace and filled our eyes with the great view...
   Above all, we were tired. We didn't complain, so we did not go out for dinner and we asked one dish, wine and dessert through room service. We left next morning, about a quarter to noon. When taking out our suitcases, cleaning crew women were working next door. 
  The day after, I realized I had forgotten in the cupboard 1 jacket and 1 pair of trousers - white linen - not branded articles, just nice old clothes I liked very much. I had stretched on hangers, to get them good when going down for dinner, as it was our first idea.
    II call the Hotel: they say they will send somebody to  search; They call back, next day: Nothing has be found. They go as far as to ask me if I did not make a mistake, if i'm sure that I have forgotten those two things... I tell them that I am absolutely sure. That they must look over what corridor camera have filmed; that they can make use of means of knowing that I cannot. I insist on their responsibility.They promise me to initiate an investigation. Four days after: a message on my phone: they had looked on what was recorded on cameras, but they didn't find anything... 
   What would have occurred if I had put on my jacket and my trousers and if we had gone down to the dining room? My wife had jewels. We would not have put them on the safe just for 2 hours dining! Those jewels were likely to be stolen! 
      WHAT TRUST can we have in people in this hotel, as a matter of fact?
      Is it natural to consider that sort of subject: the ""rats d'hôtel"" as we say in France (hotel thief), in a 5 STARS hotel, and to pa such a price, 370 € ? I have looked over other reviews on  Miramar; I found 2 other complaints about stealing, even more important than mine. The cleaning crew looks to be from an external company: how could they be really controlled?!The staff promised, but came up with NOTHING. What spineless headship! My wife and I are really angry.
      What a pity! Or rather: What a shame!",1,2018,07,01
46,Luxury at its best!,"I stayed at Hotel Miramar last weekend with a group of girls for a friend's 50th birthday, its a fabulous hotel!  The rooms are beautiful (exceptional attention to detail) and the beds are the best I have ever experienced on any holiday.  The setting is lovely, great pool and spa area and whilst it is about 20 minutes walk to the centre, the view is worth it!  Naturally, the cost of food and drinks at the hotel are what you would expect of a 5 star hotel (e.g. Gin - 16 euro, Coke - 5 euro, small salad or sandwich around 15 euro).  It is the perfect place for a special celebration, ideal for couples.

The only negative point I would make is that the bar service at the pool is rather slow during busy periods, perhaps additional staff would be worth a consideration.

I would fully recommend this hotel for a truly luxurious feel to your holiday.",5,2018,06,19
46,Beautiful hotel with views over the City and the Port,"What a lovely Hotel, situated in an elevated location with fantastic views, we chose a Premium room and it was well worth it.  Spacious, beds really comfortable, nice shower and nice products.   The staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble.  We made full use of the jacuzzi, hammam and sauna.  The gym was well equipped.  The outdoor pool was nice too.

Thanks Miramar, we had a lovely stay and hope to be back soon.",5,2018,06,13
46,4-day stay @ Miramar,"Beautiful located with a fabulous view over all of Barcelona. The rooms were large, elegant and classy. Seem that most have a balcony! The SPA was amazing with indoor pool, jacuzzi, two saunas and relaxation room. Ignasi - client manager - was amazing! From the second we stepped in to the hotel to the second we left he made sure everything was top! Top class Ignasi and Miramar. Will for sure rebook for my next stay in Barcelona. ",5,2018,06,09
46,An incredible stay in beatiful Barcelona,"I cannot express enough how much my mum and I loved our stay in this hotel. We stayed for 5 nights in May (wish it was longer!) It was our first time in Barcelona and I'm so glad we picked this hotel to stay at. Our room was really lovely, clean and bright, with beautiful views across Barcelona - the beds are so comfy and there were L'Occitane products in the hugeee bathroom (the bathtub and shower were both AMAZING) We had a massage treatment in the Spa. It was wonderful - professional staff with the use of L'Occitane products.
The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful, especially Ignasi - who made our stay even better. He is an asset to the hotel.
Our stay was B&B - which was a buffet style - hot food, cereals, fruit, pastries etc - really good and set us up for the day. 
Some people have said the hotel is isolated - I disagree. It's location is set away from the hustle and bustle of the city but you can easily access it either by the Hop on Hop off bus tour (the stop is literally yards away from the hotel. You get a slight discount if you book it through the hotel) or you can walk down through the beautiful gardens (approx 10-15 mins) or get a taxi .... It cost about 6 Euros to get from the hotel to the bottom of La Rambla (so long as you don't order the taxi via the hotel as it will be more expensive).
My mum and I are already making plans to return to hotel Miaramar because we can honestly say it is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. Thank you! Danielle & Cheryl x",5,2018,06,03
46,Excelent Hotel and Restaurant,"With unbelievable views of the city, the restaurant offers excellent fish and rice, not the paella style, but a tasty and updated version of it. A perfect place to rest during luch time and have, maybe, a healthy siesta.",5,2018,06,02
46,Okayish,"We stayed at Hotel Miramar for 3 nights, during our wedding celebrations. For being a 5 star GL, we thought it lacked some efforts, specially when it comes to final touches in the room (decoration and devices in general). There was a weird smell around the toilet area that resembled that of cat pee, although it was probably just humidity (room 324). The terrace was great, fantastic views. The bed was comfortable, and so were the pillows. The staff were friendly and specially Ignasi who helped a lot through our stay. On our first night there was some noise outside coming from a different venue and Ignasi made every effort he could to make sure we wouldn’t be bothered by noise again, and it all went fine. We didn’t have time to try the spa sadly but it looked amazing. ",3,2018,05,18
46,Beautiful hotel but a bit isolated.,"Hotel was beautiful.  Lovely balcony. King sized bed.  Unique tub.  Only regret was that we were staying only for one day.  the only negative was that we had to wait until 3:00 to get into our room.  Have to agree with other reviews that this hotel is way off the beaten path.  However, we had done all of our sightseeing previously so we were content to enjoy the hotel.",4,2018,05,08
46,Trying to be a fine hotel but need more efforts,"Located on Mount Montjuic, the hotel is a bit isolated with the main attraction. You have to either take a taxi or walk for about 25 minutes to reach anything.

I stayed 3 nights at the Miramar. One nice thing is that you are seated while you are checking in. It is not a very big hotel, but with nice view over looking the harbour. The layout of our room is interesting that the oval shape bathtub is placed in the middle of the room, with separate shower and toilet. The bathtub is separated by a sheer curtain from the beds. It is a room layout perfect for loving couples, but not for 2 working colleagues. The room is spacious, and bright enough. Bed is comfortable. The cleaning ladies are not very well versed in English, but are hard working. 

The hotel backyard has direct access to the garden behind the hotel. There is a small cafe on the left serving lunch and drinks, and a restaurant on the right serving seafood meals. There is also a cable car station leading to the convention located on the other side. The reception introduced us to a local restaurant on the first night of arrival, but the restaurant is the worst of the whole trip.

The breakfast is probably the worst of all. Both the restaurant environment and the food is 3 star at most.",3,2018,05,02
46,Going downhill,"Have stayed twice before and have to say this time we had very poor service. Firstly they had no reference to our reservation. Secondly they put us in a standard room even though I had booked and paid for a premium room with a view of city or sea - we had a view of the pool! Got fobbed
Off by being told it was because we wanted a twin room! We got our room moved but not easily - had to wait until 3.30pm the next day.  Breakfast was very very poor. Standard gone completely downhill - especially for what they charge. No one to open the door for you and see you into a taxi like the other 5 star hotels in the city. Wish I had followed my instinct and stayed at the W Hotel - we went there for a drink and they were 100% more hospitable and the cost of staying, with breakfast, would of have been the same.",2,2018,04,10
46,Great Hotel on Montjuic...,I have stayed at this hotel during the past 15 years and it has changed management a number of times. The latest management seems to have done a better job. The hotel has a great view of the city and there are number of good restaurants nearby. Try Martinez which is nearby.,4,2018,04,10
46,4 day stay at hotel Miramar,"The Miramar hotel is located on top of Monjuïc, which means you get a very nice view over the city. On the other hand it means you have to descend about 400 stairs to get to said city and worse.. reascend them when you want to go back to your room after getting sunburned like the hated white straight male you are if you are me. Luckily there's a cable car which you will not be able to use if your dearly beloved is afraid of heights. Taxi it is. 

The 5 star designation of the hotel means little to no hipsters (they rather stay at 3 star hotels which charge more for ""industrial"" rooms) but more people with nosejobs, chihuahuas and annoying posh children. The facade of the hotel at the top of the hill looks 5-star but unfortunately the main entrance is located on the side and the hotel owners havent bothered with a proper paint job since the last prisoners left the castle of Montjuic. 

I'll have to write a bad review about booking.com too as it doesnt show me in my confirmation mail which type of room I booked but anyways it was the one just under the ""suite"" in level of luxury. The setup was very nicely done with a terrace showing us the city, the sea and what EUR 50 more a night couldve offered us in the form of the W hotel. No complaints though, the rooms were spacious, the general finish was good and the seperate design bathtub allows for two people to enjoy it at the same time. 

I liked the ""open bathroom"" idea, allowing you and your loved one to watch your favorite series from the bathtub, but the devilishly difficult to open curtain which seperates the bedroom from said bathroom proved almost too much for the helpful hotel clerk, who spent over 10 minutes trying to open it just enough for us to enjoy the room as displayed on the website. 

The wellness and spa is very minimal and the indoor pool doesnt offer a view outside, while the outside pool doesnt open until May and honestly is not that big either when looking at the number of rooms. 

Conclusion: you want to upgrade your room to my unknown level (thanks booking) so you at least have space, a nice terrace with amazing view and the design bathtub with open bathroom because honestly that is what makes the hotel earn its 5 star status. Dont book it for the wellness and dont expect the lavish luxury of the W which probably gives you more return per buck. 

But then again you only need to step out of the door at the W to be greeted by 25 beach salesmen trying to sell you blankets, mohito, beer and agua nonstop so all in all we were very happy on our mountaintop.

One last piece of advice: dont just look on the booking.com (again those guys ruining it) map view as you will think the hotel is located very close to the sea. Well... it is, if you're a bird.

Disclosure: writer is not a bird and does not enjoy an overdose of stairs",4,2018,04,01
46,Great hotel!,Great hotel on the mountain overlooking Barcelona. Nice big rooms. The terrace of the hotel has the best view of Barcelona. The swimming pool looks great and the restaurant is top of the bill! From the hotel you walk easy down to the city center and a few meters outside the hotel there is a small restaurant which serves the best white sangria and tapas.,5,2018,03,25
46,Not worth it,"I don't normally rant on reviews as there are always points that aren't going to be up to eaveryones standards, but I'm a little frustrated with the experience we have had here. Ill start by saying the location is great and hotel is nice on the eye. 
Onto the not so good. We arrived Friday after being at a conference in Salou for 4 days, heavily pregnant with my husband so we could have 1 last relaxing break before the baby is here. We picked this location as it slightly out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the city, with beautiful views and what looked like a lovely hotel. 
My first compliant is my husband used the hair dryer (to dry his beard) on the first night and it shot sparks out and set his beard on fire. We told reception as we went out for dinner and they laughed... apologised said they would replace it whilst giggling and asking if we were serious!? 
My 2nd compliant is that every morning we had a lie in. Making the most of being child free plus I'm exhausted, house keeping knocked on the door starting at 9am every day. To me this seems a little early. And it wouldn't be once. Saturday morning they came round 7 times in the space of 1 hour. And lastly, this is the point that frustrated me the most, the hotel is next to the police firing range. Every day, all day intermittently every 10 mins or so they fire off 20 rounds or more. It is as if someone was stood on the balcony letting off fireworks. Even on Sunday. I fell asleep to this noise and was woken by this noise every day. We still have 1 night here and I have never been more excited to go home. So what was supposed to be a relaxing (expensive)Babymoon weekend has turned into being more stressful than just relaxing at home. 
We stayed in a deluxe room 411 that over looked the waterfall. Avoid it.",2,2018,03,25
46,No way 5 stars....sorry.,"I have booked this hotel in advance (actually 4 months) for the marathon weekend (my husband took part). To our surprise they put us in a room at the REAR at the hotel!!! No views at all!!! ( we payed a DELUXE room (at the time of the booking they did not say anything, selling as an amazing views) and I also did not complain at the moment (after 12 hours driving and a pos operative state I just wanna to take a rest!!!)no one escorted us to the room.....no porter....YES we carried our luggage!!! Another surprise...have you ever seen a 5 stars hotel without coffee machine or tea maker in the room??!! well, they manage not to have!!!just a minibar....another fact very stranger that they keep the ""iphone"" station (a very old one, my mobile do not fit in there) in a chain!!! Came Sunday the day of the marathon....and another surprise....when we arrived very tired from the event the room WAS NOT DONE!!! it was around 2pm on Sunday!!! that means no fresh towels no toilet paper.....the housekeeper told us that they give priority to the rooms that put the sign at the door?!?!?  WHAT?!?! At the shower another surprise...suddenly the water was so hot that you could cook an egg!!! we have to call again the front desk.....the plumper came immediately and solve at a half the problem....he said that we should open the cold water at the sink and the shower together to have a ""warm"" water.....LOL!!!when I tried to take a bath.....I realize the tap was done at the opposite the cold is hot and the hot is cold??!!???and when I had a closed look to the floor at the toilet I saw many many many ants around.....OH MY Godnesssss!!!!!At night specially on Friday/Saturday we could hear the piano till late at night. The restaurant was OK not impressive for a ""5 star"" as the bar at the lobby as well. The staff was very attentive.This definitely is not a 5 star hotel.....not at the range that we are used to.Maybe a five stars in Spain.....????or maybe the stars make part of the logo?!LOL!!!Location is nice at Montjuic but you have to take a taxi every time that you want to go to the city. Parking was ok; we could park the car just vis à vis!!!Last but not least....they did not change the sheets during our stay once!!! As long as I concern 5 star hotels change daily....and check the room twice a day......not at this one!!!Conclusion: Definitely NOT a five stars at any meaning!!!Sorry!",1,2018,03,14
46,Amazing Location...Helpful Staff...Delicious Food...Dancing Until Dawn...An Unforgettable Experience,"As we reflect on 2017, a few momentous occasions come to mind.  We hosted a party for friends and family to celebrate our wedding, and could not have been happier with the Hotel Miramar and especially our coordinator, Aïda Guerrero.  My husband and I live in New York, and had to handle most of these details via email.  Aïda answered every email promptly and thoroughly and helped us every step of the way.  She was knowledgeable, professional, and an absolute pleasure to work with.  And this goes beyond Aïda and can be said for everyone at the Hotel Miramar who helped to make this party so special, from the amazing chef to each staff member.  We would not hesitate to book another event at the Hotel Miramar, and would hope to have Aïda taking the lead.",5,2018,02,27
46,Stunning hotel and staff.,"With great views of the port, the city and sea, this is a perfect hotel to stay at. Our room was large, clean and spacious with comfy beds and a great view. The staff were friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. We visited the Spa and had excellent treatments. Sipping wine in the lounge overlooking the terrace, harbour and sea at the end of each busy day was sublime.",4,2018,02,27
46,Great View Hotel,"Last week we spent two nights in this hotel - me, my man and our 10 yo son. The most perfect on this hotel is the stuff, they are very very very much great professionals and so nice people who are willing to help you with anything even it is not related to the hotel. All the receptionist are so well trained and very nice! I would like to point out to the barman in the lobby bar - he was very accommodating and I felt there like a princess.
Regarding the room - we had a suit with the greatest view I have ever seen, the terrace pleasantly surprised me....oh; however, the designer really never spent there even a night .... the bedroom is beautiful at the first sight but before anyone enters the bathroom which is just a half meter next to the bad with a glass door and you can't go there during night if you don't want to wake up your room mate..... The same problem was in the living room where our son had a bad next to the main doors and one night there was a piano concert or something and we could hear it very loudly through the doors.
Furthermore, it is too shame they don't really care about details - visible bolts in the wall especially in the bathroom, rust and water stone, and not nice gaps in the shower...dust all around....
Maybe this will help them to think about it, after all, they are really great and the hotel could be even more amazing!",3,2018,02,23
46,Beautiful hotel with stunning views ,"We were here on Friday 9th for a drink when en-route to our restaurant.  It is a beautiful hotel and being up on Montjuic it has stunning views over the city, harbour and the Mediterranean. A real taste of luxury. ",4,2018,02,16
46,Lovely,Lovely hotel.  Great views.   Close to cruise ship ports!  Only down side was they didn't allow us early check in and we arrived from the UK.  Otherwise very posh.  The restaurant was nice too.  We are arriving for a transatlantic cruise so it was very convenient.,4,2018,01,06
46,Great visit,"We went for a weekend trip to Barcelona and the hotel staff was wonderful. Martin in particular spent a great deal of time making us feel welcome and recommending places to eat and go out. He took the time to understand what we wanted to get out of the trip and gave us thoughtful advice which was highly appreciated!
The hotel is lovely and the rooms were nice though we did not get quite the view we were hoping for. If you dont mind being away from the crowds of Las Ramblas and getting a taxi at night then this is a great place to stay,",4,2018,01,05
46,Expensive but not always perfect,The hotel lobby and reception are at the back of the hotel almost in the basement. The first room I was appointed had a nasty smell and no WiFi reception. I was moved to another room after insisting that the one I had wasn't satisfactory. In the new room the bath and sink were behind a curtain in the sleeping area. The bath looked great but turned out to be almost unusable since very slippery and not giving any support. The breakfast was good but not exceptional. All in all not perfect for a 5-star expensive hotel.,4,2018,01,04
46,Wonderful stay,"We stayed during X-mas at this pleasant hotel. Staff is very kind and helpful about where to visit, where to dine etc. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Variety of selection for breakfast. We didn’t have chance to dine in the renovated restaurant but heard positive words about it.
We will remember the smiling faces of people in Miramar hoping to come back again. Muchas gracias.",5,2017,12,26
46,VERY DISSAPOINTING,"Just spent 2 nights for Christmas here, then decided to move to another real 5 star hotel. 
THE GOOD: 
Good location, in beautiful Montjuic park, 30mn by foot to Las Ramblas. Very close to the National Museum and the Miro Museum. Very nice private gardens and terrace overlooking the harbor.
THE BAD: 
Not a boutique hotel but a large impersonal building without any charm. The staff is polite but a bit robot like and not well informed about what's going on in Barcelona. They do need more training (with the exception of Carlotta and Robert who were very pleasant and professional)
The Spa is underwhelming, the interior pool is cavernous; the tiny hamman has to be set up 20mn before you use it; and I never found the sauna...Not a cozy, welcoming, serene place like, eg, the spa from the Gran Florida Hotel.
THE UGLY:
---Shapeless, worn mattress that prevented us from sleeping ( the day after they changed our room and explained that mattresses are being changed little by little...So make sure you request a room with a brand new mattress)
---Noisy: even though you're away from everything,  there is noise coming from the small plaza by the hotel, which is a favorite of party goers in Barcelona  who come around midnight in limousines to revel and enjoy the view. It did not last all night, but a couple of hours is enough to disrupt your sleep! (with windows closed as we were there for Christmas...) 
---No electricity in our room the morning of departure: Could not dry my hair nor charge my phone! I called the front desk but nothing was done about it...

All in all, a very disappointing hotel, not deserving 5 stars! 
Giving new guests a glass of cava upon arrival isn't enough! 
There are much better places in Barcelona. 
We won't return!",2,2017,12,26
46,Wedding,"Amazing venue with fantastic ambience, the staff couldn’t do enough for us!! The drinks and food were outstanding , certainly worthy of the five star status . I’d like to pay a particular tribute to Daud our barman who really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome. His attention to detail in his work was commendable , I’d definitely recommend this place if your budget allows it!! ",5,2017,12,03
46,Honeymoon stay,"The day when the dream comes through. It was a very special moment for us and I must say that the team at reception helped me a lot with organising and prearranging. My wife was astonished with the flower arrangement ( I have booked the romantic package) and the details to our needs. The weather was a bit cold so we didn´t managed to enjoy he beach much (but for October what can you expect..). Food is delicious and Barcelona has so much to offer. We have tried the Forestier (if I am spelling it right) and really nice experience but I would recommend places in Barceloneta area and take a nice walk afterwards along the beach. 
Hotel is clean, well situated and really close to airport too so no need to spend fortune for taxis. Mr Jonathan at reception was exceptional and helped me to find the best room with an incredible view on the top floor! Highly recommended. 
Thank you Hotel Miramar for the experience and hopefully will be back soon.",5,2017,11,30
46,breathtaking views and friendly staff,I stayed in a premium room and I absolutely recommend it. The room was very spaceful and I was able to enjoy wonderful views from the comodity of room.  I also would like to highlight how friendly and attentive the personnel is.,5,2017,11,30
46,Last two nights in Barcelona,"We chose to stay in this hotel in the last two nights in Barcelona.

Pros
1. The room is spacious and the scenery from the room is spectacular.
2. The food at the restaurant is very tasty and the service is excellent
3. The sauna area is super nice, yet is quite small. It can only allows max 4 people inside. Luckily, there was only my boyfriend and I everytime we went there.
4. The bathtub in the room is spacious where can fit in two persons
5. The service at the front desk and conciege is perfect

Cons
1. The location is remote where only taxi can reach the lobby of the hotel
2. Privacy of the room is not quite high, especially we were staying at a lower floor and facing the stairs.
3. Do not expect to swim at the swimming pool because the swimming pools are super small where people cannot really swim.

Overall the hotel does not worth for the price but still it provides a comfy stay.",4,2017,11,29
46,Great Place to Stay in Barcelona!!,"What a great hotel. A little off the beaten path but very, very nice. 5 star quality for 3.5 star pricing. The staff is very courteous and helpful. Everyone really cares and wants to help. The food in the lobby bar was good and the wifi is excellent.",5,2017,11,05
46,Stunning hotel ,"Loved this hotel, very peaceful, ideal for couples or families. Great view of Barcelona . 
We stayed as wanted to be near to Olympic stadium as we were watching a concert. 
Friendly staff and gorgeous rooms . ",5,2017,11,02
46,Super relaxing stay. Wonderful hotel & surroundings,"From the moment we walked into Miramar, we knew we had made the right choice of hotel to stay in Barcelona. The staff were, helpful, courteous and friendly. We had an early check-in time which meant the possibility of having to leave our luggage and wait for our room to be announced as ready. During check-in we were first told the room was not available. Within the short time it took to show our passports, the room was made ready and we were able to unpack, relax and unwind. 

The bar main area is a lovely feature offering a good selection of drinks and a choice variation of tapas style food. There was also a small selection of free candies at the end of the bar, much to the delight of our young daughter.

The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. My only small gripe would be the choice of TV channels. With today's technology, it would be relatively easy to supply channels such as Netflix and other international streaming programs. This would be a welcome addition if it could be made available.
The only negative point was our in-room phone did not work. 

The hotel itself is fabulous. A mixture of international holiday guests and business professionals all mix together very well in this beautiful establishment. 
The views from the rooms and the terraces are superb. You are treated to a unique high point vista overlooking Barcelona.

A huge recommendation has to go to the staff of the Miramar who were always friendly, accommodating and helpful. This goes for the people serving at the bar to those running the front desk. 

We spent a total of 3 nights at the hotel. We're a family of three. For us, this was a perfect short city break thanks to the ambience, comfort and care provided by the hotel. If you want to spend that little bit more and treat yourself to a great experience, we highly recommend the Hotel Miramar.",5,2017,10,27
46,Incredible from start to finish,"My wife and I visited Hotel Miramar in October 2017 with our four year old son. From arrival to departure the hotel was just perfect. The staff were friendly and helpful on every occasion - entertaining my beginners Spanish before breaking out into fluent English! They directed us, arranged our airport transfer and couldn’t help enough. 

Our room was amazing - we booked a premium room and were stunned by how perfect it was. A huge comfy bed (plus an extra single bed for our son), a balcony overlooking the beautiful city and a bathroom fit for a king!

The hotel has both indoor and rooftop outdoor pools - I think we were the only people using either! The Spa was a perfect place to relax and unwind and the restaurant and lounge were ideal to spend a few hours soaking in the sun and views with a cappuccino or a cocktail!

Breakfast was immense as tends to be the case and a must when travelling with children. If you want to venture out of the hotel the open top bus stops just outside the hotel and will take you all round the city.

In the evening the night time views are breath-taking. People travel to the area just for the views, so we counted ourselves lucky to have them going to bed and when waking up.

My only critique (and this is being ultra critical) is that the restaurant lunch and dinner menu is quite small (two pages) which offers limited choice. The food is tasty and great for perhaps one meal for adults. We used the lounge menu more for our son (who’s not quite the fine food connoisseur just yet ;-D)

We would both return without hesitation - the hotel richly deserves its 5 stars. Great venue, great views, great rooms, pools, spa and staff to finish it off.

Highly recommend",5,2017,10,25
46,luxury rooms on top the Montjuic with the most gorgeous view of the city,We were staying at the premium suite for the first two nights and moved to deluxe room for the third night. Needless to say the suit was spectacular with the Marina view. But th Deluxe units were as beautiful. The details in the room furniture was of excellence. The staff are super friendly. we were just a bit disappointed about the breakfast. I would expected more options and fresher alternatives that would match the excellence of the rooms and other services.,5,2017,10,24
46,Beautiful,"We've just got back from a 3 night stay at Hotel Miramar and could not fault it. The hotel itself is beautiful, well looked after and immaculately clean.

The staff are amazing - all reception staff are friendly and offer good advice on things to do in Barcelona.

Pool area was lovely and inside spa/pool were great. 

The hotel is a bit out of the way so you will need to use a taxi to get around. However, the tourist sight seeing buses stop right outside the hotel.

A special thank you to guest relations for organising cava and chocolates for my birthday - it was much appreciated! 

Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,10,05
46,Premium room with Marina View,"I have been in Barcelona numerous times and this is my first time staying at Miramar Hotel.
I can only say this hotel is one of the best in the area if not the best if you consider the open space and luck of traffic you get here,  and on top of that, it's by the Montjuic a must see destination, don't forget about Tibidabo too.",5,2017,10,03
46,"Top of the Montjuic, best views of the City and the Port","We stayed in a premium suite and had the corner unit. It was the best view in the city, We could see the port from one side and the city from the other. I would say that if you are not into visiting each and every palace in the city or Europe, this pretty much covers it and you do not have to visit Montjuic. You can still take a cable car (located 5 minutes walking distance from the Hotel), that will take you around the mountain and to the palace. We did not take it as we are more of City experience folks and we have seen enough palaces.

Now the best part: When I booked the hotel first, I was horrified that this will be an expensive commute to central areas like La Rambla, Passage de Garcia, Gothic Quarter etc. So basically, each trip costing around 20 EUR one way. However, a big shout-out to my man ""Robert"" for giving us an overview of how to get around in the city. Montjuic is connected to the Barcelona Metro/Subway system via another train called Funicular (5 minutes walk from the hotel). So all you have to do, is get into the Funicular and you are part of the Metro system, i.e. you can use the same ticket for metro. That was a big win for us, because we already had Ola Barcelona - 3 day Metro Pass. One thing to keep in mind, if you are changing metro lines, be sure to leave some gap in your schedule. We had a 3 year old and a stroller so sometimes, catching the subway and going to places like Gothic Quarter (you need to change the metro line for that) would be around 45 mins. Yupp, going to Montjuic to anywhere around the city will take time, but we think that the amazing views and the hotel experience compensated for it. You can also skip the Funicular and walk downhill yourself to the nearest metro station (~12 minutes).

Food wise: I won't rate it at the top. I have had better meals and breakfasts at 4/3 star places. But we usually go for the city experience and eat out, se I did not mind it. The location will make you forget that piece. I will however take 0.5 points away for that (the 4 points overall rating that I am giving, is actually 4.5 points).

Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our son really enjoyed the place because of the amazing views (cruise ships, tug-boats etc.). We even went for evening walks around the back of the hotel to catch some really stunning views of the city. You can actually see the entire city from there (i.e. top of Sagrada Familia etc.) Barcelona was the last destination in our trip to Spain. The hotel experience really contributed towards us enjoying the last 3 days instead of feeling depressed because we were nearing the end of our trip.",4,2017,10,02
46,Not more than a 3-4 star hotel,"Expected that ""little extra"" for a 5 star hotel and we spent a lot of money for our honeymoon. Would more say it's a 3-4 star hotel. 

Couldn't get fresh vegetables for breakfast when we asked for it(!!!) We're vegetarians and there was a lot of meat at the buffé.

We had a suite, but no fresh flowers or any other nice details.

No good cleaning in our room. Chocolat on the floor for a whole week. 
Had to ask for fresh wine glasses. 
Had to ask for new pillows to our balcony chairs, they had suddenly disappeared.

Nice and helpfull staff in the reception though!",2,2017,09,29
46,Absolutely recommend,"We had the most amazing stay at Hotel Miramar Barcelona. We visited for my birthday and there was a bottle of cava waiting on ice for us in the room. The room was gorgeous, just like rest of the hotel, and we had an amazing view over the sea. We arrived from Madrid before check-in time so our room wasn't ready, but the staff was SO friendly and SO helpful. They securely stored our bags and helped us to plan lunch and book tickets for Park Guell until our room was ready. They also helped us to reserve a table at the hotel's restaurant, Forestier, to celebrate my birthday. I'm really disappointed that I can't remember their names; otherwise I would shout them out by name because they were just so wonderful.

The only tiny gripe I have is that service to the room was very, very slow -- if they came at all. We had to call for an iron, for more toilet paper, etc., and the iron took at least an hour to be delivered (I had to call twice more) and I eventually had to snag a roll of toilet paper from a maid's cart (sorry!).

Other than that, the service was impeccable and our stay was amazing beginning to end. We recommend the hotel to all of our friends traveling to Barcelona. Thank you!",5,2017,09,28
46,Great views of Barcelona and the ocean. ,"Last year we stayed in town close to all the shopping. This hotel is about a 20 minute easy walk to town. It sits on a hill overlooking the city. Our room was nice with a small patio. The bathroom offered separate tub and shower. On the first day we came back from shopping and a complimentary bottle of champagne, cookies, chocolates and orange juice were in our room. All the staff were friendly and very helpful. Breakfast offered lots of good things (if you eat outside please feed the wild kittys). Only bad thing was we had room service the last day and the food was horrible! I do recommend staying here though.  ",5,2017,09,27
46,Excellent hotel with excellent service!,"Beautiful hotel and the best view over Barcelona.
Always 100% serviceminded staff.
We where there on our honeymoon and the staff took real good care of us.
The location was great and the taxi's are always near when you need to go to the city.",5,2017,09,25
46,Weekend en couple,"Excellent stay at the Miramar combining an business trip with a romantic weekend for 2.  Impressive hotel with great facilities and amazing views.
Outstanding quality breakfast with lots of choice.
Room for improvement : the portions are small in the restaurant if you choose to stay for an evening meal.

We will definitely return to the Miramar.",5,2017,09,21
46,"Amazing place to stay, specially for couples!","I just came back from a 7 day business trip in Barcelona and I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel. The service is just impeccable!!!! I have traveled many times in Europe and although I love the places I visit, I find their customer service and standards are not the same as in North America. I was proven wrong here....100% satisfied. Will definitely be staying here next year for my trip again!",5,2017,09,16
46,Beautiful Hotel + Amazing Staff,Upon arrival we were greeted with the sweetest staff who offered us up Cava as we checked in.  The room was beautiful and the hotel had everything you needed.  The staff was incredibly attentive and helpful. We enjoyed the L'Occtaine Spa and room service.  The hotel is in Montjuic and is a bit of a cab ride into the main parts of Barcelona but it honestly isn't an issue.  Cab rides are incredibly affordable and they're super easy to come by!  Miramar has some of the best views of the city hands down.,5,2017,09,13
46,Perfect stay in Barcelona. Amazing Hotel,"This is a top hotel in Barcelona. I have been visiting Barcelona once a year since 2004 and I have found Miramar to be a par above the rest - fantastic and friendly staff, very comfortable rooms, amazing location, and views. Never been happier in a hotel and I would highly recommend property this to all types of travellers.",5,2017,09,13
46,Room with a view ,We had excellent service and great food from the restaurant for room service.  Highly recommend for anyone.  We spend 2 nights here before our cruise departed.  Gave us a great chance to see the city and to get a taste of Barcelona.  ,5,2017,09,09
46,Only hotel on Mountjuic,"This hotel is about 30 minute walk from the city if you are fit! Fantastic views over Barcelona with a cable car to take you to the port. Spacious, clean rooms. Not all of the staff are as accommodating as they could be. Great bar food and bar staff. A slow service in the restaurant. The swimming pools on the smallish side but with an added bonus of having for sale the L'Occitane products with spa treatments. Overall, I would rate this as 4 star as not up to par with other 5 star establishments I have stayed in, but saying that would stay again.",4,2017,09,08
46,A Hotel To Remember...and Re-Visit,"Hotel Miramar is quite the place to be, high atop a hillside overlooking the great city of Barcelona.  Cleanliness is excellent, staff members are eager to help with whatever you may desire, and always do so with a smile.  The rooms are slightly tight, but well-appointed with comfortable beds.  The shower is almost a religious experience:  multiple shower heads, great water pressure, steady temperature.  Very hard to get out of.  The only negative was the air conditioning, which, although cooled the temperature in the room, failed to properly dehumidify -- leaving a damp feeling in the room and in the bed linens.
The lobby bar is the highlight of the hotel.  Elegant atmosphere with generously portioned, expertly-prepared cocktails.  The bar offers numerous premium and top shelf liquors, and free snacks.  The bartenders are well-trained and really seem to take pride in mixing a cocktail, rather than just slinging booze.  A particular standout is evening bartender Ignasi -- courteous, elegant, and quite charming.  He is also fun and interesting to converse with while sipping libations.  He is a rare find and a particularly memorable member of a wonderful team.",4,2017,08,29
46,Far from the city but great views and relaxing time,"This hotel is located not too close to the city, but the views and grounds are really good. If you want to just relax and take in great views this is the place to be. We were embarking on a cruise so we wanted to just chill. There is a cable car station just close by that can take you upwards the mountain to get some greater views.",4,2017,08,25
46,Solid choice out of city centre ,"We enjoyed staying at the Hotel Miramar. It's location out of the city meant that you get a great view and you're out of the hustle and bustle. The staff were also very helpful.

My only complaints are that the fit out in the rooms are a bit worn and tired, the restaurant is over priced (which is annoying because of its remote location you can't readily walk down the road), and it was very noisy around the pool from what sounded like a firing range.",4,2017,08,23
46,"Great view, problematic location","The hotel has a great view but the transportation to hotel is a bit problematic.
If you dont care walking too much, paying for taxi or trying to catch up hop-on hop-off bus; it is a great hotel.
The rooms are very clean and luxury ; the staff and service are also what one should expect from a 5star hotel.",5,2017,08,23
46,Visit to Barcelona,"Great stay at Hotel Miramar.  The location is perfect as its quiet, but a short taxi or 20 min walk into town which suited us perfectly. Special thanks to Daniel and his F&B team who were superb and looked after us very well.",5,2017,08,23
46,"Beautiful views, but horrible shower mold and smells","My husband and I planned to stay here for several nights while on vacation. We wanted of course a room with a double bed. When we arrived we were put into a room with two single beds. This was not ideal so we called reception to see if we could change rooms. Unfortunately even though they said they would look into it, we never heard back. Additionally, the pictures of our room online showed it would include a big tub. Our room only had a shower. The bathroom smelled so bad the whole time that we had to open the bathroom door as little as possible. The shower has almost floating floor tiles and around the tiles is a ton of blue and black mold. This ruined our trip as it was disturbing and smelled horrible. I would never have expected this at a 5 start hotel and wished we hadn't spent so much on this room. We will not stay here again.

This hotel does has some positives such as the views and balconies. Note the shooting range is quite loud by the pool. Pool is pretty but to reserve sun beds you must spend 80 euro each day.",3,2017,08,10
46,Great hotel with great staff,"This was a great find by my wife.   Great 5 star hotel with extremely friendly staff.  Rooms are clean and very nice.  I will come back again.  It is away from the beach but great location.  You can take a cable car to the beach for 11 Euros.  Great buffet breakfast.  Great restaurant and across from another great restaurant. Nice city and port view.   Small indoor and outdoor pool.  
",5,2017,08,05
46,Too far away from the city center - poor public transportation,"Just to start with-this is a very nice hotel with a very nice view of the city. It also have a very nice garden with a pool. So if you are up for just staying at the hotel and relax this is a good place. If you want to explore the city and do it by walking, cycling or public transportation this is NOT the place. It is located on top of a hill and it is too far to walk into the city/beach etc. I also have to say that I expect more from at hotel in this price range. They forgot our roomservice breakfast and to deliver the iron we ordered. And just to mention, go for the roomservice breakfast as the buffet is 28€ per person.",3,2017,08,02
46,"Beautiful hotel, but bad service","It's a nice place, clean, with a great view in front, but the service is bad because the team is not enough for the clients. In the terraza Hecho it seen dirty  table during many hours. The food I don't like me. I hope a best service.  ",3,2017,07,22
46,Good but far,"Me and my family (including 2 small kids) enjoyed a lot staying in the hotel. Personal was very friendly and upgrated our room to the better one when they couldn't fix quickly water dropping over our bathtub. They have also presented us a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates from the house and made all depending on them to make us happy with our vacation.

The restaurant is not cheap but very good. I recommend to book with breakfast included, it was a really good buffet.

The only complain is the location. We got a fake impression from the booking sites that the hotel is lying on the seaside and that it is close to the city centre. None of these is true. Hotel is located on a high hill over the sea on the age of the city. The sea is easy to see but there are just boats, no beaches. The distance to the centre is about 30 min of quite fast walking. ",4,2017,07,19
46,Classy and Modern,"The hotel is located in the area of Montjuic, just some 15 minutes walking from the city center. The views from the restaurant and the terrace are amazing!

The rooms are nice and well distributed, they have a nice bathtub, big king size beds and also have a lovely balcony to let the nice summer breeze in. 

The service is fantastic! The front desk staff is always on point and are willing to go above and beyond to solve any issue that you might have. It was always a pleasure to be greeted by them and to see their smiling faces day to day. 

Overall a fantastic property! Top choice, I could not recommend this hotel enough. 
Until next time!",5,2017,07,12
46,Syria,"The management of this hotel I believe are so greedy,  Although they probably have the best view on Barcelona but they are not spending enough to maintain the quality of the hotel in terms of rooms and facilities, Ive been with my family recently, the rooms are very old, the lockers are almost falling down.
The carpet is not clean ,the same poor quality is in the bathrooms, each and every glass board in this hotel is broken starting from the hotel main entrance up to the rooms.
Finally and to be fair,  The staff is very friendly and helpful
My advise.. Dont go to MiraMar Barcelona until you hear the hotel .was renovated as I am doing the same.",3,2017,07,07
46,Top Class!,We were gifted a one night stay here from a relative in a Deluxe room on the top floor. The room was perfectly designed and very spacious with a beautiful bathroom. To top it all off we had an exceptional view of Barcelona city and the sea from our large balcony. Definitely a place to stay again!,5,2017,07,04
46,Superb. ,"We love this hotel. It is starting to look a little tired in places but the location and the staff are superb. 

On the hill top, at the end of the cable car ride from San Sebastián beach it has superb views, is quiet but you can see all the city,  is 5 mins from las ramblas and yet peaceful, tranquil and ...it has a great pool. Two in fact. One outdoors, one indoors. 

Lovely gardens,  great restaurant and another couple nearby just in case you need them. 

Nothing for the kids though but the city is so close that it's hardly a problem. 

This was our 4th visit and we will head back next year. ",5,2017,07,03
46,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel was everything we wanted and more. The staff were fantastic and couldn't have been more helpful.
The hotel is a great location with a 20 minute walk to the marina. We paid to upgrade to a premium room and was so pleased with the room and fantastic views over the marina. The pool area was beautiful, only downside is that the pool closed early for a wedding which was very disappointing as we wanted to spend the day by the pool area as was only there for two full days. That said, there was plenty to do around Barcelona and the staff were more than willing to recommend where to visit. 
Would love to stay here again, and would even contemplate having my wedding here after seeing how lovely the other wedding was! 

Breakfast every morning was lovely and the bottle of bubbles sent to the room to celebrate my boyfriends birthday was a very welcome gift. 
",5,2017,07,02
46,Definitely coming back,"Amazing location in Montjuic, with view on the sea, nice parc where you can enjoy a meal or a drink and then have a walk. Professional service, very attentive, good food and cocktails. We are definitely coming back !",5,2017,06,24
46,Interesting experience,"The photo of the elegant pink pillared facade of the hotel gives a misleading impression - on both sides and behind it is an ultra modern establishment, very sleek inside, the exterior rather harsh with black facings.  The outlook over the port (where we could see our cruise ship moored) and the City to the north is lovely. It's about a 15 minute walk downhill to the Rambla, the centre of life in Barcelona.  Our room was on the south corner of the 5th floor with the aforesaid view and also overlooking the garden and large, inviting swimming pool.
Very spacious and well appointed room, comfortable bed. Regrettably we found that the phone did not work, despite 3 visits from hotel personnel, so we had to go down to reception several times to ask for things. The light on the large balcony also was inoperative . The fine big walk-in shower leaked profusely onto the bathroom floor and, first time, into the the corridor of the room. After that, we placed towels strategically to stop the flow. The woodwork round the base of the bathroom door was rotten, so this must have been a long term problem. In the morning, despite several attempts by both of us, we could not get the big blind over the bathroom window to go up. A chambermaid did it with a special ""tweak"".

At breakfast we experienced a pathetic attempt at English tea - warm water poured into large mugs, tea bags which burst on being stirred!  We know that the Continentals 
by and large find tea-making a bit problematical, but one might reasonably expect that a 5 star hotel would have mastered the art by now!  We had coffee instead.

We reported these problems and had an interview with the charming manager who promptly cancelled our ""extras"" bill - a few drinks, and he sent up a bottle of wine. He seemed inclined to make a deduction from the bill but said that as we had booked through Booking.com this was too difficult. I usually try to book with hotels direct for this reason. 

The terrace in front of the pink facade, overlooking gardens and the port, is very pleasant for drinks.  Provided you can avoid the problems we had, it's a lovely place to stay.",4,2017,06,16
46,One week in luxury,"Great room with very comfortable large bed and a large balcony overlooking the whole Barcelona. 
Great bartenders who made us Gin & Tonics. The breakfast was great but the dinners a bit tastaless. Will return!",5,2017,06,11
46,A Spanish retreat above the fray,"A modern hotel with all the amenities, including L'Occitane en Provence products. Jonathan and Cinzia made sure everything I needed was taken care of and more. I hid away in a corner of the  Forestier restaurant eating lunch and working for hours, with a view of the harbour. In the afternoon I went for a swim in the indoor pool and then a sauna and spa. The whole event was relaxing and enjoyable. ",5,2017,06,03
46,Not what we expected from a Five Star Hotel,"We arrived at about 3.30pm very hungry and ordered a snack from the bar. After waiting about 45 minutes the food appeared but it was just warm not hot. No reason given for the delay. We sent the food back and replacement food arrived which was not particularly good.

When we returned to our room after an evening out we found that the room had not been turned down nor the towels replaced. Unfortunately the room phone was not working and I had to run down to reception. They told me that the battery in the phone was not working, my response was that it wasn't my fault and the receptionists response was that it wasn't hers either!!
Sadly after another 20 minutes of waiting for the turn down service I had to go back to reception to remind them that we were still waiting.

The rooms were quite spacious but on close inspection were not particularly clean and indeed the settee was soiled.

We would not choose the Miramar again, there must be better options in Barcelona.",3,2017,06,02
46,Weekend at the Miramar,"We had a 2 night stay in the Miramar, they were kind to upgrade us to a suite. The hotel has a view overlooking Barcelona - 20- 30 min walk down to the city , a taxi ride on the way back . Rooms were modern spacious, good size terrace overlooking the bay. There is a pool area with lots of open space to chill out, we also like the spa - with various water features. It is a great choice if you want to stay away from the hustle of the city.",4,2017,05,20
46,Miramar Hotel is awesome,"We stayed in miramar for a business conference and it felt like a holiday, firstly the location has a beautiful panoramic view over the city, with luxury rooms, great service, a spa, lovely food, overall brilliant experience! 
It is a bit of a walk into the city, but absolutely worth it.",5,2017,05,17
46,A worn down hotel ,"This is a five star hotel....hmmmm... Maybe Spain doesn't care of the quality. Yes they have a pool, but it is really dirty. Yes they have a gym, but there are not aircon in there. My room had dark curtains but with 100's of holes. The bed will soon break and in the shower there was loose pieces on the floor. If this hotel would say they were a three star, I would give them much higher rating because it is not super bad, but they rate themselves as five star then you expect so much more. The location is good. Great view and you can take the cable car to the beach or just a short walk to the city. Breakfast is ok, you can order your own eggs but they don't tell you that and sometimes it takes about 20 minutes for an omelette even if you are by yourself in the breakfast. Every time I had a glass of wine they pour outside. Also on all my friends, almost a bit funny. They do not know how to do it. This hotel could be so much better with some maintenance and shaping up the service. ",2,2017,05,13
46,Great visit ,"We visited Hotel Miramar for 3 nights in May as part of our honeymoon. Hotel is in a great location for exploring Barcelona. It's about a 15 minute walk to La Rambla. 

Staff were all very friendly and helpful and sent a bottle of champagne to our room compliments of the hotel. The food in the restaurant was very good we enjoyed a lovely meal on our first night and again looked after by the hotel with a lovely dessert wine given to us with our dessert. Breakfast was excellent and had a wide variety to choose from.

There is an indoor and outdoor pool. We visited early May and unfortunately were unable to make use of the outdoor pool as the weather wasn't the warmest. There is a nice indoor pool and sauna that we made use of and is complementary for hotel guests.

A cable car runs from outside the hotel to near Barcelona beach. Worth a trip great views of the city.

Overall we really enjoyed our trip and hope to return again in the future. If you like a little bit of luxury when you travel Hotel Miramar is worth a visit. 

",4,2017,05,08
46,"Great hotel, fantastic view, minor shortcomings","We spent 3 nights in one of the suites and enjoyed it very much. All staff has been exceptionally friendly and the rooms were large and welcoming. In particular the large private terrace with view onto the harbor is fantastic. We also enjoyed an evening in the small bar with great live piano music. Given it's a 5 star luxury hotel, the spa area could be somewhat more spacious and there's been an ugly stain on the ceiling of our room close to the a/c which should be repaired. In the end we were very happy with our choice and would like to come back to Miramar again.",4,2017,05,06
46,"Delightful stay, helpful staff, perfect!","First of all, thank you to the many TripAdvisor reviewers who recommended to get a room with a balcony.  We had a lovely balcony with views of the pool and ocean, with many lovely cups of coffee and glasses of wine enjoyed on the balcony.  Comfortable beds, great L'Occitane toiletries, awesome buffet breakfast.  It was a wonderful stay and I would go back here in a heart beat.  That being said, keep a few things in mind, to get to any of the ""sites"" in Barcelona (Sagrada Familia, Picasso Museum, Park Guell) you will be taking a cab.  The only things close by and walkable are in the Montjuic area such as the Miro Foundation and Magic Fountains and it is still a long walk uphill to the hotel.  Order a cab the night before and they were always there in the morning to get us. They are reasonable ($+/- 15 euro to get anywhere. We did have one issue with getting a cab on a Saturday night...but oh well.  That would not deter me from staying here again, it's a lovely hotel.  Walkable (down the hill) to Carrer de Blai which has tons of great tapas spots.",5,2017,05,04
46,On Top Of Barcelona,"We stayed in this hotel for about nine days and was pleasantly happy with its location over looking the town of Barcelona and the harbour.
We stayed in room 602 with very good view of the hotel gardens and the harbour. The room is of very good size including the bath room( Shower only) and toilet. The air condition is of very reasonable standard and well maintained. The bed is very comfortable, but the House-Keepers were very unprofessional and did not provide a standardised service including replacing used toiletries', emptying the coffee machine and replenishing used coffee, sugar and water on daily basis. She was very rude when my wife came back to the room to pick up an item while she was cleaning the room. She did not remove the tray/trolley from our room which we used the previous night room service . Because of her unprofessional attitude, we did not order any more room service or use the mini bar.

The receptionist were very helpful and professional, there seem to be a regular problem with our room electronic key card as we have to return on regular basis to have it reprogramed when we were unable to open the door. The receptionist ran out of excuses and she finally said I quote"" What can I say to you again, but only to the say that I am sorry ""unquote. 

The breakfast service was good including the choices available, but was disappointed of lack of grapefruit juice on daily basis  and irregular coffee and tea services by the waiter. The muesli were all sweet/sugar sachet and none of sugar free and less sugar.

The dinning hall is of good size and you can either have your breakfast indoors or outdoor.

The hotel is in a quiet area with regular taxi service and not too far to the famous Barcelona beach which you can take the cable car outside the for 11 euros one way to the beach area.
The little problem is hearing the ship engine generator in the evening when you are relaxing outside your balcony.",4,2017,05,04
46,Just WOW!,"This is a spectacular place to stay in Barcelona! Costly but the rooms are incredible, the views are priceless, the service second to none and the bar snacks, served with your drink are super tasty.
The rooms are absolute luxury, beds you just sink into and pilllws to match. 
It is slightly out of the way, though if you're into views, great service and luxury, stay here!  
I can not speak highly enough of the spa, sauna, steak room and pool. Throughout my 5 day stay each of them got a full work out! 
I highly recommend anyone stay here :)",5,2017,04,22
46,Fabulous,Fabulous hotel with panoramic views of Barcelona. Positioned above the City set in exotic gardens. Service is superb and food was excellent. We stayed here before we boarded our ferry to Mallorca. Perfect in every aspect.,5,2017,04,20
46,"Perfect place to stay -- location, hotel and service were tremendous","I travel extensively for business, but was in Barcelona on my own dime !  I made the right choice !  The room was beautiful; the location was only 15 mins to Rambla (though warning! up a steep hill for those walkers), the food was yummy!  It abuts against gardens (down the hill -- hidden, very interesting)

Yet it was Nicholas, Maria and Sophia who made the hotel so special.  They really enjoy what they do and were so helpful!  My daughter left her bag in hotel after we left and they tracked it down for us.  And, free parking since I booked with them directly.  Tremendous!",5,2017,04,17
46,Excellent Value For Money,Had lovely time staying at the Hotel.  Lovely views from the balcony.  Staff is very humbly and service is excellent.  The Manager Mr. Diego Vilar and Ms. Agata were superb persons to deal with.  I had a group of 100 persons and they all had a great time.  Very convenient to go around in Barcelona,4,2017,04,16
46,high over marina,"lovely hotel, real 5 star, perched high above the marina, lovely staff, very helpful. worth taking the cable car from the hotel garden,11 Euro one way,same cost as taxi, but fantastic view and much faster.",5,2017,04,05
46,Beautiful hotel with true 5 star service ,"My husband and I just left the Miramar after a weekend stay. We were exceptionally impressed with the entire experience from the beautiful setting and facilities to the highly attentive staff we couldn't ask for more. We only wish we had stayed longer! Our only very small suggestion was to inform guests about the shooting range close by...8am loud shots on a Sunday morning can be quite unnerving in the society we live in! It certainly wouldn't have put us off but it would be nice to have been warned! Well done too all of the staff however, special thanks to Fernando who was so sweet, he recommended a fabulous tapas restaurant called 2254, amazing! ",5,2017,04,04
46,Just lovely!,"You cant describe how much you will love this place...The location is amazing, on the top of Barcelona at Montjuic hill you can enjoy the beautiful view of the city. The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious. The food at the restaurant very good and tasty. The atmosphere in the hotel is just fabulous. For sure you will want to stay there.",5,2017,03,29
46,Luxury hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over a weekend. It is a fabulous hotel, very luxurious and our suite had a huge balcony with views to the marina. Very professional service and food was excellent. Good location up on a height in lovely grounds away from the bustle of the city. Not ideal for those who have walking difficulties. But taxis are at the door. Highly recommend. Is a bit more expensive than some other 5 stars in barcelona but well worth it.",5,2017,03,23
46,A little expensive but very nice,"We stayed for 4 nights over the Marathon weekend.

We reached the hotel via an arranged transfer. Very polite and very professional but at 90 euros for 12 miles it should be.

On arrival we were met by a very professional reception team. Offered a cold drink and checked in. Very polite and professional. If paying with Amex watch out there is an additional charge.

We had an upgraded room and it featured a large bath area and a super king bed. We had a private balcony that overloooked the marina. Very nice. The only thing that spoilt the room was the chav hen party that were up screaming and shouting until all hours. Sadly they were from the UK so just made me feel embarrassed to be British...oh well.

The hotel has a spa with a small gym and pool. There is a large outdoor pool but it was closed (time of year). 

We ate breakfast and very nice indeed but if not included in the room I doubt I would have paid the 56 euros (gobsmackingly outrageously overpriced for two). That said it was very nice.

The staff, to a man (woman) were brilliant and were very well trained and friendly..

Great hotel but not sure the price point is right.",4,2017,03,13
46,a few great days,"we spent some days in Barcelona for a small break. We wanted a luxury hotel with a good reputation. This is the Miramar! From the first moment on we appreciated the very friendly and competent staff. Our room was excellent with a fantastic view on the sea and the harbor. Nice bar in the lobby and a really good restaurant (Forestier). The location is a little bit out of the centre, on the Montejuïc Hill. But there are easy ways to get there...even by walking. we can only recommend this hotel",5,2017,03,11
46,City break ,"Stunning hotel for relaxation and view of the port and city. Staff were v professional, caring and went far with their human touch. Would definitely go back. The walk to and from the city was not a problem and was enjoyable. The room and spa area were gorgeous ",5,2017,03,08
46,To Avoid: A 3 star hotel not more,"I booked this hotel with my wife during MWC'17. The hotel is featured as a 5 star in hotels.com where we book it. When we arrived we were shocked to see the state of the room (Pictures are attached) and even before entering the room the lady at the reception was very cold not welcoming at all. At 12h30 the room was still not ready so we decided to go to the conference. When we went back to the hotel neither of the door cards was working because keeping them near your phone or credit card isn't recommended !!! This happened three times during our stay.  

The next morning we decided to try the gym and again we were shocked to see a 25m2 gym extremely humid just next to the interior pool. The gym has two treadmills extremely noisy and some weights. We went for a run outside instead which we really recommend. We had dinner at the bar yesterday and I asked the waiter what's inside the vegetable sandwich and he replied to me Vegetables !!!! Then he completely messed up our order and he apologized in a very bad English. 

The breakfast is very basic with Nespresso machine and self service for your coffee.

To summarize our experience paying for a 5 star hotel to end up finding an old not refurbished 3 star hotel with a unprofessional staff and a horrible service is just not serious. ",1,2017,03,04
46,Great views and well placed but overpriced,"Stayed for a business trip, rooms were OK but perhaps a little tired. The restaurant was pricey (over 50 euros per person for two courses and a glass of wine) and the room service menu never matched what they were actually able to provide.",3,2017,03,04
46,Wonderful stay!!,"My husband and I stayed here for  4 glorious days.  Rooms are beautiful, loved the bath in the centre of the room. Cava on arrival with complimentary water and chocolates in the room. Staff were lovely, Very professional and extremely polite. Would definitely return hopefully soon!!",5,2017,02,23
46,holiday,We went to the Hotel Miramar on our winter holiday. We had some trouble with the heating but the front office manager Jonathan was very kind to us and got it sorted out.  Service was awesome. Would definitely go back.,4,2017,02,14
46,HEAVEN ON EARTH,"the caption says it all. overlooking the city and the harbour of barcelona, the hotel is located on a hill with a beautiful view. front staff try to make ANYTHING possible for you. they were absolutely the best and very professional. we never really figured out why, but for some reason we got a free bottle of champagne sent to our room, which we didn't expect at all. again, they even make the stuff happen you don't request ;)
breakfast was delicious and has something to offer for every taste! 
we sure will be back! oh and go for the premium room, it's worth it!",5,2017,02,05
46,Absolutely the best relax location in Barcelona,"Once you arrive to this hotel you are convinced that you have found the best relaxing spot in Barcelona... this location on the hill gives such an excellent view over the complete city & harbor, and this only on a 10 min walkingdistance from the centre !
The hotel has a historical part what is perfectly integrated in the later builded extension... it als has a impressive park around the hotel. Really top !",5,2017,02,03
46,Awesome 3 days in Barcelona,"Hotel Miramar provides a beautiful top view of Spain..on a clear day you can also spot the gaudi's lovely creation @Sagrada Familia.

The food in the hotel was spectacular , it has a beautiful break spread and the lunch in the restaurant was amazing. You can sip your morning orange juice sitting by the view of the sea.. its beautiful :)

Travelling is pretty easy, nearest train ride is just 10 minutes walk down the hill and you can go just anywhere. I would recommend to walk around and enjoy the roads & the feel of barcelona.",4,2017,02,01
46,The Spa is excellent,Had a wonderful two nights here. A ten minute walk to city.  A beautiful view from the hotel and staff are excellent and willing to help.  The spa is amazing and Sabina and Martina were incredible.  Definitely the best treatments I have had in a long time,5,2017,01,31
46,Simply Wonderful ,"What a wonderful hotel !!! Amazing views, beautifully appointed rooms, excellent food and drinks - there's literally nothing I can think of that was disappointing. 

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with Spanish Cava, the receptionist organised for our bags to be taken to our room, offered us a reduced rate for breakfast, and the escorted us to our room - which did not disappoint in any way. 

The spa facilities are excellent with pool, steam room, sauna and jacuzzi. I'm disappointed that I left the hotel without booking myself a massage.

The hotel bar is great with panoramic views over the harbour area. The staff are super friendly and professional, and make some mean cocktails 🙂

Breakfast was high quality buffet style. I'm not usually a fan of buffet breakfast but the Miramar won me over with it's great selection and quality. Breakfast is expensive but 100% worth it. 

I would look no further than hotel miramar if travelling to Barcelona and would happily book again. ",5,2017,01,29
46,Lunch!!!!,"We stopped here on a whim. Ok, honestly, I needed the restroom and I won't do that without at least buying something. The restrooms were immaculate! We decided on a late lunch. I'm celiac which is painful sometimes while traveling. James the Maitre d', gave me some of the best gluten free rolls. He and the waitstaff were very knowledgeable and the food was so delicious! We had paella and hummus.",5,2017,01,16
46,Ended up cancelling after communicating with hotel,"Misleading add on bookings.com showing pics with nice view whereas when I emailed hotel I was told that deluxe room only has view of garden /pool and I can upgrade for euro 55 per night to premium room .

Communication was great however given I have booked 6 months in advance and I always book room with view( made it clear via my email )  hotel could have offered complimentary upgrade .

Booking cancelled and as I am Hilton gold member I will stick to Hilton in Barcelona .",1,2016,12,30
46,weekend break,"A truly amazing hotel, staff were great, helpful and very pleasant.
Rooms were great, with a great view over look the port and city.

Couldn't have asked for more.

Good location, as long as you don't want to go into the city,",5,2016,12,13
46,Nice hotel but a little dated ,"The hotel was nice and the rooms were clean and comfortable but the hotel did seem a little dated. The staff were nice and accommodating. The hotel is not super central but not a bad location. We have stayed in ""cooler"" hotels in Barcelona though....",4,2016,12,09
46,"Beautiful hotel, impeccable service and worth every penny ","My husband and I stayed for a night at the start of October. The welcome at check in was genuinely warm and what I would expect from such a high quality hotel. The hotel is very stylish and in an amazing location overlooking the city. Very close to the cable car too. Our room was lovely, not huge but had all that we needed for our stay. Very comfortable and quiet. Our huge corner terrace was stunning and gave us amazing views over the city and the harbour and out to sea. The pool area was beautiful and elegant and as the hotel was quiet, we had it almost to ourselves. On our second day, the pool was closed for a private function. This was very disappointing but the hotel manager offered generous compensations which we very much appreciated. The service and our experience at Miramar was wonderful and I would absolutely recommend this hotel. We did not eat dinner here but breakfast was fantastic. The indoor pool also deserves a mention as it looks very stylish, though we did not use it. ",5,2016,11,29
46,Excellent Service and Location,"Loved staying at Mt Juic - running/walking around the Olympic Stadium, castle, etc., and close enough to get downtown on foot easily.  Fabulous view of the Mediterranean sea and Barcelona.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with all requests.",4,2016,11,27
46,Great views overlooking the city,"stayed there for 5 nights on a business trip, didn't get disappointed, large beautiful room, friendly staff and 15 to 20 mnts short walk to main street of Barcelona.
breakfast can improve with more selections. 
Overall stay was great.",5,2016,11,26
46,Amazing!!,"The hotel is located about 15 minutes from the airport (£29 standard rate in taxi one way) and about 10 minutes from la rambla. It is a brilliant location to be close to the city centre but a perfect hideaway from the hussle and bussle. The hotel has beauitful views over looking the city. 

The breakfast was lovely and a diverse amount of food to choose from.

The staff we're lovely and helped us pick restaurants to eat st (we reccommend 2254 - amazing food) and book sight seeing visits. 

The room was a good size, clean and the bath tub was a gorgeous feature. 

I wouldn't stay anywhere else in my favourite city! ",5,2016,11,09
46,Wonderful hotel and amazing area,"I heard about the beauty of Barcelona, but in fact it exceeded my expectations. The hotel is so nice and its staff doesn't just serve or help, but they make you feel it is really their pleasure to make your trip a piece of art ☺
My advice to bring a good camera with you!",5,2016,11,01
46,"Decent hotel, well worth considering","We were booked into this hotel by our cruise agents. Not knowing what to find, it is a fair way out from the city centre which i guess will appeal to some but not to others. Certainly to be able to access the city centre and main tourist areas requires a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro or to take taxi, definitely too far to walk the whole way. The hotel is situated close to the beach and we found it to be a modern, clean and well appointed hotel, The staff were friendly and helpful and the beds were comfortable. quite impressed",4,2016,10,26
46,Beautiful spot to stay,Hotel and staff were wonderful.  Beautiful and quiet rooms.  Location was a bit difficult since you could not walk to main city area.  Transportation was tough as one of our travelers was elderly and so we depended on taxis.  Taxi drivers I'm sure took full advantage of us and made a ten minute drive into twenty and thirty minutes.  Wish I spoke Spanish,5,2016,10,24
46,Highly recommended!,"I was looking for a hotel close to the airport for the last night of my trip and the Miramar reviews were very good. I booked a suite with a terrace with a view of the city. The room was luxurious and large,and the terrace had amazing views over the city at night. I arrived late in the afternoon and was able to get a late lunch on the outside terrace. I overslept in the morning and was in a rush to catch my flight. When I got downstairs there was a long line of about 25 people to check out. The porter was very busy as well but he finally got me a taxi. I interrupted the line and gave them my key and apologized but said I had to leave and to charge my credit card. They were nice about it. My room had been pre-paid so it was just lunch and breakfast. They had 3 people working fast at the reception desk, so the line wasn't the hotel's or staffs fault. Everyone on the staff spoke & understood English very well and were very nice.
They are definitely out of the downtown tourist area but when I drove in I noticed the hop on hop off tourist bus drive by and I am sure that is a Metro stop in the area. On my way to the airport I noticed a very interesting cemetery on a hillside that when I later googled at home, found out it is the Montjuic Cemetery. For photographers I recommend you check it out. I wish I had known about it earlier in my trip.

In summary, this place is beautiful and definitely worth the money. I wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2016,10,20
46,Couldn't have chosen better,"We were boarding a celebrity cruise the next morning and the location to the port was fantastic.  Also the location to a tour bus of Barcelona was right across the street, very convenient.  We also ate at a great restaurant right around the corner.  The room was clean, and the bathroom was gorgeous.  The people at the front desk were very pleasant as you sit down and sip champagne as they check you in.  Gorgeous outdoor pool (tto cool to use it), small but adequate indoor pool.",5,2016,10,20
46,Great views and fantastic room,Hotel Miramar is a great place to stay for a quiet relaxing stay.  The gardens are amazing with city and ocean views. Rooms are large and clean.  The staff is most attentive and helpful with excellent recommendations. Room service is delicious. Subway access is a short 10 minute walk down a hill.,5,2016,10,19
46,The big fancy place up on the hill,"This hotel is what most hotels strive to be, a beautiful property with attentive employees, a view, and beautiful rooms. The attached restaurant does a fine job and cooked a great meal probably the best meal we had in Barcelona! I don't know if I will stay there next time in town I think I would want to be closer to the action where you can walk to restaurants without hiring a taxi cab. It's pretty much €10-€15 to leave that hotel and go to the restaurant area unless of course you like a tremendous amount of walking which we do not. ",4,2016,10,17
46,Couldn't sleep.  ,A wedding that was supposed to end at 11 PM was allowed to continue until 2am. Assigned Room 203. Awful.  Bar noise permeated the room allowing just three hours of sleep.  Room was right over front entrance.  I hate giving such a review as the hotel has other things going for it.  I complained to the manager but was given nothing but sympathy and agreement that there were indeed problems and he didn't know why the wedding party was allowed to continue so late.  ,1,2016,10,02
46,Amazing view and great for drinks,"We got on the cable car and ended up at a little bar/cafe called Miramar.  But if you walk just a few more step you will arrive the the Miramar Hotel. It's so beautiful, the service was great and the wine was reasonable.$6 per glass and tasted a whole lot better than what they gave us at the Miramar cafe next to the cable car exit.  At sunset they play live music and it was great!",5,2016,09,30
46,Amazing 2nd visit to Hotel Miramar,"Revisited this wonderful hotel following our first visit last year - we just had to return. This is easily one of the best hotels in Barcelona and totally deserves its five stars. On arrival you are greeted with a glass of Cava- a great touch. Service throughout the seven night stay was great at all times. Great location with stunning views. Rooms are all very roomy and decorated to a high standard. This hotel has both indoor and outdoor pools, both excellent. If you are staying in Barcelona and want to treat yourselves with one on the best hotels in Barca you must stay here.... ",5,2016,09,28
46,"The Shooting Range, Weekend weddings, and Designer Earplugs","Every year, I organize a gathering of people from all over the world in order to think deeply about the field of leadership development.  It is a soulful gathering and so we look for boutique hotels and we sprinkle our agenda with a mixture of intellectual thought and emotional resonance.   We have done our Forum in New York, Vancouver, London, Denver, San Diego, Boston and for any hotel it is a great opportunity.  Because sitting in our audience are decision makers, any one of whom could bring their own corporate executive development programs to Barcelona.  In other words, get it right, and the hotel could see many companies bringing their own executive to the Miramar in the year to come in attempt to emulate what they have personally experienced.  

Prior to our recent meeting, I flew to Barcelona three times from the States and scoured the hotels in Barcelona.  In each case, the hotels realized the potential multiplier effect.  

As we checked into the Miramar, two days before the start, we overheard, a distraught German complaining about music blasting from a wedding party until 4 in the morning the night before.  

On the first day of our Forum, we had one on the top speakers in the world addressing our 100 delegates.  He had flown in from Shanghai.  Our delegates had flown in from 13 different countries.  As he began his remarks, they were suddenly interrupted by what sounded construction and a metal rivet gun.   Here is what we learned:  Behind the Miramar is a gun range and the local police were giving a shooting demonstration.  
I was crushed.  No one had mentioned this to us.  We were told that there was nothing they could do but they had never had this problem before...However, in the days to follow, the shooting range continued to interfere with our speakers. 

We had planned to stay beyond the Forum and so we still at the Miramar on the Saturday following our conference.   All night long, until 4 there was another wedding party blasting the worst electronic, mind-numbing, cretin producing, non melodic, music that might have been used as a form of torture at a CIA internment camp.  

When we called the front desk they had a brilliant suggestion:  ear plugs. Like the wedding party, we didn't get any sleep until it was over at 4 a. m.  

Here is the mystery to me.  I met some of the absolutely nicest people working at the Hotel.  Truly kind, truly helpful, truly competent. 

The location of the Miramar is a 'gold mine'.  This hotel has an Occitane Spa, overlooks the city and yet within walking distance.  The potential to make it a more exclusive, upgraded hotel is clear.  However, it is currently a bit tired, the breakfasts are of poor quality, and one gets the impression that the very genial manager, Diego, has his hands tied by pressure coming from somewhere for short term cash rather than establishing this hotel and its brand as a high end experience....

Conclusion:  Don't stay here on weekends unless you are in the wedding party;  Never, ever, ever, book a meeting into the hotel and run into the disturbance from the firing range.....and make sure to bring a pair of high quality ear plugs.",3,2016,09,26
46,Reservation made 6 mths ago; yet got it wrong!,"Made a reservation 6 mths ago with a conference group:  requested high floor, view.  Checked in - first give key to  nice room with view, which was already occupied!  Tried to find replacement:  ""full hotel"", I was told.  A couple of poor choices.  Now stuck in box with no view.  Given a free drink. :(",2,2016,09,20
46,second stay and will be back,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Miramar and for me I will return to this hotel every time I visit Barcelona, why stay anywhere else,  my room which I requested before my arrival is perfect for me clean with a big balcony, the staff are friendly and helpful, breakfast is adequate and tasty, not too busy by the pool can always get a bed. 10/10 again! see you next year!!!",5,2016,09,20
46,Not a 5* -but could be if management take note......,"In my opinion there are 3 types of reviewers on TripAdvisor:

1) Business travellers -they tend not to leave reviews unless the hotel is exceptional or had a bad experience, either way they want the world to know.....
2) Tourists -statements like ""best hotel ever!"" signals that they have been used to a lower grade of establishment and decided to treat themselves hence their gushing reviews similar to a lot of the reviews for the Miramar -I will come back to this later....
3) Travellers - Experienced travellers who can distinguish between the different types of establishment and will review it accordingly e.g. if they have been used to staying at say 3* establishments and then stay a higher grade hotel then clearly the experience will be ""better"" but they avoid the label of ""best"" and/or similar adjectives as clearly it is not the case!

The Miramar purports to be a 5* GL and by some of the ""tourist"" reviews it seems to clearly be in that category but if you look at some of the more ""critical"" reviews (the ones management should take seriously as opposed to the ""positive"" ones) then I believe that it would be a much better hotel than it actually is right now, hence the following constructive feedback:

I must state that it was literally a flying visit on this occasion but it was with a view for a longer term relationship as for me the hotel ticked a number of boxes, namely it's ""boutique"" appeal/size, the hillside location and rooms with balconies offering fantastic views over Barcelona/sea/port, the swimming pool/gardens and of course the expected 5* service to compliment it all..... With this in mind I made contact directly with the hotel and made a booking well in advance for a ""premium room"" however, upon checking in, first warning signal, no welcome drink, followed by a first floor room (#103) with views of the trees in front of the hotel. Not sure how you can provide a premium room that does not offer the all important views of Barcelona?!!! This let down resulted in a request for a ""proper premium room with views""

To his credit Diego (duty manager ?) took charge and promised me a more suitable room (#504) later that day so we accepted and went for lunch.

Sadly, despite it not being busy at all, the service was slow and when I eventually literally collared a waitress it still took about another 30 mins to get the order -a ""Club Sandwich"" which is not a Club at all but ""Chefs interpretation"" -if its not a Club then don't call it a Club -simples! It was very disappointing and ranks joint lowest during my wordly travels along with the Club at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami (also a Chefs interpretation)

Anyway, we eventually got into our room and albeit it was acceptable it did not have the expected double balcony which I was told was not standard for all premium rooms :(

As I have rambled on for a while I will consolidate into ""pros & cons""

Pros:
Spacious bathroom with a bath by a picture window + large shower -see photo
Large picture windows leading onto decent sized balcony but was expecting a larger one.
Pleasant décor in rooms + the  lobby/ lounge/ bar area looked the part with a pianist adding to the atmosphere in the evening

Cons:
Bathrobes hanging above the bidet in the corner of the room -see photo
Stand alone fridge next to desk -looks totally out of character like an afterthought -see photo
Dead plant on the balcony -see photo
Wardrobe space was very limited -sufficient for a business traveller for 2-3 days and certainly not for a couple -see photo
Gin selection in the bar was good but let down by only offering Schweppes - even the premium brand does not compare to Fever Tree -it may suit management to sign an exclusive agreement with the drinks company (think it was 2 yrs ago?) but this ignores the fact that in a 5* establishment the customer comes first and we should be given the choice of tonic especially as FT is by far the best!
Again, service was slow and we like a few other guests ended up queuing at the bar to pay our bills :(
Breakfast is a buffet affair but tea and coffee was not served to the table but available via a machine (like in a budget hotel) and the coffee that was dispensed was luke warm :(
The scrambled egg had tongues for serving as opposed to a spoon which was rectified after another guest brought this to the attention of staff :(
Plates and cutlery were slow to be removed -it clearly was a case of too few staff

In summary, our stay was not unpleasant but more a case of the hotel not coming up the required expectations of a 5* establishment (the devil is on the detail) but charging as if they were.....

My opinion is that management should look at employing less younger staff which by their age results in lack of experience but ones that can provide a genuine 5* service and/or train up the staff to the required levels as well as employ more. Until this is done its only a 4* hotel.

Finally, thank you Diego for your efforts to make our stay satisfactory and taking on board my feedback, I hope my next visit will be more in line with a 5* rating....",3,2016,09,18
46,Superb hotel,"Fabulous hotel, in a quieter area of Barcelona. Greeted by warm friendly staff with a glass of bubbly. Had a premium corner room with great views of the harbour and city. Small outdoor pool in a garden area which was refreshing after a busy time in the city but also lovely to relax when required . Seven double cabanas around the garden / pool area which I believe there is a minimum spend of 75 euros on beverages etc but in sept this did not apply to us ,so we enjoyed using them.20 sun beds and three big low lounging beds,food and drink London prices as is most of Barcelona. Indoor pool small but pleasant, we also used the steam room and jacuzzi.The phones were modern in the room and we did have problems using it to get in touch with reception. As big tea drinkers there were no facilities we did email the hotel prior to arrival and they were happy to provide a kettle and cups and saucers and at five euros a cup of tea we were glad we took our own. All staff were great, we had a fabulous time here and would recommend this hotel .",5,2016,09,14
46,It's good enough but not perfect ,"When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted warmly with a glass of Cava, which was a nice start. The lobby and bar area all look very nice and contemporary. When we got to the room, I was impressed by how massive the room is, a spacious sofa sitting area, a massive bed with an open plan bathroom, and an extra walk in wardrobe area at the back. It's a really nice size room. But I am not sure about the design of the open plan bathroom. It can be noisy in the middle of the night if you want to use the toilet and when u turn on the light and it may disturb your partner. Bathroom should not be open plan next to the bed, that's a design fault to me. Also the shower room door open inwards and the door touches the raindance shower head above. So you can only open a gap rather than fully and I am always worried that I would either smashed the glass door or the shower head. Another design fault. 
The pool is very small, and the hotel have lots of guests, not enough deck chair for sure. There are some fancy sunbeds with drapes all over it but always been reserved. The parasol are all wonky and they fell a few times cos of wind. I found that can be dangerous. The pool design is small and odd shape. Not big enough for the number of guests they have. The spa was under renovation at that time so can't be the indoor pool. 
Service wise, the reception guy was very good and welcoming. But housekeeping was not great. Someone opened my door twice without even knocking my door. That's bad. Also, they don't seem to replenish toiletries everyday. And twice we came back to the room at 4:30pm and the room was still not made up yet. We had to complain to the reception and waited until 5pm to enter our room. Breakfast was also quite busy, too many guests and perhaps not enough staff. To me tea and coffee should be bought to the table but didn't happen. It happened once maybe but the waitress brought me a mug with hot water and a tea bag. No tea pot. Maybe I am too spoiled. 
The setting of the hotel is fine, up the hill but it's not close to town centre. Walking up the hill on a hot summer day may not be ideal to everyone. But the Miro museum n Olympic parc area are nearby too. So depends what to want to do I guess. ",4,2016,09,10
46,"Not terrible, good views, bland","Was here for a conference dinner. Tapas to be specific. I would say it's OK. They served a variety - quite unobtrusively, taste-wise its fine but bland, I have to agree. The views are superb though - I think the night views are better than those in the daytime.",3,2016,09,07
46,Perfection,Incredible views.  Would come back just to stay here again.  Restaurants on site also very good.  Takes a bit to get down to city to explore but buses come by a lot and taxis always there also.  Insanely beautiful property.  We paid about $30 a night on orbitz to get an ocean view and our room was spectacular compared to the 2 other couples we traveled with.  Was on corner facing city so we had city and ocean view. The grounds are also stunning.,5,2016,09,07
46,Not happy,"The staff are not friendly especially the girl at the front desk, breakfast waitress also did not welcome us or show us to the table, which is weird because i saw her welcome other couples with a big smile and show them to their table and ask what they would like to drink! 
I have been to many hotels around the world and this one is the worst by far when it comes to staff manners and professionalism. However, the rooms are spacious and clean. The view was nice. 

Overall experience was not as expected and would not recommend nor visit again!",2,2016,09,05
46,Amazing view and more,"This is a comfortable hotel with amazing view to Barcelona and the port. Looks that a good interior designer worked there. A perfect restaurant - not so often you can get the same level of meals even in 5-stars hotels. Friendly staff. Great location: it's on Munjuic and you can reach by walk the Castle, Fund Miro, National Museum, Olympic Stadium, etc. it's really nice place  ",5,2016,08,27
46,Best hotel we have stayed in by far - what a welcome!!,"We arrived here at 11pm last Sunday (21/08/16), after walking out of our £330-a-night room at the 'W Barcelona'  (Its a long story, but i'd read that review if you want to know about the contrast of the worst and best hotels in Barcelona)

Upon arrival through the front doors we were greeted by a spectacular lobby area, and the wonderful Gregorio who chatted freely and cheerily about our upcoming stay.  He was very sad to hear of our problems at the previous hotel, and we were sure we had made a much better decision this time around. Whilst we dealt with the paperwork, we were both given complimentary champagne - what a nice touch.

We stayed in a lovely room with beautiful views of the city, beach and pool area, and whilst we had just finished packing at approx midnight that night, the phone rang.
It was Gregorio from reception letting us know that he opened up the jacuzzi and wet room exclusively for us, and there a full bottle of champagne and 2 glasses waiting for us. We were utterly bowled over.  Needless to say, we very much enjoyed our first impressions of the great Miramar Barcelona.

The following day we spent most of by the pool and bar area, where we were served by the beautiful and very attentive Margaux.  Between her and Gregorio we were made to feel so special, and we have every intention to go back there time and time again.

The food was freshly cooked, the rooms and public areas were clean and well maintained. The staff were all wonderful.

I could go on and on, but I would run out of superlatives to fully describe the stay.

If you are in doubt as to which hotel to stay at during your stay in Barcelona, and you want unbridled luxury and service, then do not look any further.

We love you Miramar, you really made our stay the thing of dreams. xx",5,2016,08,25
46,Good but not 5*,"The hotel entrance is really nice, friendly staff and a really warm welcome. Glass of Cava and we checked in very quick. The rooms are a great size with lovely big beds. Having a bath in the room is great fun, the kids loved it. The rooms are in desperate need of an update, wardrobe doors do not close properly, shaving mirror hanging off the wall, toilet door wouldn't close, shower head needed cleaning and fixing to the wall as it hung down, rug under bed is very stained and all the furniture was marked. I could imagine this hotel to be stunning when it was new. The pool area was lovely, but again it is in desperate need of an update. The pool was tired, hand rails missing on the steps to the pool, the decking was loose in areas and could be a trip hazard. The pool food was excellent and staff very helpful. The hotel restaurant was nice, a little overpriced, the menu was limited and didn't change during our staff. Not sure if we'd stay again, but we definitely enjoyed our visit. The pianist in the bar was amazing!! ",4,2016,08,24
46,Nice,"Pleasant Hotel on a height. Beautiful view of the city. The funicular goes down to the beach directly from hotel, only late begins to work and early finishes, from 10-20... The pool is small, plank beds aren't enough, we could never use them! Have very much impressed morning jogs on the mountain from hotel.",4,2016,08,24
46,50th birthday!,"Just returned home having spent 4 nights here for my partner's birthday. The hotel itself is stunning! Great views, rooms beautiful with great views over the port...
On arrival we had to wait 4 hours for our room, and between us we made 4 trips to reception to enquire as to the progress...finally a manager became involved and offered us 50% discount off our drinks as compensation???? We had been up since 4am and were exhausted, and I also had emailed prior to inform them of our early arrival. A bottle of Cava had been requested by myself to be in our room on arrival - this never materialised! By this stage we were too tired to argue!
Breakfast buffet - very good selection, bar menu good.
Some staff need to be friendlier, and SMILE!
Pool area lovely, with nice shaded area.
We availed of the Romance package, which was lovely thank you.
Housekeeping needs improved though, as rose petals from our romantic bath were still there 48hrs later - alongwith the tortilla chip on floor since our arrival??
We had to go into the store twice to get more shower gel, toilet paper and towels.
As a manager of a 5* venue myself, I really did feel that this hotel falls short in a few areas - especially with the price you are paying, however saying that, it was enjoyable and relaxing despite a bad start.
The receptionist on check out did not enquire as to our stay either.
If you have the money, and arent expecting too much, this hotel would suit. Some areas still need a bit of work.
",3,2016,08,19
46,Best Weekend!!,"Stayed in February 2016 for my boyfriends birthday, perfect choice of hotel despite having to walk up lots of steps every day to get to the hotel so be warned!
Beautiful setting, bed was HUGE, staff all very helpful and welcoming! Will definitely be back again :) ",5,2016,08,19
46,Magnificent ,"This hotel is impressive 
Trendy, luxurious, clean, good service, good food, spacious rooms, excellent location and last but not least excellent views. 
Very good for a couple retreat, friends gathering...etc maybe not so much for families. 
Would definitely go there again 
Good luck to you ",5,2016,08,16
46,Manage your expectations,"Good or bad? If you expect maximum 4* hotel with beautiful view on harbour, it´s the place for you! If you expect real 5* hotel with excellent service, you will be deeply disappointed. 
PROS:
-	Location: if you pay a „Premium room“ as we did, you can enjoy romantic sea view from your balcony
-	Loccitane Spa: my wife tried some relaxing massage there and she said it was one of the best
-	Spacious room, well equipped
-	Very comfortable bed with nice pillow menu
-	Quick check in and smooth check out
CONS:
-	Location: if you pay for 5* hotel on the hill outside the city centre, you assume, there will be some hotel shuttle bus to city centre. There is nothing.  Fortunately taxi is not expensive here (aprox. 7 euro to the harbour), or you have to go down the hill about 15 min, but going back in hot weather is not a good idea.
-	Service, service service… there is no service which you expect in 5* hotel. You can forget about doorman helping you with luggage, somebody to call the taxi (they told us, we have to stop some taxi on the street), we did not find any concierge helping you with booking tickets etc., no evening room set-up…I could continue a long list
-	Pool: there is only about 10 double sun beds, which are constantly booked, you have to book it minimum a day before!
-	Very dated furniture and room facilities: There are visible scratches on almost every door,  wardrobe door don´t  fit together (see picture), air condition did not work properly, safe box did not work at all (we had to ask reception to be fixed), everything you touch is almost falling down from the wall – if it´s the shelf in shower or the eye mirror. You can see visible stains on carpet and the white bath tube has so many yellow stains, that you really don´t want to use it!
-	Breakfast: the same selection of buffet for 5 days of our stay! Nothing special, you can forget about some pancake point or something like that. Coffee is not served, you have to service yourself,  but 3 different waiters are able to ask you in 5 minutes about you room number, every morning.
I am sure, it was a great hotel when it was a new one! But it´s very visible, that the owner tries to make money only and don´t invest anything back to keep it updated.
Anyway we spent a beautiful week in Barcelona, the beautiful town with very nice people and we definitely go back very soon. But I think, we will try another hotel, with better service.",4,2016,08,15
46,Wonderful ,"My wife and I stayed there for a few days for a short holiday and absolutely loved it. 

Check in was smooth with complimentary cava and apples. Very professional and friendly staff. We had the premium room which was lovely with a beautiful balcony and view. 

We tried room service twice which fast and tasty, try their burger. Also the pool is nice with a cool vibe; plan to spend a day or afternoon there. 

You should also try the cable car to port Olympic which gives you a beautiful view of the city, port and beach. 

Finally the hotel is not in the centre so a taxi is needed back and forth for 10 euros max each way but this didn't spoil our holiday. 

Would stay thete again next time",5,2016,08,13
46,The Best Staff Ever!,"This was our 3rd visit to Barcelona, so this time we fancied staying in a more relaxing location with a swimming pool so that we could unwind, and we really hit the jackpot with the Hotel Miramar.

This hotel is based in Montjuic which sounds like a long way from the city but is in fact a 5 minute (7euro) taxi ride or a 15 minute downhill walk straight into town.

It's a two minute walk to catch the cable car up to the top of Montjuic to visit the castle, or you can catch the Funicular (2.40euro) down into town. Literally outside the hotel you can also catch the cable car into the port.

But the real delight of this hotel has to be without doubt the staff. Each and every member from the front desk, the restaurant and the staff around the pool, are all extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Always greeting you with a smile and always wanting to do anything at all to please.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the hotel in general is extremely peaceful which is a welcome escape from the hustle s d bustle in the City.

The breakfast buffet is gorgeous with everything from fresh fruit, hot food and freshly baked pastries.

I really cannot recommend this hotel enough. Sure, you will find cheaper, but more relaxing and friendly - absolutely not.

",5,2016,08,13
46,Wonderful hotel with a good service ,"We stopped in this hotel for some nights. The welcome service  was perfect (water, champagne), check in is fast. The room was cozy and modern, with a big bath  and shower and good view  on the city. Free access  to pool and sauna. The location is nice  but it's  better to come there by car coz it's located on the hill and there is no metro, bus passing just next, so either you walk or take a taxi. ",5,2016,08,11
46,Quality hotel on superb location,"Hotel Miramar is located on mount Monjuic with panoramic views over the port and city of Barcelona. In front of the hotel there is a mirador which is also the departure point of the cable-way into the city. 

The rooms are very spacious, and the bathroom has a big freestanding tub and a huge rainshower. In the garden there is a nice swimmingpool with bar/snack service. This is a nice quiet hotel where you can relax after a day of wandering through Barcelona.",4,2016,08,08
46,FANTASTIC HOTEL WITH AMAZING VIEW,We booked this hotel with BA Holidays and cannot fault it.   Excellent value for money.   It was our first visit and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left the service was friendly without being over familiar with every member of staff wanting to make sure you enjoyed your stay.   The hotel was spotlessly clean in all areas and the room we had was cleaned to a high standard every day.   Location is quiet but the cable car is only 100 meters from the hotel and if you return after a long day out then Martinez is very near to the hotel and offers excellent food and service.   We will definately return later this year.,5,2016,08,08
46,Short city trip,"We have stayed here from Monday to Friday. Place is very nice, clean and great location with view over city and sea. Most of the stuff are nice english speaking people with positive attitude. Kitchen in restaurant with nice teresa is above the standard. Try bluefin tuna tartar. Our favorite. How ever U can miss scrambled eggs on breakfast. Not good. Hotel has a nice pool with the view. Refreshment is served there all day long and is very good as well. On sunny afternoon U may find all sun bads occupied. Get a towel and lay on grass. On our visit they have a trouble with parasols. They were flying all over the place with just light wind. Hope they will solve it soon. We would come back again.",4,2016,08,05
46,An ideal place to stay in Barcelona ,"What a great hotel in a fantastic location! We came to Barcelona for 4 nights and after endlessly pouring over the 4 and 5 star hotels in the city this won the vote. We had a premium room with a terrace situated on the front left hand corner of the hotel and it couldn't have been better. The staff are very helpful and the breakfast is great. We didn't eat an evening meal in the hotel as we wanted to venture out for food but looking at the menus I'd say the selection would suit almost anyone. 
The pool is a very nice place to relax - I would recommend booking a poolside bed. The food at the poolside is very good. 
A 10 minute walk into the city this was ideal for us as we could easily access the mayhem of the city but also retire to peace and quiet. 
The Lounge bar looks over the city and we enjoyed several G&Ts there. The views at night are quite something. 
If I was revisiting Barcelona I'd definitely book this hotel again! ",5,2016,08,02
46,Something different,"We really loved Hotel Miramar. We had just come off the Royal princess cruise around the Mediterranean and was staying in Barcelona for 4 days. Check in staff were really polite and helpful. We had 2 rooms in one of the corners of the hotel that overlooked both the city and the port.... Beautiful rooms , very modern and just a bit different to other hotel rooms. The pool area is very resort style overlooking gorgeous gardens, and all the meals we had were delicious ! The only thing we couldn't work out were the in room phones. We had trouble calling room service, so we just ran down to reception and ordered it there. The lollies in reception are a lovely touch too. 
Also we had booked the hop on and hop off bus for Barcelona and it stops about 200 metres from the Miramar , so that was really convenient for our sightseeing tours. 
Loved Barcelona and loved the Miramar . ",5,2016,07,31
46,"A very expensive 3 star hotel, or a cheap 5 star wanna be","Located in the precious Mont Juic, Miramar is a strange value proposition. Wants to be 4 star I guess, but certain details are killers.
Rooms: bathooms are separated from bedroom with a curtain. And toilett is behind a glass door. Meaning there is no intimacy for more than 1 person per room.
Extras: a few of the typical perks you can enjoy in a 5 star hotel are available, but only if you pay for them. Sun beds next to the pool for example.
Service: personnel seems like local police, trying to make sure you are charged for what you consume other than to service you. For example, dont be surprises if you are tackled when you go for breakfast to make sure you have paid for the buffet.
Food: really bad restaurant. Ok bar. go to the bar. Spanish food is good no matter what. But the restaurant is very bad and expensive. Really disappointing.",1,2016,07,24
46,"First five star hotel, and didn't disappoint","This was our first trip away as a couple and as we walked into the hotel we were blown away. Grand entrance which smelt lovely. We quickly checked in and out bags we brought to the room for us.

The room itself was spotless, cool, and quite large.
The bed was comfy, and the bathroom had a large shower and free standing bath.
The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our short stay. 
The swimming terrace was smart and the bar service was efficient.
We didn't try the spa, however it looked lovely.

The restaurant we have reviewed separately, but needless to say it was brilliant.

Overall a true five star experience, would recommend to anyone.",5,2016,07,18
46,Just amazing ,"We've really enjoyed our stay in Miramar hotel barcelona as it is a great choice for a holiday, the hotel design is very modern and classy the rooms are perfect size and comfortable specially the bathroom its very unique and the terrace is amazing and the outdoor pool is very nice, the breakfast buffet was rich and delicious the staff are extremely helpful and kind the only problem is the location of the hotel even though it has a very nice location and view above a hill but its a little bit hard to walk down to the city center and then walk all the way up to the hotel ",4,2016,07,11
46,Modern stylish hotel,"Hotel is up on high, offering excellent views over port. 

Modern design, comfortable rooms, ours wasnt that big but very stylish. Has safe minibar and designer bath

Outside pool area is comfortable and inside pool has jacuzzi and sauna.

hotel lounges are comfortable, staff pleasant. There are gardens on different levels, ideal for weddings.

Only thing that hotel can improve on is check-in, we were part of group of friends and they had been told room disribution well in advances, but they kept us waiting for over 40 mins

We had no views, best to ask for tooms overlooking bay ",4,2016,07,04
46,Another stay at Miramar,"After last year's good experience with this hotel, we decided to, also this year, to have one more stay in this lovely city and nice hotel, the second week in June. We love it because of the quiet surroundings, nice pool area, and lovely staff. This time we spent some extra money  for å ""sea view"" room. Got a room with a large terrasse and a grate  view, overlooking town and harbour area. The beds were very comfortable, but the room itself was a bit ""tired"". All in all very nice stay, may be a little overpriced. Would very much like to come back....",4,2016,07,01
46,Simply Amazing,"Hotel is only 5 min away from the center. Great view/ Amazing service and great food. Experience in the terrace was just great, service staff were very professional, accomodating and friendly. Our room was superb with a large terrace and with spectacular view of Barcelona. Special thanks to Marc at reception and Diego (front office manager) who made our stay memorable. Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,06,28
46,Something different ...,We really enjoyed our stay at this Hotel. It has character and is well set out in a great location. The staff are very helpful and professional with excellent multilingual skills like Marie. Our room had a great view and very comfortable for sleeping. I'd come back and stay longer next time! ,5,2016,06,28
46,"Beautiful location, Beautiful hotel. Perfect for some travelers, OK for others...","We spent 8 nights at the hotel Miramar. It's a very luxurious hotel at the top of a hill overlooking the Balearic Sea. We paid a little more for a room facing the Sea, with a lovely balcony that we could spend hours on just gazing off at the sailboats, Cruise ships docking, swallows and seagulls, and a great panorama of the city. The hill called Montjuic is a destination of its own and you will see a lot of folks enjoying the gardens (outstanding cactus garden adjoins) or the view on their way up to the Castle farther up the hill.

Our room was beautifully appointed, with a freestanding large oval tub, as well as shower. Comfortable bed.

There is a very nice L'occitane branded spa with a nice indoor pool and steam, along with massage available. We indulged in a 60 minute massage and found the staff to be very personable, professional and relaxing.

The building is beautiful inside and out, wonderful decorations, always clean, smells great, and the lobby area and bar are great for hanging out with friends or a group if that's what you are wanting.

The outdoor pool area and bar/cabana area is exquisite, and perfect for lolling away an afternoon with a book and a drink, or a smoothie. 

Free wifi throughout the building was fast and always there, without a lot of drama to reconnect every 24 hours, or even see a login screen, which was a pleasant change from the states.

Coffee in the room or in the lobby was always free, which was always very nice.

It seems the hotel tries hard not to nickel-and-dime you for every little thing, which is appreciated.

The challenge with this location is that it's a little remote from mass transit, especially at night. It's a 15 minute walk down the hill to get to the nearest convenience store, tapas bar, or really anything else other than the hotel complex. Taxi service at night is not always reliable. So if you are, say, on your honeymoon and don't plan to leave the property very much, it's perfect. But if you plan to come and go a lot, especially at night, it might not be the best hotel for you. Something to consider.

",4,2016,06,26
46,Fawlty Towers in a beautiful setting,"This is a stunning hotel. The swimming pool is great and the views are superb. The service is right out of Fawlty Towers. The staff is very friendly but many are comically inept. Check in us a 30 minute journey and every question requires a manager to confirm the answer.
We extended our room which was confirmed but staff still turned up to clean us out. We ordered a paella with no fish due to an allergy but got fish anyway. We had to redo our room keys twice a day to get in. We had a colleague join us on day 3 and we were each charged the additional room. We needed a table in a meeting room and ""Manuel"" came rolling the round table. Unfortunately it had a sticky edge and as he rolled it along he ripped up all of the floor tiles. It was a huge laugh but I am guessing unintended. If you have patience and a sense of humour you will enjoy this beautiful hotel.
",3,2016,06,23
46,"Great location, great views, missing little details in service to be perfect...","Great hotel location on top of the Monjuic hill, many rooms have views and balcony towards the city or the harbour. I got lucky to get one on the top floor facing the sea and the city. All amenities are nice, however quite some little details are annoying and you need to ""live with it"". Checkin can be a long process, don't know really why, and as the checkin desk have only 3 registers, queuing can be pretty long. Elevators are crazy slow, so having a room on a top floor can take time... Free wifi is available, however mostly in the main parts, side areas have no coverage. Service at the restaurant is slow. 10min to get a menu, 30min wait to get a salad. Everyone is smiley and helpful and the hotel is very clean.",4,2016,06,22
46,Excellent Hotel In Barcelona ,"The room of the hotel is perfect with wonderful harbour view. All the staffs were helpful and friendly. Most of them could speak different languages. 
The location is good and the bus stop of tour bus just outside the hotel. You could join the bus tour and travel around all sightseeing points.
The restaurant is perfect with outside terrace and nice harbour view. The drop off point of red cable car just outside the hotel. This hotel was located on the mountain with a quiet environment during night time. However, this hotel was closed to down town area. Just take 20 minutes walk to La Rambla.  By taxi just five minutes and the price around 5 Euro.
My stay is satisfied and will come back again. Highly recommended.
Muy Bien! ",5,2016,06,11
46,Superb,"We have just returned from this hotel having booked it to see Coldplay in concert at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona.

Having visited the city last year and not been very satisfied with the hotel we had stayed at then,we did some more research this time.We needed somewhere reasonably close to the stadium and wanted somewhere a little quieter but still within walking distance of some of the city sights.This hotel came up trumps on all our requirements.

When we arrived,we were greeted courteously and in a friendly manner and we were checked in quickly and efficiently.Our luggage was then taken to our room for us.The room was spacious,clean and well equipped.We had a decent sized balcony with 2armchairs overlooking the garden.As my husband had mentioned that it was his birthday,when we returned to our room later that evening a bottle of Cava was left in our room in an ice bucket along with 2 glasses(a very nice touch)

Our only complaints about the room was that although the bathroom was separate from the rest of the room there was no door in between and the handbasin was cracked.

As the hotel was on the hill/mountain overlooking the City,there was a fabulous view all around including some sea and port views.It was about a 20/25 minute walk down to La Ramblas and the harbour area but it took a little longer to walk back uphill.
Taxis are easy to find if you prefer not to tackle the hill.Also,the cable car runs from the Barceloneta area virtually back up to the hotel.Another mode of transport which runs nearby the hotel is the open top bus which is one of the hop on hop off variety and takes you all around the city.

When we checked out,the chap summoned a taxi and took our luggage out for us.

All in all we couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel",5,2016,05,29
46,Cold food and arrogant service,"We visited this hotel yesterday for a light dinner. We went for the menu in the bar, which had a good variety of choice. We settled on several tapas to share and ordered drinks and wine.
The hotel itself is very well appointed and we sat on the patio which has a great view.
Whilst our food was tasty, it was all quite cold, which was disappointing, however we persevered.
The main issue I have though, is that the bar staff / waiters were not attentive at all. So much so, that when we ordered further drinks from one waiter, he came back empty handed and informed us that the bar was shutting!
My quite valid protests fell on deaf ears and it seemed like the Hotel was happy to take our money and not worry about service. In fact the main barman was quite arrogant about the situation.",2,2016,05,28
46,Worth the money,"We spent a week in the hotel and are very satisfied with their service. Very friendly staff (Sarah is best with her gorgeous smile and positive energy), delicious breakfast, clean and spacious room, great classic mojito, great location.",5,2016,05,28
46,Excellent Location!,"We've stayed there for 3 nights in the premium room on the 6-th floor. The staff we encountered all spoke great english and were willing to help. The room is nothing special, the standard stuff for five-star hotel, but the terrace is very huge and sunny, facing the magnificent Barcelona city skyline and mediterranean sea.

I think the hotel is in an excellent location - on one of the beautiful slopes of Montjuïc hill (Olympic Games were held here in '92!) with its parks and amazing spectacular views over the city. We made the walk from the Miramar to the Magic Fountain and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, I would say it was a lovely 20-25 minute walk. The city center is close (Las Ramblas, L'Aquarium, historic buldings), we just walked down the hill... and came back to the ""Miramar"" by taxi, which costs about 8-12€.

Wifi is free and the speed is good.

The pool and SPA: we just did not have time to ;)

Room Service 24h: fast, but the menu selection is small.

Although the room required renovation, I still put five stars rating, because of very good location, beautiful spectacular views over the city and mediterranean sea, and of course - very friendly staff!",5,2016,05,24
46,"Close to perfection! 4,5 if it was possible","Spent 3 nights in this magnificent hotel.
Simply great - great and helpful staff and nice surroundings at Montjuic.
Nice location - and with an upgrade a tremendous view of the city and the harbor.

The only issue we had was the very hostile head waiter at the breakfast buffet - maybe he just had a series of bad days... ;O)

But this is really worth a try since you are in Barcelona but with a distance but a view - and one of the best paella restaurants in the front yard (the Martinez!).

Put on your hiking shoes and explore the fabulous gardens residing behind the hotel.

This is a nice spot - and as a cherry on top of the cake you get the best Sagria at the Miramar cafe next to the tram to Barcelonetta (the Tram closes at 21.00 during the summer).",4,2016,05,20
46,Overrated,"I was there last week.
I was given a very good room @ the top floor. View was excellent.
Small details that were not so good:
Dock station was ""chained"" to the table.
Toiletteries were not replenished daily.
There were some small imperfections both on the floor as well as on the walls.
Dim sum at breakfast was not steaming.",4,2016,05,17
46,Exceptional!,"This beautiful 5 star hotel was a wonderful way to spend our last night in Barcelona.

We actually booked on Priceline with the name your own price feature. When we first arrived, we were disappointed that it was so far from Las Ramblas, however, the views are spectacular, as the hotel is perched up on the side of a hill.  The grounds and views were so amazing, we did not even go down for dinner, but stayed on the property to eat in the restaurant with great views.

The huge rooms are wonderfully equipped with a beautiful bathtub and a great shower. The beds are superior and our room had its own porch, which unfortunately we could not use due to rain. However, we will be back.

The staff could not have been any nicer as we were well attended to in every way possible.

I can highly recommend this hotel. It is definitely 5 star on all accounts!",5,2016,05,12
46,Good hotel in beautiful place,"Hotel have probably best views in town,situated on top of a cliff.
Good restaurant,friendly staff.
The only thing that annoyed us was charge for ordering taxi 2euro,when taxis were always around anyway.",4,2016,05,04
46,"Great location, terrible service, responsiveness and attention to detail","Great location on Montjuic hill.  Views over the harbour and the Med beyond. Our room had an enormous balcony. That's the good news. 

The bad is awfully bad -- the staff is very poor with customer service and attention to detail.  Our room had an outlet that didn't work, the bedside clock was completely wrong, and there was mould in the shower because the fan didn't work. Housekeeping either didn't notice or didn't care because none of this was fixed for days until I mentioned it to management. Their response is that they are usually meticulous about these things and they have repaired it since we left. But if they're meticulous, why didn't housekeeping report it to be fixed every single day they were in the room?  

On the day we left, we prebooked and prepaid for a taxi to the airport. As we waited in the lobby, a staff member came up and said this taxi outside was the one we were waiting for. When we arrived at the airport, we discovered to our horror that it wasn't. So I had to find cash to pay this taxi driver PLUS I had already paid for the prebooked taxi. This staff mistake cost me 40 Euros. The hotel said it was a misunderstanding, but why didn't the staff ask the taxi driver who they were waiting for before coming to us??  I told management that I should be reimbursed for this, as it was their mistake that caused this, and I'm still waiting for a reply a couple of weeks later.

Worst of all is that we had food poisoning from room service on our last night. Exactly six hours after eating, my wife had the worst food poisoning attack of her life. We had both eaten from a common plate for lunch, and I was fine, so there's no doubt it was the hotel room service that is to blame. The hotel promised me they'd inspect this and get back to me. Weeks later...and I'm still waiting... In fact, it took over a week to get even an initial reply to my complaints right after we returned.

I stayed at this hotel before and really liked it.  But this time, the lack of care or concern for the trouble and illness caused, the inattention to detail, the fact that staff were giving us mixed messages (this is a whole other issue which I won't get into here), had now led me to be utterly shocked and disappointed that a hotel can fail on so many levels.

The building itself and the location are so good.  If only the staff selection, training and follow-through when interacting with customers could match it, this would be a world-class property. It's clear though, since there were a litany of issues, that this is not a one-off, not a single person, this is a systemic, property-wide issue that demonstrates the people are not committed or able to deliver a world-class experience.",2,2016,05,03
46,Magnífico!,"The location is superb, step outside and you’ll enjoy one of the best views in the city.  We reached the hotel on the Teleférico del Puerto cable car which was an amazing way to arrive. There is also a bus stop just outside and a car park, or you could always walk up the hill.

I won’t dwell too much on describing the hotel, other than to confirm that it is as fabulous as it looks and has all the facilities you’d expect for a hotel of this class and is well maintained.

The bedroom was large with a large balcony, separate bathroom, shower (also large) and WC.  The bed was comfortable, the decor was modern and even though we were at the back of the hotel (facing up the mountain), we still had a great view towards the North West of the city.

The staff were great, especially the barman who was very liberal in pouring the single malts we ordered.

Breakfast wasn’t included and was a bit pricey, but it was one of the best I’ve experienced, there was so much choice and it was all fresh and delicious.

Our evening meal seemed a little pricey at first, but given the quality of the food, the great service from our waiter and the ambience, I think it turned out to be quite reasonable.

I wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2016,04,21
46,Drinks on the terrace after cable car ride,"We visited here as part of our cable car ride
We got a return trip but got off at the top for a walk then went to the restaurant bye trace and had a drink in the sun with a fab view, what more can you ask for 
Lovely place
We didn't want any food but what we saw looked good",5,2016,04,19
46,Amazing hotel - Modern - great facilities - amazing service,"Hotel Miramar was our choice for our 'Minimoon' following our wedding in April 2015. the hotel was by far the nicest place I have ever stayed. The modern design and the facilities were amazing. The staff couldnt be more helpful. Unfortunately we could not afford to eat in the hotel but spent lots of time in the city. The hotel has a great view over the city and the sea. A great walk down, but definitely a taxi ride back up the mountain.",5,2016,04,15
46,Vacation,"Hotel view is great but it is too far from the city center and all the monuments. It just took us 10 min. from rail station but much longer to the airport.

Hotel service was terrible, no welcome during our check in and even worse we didnt have a single stuff in our room such as WATER - kettle for making tea - taps were leaking and room service was trying to do some cost saving on putting shampoos and body gels ... although we have complained alot but no one felt responsible and if i had a chance i would change my hotel on the same day.

Breakfast was more or less efficient and you had some choices to start your day.  Taxi dont even mention it, if you are looking for a taxi you should wait almost 20 min. until they call and ask for a taxi as you can not walk to the main street!!!!!

Frankly the hotel doesn't deserve a 5 star hotel even if you take premium room. I never suggest this hotel to any one.",1,2016,04,08
46,far from 5 stars,"This is 5 stars hotel so expectations are adequate to this. Unfortunately, the hotel did not meet them. The list of shortcomings could be very long, but I'll mention the most important: - Untrained staff not speaking English and not capable to answer any questions - Tragic service restaurant during breakfast or lunch (lack of products on breakfast, but they pull your plate to finish faster) - Room cleaning lasts forever - we were leaving about 12 and coming back at 17 to untidy room - After leaving for pool outside the door shuts automatically, you can not return unless passing the restaurant. In conclusion - hotel in need of renewal and with incompetent service, which pretends 5 stars. Curiosity was to block double money on my card, which I failed so far to recover. Definitely avoid this place.",2,2016,04,03
46,Lovely Views,"Lovely settings, great views and mostly genuinely nice and helpful staff.  But still somewhat lacking in terms of following through on service. I stayed for 4 nights and had a lovely, comfortable room with balcony and the views! Sadly, on arrival, I had to go back downstairs with hand luggage entow because my key card did not work and a lady working on the floor was not very helpful at all.  In total, I had to get my key card recoded 4 times!  The housekeeping side of it was questionable - twice I had to returned to the room and things had been left in the bathroom or not replaced.  Two very tiny bottles of water left on arrival which were not replaced once consumed.  No ability to make tea or coffee in the room.....Would have been nice for the jet lagged waking at 2 or 3 am wanting something comforting to drink. The restaurant was very good.",4,2016,03,11
46,Gorgeous Getaway with a View!,"I stayed for just one night with my boyfriend when we wanted to get ""out"" of the city. Hotel Miramar is located in the Montjuic area of Barcelona and sits above the city. From the back patio and gardens there are lovely views of the port and everything else inside is just as gorgeous. We went before Christmas and loved the tall trees in the lobby, incredible breakfast buffet, champagne upon arrival, and all the amenities. The spa is fantastic and soothing and bonus - the kitchen staff helped me with my gluten-free dietary needs! Close to incredible tapas (in Poble Sec) and some incredible art museums, this is a great place to stay.",5,2016,03,08
46,Good place to saty in Barcelona,"We really enjoined this hotel. Balcony was great. the best part is the location - very close to Barcelona city. 
Rooms were ok. Food was good especially breakfast - great selection of fruits and vegetables.",4,2016,03,06
46,Ultimate relaxing hotel,"We stayed for four nights and had a wonderful time; the staff are extremely helpful and friendly from the concierge/reception staff to the bar/breakfast staff/room service/housekeeping ladies. 
Excellent breakfast with freshly made bread (obsessed with the olive bread); lots of fresh fruit daily, juices, patisserie, hot food, cheeses etc and a nespresso machine.
The rooms were beautifully presented, beds were super comfortable, huge bathrooms with lovely products, great gym and spa facilities.  
Great views over Barcelona from the terrace and our balcony.  Will definitely be returning, fell in love with Barcelona, the architecture, the people and the food. Thank you to the hotel for making our visit such a memorable one.  Zoe :) ",5,2016,02,22
46,Hotel Miramar ,"My partner booked us to go away to Barcelona in the January this year, we stayed at the hotel Miramar. As we arrived we were given each a glass of complimentary champagne on arrival which was lovely, and the reception staff were very welcoming and polite!  

We were then shown to our room, which was not what it looked like on the website, my boyfriend had booked the premium room which turned about to not be a premium room, in fact they had just given us a standard room but just gave it to us as premium only because the view was good! (Which it was, I could not fault the views from the rooms, amazing!) me and my boyfriend don't like to make a fuss the room was still nice just not what we expected from the website!

As I went to settle down our suitcases I went to use the Lavatory, which I then noticed there were ants running around the toilet seat, as if there were an ants nest close by! I called the receptionist and complained about the ants and then I mentioned the fact we didn't have the exact room we requested, the receptionist then moved us to a junior sweet which was much nicer and looked a lot more like the website pictures! But there were still ants all running around the bathroom, absolutely everywhere which I complained about but nothing was done of it! 

I would say the hotel is overall a nice place to stay it has good character, polite staff stunning views, but I would not give them very good ratings due to cleanliness, even the carpets around the bed were not clean they looked as if they needed a good clean! Cleanliness wasn't great!

But we enjoyed our stay here in Barcelona! The food was nice, but not much choice! ",2,2016,02,08
46,"Great service, food and views","Overall I praise the service, we were received by Simone, who gave spot on information about local attractions and was all the time, along Jonathan, looking to make our stance more enjoyable. My party was given a corner room with sensational views to sea and city. The service at restaurant was amazing, wow what a great breakfast buffet, and the service of three young ladies, 2 named Maria Jose and Miriam, was exceptional, but all the waiting staff was really good and attentive. Moreover, the rooms were cleaned to perfection every day, and room service was delicious – go for the burger. Recommendations: if you could get a corner room with views to city and sea those are the best, and I suggest you either book with breakfast inclusive or take the breakfast offer, it is worth it!",5,2016,02,07
46,"Wow, what a view","Lovely contemporary hotel. check into my room and had a huge balcony with an amazing view of Barcelona. Looks even more beautiful at night. 
Small restaurant but never over crowded, and plenty of choice. 
Staff very attentive, big thumbs up from me :)",4,2016,02,02
46,Offers breathtaking views of Barcelona however the service could be improved,"The location of this hotel couldn't be any better. Hotel Miramar offers a view of this wonderful city that is way beyond description. Simply breathtaking! However, the staff at the reception (particularly the female staff which was there on sunday the 24th of Jan 2016) is bad for the reputation of this so called ""5 star hotel"". We asked her to arrange a trip to Camp Nuo for us which she promised she would  in 10 minutes. After not hearing  from her for a quarter of an hour we left. On our way out at the reception we heard her busy selling some sort of touristic motorbike activity to some people and she totally ignored us. This behaviour is simply unaccepted for a 5 star hotel where you pay a lot to stay. Apart from the service everything else was fine.",4,2016,01,29
46,"Great view, that's it really ","The suite was big and food is OK. But we found lots of ants on the floor and they charged us an extra day although they told us we could leave earlier without charging. It's 20 minutes walk to the port and city center, nothing much around the hotel. Plus it's on a small mountain so walking back was a bit difficult 

The breakfast was very delicious and you can see that the staff try their best ",3,2016,01,27
46,Very nice place to stay,"I have been in the hotel 2 days for business. It is really a beautiful place on a hill, with a great view over the city and harbor. Also it is walking distance to Barcelona city. Gym was also okay. Dinner was good. Staff friendly.
",4,2016,01,22
46,"""Welcoming staff but...""","I found using a credit card somewhat stressful.  Staff, who were pleasant with assistance, greetings, and other cordial social graces took a long time retrieving their credit card machine to charge my expenditures.  Suggest Using your own euros.",1,2016,01,08
46,"Bathroom moldy, not a 5 star standard","I was disappointed. I found a dirty bathroom smelling of mold and the hotel is generally worn down and not a 5 star house anymore. 

An email with my complaints wasn't even answered. 

I will not return to Miramar even though the location and view is quite exceptional. ",1,2015,12,26
46,Poor service,"I have spent 7 days at this hotel between Dec 10 and Dec 17 2015. While this hotel has a nice location and i have a nice room. There are several issues which made my stay unpleasant, especially towards the end of my stay. 

1. Poor quality slippers for Spa, sauna and swimming
The slippers provided are of such a low quality that it's very dangerous (extremely slippery) to walk on wet floors!

2. Sauna, spa and indoor swimming facilities do not match what has been advertised. 

3. Receptionists are not keen on helping out explaining to taxi drivers about the address. They said that all taxis use GPS. 

4. Communication between receptionist and cleaning department doesn't seem to go through from time to time. I requested for the extra mattress to be removed, as the temperature was too high in the room, and the central heating system doesn't work so well. The message didn't go through somehow and luckily i was in the room when someone came to check the minibar. The staff was very helpful then and helped me remove the extra mattress. I told her not that it's okay to keep the extra mattress in the room that day, but was certainly expecting them to remove such a big object the next day. The extra mattress was stored in my room until i checked out! 

5. Poor handling of noise complaint
For the last two days of my stay, a neighbour was shouting very loudly every morning (from 7.20am onwards, and from 8am onwards), not continuously for the whole two hours, but every now and then, and lasting for a couple of hours. I didn't complain for the first morning. When i was woken by again on the second morning at 8am, i called the reception immediately and requested that they see to the situation. Nothing happened. I recorded the screaming when i got up at 9am, called the reception again. Another receptionist answered and said they didn't notice anything at 8am. I asked her to come to my room and listen it for herself. No one came. When i finally went downstairs at 9.30am and let them listen to my recordings, they realized that they should have been more responsive earlier, but didn't do anything except saying they are sorry.",1,2015,12,17
46,Excellent Stay!,"My best friend and I have travelled throughout Spain for a month and Hotel Miramar was our first stop.  Upon arrival, Manuel greeted us very kindly by our first names and made us feel right at home!  He was so friendly and welcoming and chatted with us for a while, answering our questions and recommending a few places which we enjoyed visiting. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all the other staff were also very friendly and made us feel welcome as well.  This hotel is a definite must, and a very close cab ride to the main areas of Barcelona for food and tourist attractions! We didn't take transit so I'm not sure how that is, but a cab ride to most places was very reasonable, at 10-15 Euros per trip!  Before we left many people emphasized that taxis would rip us off, but we never experienced that at all, and everyone we met was very kind and honest.",5,2015,12,11
46,cruise overnight stay,"Great hotel clean staff very helpful room are great although for the price they could do with a little upgrade looking a bit tiered ,views over the city and port fantastic .The food in the bar we had lunch was very good although breakfast for the price was disappointing hot food was cold and not much choice compared to other hotels .",5,2015,12,11
46,Booking made 4 months in advance cancelled days before,"Firstly - I must admit this is a much delayed review as my husband just reminded me I didn't write it back in 2013! 

Travelling to Barcelona from Adelaide, Australia for our honeymoon in Dec 2013, we made a booking 4 months before. All confirmed, paid for. We had even sent a number of emails to the hotel leading up to it.

1 week before our booking, we are told the hotel is ""overbooked"". December in Barcelona is very low season, and given we had booked 4 months in advance, this was clearly untrue. 

We were offered an alternate hotel (in the same room category with no upgrade, free breakfast etc) which was 25km away. I asked if they would offer any reimbursement for travel associated to the new hotel and they declined to offer anything other than breakfast.

We declined the offer and stayed in an Exec room at the Hilton which was a great location to walk to Camp Nou and catch line L3 subway (we had previously spent a week in an apartment on Passeig de Gracia).",1,2015,12,08
46,The Best Hotel Ever,"Should be 6 Star, this Hotel is excellent, the rooms, staff, location, swimming pool, restaurant. Proposed to my Girlfriend here, now Fiancée. You could not find a more stunning romantic hotel. Location is a 20 minute walk to Las Ramblas
      ",5,2015,12,03
46,Fantastic,"This hotel was amazing. The view was breathtaking and the hotel itself was beautiful too. It was clean, modern and all of the staff were sooo friendly (giving us champagne on arrival). Both the indoor & outdoor pools were great and the sauna was also good. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again. Would recommend to everyone",5,2015,12,02
46,"beautiful rooms, great hotel","It is a very beautiful luxury hotel at a quiet location overlooking the Barcelona port. We had a fantastic room with a beautiful terrace, breakfast was great too and in November we were lucky that the weather was so good that you could even use the outdoor pool.",5,2015,11,17
46,Fantastic staff and the views aren't bad either,"I have been meaning to write this review for a few weeks now. My wife and I stayed in Hotel Miramar in September for a couple of nights as part of our wedding trip. 

There are so many highlights for this hotel:

- Beautiful location in the hills of Montjuic. The hotel has spectacular views directly overlooking the main parts of the city. The hotel has some beautiful grounds to relax and soak up the views. 

- Breakfast on the veranda each morning was so peaceful and such a wonderful setting for this incredible city. 

- Even if your room doesn't face out over the city the gardens to the back of the hotel makes for a really nice setting with a glass of wine on the patio. 

- Xavi and the team at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful and really made our experience there even more special.
   
Will definitely be visiting again and would have no question recommending to others.",5,2015,11,15
46,Superb stay,"We stayed at Hotel Miramar for our 20th anniversary for five days. Our stay at the hotel was totally great. The hotel, service and location were absolutely magnificent. Special thanks to outstanding service at the lobby bar. Certainly we`ll come back here as soon as possible.",5,2015,11,14
46,"Super location, staff, facilities","This is a beautiful hotel overlooking Barcelona's port - even though situated on the hill it is still only 10mins cab from all of the Ramblas action. I recommend getting a room overlooking the port for the best view. The staff were superb, the restaurants on site are brilliant, there is a great outdoor pool, and spa, and in general I would highly recommend.",5,2015,11,08
46,Very nice and convinient,"The location of the hotel on top of the mountain is superb, hotel is very clean and generally it's not expensive. The staff are EXTREMLY nice and professional. Location is great not far from la rambla. I definitely will come back to this hotel on my 2nd visit to Barcelona ",5,2015,11,04
46,Great G&T,"We passed the hotel after getting off the cable car and fancied a nice lunchtime drink. Ended up with a G&T each. Good choice and too be fair Vicente quality and status of the 5 star hotel the prices were reasonable. 

Lovely seats on the terrace by the park with good views of the city. Can't afford to stay there.",4,2015,10,30
46,"V Nice hotel, excellent service, just a stones throw from Barcelona...","The staff at the Miramar were exceptionally helpful and polite and went that extra mile... We even had a celebratory complimentary bottle of fizz because we were celebrating my birthday.  The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and small but perfectly adequate spa & swimming pool.  The rooms are great, with amazing views from the balcony.  We were in one of the larger rooms on the v top floor - there was a bit of a musty smell, but the staff came and sorted it out quickly.  Location is perfect if you don't mind a short walk into the centre - the benefit is that it is extremely quiet at night. ",4,2015,10,29
46,Very unprofessional,"We booked to stay three nights at the end of a week in Barcelona. We booked eight months ahead in February to stay in October. They took our money and kept it for eight months and then a few days before the booking they cancelled because they were overbooked. In other words, they gave the booking to people who booked later than us. We were offered a completely different hotel on the Avenue Diagonal, miles from the harbour and Montjuic area, which was no good to us. We found another hotel nearby ourselves at a slightly higher price because of the late booking (900 Euros for three nights) and walked into the Miramar to ask why they had cancelled. They had no excuse, just said other people had also booked. When we mentioned that we'd booked eight months in advance they just said that's how it is sometimes. The desk clerk gave me the name of the booking manager (Paula Cabado) who was away on holiday. When we got back I emailed her asking why she had done this and got no reply. I waited a week and sent the email again. Still no reply so here is my review: they are completely unprofessional and care nothing for their guests or customers.",1,2015,10,29
46,PESSIMO - THE WORST,"1 - I forgot a shirt in my room, they told me they did not find anything.  The room was empty the days after my departure, so someone from the hotel has necessarly token it.  This simply could not happen in a 5 stars hotel.

2 - They do not how to deal with Amex

3 - It was impossible to pay the bill with two credit cards (only one allowed, no one knows why)

4 - They were extremely lazy to response to my complaints, but they were very quick to charge for the frigobar.....",1,2015,10,26
46,A special superb hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights  with my wife celebrating  her 60th birthday, A boutique hotel with spectacular views, the staff are its best kept secret, they treat you like family friends.

46,Pleasant quite and very comfortable hotel,"A very pleasant hotel ,clean and very good on the eye ,the staff are amazing ,a very good breakfast.
The cons are not good for celiacs no gluten free bread for breakfast or biscuits not good for hotel of this class.
A beautiful setting but for thr older generation who cannot walk far a bit off the beaten track need taxi .
Beautiful views from rooms over the main beachfront area and the harbor where the cruises leave from so good if on a cruise .",5,2015,10,23
46,Perfect location with exceptional views overlooking the city and harbor!,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Miramar for two days after completing our twelve day Mediterranean Cruise. The Hotel Miramar was quiet, comfortable and well appointed with a location that was perfect on Montjuic Hill not far from the cruise terminal with panoramic views overlooking the city of Barcelona and the harbor.  The location of the hotel is only a few short footsteps from the Hop-On Hop-Off bus stop #5 (orange bus route) which allowed us easy access for sightseeing the major attractions in Barcelona for a reasonable price (the buses arrive approximately every 7-20 minutes, each loop takes approximately 2 hours, and my wife and I purchased a two day bus pass voucher on the internet for $75.73). The Miramar restaurant, which is also just a few short footsteps from the hotel, located near the end of the Teleferico del Puerto (Barcelona aerial tramway connecting Montjuic Hill with the seaside waterfront), was reasonably priced with its exceptional views overlooking the city and harbor. If and when we return to Barcelona this would be our first choice in hotels.",5,2015,10,12
46,The Fabulous Miramar,"Can't rate this hotel enough, staff couldn't do enough for you they went above and beyond 5 star service . Our room was amazing stayed in a deluxe room and certainly not disappointed and with great  views over Barcelona . Spa and pool area just what was needed after touring around Barcelona. Breakfast and food in the hotel was delicious . Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the city who is looking for more than the hotels  5 star rating.",5,2015,10,10
46,Wonderful stay!!,"This hotel does not disappoint! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. ""I have selected this room for you, because of its size and views, but if you would prefer a terrace, I have another you can look at"". The room was a lovely size in three sections, lounge, bedroom and bathroom area. Very comfortable and 5 star all the way. Breakfast was wonderful and we used the indoor pool twice and the changing rooms have a sauna, steam room and jacuzzi in. (Switch on sauna and steam room before you swim, so it can heat up). Only issue was the shower door hit the rain shower head when you entered and bath, looks very modern design, but was difficult to manoeuvre in, get comfortable in.Will definitely return.",5,2015,10,08
46,Excellent experience,"We loved this wonderful hotel. Combination of luxury and elegance.
The hotel is quite big, but built in a smart way that avoids the ""stadium"" feeling.
Great rooms, excellent service, great views from the garden. Excellent breakfast, bar and food.
We didn't use the pools or the spa.
Location: Not in the middle of town. The plus: it is quiet and tranquil. The minus: you have to take transportation to town (taxis are cheap and many).
We will certainly return.",5,2015,10,05
46,Oasis of peace but close to the centre,"This hotel was faultless. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was quiet, and some touches of luxury, the breakfast was stunning, and outside our balcony was a terrace where locals would gather to look at the stunning view of the city below. This hotel is on Montjuic which is a hill overlooking the city , where there are formal gardens, the Miro museum, a castle, and amazing views to the city and sea. Its only a few minutes walk to the Rambla down the Carre Nou de la Rambla, with quiet local streets with restaurants far from the tourist crowds. There is also a gondola to take you straight to the port and Barcelonetta, perfect for a quiet dinner. It was a lovely stay and we would go back tomorrow.",5,2015,09,28
46,One of the best hotels in Barcelona,"Booked about 6 months ago as we had this hotel in our sights during our prvious visit to the city last year. Sitting on top of the Montujic mountain area, this has to be the best view from any hotel in Barcelona. We paid for a superior room with an amazing sea view, which has views across the city and bay/docks area- worth every penny as its great to wake up and watch the sunrise over breakfast. Wonderful size room, with a large tub, shower and everything you need. Location as I say is amazing but requires more cab trips than normal due to where it is located, however it is easy to walk down to the main areas etc through several safe routes ( I'm just lazy lol) service great and staff all very friendly. The bar and outside seating areas were perfect for a late evening drink overlooking the city. You HAVE to stay here. 10/10 . Pool areas were also great both outside and indoor pools, and the gym was excellent, I even used it a couple of times. You couldn't ask for more from a hotel.",5,2015,09,24
46,Very pleasant stay!,"We stayed at Miramar in Mid September.  I was very pleased with the hotel. The room and bedding was quite comfortable.  I especially enjoyed the free standing bathtub, as well as the rain shower.

The hotel is indeed a bit removed from the city, on Montjuic mountain. This is why I chose the hotel.  There is a lot to do up on the mountain (museums, amusements, Fountain, botanical, walking, etc).  We walked approximately 15 minutes to the funicular...which transports you down the mountain and into the Metro station.  It wasn't overly inconvenient. 

The view from the hotel was quite nice.  Our favorite part of the stay was the breakfast.

I would stay here again!.",4,2015,09,22
46,Miramar on Montjuic,"Recently we stayed  for 8 nights (7 nights, then 1 night before leaving Spain) at Hotel Miramar. The staff where excellent and helped us with our poor Spanish making us very welcome. The facilities where great, as was the house keeping. Whilst it maybe a short distance from town it is an easy walk to the train station or a leisurely stroll into La Rambla. The view over the town is fantastic especially at night. Most nights we ate in town, being visitors we wanted to try different places, however on our last night we had a meal in the restaurant, fabulous meal, excellent wait staff. A big thanks to the manager Jaucei for a great night.
One small complaint was on both Saturday nights, weddings where held at the hotel and they go on until 3am. Not so great if you have just travelled from the other side of the world as we had (35 hrs), ask for a room well away from the wedding area.
Otherwise highly recommended.",4,2015,09,05
46,4 Nights in Barcelona ,"My fiancé and I stayed for four nights midweek. We found no problem getting beds by the pool, but at busier times I envisage there would be stiff competition for beds (the canapé bed prices seems a bit OTT- though does include wine and lunch) We were happy with the room and it wasn't far into the town if you don't mind walking. Staff were polite and courteous but there didn't appear to many present at any one time. Overall worth 4 star rating.",4,2015,09,04
46,"some good,some bad","Stayed at the Miramar for 3 nights at the end of August.First of all,the staff were very nice and helpful which is very important.The hotel is in the hills above Barcelona which means you get great views,but you will need to use taxis.
The reception area is nice,quiet,and the welcome is warm.Our room with a small terrace was clearly designed by a man,mirrors etc in the wrong place,badly designed wardrobe
.In the middle of the room was a sliding curtain,behind which was the bath.It was taking open plan to the limit.There was a separate loo behind a frosted glass door.
All great if you are 20,but a few decades on,not so great !
Wi-Fi was free and no 20 digit passwords - very good.
There is a good sized pool area set into a large garden.There were some canopied beds which you had to pay extra (someone said 140 euros per day)but did not ask the price as we had to plans to pay extra.Then there were a few loungers,and I mean a few,a very few.So few in fact that there were none available,not surprising as there were so few !
It made no sense as there was so much empty space.There was also an abundance of mosquitoes and flies,but that is not the hotel`s fault.Having a pool with no loungers....... don`t get me started.
Visited The Arts and the W hotel,and if you are looking for a more buzzy and exciting hotel,those two looked great,but don`t know how their prices compare.
If you want somewhere quiet,enjoy open plan bathing and have packed a deckchair,this could be for you.",3,2015,09,03
46,Do NOT book this property if you want a 5 star hotel.,"if you are expecting a five star experience DO NOT come to this hotel!!! It is the WORST 
5 star property I have ever stayed in, more suited to a three star.With such a great choice of luxury hotels in this wonderful city  definitely give the Miramar a miss.

The only positive is the wonderful view overlooking the city, the rest is a disaster.

 Clearly there is a staff issue,with no housekeeping services in the evening,dirty towels remained till the next day along with dirty glasses,cups etc.Rooms were not cleaned on numerous occasions until 3pm in the afternoon .

The pool area is tired,beds are unavailable if there are more than 30 guests sunbathing, Guests had to lay on  towels on the grass to sunbathe! However if one is prepared to pay 150 euros there are  double sun beds to rent for the day....,absolutely ludicrous.. On one day the pool area was covered in glass shards from a wedding the previous night along with  large chunks in the pool itself ! It was only a guest informing the staff that this had occurred on stepping into the pool the following morning. No one had bothered to check or clean up from the night before.! While  the majority of staff were pleasant there was a general lack of training which resulted in slow,and sloppy service.
There are numerous issues with this hotel, I would certainly not return or recommend it in any way.",2,2015,09,01
46,Great view nice pool,"Great pool area and view. Nice room with large balcony with ocean view. Staff nice and friendly, service could be better, they seem to be understaffed, or to many managers just hanging around. Good for family. Our breakfast was not included, they charge 28€ per person so be ware. Very good singer/entertainment.",4,2015,08,27
46,Miramar Hotel is my worst experience for a 5 stars Hotel!,"An absolute do not go.. It started bad already, with me sending an email to the concierge, that was never replied. After 3 emails and 4 phone calls to get an answer, I had the concierge manager, explaining that the staff was busy during summer and that he was sorry but could not do anything faster, nor take time to confirm emails reception or timings; all this in a pretty aggressive tone. 

We arrived at the hotel at 12 as mentioned during the reservation, but the room was ready only at 3PM only… The room was good, however, we had some sewage smell in the entrance and the water of the shower was not stable… Also, the room is made only once a day, so if you make a nap or mess up the room a little during the afternoon, do not expect to see your bed redone or gently opened for the night. 

But what is really shocking is to see that, only young adults on internship are present at the hotel to execute the service during the day. There really little staff present across the board, and literally no senior staff at all. At the reception, all the front desks are young trainees trying there best... Same at the pool area, lobby or at the breakfast… And the few hotel staff members you can find seem to take care of way too many things. We had confirmation, after I asked why it was so chaotic in the hotel, that the staff is mainly on internship programs, and that it is very tough to assure the service expected by clients anymore… We noticed this and were not the only clients as per others confirmations. I could write more about the hotel, but will stop here.",1,2015,08,26
46,Family visit 15th-21st August 2015   Suite and connecting room,"Room 403 was spectacular.Very large lounge, double bathroom, spacious bedroom area. Balcony was the largest in the hotel with beautiful views over the city,marina and port. Room was every well appointed, good coffee machine ( which always remained full ), very very clean which was maintained by the household staff during our stay. Breakfast was well organised. Efficient to seat, coffee at once and then plenty of time to use the self serve buffet, or simply take time out waiting you cooked egg order. Either option, the food was well presented, cooked and every day changes were made to avoid a sense of ""same old,same old"" creeping in. Our girls joining room, overlooked the pool which they loved and again a good size balcony.Room service was good and housekeeping kept the tidy ( after all, there were 2 x teenagers in that room !! )

Short overview. Recommend to all. Clean, spacious rooms ( if you ask for 403 you won't be disappointed ) Good standard of cleanliness, service and wide variety of activities to do with the pool and spa / sauna .

Only slight observation. My wife order a caesar salad ( which on the menus came with chicken ) She had requested if possible to remove the chicken and replace with prawns. In the pas this has not been an issue, however our waitress stood firm and without checking with Chef, repeated 3 times this is not possible as it is not on the menu..!!!  Maybe a little more flexibility would have been better received..",5,2015,08,22
46,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC HOTEL !!!,"Stunning hotel with the very best staff and the views from the terrace and grounds are magnificent. You do need to get a taxi to most parts of the city unless you are a fitness fanatic but it is fairly cheap to get to the main town (about 8 Euros) The pool area is gorgeous, the rooms are absolutely breathtaking with egg shaped baths, rain showers and large comfortable beds. I've been to Barcelona 4 times and previously stayed at TheArts & The Pullman Skipper (both fantastic hotels) but I will definitely be staying here in future - 6 stars from us !!!",5,2015,08,21
46,Wonderful stay at the hotel miramar,"We spent 4 nights at the hotel in a deluxe room overlooking the port. All the staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The pool area is a well designed space with drinks and snacks available at the pool bar where the staff were delightful. It's a pleasant 20 minute walk into the city and a short taxi ride back up the hill. We will definitely be returning and spreading the word.",5,2015,08,20
46,Fantastic stay at a wonderful hotel,"Just returned from a 5 night stay with my wife and 21 month old daughter.  The staff were fantastic, couldn't do enough for us and made our stay a wonderful experience.  Rooms were extremely comfortable, facilities great and stunning views over the harbour.  A relaxing place that strangely would suit couples, families or friends",5,2015,08,17
46,First Holiday Together,Came here for our first romantic getaway and could not have faulted the place in any way shape or form. Beautiful suites and facilities. Very close to the cable car which takes you to the beach. If you rent a moped (hotel has good rates) then you can explore the city of which most is close by. The concierge are amazing and recommended some of the best restaurant. ABaC was phenomenal. ,5,2015,08,11
46,Amazing! ,"My family and I, stayed at the Miramar from 1st August to the morning of 8th August. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Miramar, our rooms were of the highest standard and the hotel staff were above and beyond our expectations. We would not choose to stay anywhere else! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone as it is family friendly, great views and despite not being very central, it has great access to the city! The Miramar is also near fantastic tourist sites including the MonJuic Cable car service, and the cable car that reaches the port, not to mention taxi's are almost always available! Thank you to the Miramar staff, who made our trip even more special! 💕",5,2015,08,08
46,"Friendly helpful staff and good service, but premises require investment","PLUS: top location, very helpfull staff.  Ideal wedding location.  Relaxing athmosphere, pleasant views over the harbor and ocean.  Excellent restaurant. Spacious quiet guest rooms. Automatic WIFI throughout the premises.

MINUS: Throughout the hotel the decor requires touch up, for example where paint is peeling or rot is setting in.  
Our shower room would not allow to be opended fully due to the shower head protruding from the ceiling and blocking the door opening half way - this must be a longstanding issue and it appears management has not felt the need to address this issue since the shower was designed (which is telling). Also the shower door could not be closed and the marble floor panes wobble when stepping in and out of the shower.  Water pressure dropped considerably while taking a shower in the morning and for other guests taking a shower later there was no water at all. 
Overpriced pool ""cabanas"" (big four post double lounger) at €150/day. 
A/C control in our room seemed sluggish.",3,2015,08,03
46,Good hotel great views,"Would happily stay here again, spacious rooms, everything worked. Lovely views from terrace nice place to sit and have a drink or a meal. Dinner here was excellent good food and knowledgeable staff. No complaints, staff helpful and attentive.",4,2015,07,29
46,Fabulous,"This was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at. I was there for 5 nights and it felt like home. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The staff is friendly and prompt. The views from the hotel are breathtaking. We were welcomed with a bottle of cava in our room upon arrival, and there was a candy stand in the lobby where i would keep taking candy from! Room service was delicious. I loved that the bathroom products were L'Occitane. As an added bonus, there was free wifi everywhere in the hotel including the rooms. The pool area is small but nice and a great place to have drinks. The hotel is on a hilltop so its not walking distance from anything but its only a 10 min drive to the center.  A great place for a vacation.",5,2015,07,28
46,Good if you've been in Barcelona earlier,"- the location has its benefits although it's not good for a longer stay only in the city
- friendly, although not that effective service, proper English
- garage
- outside pool is nice for relaxing, small for swimming
- good size shower
- small terrace
- free wifi
- ok value for money",3,2015,07,26
46,Got stolen our iPad from our locked hotel room,"Got stolen our iPad from our locked hotel room

On our honeymoon, we had 5 days at the Hotel Miramar from 16 July 2015 to 21 July 2015. We were very excited about the hotel and staff the first days, its a nice modern hotel with really good professional staff in the bar and restaurant, good food and a great view.
On the third day on Saturday 18 july - we had agreed to have our  ""romantic bath"" (included in our hotel package), which should be ready pm. 22:00 in our room, incl. Cava. We left our room a little before pm 20:00 to eat in the hotel restaurant and went back to the room at pm 22.10. The romantic-bath had been made - but there was no Cava and my husband iPad was gone. We looked everywhere for the iPad, which he had left on the bed - maybe service staff have moved on. But it was not there and we go to the front desk and tell them about the situation. The staff were welcoming and we suggested them to see the surveillance film from the hallway, we of course wanted to know who had been in our room. Unfortunetly we hadn’t activated “find my iPad” because we ONLY used it in house were we feel save! 
The reception staff were understanding and would investigate the situation. We did not get any new information that night and were told that we could talk to the manager the next day. 
Next day we got the knowledge that the external security firm has seen through monitoring and only 2 service/cleaning staff had been in our room while we were away. We can not speak with the manager, who is not there on Sundays, we have to settle for middle management, which says that the external cleaning company will talk to the employees who have been in our room. It is very clear to us that we have been robbed and it's very constricted who might have done it ... My husband chose to spend half a day to go to the police and report the theft. When we three days after the theft must travel home, no one have yet spoken with the service/cleaning staff that is proven was in our room and we have not been offered any compensation, besides that we did not have to pay for our romantic bath at our request. We only had our room cleaned once after the theft, and only because we were sure that every valued item was in the safe. 
We were treated with sympathy, but due to the lack action from the hotel in the process and lack of compensation we feel very badly treated by a five star hotel management - we expected more!

We were very angry, spent much time evaluating what to do and spended time on the police station, the romantic bath was destroyed, my husband ipad stolen with all of our pictures from our trips together, weddingpictures and our new house, and we didn’t felt comfortable the rest of our stay.. Our stay at Hotel Miramar cost us about 640 euros more and a very bad stay because of the theft.

We can not recommend this place to anyone! – The Service/cleaning staff that was in our room that evening is according to our knowledge still hired to clean the rooms.",1,2015,07,21
46,Great views!,"We had 3 nights at the Miramar in mid-July as a last minute booking.
 
We had to carry our own bags from the taxi into the hotel, but the taxi drops you right outside the door. The 20-minute taxi journey to the airport was 30 Euro’s. Check-in was slick and we were greeted with a glass of sparkling Cava. I thought the receptionist, Riccardo, was very friendly and helpful and this is a part of the journey that I think the Miramar have just right.

We stayed in a premium room with a balcony (room 509) The negatives are: no iron/ironing board (although one was sent up when we requested it), no coffee making facilities, no complementary drinking water, no door on the bathroom (by design), although the toilet is separate with a door, the glass door on the toilet making a horrible scraping noise as it drags across the stone floor and there is a shooting range very close by, so periodic gunfire disturbs the tranquillity when sitting on the balcony, but it is not overly intrusive. The positives are that the room is light and airy, the bed very comfortable, the rooms are kept very clean, a nice sized balcony with lovely views across Barcelona and free Wi-Fi that works well.

The hotel is a few minutes by taxi from the centre. Taxis are metered and plentiful around Barcelona. As an alternative, there is a cable car opposite the hotel, operating until 8pm, which drops you in the old town area (about 16 Euros for a return trip or 11 Euros one way). We also bought a 2-day ticket for the hop-on, hop-off tour bus. This stops just outside the hotel and has 3 different routes covering the whole of the city and seems to arrive about every 5 minutes at peak time and was well worth the 38 Euro’s per person for two days. 

The hotel’s main bar is very nice with outside tables with spectacular views across the city. The bar was usually very busy and it was often impossible to get a table outside. The waiters were very friendly but clearly overworked, so the service was universally poor and well below the standard I would expect from a 5-star hotel. The hotel must lose a lot of sales because of this. We would have to walk to the bar to ask the bar staff to bring fresh drinks over. Bar snacks were very slow coming as well and there was a lack of flexibility. For example, there is a ham sandwich with cheese on the menu but it is apparently “not possible” for the restaurant to provide a plain cheese sandwich (in the kitchen of a 5-star hotel this is hard to believe). Room service is also painfully slow.

We ate at the hotel restaurant the first night, which was very quiet. We thought the food was interesting in that the chef was clearly trying to provide something a bit different, but we didn’t like any of it at all.  The restaurant service was very good, apart from us booking a table for 8pm with reception only to find on arrival that the restaurant did not open until 8.20pm! After this, we ate lunch and dinner in the city, where we found the food to be first class. We asked reception for restaurant recommendations and to make the dinner bookings for us, which worked out very well. I can highly recommend the Can Majó fish restaurant on L' Almirall Aixada, 23, which was fantastic and a short walk from the cable car drop off point.

We had breakfast in the hotel every morning. This was a fairly standard hotel buffet but there was a good selection and the food and coffee was very good. We found nowhere better within walking distance so I would recommend this.

Overall, my impression of the Miramar was that (apart from reception and housekeeping) the service and restaurant are not 5-star standard but to be fair the rooms are not 5-star prices either, even on the hotel website, so I think it provides very good value for money. I think the inconvenience of having to get transport in and out of the city is more than made up for by the friendliness of the staff and views afforded by the hotels elevated position. Overall, I thought the hotel offered very good value for money and I would recommend it.",4,2015,07,19
46,Outstanding!,"We booked this property having stayed in Barcelona previously but in a city centre hotel. This hotel is a 5 minute walk down a hill to a metro station where you have easy access to the rest of Barcelona. It benefits from an elevated position next to the cable car with beautiful gardens.
The hotel itself is lovely - the food is really good - but the staff - every single one of them are absolutely superb!
From the welcome from Laia to the bar staff to the restaurant and spa staff - everyone is just so welcoming I will 100% be back to stay here. It is outsnading!",5,2015,07,09
46,5star hotel,"The view from the room was breath taking! You can see all of Barcelona from the room. The terrace in the bedroom was very good too.  Ordering  room service and watch the sun go down at the terrace as you drink a cocktail before dinner. The breakfast was a buffet and it  was  good. Next time I'm in Barcelona, I will definitely stay here!",5,2015,07,08
46,Fabulous finale to our month in Spain!,Blissful retreat atop Montjuc hill ...great hotel to unwind and relax after frenetic adventures in cities!

Views over city and ocean glorious from balconies where a cool drink and delicious tapas may bed enjoyed. 2 nights too little...need a week there! Close to National Art Gallery which is stunning!,5,2015,07,02

46,Fantastic in every way,"I have just returned from a weeks stay at the Miramar, the hotel is fantastic, the location for me was fine as I always get taxis everywhere so being on a hill wasn't an issue, the pool area was never busy and I always managed to get a bed, the pool is quite small but adequate for cooling off in, every member of staff I came across was polite and couldn't do enough for you when you asked for anything but didn't bother you when you didn't need them, my room was lovely with the most amazing baloney, I will not mention my room number as I will be going back and booking direct with the hotel and the less people that know the room number the better chance I have of getting it when I request it (sorry),can't wait to go back!",5,2015,06,26
46,"Fab hotel, loved it!","Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of April and this has to be one of my favourite hotels I have ever stayed in.  
As soon as we arrived the first impression was fabulous.  Checking in we were offered a glass of bubbly and given all the information we needed by the lovely Aina.  We were early checking in and they had got a room ready but she said if we didn't mind waiting for about an hour they had a 'better' room.  We agreed to wait and it was so worth it!  We had a room on the top floor with the most amazing view of all of Barcelona!  Fantastic.  
We had room service a couple of times and it was delicious and delivered promptly. 
We were offered a discount to add breakfast to our stay and it was very good. 
I agree with other reviewers that it's a little out of the way but I'm not that great at walking and we managed to get to most places we wanted on foot.  We did get a cab back from Sagrada Familia though but it was only 12 Euros.
The park up the hill behind the hotel is beautiful, def worth a visit.  We wouldn't have gone there but decided to walk back to the hotel from the Palace and we were so glad we did.
In the evenings it was lovely to sit on the terrace watching the activity in the Port below us and the view of Barcelona change when all the lights are on.
If I ever return to Barcelona this hotel would be my first choice.",5,2015,06,14
46,If its the right place for you its fantastic!,"First ask yourself what it is that you want from your BCN hotel. This was our third trip to the city in 2 years. Previously we have rented an apartment bang in the centre, open the door and there's the city. Returning this year we wanted more of a laid back experience and for this the Miramar was perfect. The location is incredible with views across the sea and entire city. It does of course come at a price, in this case the need to pretty much take a taxi out and back every day. We never had a problem getting a cab from the viewing point 20mtrs from the door, but it does add to the overall expense.

The staff are absolutely lovely - when we arrived we weren't happy with the lack of balcony - the staff couldn't have been more accommodating and showed us every other room in the hotel. The room we settled on was beautiful and enormous. The hotel has a very laid back and chilled vibe. Unusually for a city centre hotel we spent a couple of hours each day around the pool which was a nice respite from the pounding the city streets. 

Overall this a fabulous hotel particularly for a grown up city break. The only warning I'd give is that unless your rate includes breakfast don't bother with it as an extra - and at the best part of £50 for 2 ridiculously overpriced.

Will definitely be back!",5,2015,06,13
46,Good hotel,"Only spent a night at the Miramar. The room was decorated with taste, had everything needed except a coffee machine which I think is a let down for an hotel of this rank, Wifi was good, liked the balcony although the view wasn't really good. Great breakfast and staff was very helpful and attentive to my needs. 

Only 1 complain: there is a shooting range few meters away from the hotel.. couldn't locate exactly where but for sure we could hear the noise ! 

I won't spend my holidays there but it was perfect for a business trip.",4,2015,06,11
46,"Amazing view, amazing reception/concierge staff, amazing facilities, amazing location!!","Our first impression when we got to the hotel lobby was wonderful...beautiful, spacious and clean with friendly reception staff. 
Our next pleasant surprise was when we first entered our room (519). We had booked a junior suite which had a very large balcony, and that view of the port and the city was stunning. The hotel is located on a hill away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet only minutes away by foot or by taxi. The junior suite consisted of two large rooms, one bedroom and one sitting area, and a large bathroom with a shower with about 8 spray jets. Only negative comment is that the bathrooms should have ventilation as it tends to get humid an damp. 
The reception/concierge was amazing, and while I can't remember his name (please forgive me), he was so helpful and went out of his way for us. Management should know that this gentleman is a keeper employee and they will know him by the fact that he was the one who told us where to go off the beaten path to get hot chocolate and churros. He did not disappoint in taking messages, making reservations and booking tours...he was simply great.
We entertained guests from the US while we were there and they were just as pleased with the hotel as we were.  
Definitely will recommend this hotel, and Barcelona for that matter, as a must try. My wife and I will definitely be going back.",5,2015,06,10
46,Fell short of expectations,"Hotel, facilities and views could be rated as 5 Star. Unfortunately the service and response from staff left a bit to be desired. Specific, repeated requests to the staff at the front desk regarding missing ameneties within our room were never addressed. Will have to try a lot harder if they want to be genuinely 5*.",4,2015,06,05
46,Relax and enjoy..,"If you are looking to rest and have a pleasant stay in Barcelona, this is the place. Miramar offers a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. It's impeccable staff, comfortable & refined rooms, relaxing spa & pool and amazing view can sure make one not wan't to leave so soon.. ;)",5,2015,06,01
46,Spectacular views from the hotel!,"We stayed in Room #601 for 3 nights in May 2015.  The gal that checked us in at the front desk was delightful (Laia); Sign up for the breakfast @check-in, good value and good selection.  People come from all over the city to this hotels' front lawn because of the views.  If you are up for walking, it gives a great exercise to walk the city (coming back up at the end of the day is a steep than average incline, which we loved!).  Anything we needed, the hotel provided. Our room was a corner room, VERY quiet, no neighbors above or next to us, wonderful!  2 complimentary waters in our room, complimentary toothbrushes, complimentary plush robes, complimentary foot slippers - and the best smelling soap.  Didnt try the spa, or the restaurant for formal dinner, so cannot comment. We will be staying here again.",5,2015,05,31
46,Nice hotel in a quiet location,"This is a very modern hotel with great facilities. The gym and indoor pool are nice and the spa options are excellent.
The staff couldn't be any more helpful and helped to make the stay pleasurable.
The only downside of the hotel is the noise from a next door shooting range which can start early in the morning and continue until the early evening. This really ruins the peace and tranquillity of such a remote hotel.
The hotel is 15 minutes walk from the Olympic stadium, which is worth a look. You can also walk to the edge of Barcelona in 10 minutes and 20 minutes to La Rambla. You have to be quite fit to walk back up the hill, but there's always a taxi, bus tour or cable car.",4,2015,05,31

Terrace breakfast great but not if inside as too crowded there",4,2015,05,26
46,Disappointed,"Hotel itself is ok...but not 5 star in my opinion. Booked a premium room and it was awful, stay away from room around 316 to 319, balconies in those rooms are not like the rest of the hotel.The customer service was more like a 2 star. Very unhelpful staff...would not book this hotel in the future. Went here thinking we would get good customer service and nice room with a decent balcony, as advertised and as paid for, but left very disappointed.",2,2015,05,26
46,The View !,"Nice 5 star hotel with nice design furniture in the lobby and at the bar. I love both outside and inside architecture. You can walk to ""La Rambla"" in 20 minutes. My only minus point is the outside pool that is not at the level of a 5 star hotel.",4,2015,05,26
46,Excellent hotel!,"This hotel was beyond my expectation of how nice it was! Easily a 5 star hotel! Definitely newly renovated, our room was large, clean, view of the ocean and in excellent condition! Service was friendly and helpful. They have a indoor and outdoor pool which were awesome! The hotel is located on a hill overlooking the city and the ocean is has a great view! and nice gardens to walk around. They also have a gondola located just outside the hotel and for a couple euros it takes you to the beach! My only complaint of the location is one you do need a taxi because it is far away from the downtown and the hill is a good 20 walk from the nearest metro station! But personally the location was worth it!  We did run into some bad service with the bar on the main level however, its understaffed. We went for a quick dinner at the bar and there was only one bartender and one waiter for about 20 people the waiter was literally running around and as a result we waited 45 mins for our food and he messed up our order and forgot my wine. He said he would give me the wine for free because of his mistake but then we ended up having to pay for it which I did not appreciate. To me this wasnt really a big deal because we ate there numerous other times with no problems. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel! Definitely romantic and relaxing if your looking for a honeymoon spot!",5,2015,05,25
46,"Great hotel, Great View, but rent a car please","Great place, Great view, Great Food

I suggest however if you are going to rent at this place that you rent a car as well since it is fairly far from public transport. We paid almost 20 EUR a day on taxi that was the price of a one way

The staff speak great english they are EXTREMELY helpful and are ready to serve you 24/7",5,2015,05,23

46,Just perfect,"Because of delayed flight we arrived around 10pm, we were greeted at reception and offered glass of cava, check in was easy and stress free, the room was fantastic with a lovely large balcony and spectacular views. The staff were superb and nothing was too much trouble from ordering a taxi to giving recommendations to local restaurants. For us this hotel was perfect in everyway just right for relaxing and unwinding. The hotel is situated in a quite area but close enough to visit all the local sights. I can only say a massive thank you to all the staff for welcoming us too Barcelona and making our trip a memorable one.",5,2015,05,17
46,Nice nice nice,"Stayed in miramar for 4 nights, hotel was great, well presented. The rooms was clean and a pleasure to come back to. The gardens were beautiful, the restaurant served great food and by chance they had a piano player that really did add something special. 
Great bar serving good English tea and they had some cheeky sweets we could pinch :D only negative not on the door step of ramblers and a steep walk back so taxi every time",5,2015,05,15
46,"Older hotel trying to be modern, will not stay here again","My experience was not pleasant, and felt like my presence was an inconvenience to the hotel and its staff. I booked my hotel back in August of 2014 and yet, my room was in the corner of the hotel at the end of the hall, without a view, next to an elevator shaft. The room smelled of used cigars and was very humid. The walls, switches, and ceiling were dirty. The curtains for the bathtub were a nuisance to deal with, the shower stones were not installed safely inplace and smelled. 

Overall for $350/night, my experience was less than enjoyable. I submitted honest reviews and pictures to ensure that no one else goes through the same experience as me. Personally, I will not be looking to stay at this hotel in future if this is what I can expect for service. A view would have probably made it better, but I didn't even get that, and the cleanliness of the room and attention the details, was major concern.

Upon check out, no one bothered to ask how my room was or if I enjoyed my stay. It seems that they were more concerned with just checking me out and charging my card. There is a serious disconnect in the level of service a ""5 star"" hotel needs to exhibit.",1,2015,05,12
46,Montjuic Retreat,"We stayed here for 6 nights & had a wonderful time.  Returning to our room
each day/night was a pure joy.  The hotel excels in all aspects-location, food,
service, comfort, amenities & peace of mind.  One bonus-the views from the
rooms & some common areas is an awesome panorama of Barcelona & the 
waterfront.  Ours was a Miramar suite with a terrace + table & chairs- a welcome
respite from the long days sightseeing.  The location is on Montjuic (in the park) 
just south of the central Gothic  old section & has easy access to the city 
(short cab or metro ride) as well as the coastal highway north & south for day
 trip driving.  Indoor or outdoor parking available.  

The lovely, warm, & friendly staff were superb, whether fixing a room problem,
 maps & directions, restaurant reservations, packaging & mailing help, 
 towels/bath supplies, cushions, room service & such.   Many thanks to Simon,
Laia & several  other  staff members who helped make our stay so fabulous.

The breakfast buffet had just about anything you would want with eggs, hot
& cold meats, Dim Sum, cheeses, yogurt, fruits,  granola,  & a large selection
of baked breads, cakes,  pastries, juice, &  espressos.  Dinner at the Forestier
was a pleasant surprise. At our table (2 couples) all the courses were prepared
perfectly, presented in a timely manner & creatively put together.  Check out the
grilled artichokes/eggplant/pine nuts-delicious!!   A good wine list with many
 good values.  The bar selections are a little wanting for variety.  A few signature
 drinks (could use more with some updated selections) are well made & BIG, plus a
 good selection of hot/cold bar food offered.  Beer list was a bit generic.

I highly recommend the Miramar, so please check it out & make some plans.",5,2015,05,11
46,"Great Hotel, not so great service!","+The hotel is very nice, clean, trendy
+ The pictures look very ok quite close to reality
+ Easy wifi
+The bathroom missing door was quite sexy/romantic :) althought VERY cold tiles :(
+L'occitane toiletries, really nice!
+Large windows everywhere, so lots of sun light which I love.
+gym and spa very nice
+lobby really comfy and welcoming
+- The breakfast is nice, nothing special, but good continental breakfast. The breakfast manager was very good, good manager, quick, polite, managing service around the restaurant

-We had a very nice room with pool view, but I'd recommend the 5th floor city view as it has a beautiful view on the city and you can avoid the morning noise of the workers around the pool.
-The almost see-through and not soundproof door in the WC was a bit too much. I prefer this area to be a bit better hidden. 
-The minibar was not filled the next day so make sure u order water the night before, especially if you drink a lot of sangria
- - - had an awful incident with the reception manager, horrible attitude, rude, aggressive and just not a 5* hotel service manager. There was a misunderstanding with the taxi on the hotel's part as we were sent outside to get the taxi and after 15 min when we caught one taxi, the manager snapped saying it's only for clients waiting inside; those waiting outside need to get a cab from the station (although we asked for the taxi inside). Anyways the check out manager did apologise as he was aware, which was nice
-Location is far from the centre 20-30 min walk and from the centre its up the hill so better take a taxi just make sure you get the rules right with their taxi syste
-Do your checkout the night before, the reception and concierge is 2 in 1 so during chekout/checkin time there is long que",4,2015,05,06
46,A fantastic stay at the Hotel Miramar,"Had only a one night stay at the Hotel Miramar, wish it had been more, beautiful modern yet classy hotel, great views and grounds.  The service was excellent, could not have wished for better.  Highly recommended, cannot wait to return",5,2015,05,04
46,Tranquillity & excellence,"As I often do, I am happy to write my reviews whilst staying here in the hotel. 
Our room option is premium and we are placed in room 317.
Hotel situation: excellent, just on the top of the hill with imposing position
The room: excellent (choose premium for fabulous views)
Staff: polite and respectful and ready to assist at all times, nothing is too much trouble for these friendly professional people
Facilities: spa and fitness and pool all usual facilities of a high quality hotel
Cleanliness: perfect
Wifi: very good

I will choose this hotel again without hesitation and highly recommend. Stayed in numerous hotels here in this incredible city. The last 5 star I stayed in here in Barcelona was the Hotel Arts, this is a much much better hotel.

If you are coming to Barcelona, stay here, as close to big city perfection as you can get. Close to everything you want and just enough away from everything to be the BEST.

I always try to include enough information in my reviews to cover most aspects, so finally the roster aunt and bar. Excellent",5,2015,05,03
46,Wonderful (Mini) Honeymoon Luxury,"This hotel is beautiful and was a wonderful place to spend a few days with my new hubby after our wedding
The views are glorious and the service was impeccable
Granted it was more luxury than we would normally go for and because of that it's not the cheapest, but for value I couldn't fault it
One downside maybe is it is a bit far out of town, but that's why we chose Miramar for a quiet break
Having said that you can get the cable car from just outside of the hotel which gets you to the beach in minutes, and the wander up/down the hill to town only takes about 15 mins
Be aware however that if you are going out for dinner it would be worth getting a taxi as there is not much around the hotel itself but we found that very affordable and convenient
I would definitely recommend Hotel Miramar to celebrate your special holiday
Thanks for a fabulous trip!",5,2015,04,29
46,Fantastic Hotel,"The Hotel is located at Montjuic which is a really nice place with a lots to visit. When you arrive at reception you can sit down and do your check in. The Hotel is really nice with a nice lobby. The rooms are very clean and we had a really nice bath in our room and a big balcony. They offer free WIFI which is very good. They have a nice swimmingpool with Sauna, Jacuzzi. The staff is really friendly. From the Hotel you can walk down to the town. There is a lift to go down the beach but we did not take it.",5,2015,04,29
46,Honeymoon trip ,I would like to start off by saying that we stayed in many 5 star restaurants along the way in our honeymoon across Europe. Hotel Miramar had the friendliest and best staff by far and also took care of me and my wife like family. The room was spacious and clean and very new. The location is very private but also very very close to the main part of the city. The view is amazing and also located on a park next to the harbor. The hotel restaurant is excellent and is run like a upscale 5 star restaurant with the best management staff. Overall it was a special 3 days at the hotel and city of Barcelona and I will definitely  be back at Hotel Miramar. ,5,2015,04,25
46,Stunning hotel but shame about the Spa,This hotel is fabulous to stay in with it's beautiful grounds and stunning views. The hotel staff are very helpful and the rooms are very comfortable. Unfortunately I booked the Spa for a massage treatment as part of a birthday treat for my partner. We were asked to arrive 10 minutes before our treatment but upon arrival no one was there. 20 mins later a therapist turned up and didn't communicate to us properly until 625 to say the other therapist was late arriving. We were then told at 640 that we may not be seen until nearly 7. That was too late due to a restuarant booking. The next day we were told we might be able to have a 5pm treatment but were then told at 420 that they were fully booked. What made this more disappointing was that none of the staff seemed to want to rectify our disappointment. Amazing hotel just don't be sold in by the Spa,4,2015,04,25
46,Fantastic View,This is the place to stay if you want the best view of Barcelona.  Gorgeous garden and right next to the entrance to the cable car.  Very pleasant restaurant with a nice breakfast and attentive staff.  We loved our stay and I highly recommend this hotel.,4,2015,04,18
46,Fantastic views over Barcelona,"This was our first stay in Barcelona and went to this hotel by recommendation and it was very good. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful and the atmosphere in the bar was quiet but welcoming.  We stayed in a junior suite with fantastic views over the sea from our large balcony.  Our room has a free standing bath in the bedroom area with a separate shower and wc off.  You don't get a walled bathroom it all comes off the bedroom screened by a see through curtain and the walls of the shower and wc are glass albeit frosted.  Not much privacy when  you may need it, if you understand.  Other than that, the bed was huge, everywhere clean and lovely.  We used the indoor swimming pool which was fine and walked past the gym which looked like a gym full of machines of torture.  

The hotel is located looking over Barcelona so it is up steep hills.  You can walk but i wouldn't, there is a cable car down to the beach area just outside the hotel or pay for the hop on hop off tourist bus and use it as a taxi service.  There are two companies both seem about the same quality and price and they drop off just across the road from the hotel.  Taxis are around but reception will need to call for one for you and you pay for them to get to you as well as the fare.  If you are lucky and have time to wait you can pick one up when they drop another fare off just depends on your timing

Overall, lovely hotel would certainly go again.",4,2015,04,11
46,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,"We stayed in the Hotel Miramar in mid March for three nights and had a really enjoyable stay. Although we had a bit of a problem at check-in (due to booking agency, not the hotel) the hotel staff were very patient and helpful, especially Xavi and Fanny. 
When we checked in we were given an excellent room on the 5th floor overlooking the port area down below. The view is brilliant! 
The hotel location is on a hill above the downtown area. Nearest metro station is about 10-13minutes downhill. For a taxi back to the hotel from the Ramblas area is about €6, although if the hotel books you a taxi to go from the hotel the same journey costs about €15!
The rooms are spacious, comfortable  and clean, the bathroom has a fantastic shower and amenities. 
Breakfast is very comprehensive and has a great variety of hot and cold food. The breakfast staff were great too, in particular Raphaelle.
The spa areas and lobby areas were very nice to relax in also. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel, for leisure or business.",5,2015,03,25
46,Amazing location and Hotel,"This hotel is something special. Luxurious but not overdone. Also in a unique location right in the middle of the city. The staff was friendly, it was very clean and the spa was more than I expected. Spoil yourself!",5,2015,03,23
46,Nice hotel for a holiday in the summer ,I really liked the place. We stayed in the premium room with bath tub in the room. Very luxury for the price. I think this place deserves a five star because of the price. I would give it four if it was expensive. But it is not for a five star hotel. Ten minutes to Las rambles. ,5,2015,03,23
46,Lovely Hotel,"Excellent service, very friendly staff, wonderful setting right near the Teleferic cable car station and Touristic Bus stop. Staff could not do enough for you. Restaurant very nice, Bar fnatastic, We used spa facilities, which were great.Outdoor pool not open this time of year and looked like it was being refurbished. Fantastic views. Two nice bars and restaurants on doorstep again with wonderful views. Would recommend this hotel. Only downside, should be complimentary water in room or even tea coffee making facilities.",5,2015,03,13
46,Perfect view but overrated *,"Location is just perfect on the hill with a view on sea port and city Nice park around hotel 10-15 min walking downhill to Rambla
Very good restaurant with good choice of wines
BUT
- no drinking water in a rooms and SPA (which is a must for 5*)
- hotel really needs to be refurbished 
- outdoor pool :))))) as the indor very small
- a bit noisy from sea port

Overall - level of hotel is 4* not more",3,2015,03,09
46,Great experience :),"It's first class hotel! We had suite with huge terrace and realy amazing view:) Thank You Miss Agata for all Your help :) And tkanks for all the staff: You are very kind and helpfull!
Hotel is realy amazing: location 5 min drive from the city center and the view on the see is soooo beautiful! 
Great restaurant and very tasty food. The rest area with swiming pool also very nice.
I strongly recommend staying in this fantastic hotel :)",5,2015,03,09
46,Supposed to Be Perfect Honeymoon,"My Experience at Hotel Miramar was supposed to be perfect in our honeymoon but at the end was horrible. We were in honeymoon and when we went to our room we received a bottle of Cava and a letter from the hotel manager. On the first day everything was ok. On our second day the ar conditioner stop working and the was very difficult to sleep. On the third day when we woke up, we tried to have a bath but the hot water wasn't working and the water was freezing. We had to took a freezing shower on winter. When we got back from the Barça's game around 5pm the room wasn't cleaned. We were tired and  had to leave the room to the housekeeping clean it. When they clean it we came back to the room and we planned to drink the bottle of Cava that they gave to us when we arrived  in our last night, but they took it away from our room. We where so sad about that we antecipated our flight to Paris, and we check out by 4am. ",1,2015,03,09
46,Great service,"We stayed here over New Year and were pleasantly surprised by the fantastic service. The room was superb - comfortable and modern, and the peaceful location in Montjuic offers beautiful views of the city.",5,2015,03,08
46,Scenic Hors d'oeuvre,"I spent a few hours at the hotel for a business reception and was very impressed. Just a few minutes outside of the city, it feels like a countryside resort. The food was truly excellent, and the variety impressive. A classic, high-service hotel.

TIP: While offering a great view, the trade-off is that you cannot easily walk anywhere or catch the metro. Be prepared for taxi rides.",5,2015,03,06
46,Hotel Miramar,"The hotel is a beautiful place, in a beautiful location, though it is not that organized. At first they put us in the wrong rooms and charged us extra.  But I would recommend it to everyone. I had a great stay. Another great thing is the services, which are exquisite. The food, fantastic. And very kid- friendly. So everyone should go if they take a trip to Barcelona",4,2015,02,05
46,Excellent service,"Miramar wonderful, helpful & friendly staff. specially xavi and mark 

Beautiful setting overlooking Barcelona. The room is comfortable with big bathroom with bathtub

in the morning the view is amazing from the balcony 

The touristic bus stop next to the hotel

i recommend this hotel big time",5,2015,02,04
46,Perfect,"Loved every minute of our stay at the Miramar.  A glass of bubbly whilst checking in, wonderful, helpful & friendly staff. Beautiful setting overlooking Barcelona. Great room, massive comfy bed, huge bathroom including bidet, bath and a walk-in shower.  We had a delicious meal in the restaurant one evening & drinks in the lobby bar afterwards enjoying the live pianist. Breakfast included everything you could possibly need, cereal, fruit, bread, rolls, bacon, sausage, eggs, sweet delicacies etc....enjoyed all the more by the fabulous views from this luxurious location. The sightseeing bus stop is just across the road but taxis are many and reasonably priced. It was just lovely to finish our hectic days with a bottle of bubbly sat on our balcony overlooking Barcelona at night. Will definitely be back & will recommend to our friends and family.  We had a truly fantastic mini break 😃😃",5,2015,02,02
46,Great and peaceful location - pity about billing problems,"We liked the hotel, and especially the location.

Unforunately we were billed for a bottle of cava that we didn't order, and there were a number of billing problems because of the hotel blocking a variety of amounts on our credit card.

Otherwise good restaurant, peaceful outdoor terrace, comfortable room and a great view of the cruise harbour.",4,2015,01,20
46,Fantastic,"From the moment we arrived we had a brilliant experience in this hotel.  Nothing was too much trouble for the front of house staff who spoke perfect English.  they booked Cathedral tickets for us, bus tickets, recommended some fabulous tapas bars and were brilliant from start to finish.  There are great views from the terrace and the walk down into town takes 10 - 15 mins depending on where  you are going.  We tended to get taxis back.  We used the indoor pool and spa facilities all of which were great.  Would love to stay here again.",5,2015,01,11
46,Quick transit Hotel,"I stayed for 2 days and found the hotel to be perfectly located in Barcelona. The hotel staff were extremely professional and helpful. Access to parks, the harbour, malls and other attractions was simply perfect.

The room service menu could be improved however the room and amenities were great.",5,2015,01,09
46,Romantic get away,"My wife and I had a 2 week vacation starting in Paris and ending in Barcelona at the beginning of September 2014.  Our stay at the Miramar was amazing. The Hotel is beautiful and the front desk staff is beyond amazing. I am only sorry that we did not have the opportunity to post this sooner to thank Laia, Aina and Marc and the rest of the staff sooner. They recommended great restaurants, gave us guidance on how to get to attractions and were just so incredibly nice and professional. The Hotel has great views of the city and the water front.",5,2015,01,04
46,Memorable,"This Hotel is just perfect. BEST SERVICE EVER. Was there for get away. The team at the restaurant, were amazing, they made my stay mesmorizing. Jon Garcia Carmona's cuisine is just suculante. Will defenetely recomand this hotel.",5,2014,12,30
46,Excellence,"My husband and I were looking for a special place to spend our 40th anniversary in Barcelona and associates recommended the Miramar. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the front desk to settling in our room we found the Miramar to be outstanding. We especially appreciated our room being ready on arrival after the long international flight. The upscale modern decor was welcoming and comfortable and the attention to detail was obvious. We enjoyed lunch and breakfast in the dining room. The food and service was excellent. It was too chilly to dine on the outside deck but it looked comfortable and an ideal place to enjoy a cocktail/meal in warm weather. The Miramar provided the special experience we wanted for our celebration in all areas, accommodations, service, location and dining. We will definitely recommend the Miramar to our friends and associates for either business or holiday stays.",5,2014,12,24
46,Don't give them your bank card. WARNING!!!!!*******,"I stayed here for 2 nights in December. The hotel is stunning and the staff are fantastic. The location is perfect if you want peace but don't want to be too far from las ramblas. The only downside is their method of payment. I have stayed in many European hotels, and I'm used to the system of pre-authorisation, where they take your card details on arrival and instantly freeze the amount of the expected basic cost of your stay. Then each day, freeze another amount in your account, to correspond with your daily expenditures. Once you come to check out, they then ask you to pay in full, and then their finance department, sends instruction to their bank, who in turn sends instruction to your bank, to make the your funds available in your own account. This so far, has not worked out for me. I checked out at 11am on the 15th December, it's now Xmas eve and myfunds still haven't been released . Over £800. My own money that I'm not allowed to spend at Xmas on my children. If you chose to stay at the Miramar be warned. They do not tell you in the advertisement that to stay there, you must have at least double the amount of the cost of your stay, available in your bank account for an indefinite period. I have spent fortunes on phone calls to the Miramar, my bank, VISA. At the route of all of it is the Miramar. Until my funds are released, they have charged me over 800 pounds for my stay and frozen another 800 pounds. Totalling over 1600 pounds. And in doing so, restricted my family's spending for Christmas. THANK YOU MIRAMAR",1,2014,12,24
46,Excellent customer service,"I recently did an Senior Leaders Executive meeting at the Hotel Miramar. My experience exceeded all expectations!  Special thanks to Eva Coll, our Sales Director, who was with me all the way, from the initial bookings, to my special requests, to onsite assistance, every single detail to perfection, with caterings, meetings, rooms. Eva was a delight to work with, exceptional customer service!! I feel bad because i didn't get any of the other staff names, but SImone was very helpful, the Dutch trainee bartender - others who stayed up with our group until 4:30am on our last nite, kept that bar open for all our requests.  Amazing hotel, but more importantly., amazing customer service. Eva rocks and the entire staff was very accommodating and helpful. I would be delighted to do another event here.  Kudos to all!!  Rosalie C.",5,2014,12,17
46,Nice hotel (If you don't look too closely),"Upon arrival at the hotel Miramar everything looked wonderful, stunning water feature outside the lobby and champagne upon arrival. Marble floors, nicely decorated, this hotel seemed like a good choice for a weekend getaway. 

The hotel was very well designed with clear attention to how everything is presented to the guest. The staff were also very friendly and welcoming as well as being dressed very well. They were also very happy to help when we needed to order a takeaway and did not know Spanish.

As part of a large group, this gave us a chance to experience a number of the different suites that the Miramar had to offer.Unfortunately after staying in the hotel for a day, we noticed that a few things were definitely not quite right. Firstly there were the ants, we found them in all of the rooms and it was clear that this hotel definitely had a problem with them. Fortunately they did seem to acknowledge this and did clear them up when they took over the coffee table.

Next was the lack of upkeep in the hotel, the vanity mirror in the room was loose, holes in the walls from previous items that may have been removed, wallpaper with ripples where it had not been applied to the wall correctly and a shower were the door would not open fully due to the fixed rain shower head being in the doors path. The lift was also temperamental when we ended up having to pry the doors open to exit.

Not only were these problems apparent but the hotel clearly had a roof issue in many places. To start; the bar had water falling from the light fixture in the ceiling and a ceiling tile in the entrance to the spa that was soaked and dripping water all over the floor. There was also water in the lobby where it was very easy to slip.

I think that the hotel could spend some time improving the general upkeep of the establishment however I would not be going back, especially for the price that they charge per room.",2,2014,12,02
46,Everything Excellent,"A weekend: Check-in = very pleasant. But have a room with only a view of the garden.  Ask, and get upgrade to highest level, overlooking the marina. Dinner at Forestier. Maitre d. Javier learns we grow grapes.  Trip to the wine cellar for discussion. He recommends a very reasonable priced Syrah from Cadiz.  Excellent. Food as good.  Room has huge terrace.  Find bottle of Cava from Luxury Link.  End evening watching lights of city and marina. Next day, walk into town.  No problem; enjoy succulent garden on way down.  Too crowded; so duck to side street for a beer and people-watching.  Walk back. Warm.  Cava on hotel's immaculate patio. Dinner with Yves Sandrock (see review). Next day: ship's here; let's go.  Shall be back to Miramar.",5,2014,11,22
46,5 star all the way,"Special thanks to all the staff at the Miramar (especially the Dutch trainee - didnt get her name - and the manager Simone) for a fabulous holiday experience.  The hotel is really first class. We had a premium room with a large balcony overlooking the bay. Just be warned that there is little privacy when performing ablutions in the bath or at the sink. The shower and toilet doors are ""frosted"". Thankfully not a problem for us. The bed was comfortable, pillow selection more than adequate. We used the ipod docking station and massive closet space. The only negative was the lack of a kettle. it would have been delightful to have enjoyed an early morning cuppa on the balcony. We had the buffet breakfast on one morning. It was good but not fantastic but lovely to sit on the terrace.

Even though the hotel is not in town we did not find it inconvenient. Actually nice to get away from all the hustle bustle. The stunning views definitely worth the 4 euro taxi ride. The Hop on Bus stop was 100 yards from the entrance - very convenient. 

Would most definitely stay again.",5,2014,11,15
46,My home away from home,"There wasn't one thing that the staff at The Miramar didn't do to assure that my stay was a pleasant one.  From Jonathan who checked us in and showed us to our room and made us feel that he was welcoming us into his home; to Mateo who made it his business to fix the minor problems we were having in our room (and fix it he did); to Marco who helped with our dining reservations and directions; to the staff at the lobby bar; to the extremely pleasant and polite breakfast staff each morning.  I also congratulate Raul at the hotel, because I do realize that having such a wonderful staff with a ""can-do"" attitude stems from the top.

What The Miramar has going for it that most larger hotels will never have is the personal service and friendly attitude of the people that work there.  I can't say enough about the people there.  I actually felt sad checking out, since it felt as if I was saying good-bye to friends.

I thank the Miramar staff for such a wonderful stay, and for making my first visit to Barcelona so memorable.",5,2014,11,06
46,Special Place,"Miramar Hotel was a great idea.  I spent an evening viewing Mr & Mrs Smith recommendations and finally this suggestion came via a travel company my husband uses.  We were able to enjoy the best tourist areas of Barcelona then Uber our way back up the hill to hang out on our balcony overlooking the bay.  The most amazing room.  Staff all friendly; we like to chat to staff.  Special mention to Robyn and Jonathan who worked at the bar and put up with our constant questions.   Breakfast just kept on giving, fresh and abundant.  I noticed a couple who rolled downstairs for breakfast quite late but it wasn't a problem for the staff.  All this doesn't go unnoticed.  Two excellent reflexology treatments in their spa too.  Take the cable car to the seaside if you dare, great experience and just a minutes walk from the hotel.",5,2014,11,06
46,Great views,"Lovely hotel on top of a hill.  As the taxi driver said the air is always fresh up here. Nice to just walk around the grounds. Had a cable car to the beach. Good breakfast, Didn't eat dinner there, but there were 2 restaurants.  Helpful friendly staff. Hop on Hop off bus stops at the hotel, so easy to get downtown.",5,2014,11,03
46,"Amazing view, nice hotel, great staff!","My husband and I have recently stayed here twice. 4 nights in September and 4 nights in October. The hotel is located a little bit outside city center, and you'll probably want to catch a cab going downtown. Anyhow, this is a small cost, and easy to access. I'm not the kind who likes to walk, but it's not an ""impossible"" distance, if you prefer it. 
Our first stay was in one of the privilege-rooms. Those are by far one of the coolest hotel rooms I've stayed in, with an egg-shaped bathtub in the ""middle"", and spacious balconies facing the city an the ocean. The standard is high, the rooms are clean, toilet ammendeties from L'occitane (great!:-)) and and huge TV with plenty of channels. All in all - a really, really great room. 
Our second stay was a little more disappointing (yes, we did have the HIGHEST expectations returning). As we booked on a short notice, we booked one of the Miramar Suites for almost the same price as the privilege room. We we're really excited...
Anyhow, the Miramar suites wasn't really worth the extra money. We tried 2 different, and one was good - but with NO view. One was pretty crappy - but with GREAT view. 
The crappy one certainly need a renovation.. we're talking brown bathroom ceiling damaged from water leaks.. No bathtub, even though these suites all claim to have that.
Our shower even caused a small flooding both in the bathroom, but also in the bedroom and the carpet around our bed (not so cosy).. I'm pretty picky on hotel rooms, but regarding the Suites vs. The privilege rooms, as far as I can see, what you really pay for is a few extra sq.meeters. 

IN SPITE of the one not-so-great-Miramar Suite (I'm pretty sure they do have better Miaramar-Suites at the hotel, as we understood that they have ""good rooms"" and ""our worst rooms""..)

The staff was very helpful and tried their very best to meet our needs whatever we needed. 
All in all they're very service minded, professional and they're good making you feel really welcome from the minute you arrive.
They also understood our issue with the room and we were actually heard and compensated for our troubles. I think that is a HUGE plus, with an especial thanks to Jonathan. 

The hotel is so amazingly located, and overall such a wonderful experience, we're almost sure we'll be back again if going to Barcelona.  Other good things to pinpoint is the fabulous breakfast (expensive, but.. pretty much worth it), two amazing restaurants 1 minute walk from the hotel, which probably both offers one of Barcelona's best views, nice swimming pool area and a few nights live piano music in the bar. 

All in all - a really, good hotel. 
Don't mind the ""distance""  - you'll love the view!",4,2014,11,03
46,Lovely place to stay,"This hotel is gorgeous. I stayed here with my daughter for 5 days and we loved how peaceful it was. We had the swimming pool to ourselves every time we used it which was great. It is a nice place to relax and near enough to be in the center of Barcelona either by a 15-20 minute walk or a short taxi ride back which we usually did at night time. If you love relaxing, food and shopping this is the place for you.",5,2014,10,28
46,Miramar Barcelona - lovely hotel & nice location,"Really enjoyed the stay, huge room, peaceful setting and fab views, but still close enough to access central Barcelona and the sights. Metro easy to use and taxis relatively cheap. Cable car from hotel to waterfront & beach was a bonus.",5,2014,10,28
46,Nice hotel with lovely views,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The hotel itself was away from the main city centre (about a 15-20 min walk) which made it ideal and peaceful while still being able to access the City centre easily. The miramar gardens are absolutely breathtaking with its views of the city centre. 

The hotel itself is very well presented; we had one of the suites on the 1st floor (102). The room was a great size with a huge comfy bed. Breakfast was fantastic too - it was nice to be able to sit outside and eat mid October. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2014,10,26
46,Good experience,"We had a great stay in this hotel in Barcelona. Since the welcome, by Mateo, a trainee at the front desk, everybody was very helpful and mindful. Restaurant recommendations, things to do, etc. Raul Lizon, the Director of Sales and Marketing, greeted us. The accommodations were great, as well as the breakfast and the restaurant. The location is great, with excellent views of the port and the city, right next to Montjuic.",5,2014,10,25
46,3 day conference,We recently held a 3 day Sony Music meeting at the Mirimar Hotel including around 40 participants.  As a group we couldn't have been more satisfied with the hotel and the service provided by all staff.  The rooms were spacious and very clean and the meeting room a perfect size for our group with an AV technical on hand to ensure things run smoothly.  The location of the hotel ensures great views and an easy walk or taxi into the city.   I would thoroughly recommend.,5,2014,10,07
46,Lovely hotel,"Booked two weeks before departure through Hotel.com this hotel did not disappoint. Great room with a great view.  We picked this as it's away from the hustle and bustle.  Pros - Staff are attentive and helpful, hotel looks good and food is good too.  Cons - Olympic firing range at the back of the hotel is in use, you hear it from the pool, I could also hear it from my terrace at the front of the hotel but I did know this from other reviews before coming.  You cannot hear it when in the room, we were room 416. Also I went to the pool on my first day, lasted 20 minutes and gave up due to the amount of insects in the late afternoon and ended up with five bites in that time! Saying that I would still definitely come back. :-)",5,2014,10,04
46,Wedding and stay in Barcelona,"We are currently on honeymoon in Ischia, Italy but felt i had to share my wonderful experience of the Hotel Miramar before our return to England on the 11th October. To us this hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, since our first stay there 18 months go, and then 2 subsequent stays since, the hotel has never failed to deliver an amazing service. This was the reason why we chose to have our wedding here almost 1 year ago. since then we have conversed by email with Marta Mimosa, wedding co-ordinator extroadinaire, to organise a wedding for 50 plus guests. The hotel put us in contact with florists and DJ's who all provided a personal service to us and delivered professionally on the day. Quino from Disc Moda was brilliant and although he spoke very little English, worked alongside Marta and my hubby to design playlists that will always be personal to us. The flowers from Tavola were also gorgeous,with a Spanish theme that i really loved. The ceremony was delivered by Victor from SiQueSi, and was beyond any expectation we had. In the run up to the wedding we had emailed SiQueSi with answers to questions that they had asked, but how they turned it round into a  moving declaration of our love was unbelievable. As i mentioned Marta however was the key to all this and on meeting her 4 weeks before the wedding we realised her passion in ensuring that the delivery of our wedding services by the hotel would be exceptional. The ceremony area in the Orange Grove was beautifully set up, as was the Azulette and reception/apperitif area outside. All the staff were friendly and professional and there to help, even getting cigarettes for a needy guest!! The food as always, of the Mirarmar was 5 star and was commented on throughout the day by the guests. We finished in the disco in our own little cave and we partied well into the morning. I can only say on behalf of my husband and i and the guests who also enjoyed the services of the hotel, a massive thank you. On what is the most important day of your life, i can proudly say that the whole day was exceptional. Thank you particularly to Marta and Jonathan on Reception, who has never failed to greet us on our arrival and thank us on our departure...staff who are truly a credit to the Miramar and i hope are recognised for this. We will see you all again next year to continue our love affair with Barcelona and return to the comfort of this amazing hotel, Hotel Miramar. Karen & Paul Johnson",5,2014,10,02
46,Excelent location and comfortable rooms,"Staff was very friendly and helpful, room had a magnificent view of the Barcelona port, short walk to La Rambla but coming back is a steep uphill climb. The cable car to/from Barceloneta beach is literally steps away. Al in all, an excellent choice to stay in Barcelona.",4,2014,09,29
46,Top Notch,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Miramar last week for 2 nights and absolutely loved it. The grounds are beautiful with panoramic views of Barcelona.  The hotel itself is magnificent - our sea view room was spacious and comfortable.  The Spa was lovely and the rooftop pool was also very nice. We are not ""city"" people so this was a great place for us to stay that was away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona - while still being no more than a 20 minute walk to the city center. It was very peaceful and tranquil.  The staff are extremely accommodating - including the gentleman who graciously helped my husband find his phone that he had left in the hotel room after checking out.  This will be our only choice in Barcelona!",5,2014,09,26
46,Quality above the city,"A hotel that benefits from a great spot over looking the city and Mediterranean sea.  Good size rooms with enjoyable balconies if you get an ocean view room.  Similarly, nice bar, good quality breakfast, and pleasant spa area.  The two areas that would tip into 5 stars - the spa facilities are all segregated apart from the pool, so for example, it didn't seem like to could enjoy a sauna with your partner.  And secondly, the earlyish music from the bar just beyond the hotel is a little grating to the balcony experience.

All in though, recommended !",4,2014,09,26
46,"Large rooms, very helpful staff","Spent one night here, rooms were large although mine did smell faintly of cigarettes. Fantastic view. Staff were very friendly and helpful, comfortable beds and not too far from Las Ramblas. I walked it in about 20 minutes. Comfortable stay.",4,2014,09,24
46,Rude,"When visiting Barcelona we called in at this hotel to see what it was like, use the toilet and perhaps have a drink in the bar.
The staff were rude and officious, we were practically thrown out because we had the audacity to ask for the toilet.
I do not not appreciate being spoken to in such a way and would definitely not stay here.",1,2014,09,21
46,Beautiful Hotel,"The hotel is gorgeous and the balconies and views are amazing.  We found the place to be a great sanctuary and respite from all the crowds and hustle and bustle of downtown.  We enjoyed sitting on the balcony and drinking a bottle of wine while watching all the cruise ships come in and out of port.  It was tough leaving the hotel and moving on to more of a chain hotel in Madrid. 

It is a bit out of the way but my wife and I are both active and enjoy walking most places anyway.",5,2014,09,17
46,Fabulous hotel,"Absolutely wonderful hotel. Excellent location, minutes away by taxi from all main attractions and yet quit and tranquil location. Great value for money, exquisite service and very nice and spacey rooms. My hotel in Barcelona from now on  ",5,2014,09,16
46,Resort style accommodation a little removed from the centre,"I spent 6 nights at Miramar whilst in Barcelona on business. The hotel is located on a hilltop with superb views if your room faces the ocean (which I would definitely recommend). There are excellent resort style facilities with very good outdoor and indoor pools and reasonable gym and Spa sections. Breakfast was included in my rate and had a very good selection of hot and cold dishes. The room was spacious with a huge King bed and an unusual bathroom setup (tub in the middle of the room) and excellent hot shower with good pressure. Cleanliness was ok and there were signs of wear and tear if you bothered to look but nothing really troublesome. 
The biggest concern is probably the distance to the town centre. Getting there by foot involves a 15 min hike downhill which is fine and the views are amazing but the return uphill leaves you exhausted, especially in hot weather. It is therefore preferable to have breakfast on site if you want to return to the room after. Taxis are however reasonably cheap (8-9€ Into town).
Service is a little variable - at times the bar and restaurant seemed understaffed. The staff at reception were however excellent and extremely helpful when it came to helping with bookings and printing vouchers. 
All in all I really enjoyed my stay and would do so again in the future. For some it may however be too far from the action in the centre.",4,2014,09,07
46,Lovely resort break in the city,"Miramar has got fantastic rooms and good size balconies with a lovely view over Barcelona. Great beds, good size bathrooms, great service and a lovely spa and gym. The outdoor pool area is very nice and gives an impression of a resort hotel rather than a city hotel.",5,2014,09,01
46,"Good, not great.","My husband and I chose to stay at hotel miramar during our stay in Barcelona to be a bit out of the hustle and bustle. We got exactly that and enjoyed it. The hotel is beautiful, the views are wonderful and the staff is friendly. Some minor things that could make it five star:
*complimentary water in the rooms
*the restaurant has very slow service. Both times we ate there the meal took 2-2.5 hours. It wasn't because we were eating and enjoying it was because they took forever to prepare and serve. 
*complimentary Coffee/espresso 
*the staff, while friendly doesn't always pay close attention. We took something from the mini bar the first night and they never replaced it in our stay- this would be a perfect opportunity to sell more but they didn't even take notice. We also ordered something through room service and they gave me the wrong flavor. Still great but wasn't what I asked for.",4,2014,08,22
46,A perfect Barcelona hotel!!!,"We spent four days at the Hotel Miramar. The hotel and the property are just beautiful!!! The view is  breathtaking! The hotel is located outside of the hustle and bustle of the center of the city, but close enough to get there quickly and easily. (There was a stop at the end of the driveway for the Barcelona tour bus which we took.) We enjoyed the peaceful setting. The service was excelllent. The staff was most welcoming and extememly friendly and helpful.We had a lovely dinner at the Forestier Restaurant. The food was outstanding. We also enjoyed our breakfast buffet every morning on the terrace, as well as tapas outside on the porch! We took a Princess cruise at the end of our stay at the Hotel Miramar.(close to the port as well) Barcelona was definitely a highlight of our vacation as well as the Hotel Miramar! We would love to return someday!!!",5,2014,08,21
46,"Design toll, Service verbesserungswürdig","We just came home from a week in Hotel Miramar. 

The hotel itself is very nice. The staircase, the outdoor pool and the terrasse are the highlights!
It is located on Montjuic a bit outside the city center with a gorgeouv view over Barcelona. A taxi to the city center is arounf 7-8 Euro.

We booked a premium room and because we booked via Airtours got upgraded to a Suite Miramar which was very big and nice! (Even though the time on the radio was not set, the Miramar CD inside was skipping and the remote control buttons were all mixed up)

All in all we had a very nice time but in my eyes this is not a 5 star hotel. The little something extra was definitely missing.

Some examples:
*There was a kettle, tea and instant coffe in our room. This wasn't refilled on the second day. We complained around noon and were told it would be refilled immediately. Nothing happend. We complained again in the evening, same result. As we complained the third time next morning we were told that this ist usually not refilled but coffee and tea is only provided on the first day. 
No idea why we weren't told before. We then asked for it to be refilled daily which happend around 50% of the time.

*On the first evening we couldn't close the sunblind which every terrasse luckily has. We were told maintenance would take care of this. After a lot of try and error we found out it has to do with which light switch you use to turn the light on (logic behind this?). Be warned, if you use  the one next to the bed the sun blind does not work.
Would have been nice to get information/ feedback in this.

*On the only evening it was raining cats and dogs the door handle of the terrasse door fell of. My husband fixed it provisionaly and we informed the front desk that the door could not be closed properly. Noting happend until the next day, after house keeping was there we guessed from the ability to close our door that it has been fixed. A note/ information/appology would have been nice.

On a positive hand, the front desk was always very friendly and most of the time helpful (double checking pick up time, giving tips, etc...).

The breakfast was very nice and served on the terrasse, perfect way to start the day.

The view over the harbour is very nice especially if you like ships but be aware that sitting outside in the late evening is difficult as the harbour is extremely loud (The Tentacia leaves every night at 11 together with another ship, after this it gets better). ;)
There's also a shooting range withing hearing distance of the outdoor pool...

The Restaurant Forestier serves very nice food and we had a pleasant first evening there.

The next time we go to Barcelona we will not be staying in Hotel Miramar because we had th feeling we did not get what we were paying for.",3,2014,08,18
46,Perfect Location,"I just returned from a 4-night stay here with my wife and 4 teenagers. The service was impressive from the moment we walked in, and the views are outstanding. We were concerned about the distance from town, but it is an easy downhill walk, there is a lot more to do in the immediate area than we realized, and there is a gondola right out the front door that quickly takes you to the beach near the W. Given how busy the town was, it was nice to retreat to the quiet hotel campus at the end of the day.",5,2014,08,14
46,We will be back,"I know others have seen it as less praiseworthy on here. However where in Barcelona can you be this close to the city and yet in such a tranquil location?
The views over the city  from the hotel are stunning and you can be down at street level in a mere 15 mins if you walk. 
Pool service food and drinks are reasonably priced and staff very polite and friendly. 
We went on the Orange Route bus tour and had the hotel pointed out as a local landmark and "" deluxe"" address.
I would agree totally.
Lovely walks nearby
Nightlife down below at street level
Calm quite understated elegance by Spanish standards 
We loved it from the welcome Cava to the prompt taxi service
Well be back",5,2014,08,07
46,Not a 5 star hotel.,"Iv'e stayed in better 4 star hotels. The rooms were clean,but nothing special. There is no complementary water in the rooms,and they  charge you 4€ 09+tax for a small bottle. From the mini bar.Breakfast was very ordinary,not a good selection.The staff were very helpful,and polite.",3,2014,08,05
46,My favorite in Barcelona.....,"We've stayed in several hotels in Barcelona which can feel too busy in summer months. This was my second stay at Miramar and once again I loved it. Staff are extremely helpful, from arranging car transfers before our arrival to dinner reservations. Rooms are clean and quiet. Only comment here is that I would next time recommend a different layout as I shared one room with my son and the bathroom was only curtained off - romantic for couples but hard to keep the noise down when sharing. 
Restaurant is fantastic, loved the bar restaurant  - easy with three children. Pasta was fantastic and their Hendricks is beautifully served. Buffet breakfast also lovely ....
Location is fab, views are beautiful and lovely to wander up to the Olympic Stadium after dinner. Also very convenient for Palau Sant Jordi if you are catching a concert - no taxi required. 
Highly recommend for business, couples or families. Fantastic hotel.",5,2014,08,05
46,Stunning,"
I chose to stay here for one night to attend an event on Mont Juic. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. The grounds, pool and rooms were all lovely. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel is away from the city centre, but if you are prepared to travel to sight see, or if you just want to relax with views over Barcelona and the sea, then this is for you!",5,2014,08,04
46,Fantastic hotel in a great city,Really nice hotel. Lovely rooms. For a family stay. Menu a bit limited but exceptional staff an a great feeling of privacy even when fully booked. Recommended for a family visit. I suspect I would recommend it for a romantic getaway or a business trip too. ,5,2014,08,04
46,Awesome,"Honestly, you find there all you would ask for a 5 star hotel. Comments for improvement? Add a coffee maker and a Kettle in the room, make the aircond system more easy and precise to control. Minor comments that show the overall quality of this place. We've been to most of 5* hotels in BCN, now we always go to the Miramar because it's the best.",5,2014,08,03
46,Amazing Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in May this year. We were greeted by a glass of cava upon arriving and excellent reception staff. Our room was a basic room yet was huge and very clean. Our balcony overlooked a function room and the whole of the city. The rooms were cleaned daily and fresh toiletries were given every day. We were room only but had snacks in the bar and drinks. Every drink was served with lovely crisps and nuts. The evening piano entertainment was fantastic ! The views over the port from the back of the hotel are amazing too. 
The walk I to the city takes about 30 minutes and I would recommend paying for a taxi back to the hotel as it's situated on a steep hill. It should cost €7-10.
The only downside to our room was that there was a wedding in the function room below which kept us awake till all hours one night.",5,2014,08,03
46,great stay with family,"I cannot say enough about the staff at the Hotel Miramar.  We were traveling with our children and stayed at 2 different properties in Barcelona.  The Hotel Miramar staff hands down wins.  They could not have been more helpful with anything we needed.  We had connecting rooms in the corner, which were great because the entire corner unit was sectioned off by a main door, so we felt like we were in our own apartment.  We also took advantage of the buffet breakfast which was very nice.  We absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona, and cannot wait to visit again.",5,2014,08,02
46,They could've done better!,"I arrived just before midnight and had prerequested a late check out. This was not possible and I was quite disappointed.

When I checked in I was given twin beds despite requesting a double bed when booking. I had to get to the room then go back to reception, wait in line again, and ask for another room. This did have a double bed but the room was over a disco and there was music til at least 3:00am. I was too tired to move rooms again but thought to myself ""trip advisor is going to hear about this!""   

Finally they charged €€€ for a nespresso coffee echo other hotels give free!",4,2014,07,26
46,GOOD HOTEL!,"I just came from Barcelona yesterday having stayed for 5 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised. perched on a hill overlooking Barcelona, it has great views of the city and the harbor. it's only a 10-15 minute downhill walk to the Ramblas and Christopher Columbus statute. It is also very close to the funicular station that takes you to the fortress or a different funicular that takes you to the beach. the Whole area is very nice to begin with, dipped in great parks. 
The room (402, small ""suite"") was very spacious, huge King bed, incredible bathroom, cool views of the city and harbor with a large balcony. The AC was just average. 
The staff was very friendly and very helpful and gave great recommendations for restaurants. 
The hotel was quiet and felt very cozy. Although there is a shooting range behind, it causes no issues at all. The restaurant at the hotel is decent, but not more than that. Not all bar tenders make drinks with the same quality. One prepared outlandish drinks, the others just OK. the hotel surroundings are nice and having a great breakfast on the balcony is unbeatable. A great stay!",4,2014,07,25
46,Beautiful Luxurious Hotel for a Special Stay,"I booked the Miramar Hotel as a surprise for my Husband's 50th birthday in April. I was a little concerned about the location but needn't have worried, it was perfect for 6 days of sightseeing along with some chill out time. We tended to walk down the hill but always got a taxi back which wasn't expensive.
From the minute we arrived the staff (especially Manuel) were fantastic! I'm so glad I opted for a Premier room as it is spacious with a great balcony & fantastic views. The grounds are stunning especially the pool area. We were lucky to have good weather so took advantage of the sun beds. The spa area is also lovely, we used the indoor pool too. 
We never saw any cleaning staff but always came back to an immaculate room. Our only very minor comment would be that we couldn't make tea or coffee in the room.
The staff really make this hotel & are always on hand for restaurant recommendations etc. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food.
My Husband loved our stay, especially when he found out we were going to a game at the Nou Camp plus a tour :-)",5,2014,07,20
46,Perfect!,"My staying in this hotel was wonderful. All details for pleasant stay have been met. Service was on the highest level. Staff is very friendly and they realy happy to see you and help you to enjoy your stay. Rooms are clean and warm. Breakfast buffer menu is various and very delicious. I'd like to highly recommend this beautiful hotel for all those tourists who want to feel themselves a long-awaited guest.
Miramar, I'll come back! =)))",5,2014,07,20
46,"nice hotel, beautiful view!","nice hotel; clean rooms, fantastic outdoor pool area (my son loved it!), easy walking access (although there is the hill that others describe--it is not that bad).  there was a huge balcony overlooking the Mediterranean that was enjoyable. Lounge area was nice; food in hotel restaurant decent but not great and I thought the hotel food and drinks were very pricey.  My disappointment with this hotel was the service; perhaps it is poor management or poor communication between staff and management?  Most staff were pleasant but not very helpful; we had to ask housekeeping more than once to get our room serviced, and then they would forget to leave towels, for example.  (But the housekeeping staff did do a nice job of cleaning the room once you got them there!)  We also had to call twice for our room service order as it was not delivered (this happened twice).  Parts of the hotel were showing signs of wear; we had a ceiling leak in our room, and when we informed them, they kindly upgraded us to a beautiful room, but again, it was poor communication --they said they knew about the leak and were going to move us, but they never made any attempt to do so until we complained about the leak. So we didnt actually get to move into the new room until the afternoon of the NEXT day.  So, I would go back again as the views alone are amazing and the hotel is clean, but I hope they read this and improve their service and/or communication problems! It's a beautful hotel!",4,2014,07,17
46,Beautiful hotel,"I would like to thank all the staff from this hotel for spending great time! Big clean room, huge balcony/terrace with beautiful sea and port view. Service was excellent. Very quiet and cosy hotel. We were afraid of far location from the city but it takes about 10 minutes on foot. I extremely recommend this hotel for travel and business trips.",5,2014,07,15
46,"If you want rude and pretentious, stay here...","While a nice hotel, the location was only convenient to attractions on Montjuic, everything else required car/taxi transportation to get to.  But the biggest turnoff here was the staff...one gentleman in particular who we ran into was exteremly rude and pretentious...insisting he know who we were and where we were going!  I've never been treated that way in a hotel and I travel quite frequently.",2,2014,07,10
46,One of the best Hotels we have ever stayed in.,"We booked this Hotel for 3 nights having first stayed at the W building for 1 night.  We wanted to experience the W building, but couldn't book a 4 night break so decided to book Hotel Mirimar for the remainder of our stay.  All I can say is i'm so glad we did.  This hotel in my opinion is far more professional, friendly and luxurious compared to W building and offers greater value for money.

It was our 15th Wedding Anniversary and our 1st trip to Barcelona.  That was a year ago now but the memory of this hotel and experience in Barcelona was so amazing that I felt I should write this review.

The room was amazing had great views, funnily enough we could see the W building from our balcony.  We used the Cable car from the beach up to the gardens of the Mirimar with our small cases and was a great way to arrive from one hotel to the next.

I would definitely recommend you having an evening meal in this hotel.  We went for the 5/6 course set meal on the night of our anniversary.  It was beautiful with a small candle, attentive staff, saxophone player playing nice relaxing jazz music in the background for its guest and a complimentary glass of champagne (not really my preferred drink) but nice for hubby and I to toast our anniversary.

The young lady who showed us our room was lovely and we were blown away with the room we had been allocated it was a large suite, clean and had a beautiful bathroom just like the one shown in the hotel pictures.

This is a hotel we would book again in a heart beat if we ever return to Barcelona.  The problem being is that we are in our early 40's and still have so much of the world to see and experience.  Therefore it may be a while before we get to go back have a bucket list to get through. lol

We  have recommended this hotel to our friends and although it is not the cheapest hotel in Barcelona.  If your looking for quality and luxury it is easily worth every penny for its 5* accommodation and customer service.

If your wanting to book for a special occasion and can afford to spoil yourselves a little bit then  I would strongly suggest this hotel it is heaven and bliss and we still talk about it a year on.

Barcelona is a beautiful place and well worth a trip.  About 5 of my friends on FB after seeing my pics, went on to book trips to Barcelona.

Please note we stayed July 13 not August 13 and I apologies Hotel Mirimar that it has taken me a year to get round to leaving a review. But I hope that those that read it find it useful.",5,2014,07,08
46,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Great hotel, definitely worth a visit and would definitely return.  From the minute you arrive at the hotel, the staff are very attentive and helpful.  Riccardo was especially helpful providing us with hints and tips of the city and also arranging for us to have a bedroom overlooking the port as we were celebrating our 24th wedding anniversary.  Hotel situated 10 minutes walk from the old town and Ramblas, great location for seeing the city, we literally walked everywhere.  We dined in at the Forestier Restaurant on the first evening, which was excellent.  The breakfast was also great and set you up for a busy day of sightseeing.  The cocktails were even better !  To relax at the end of the day don't forget.to take a dip in the outside pool ....
This was a fantastic break, it could not have been better.  We will be back loved every moment just wished we could have stayed slightly longer.",5,2014,07,04
46,Lovely Hotel with Fantastic Views,"Stayed with my wife for a long weekend. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the City and the sea, which was beautiful. The staff were helpful and the bar well stocked. The pool was well used!

A great place to stay although it's not the easiest to get to the City centre from. If you choose to walk there is a very steep road to clamber up, but it's more fun than a cab.

The one negative is the gun club behind the hotel, but as we were around the other side of the hotel the bangs were muffled.",4,2014,07,03
46,Could not fault the service,"Probably the best service ive ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world. Room was fantastic, fluffy towels and robes. L'occitane toiletries, a huge double bath and you cant beat the view. A bit out of town but it commands one of the best locations in Barca and every taxi driver knows it. Yes there is a funny smell in the corridor in parts of the hotel, yes its an easy walk around the park or into town and yes there are two hop-on hop-off bus services right outside.",5,2014,07,01
46,A VIEW TO DIE FOR,"Stayed for 1 week in a premium double room (516).  Bedroom and bathroom spacious and clean with ample storage.  But some points of detail.  The bath mixer tap did not mix the hot/cold and was not fitted well.  The provision of toiletries was interestingly hit and miss - some days this and other days that regardless of actual use.  The television was fixed on a wall beside the bed and to access the latter it was essential to bend sideways to avoid a nasty collision (I could never work out why it had been so located!) but did slightly spoil what was otherwise a very comfortable room.  The balcony was superb overlooking both city and sea.  Restaurant okay but needed a design overhaul and decoration - it just did not sparkle!.  Breakfast was more than just acceptable but not perhaps the variety of a true 5*.  All staff superb in every sense of the word but especially so in reception.  I say this because I became a victim of a Barcelona pickpocket and the reception staff were unstintingly supportive - and apologetic on behalf of their country.  The hotel is wonderfully located but half way up a mountain - but you get the hand of it after a couple of days.  Overall, I thoroughly recommend the Miramar.",4,2014,06,06
46,Good hotel with great view,"Nothing wrong with this hotel - we had read some slightly negative comments on Trip Advisor but my partner and I had very enjoyable experience here. 

Service from the staff was simply first class. You can tell that the management team has drilled discipline and quality into the staff here.  Not one person let the side down in the five days we were here - the welcoming glass of Cava when you check in was a particular nice touch.  Well done!  

The location of the hotel is not as central as other hotels we have stayed at in Barcelona but the benefit is the fantastic view you get of Barcelona from the hotel and surrounding pathways.  The hotel is still easily within walking distance of the main attractions though - a 5 to 10 minute walk down the steps at the foot of the hotel terrace and along the main road at the bottom will have you at the bottom of La Rambla - so unless you struggle with walking then accessing the attractions on foot from this hotel is not a problem.  You are better off doing this than walking up the hill to take the funicular down to Paral-lel - the walk to the station is 5 to 10 mins uphill and then if you miss a train you will be waiting for 10 minutes at the station for the next one.  

The room we had was great - we were on the side that overlooked the harbour so we had a great view.  Luxurious standalone bath and powerful separate shower were great (although we had intermittent problems with hot water (luke warm at best) on our last two mornings which other people were complaining about when we checked out).

We had read comments about the shooting range which is next to the hotel and I made a point of asking on check-in whether the room was on the opposite side which the receptionist confirmed was the case.  They clearly do have issues with this as the receptionist knew exactly what I was talking about when I asked - upon leaving the hotel one morning and walking up the hill you can clearly here the guns going off loudly so I would make sure you ask about this when you check in and pack a pair of ear plugs just in case you end up on the wrong side!  However, on the side of the hotel we were on we were not troubled by this at all. 

We didn't eat either breakfast or dinner at the hotel as we generally prefer to find somewhere cheaper and better value for money.  We did have drinks each night though which were not cheap but you have to expect that at a hotel like this - I don't have any particular issue with paying €12 for a Mojito in a hotel.  

Overall a great hotel with great service.",4,2014,05,31
46,Pure 5 star,"I was treated to a stay here by my family as a birthday present. The hotel is on the side of a mountain with an amazing view of the harbour and the city. Maybe a bit difficult if you have walking difficulties getting into the city itself but saying that there are many taxis available and there is a cable car just outside the hotel. Dont do this hotel on a budget it wont work, barcelona is like most major cities in the world...not cheap ..saying that, if you looked, reasonably priced food etc can be found.
We stayed bed and breakfast and breakfast was stunning, huge choice, beautifully prepared and full of flavour, cold meats, cheese, bread of many types, cooked, pastries and cakes, cereals, fresh fruit, coffee, tea and juices.
Rooms were spacious with magnificent bathrooms, large shower, very large bath and a toilet.
Staff were impeccable, efficient, polite and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble.
There are two swimming pools, an outside for a warm day with bar and food and a heated indoor one for more serious swimmers.
Ive given this hotel 5 stars because quite frankly i could not fault it .....
its very close to shops and the city centre and all that has to offer, if you have any interest at all in food you must visit the food market of off Las Ramblas it is a truly awe inspiring experience as is the gaudi cathedral..
If i can afford it i will definitely come back to this hotel and this magnificent city...
Highly recommended ..",5,2014,05,29
46,Outstanding service and view,We couldn't have been happier with this hotel. The staff were the nicest I've ever encountered in all of my travels and the view is amazing. I highly recommend it. Yes the hill was a challenge after a day of walking around the city but it was worth it.,4,2014,05,22
46,Stunning hotel with fabulous views but there's a BUT,"The hotel, the bedroom and facilities are amazing. Really beautiful and top class.
However, there are a few downsides to the hotel.
First of all the price of food there is ridiculous! There was no way we were going to eat in the hotel when there are so many wonderful restaurants to eat in, at far better value.
Secondly, while the views are wonderful, it is a bit out of town and up a very steep hill. If you're touring all day it's the last thing you want to see!
That brings me in to my final point, if you are going on holiday to Barcelona, which I highly recommend, you won't be spending very much time in the hotel, there is so much to see and do that a more central and reasonably priced hotel may be more suitable. No point paying for amazing facilities if you're not going to use them. Barcelona isn't the place you go to sit by a hotel pool for a week.
But the hotel is stunning, the staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful and the breakfast was very nice!",4,2014,05,13
46,Absolute Paradise,"Amazing 5 Star luxury in a perfect location with 5 star service.  We stayed here for 3 nights for our anniversary.  We honestly could not fault anything about the hotel and service.  The staff couldn't be more helpful especially Mark on Reception who organised most of our trips and sightseeing expeditions!!  The hotel setting is breath-taking as it is on the top of a hill overlooking the whole of Barcelona,  The  location is great, perfect for us and not too far away from most of the sights.  you can get a taxi, cable car, bus or metro from the hotel very easily and it only takes 10-15 minutes to walk down.  The city of Barcelona is an absolute Gem, so much to see and do and culture at every turn and obviously the Gaudi influence is all around.  Must see sights are the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell , Art museum near the Olympic stadium and try and see a match if you can at FCB. Oh and the Beach and harbour area are stunning.",5,2014,05,07
46,Weened in Barcelona,"Nice hotel and very clean, staff lack interest in customers, look down there nose at us, might have been because we were British!
Lovely big room and bed nice, a good 15 min walk down hill to Las Ramblas and a long walk back up the hill, not  a place to go if your on a budget, my mistake, even coffee in the foyer was expensive, but walk down the hill and lots nice cafes and bars to choose from and take a taxi back, lol. 
Ended up using as a base and walk and ate out, if I win the lottery will be back.
The view was great to the harbour.",4,2014,05,04
46,The Miramar Barcelona,"This hotel has got to be one of the best. Booked through Expedia, just check if breakfast included because you don't want to miss it. The location is the best a short distance from the centre by taxi which are v cheap at night in the daytime walk. Panoramic view of the city. Do not be put off by the entrance, you think you are arriving in an industrial zone. Persevere, food excellent, staff helpful, positive, dedicated to achieving results to please. Rooms we were in a premium room. Lovely, spacious well decorated fine fitments v comfy bed. Highly recommend. Quiet but welcoming and homely you feel really comfortable here, donor hesitate. A short walk to the Miro museum  and national museum, which has spectacular views, tourist open top bus literally  two  minutes from the hotel. Do it you will not regret it. Wonderful would come back again. Thanks to the staff at the Spa, really very good, helped my back ache!",5,2014,04,30
46,my visit,Good modern hotel. Overwhelming perfumy smell in the lobby. Staff very willing to chat & friendly but absolutely no good for advice re trips out or anything like that. Recommended a restaurant for our last night but didn't tell us it was truly 5 mins walk away and let us take a taxi.  No pamphlets around on anything you might like to see.  Had to take taxis all the time and prices vary. Some added a supplement some didn't. No tea or coffee in the rooms. Breakfast very expensive tho' you can have an 'express' continental breakfast which is good value. Also there is a good (+ value)bar menu if you don wish to eat in the very expensive restaurant.Shooting gallery next door. Air conditioning iffy. Rooms not done till late in the day.,3,2014,04,28
46,Amazing view,"Must agree to those who claims that the main asset of this hotel is View. I got my room on the first floor - room was big and specious and the balcony even bigger, maybe even I got some premium room? View from my room was on seaside - the best ! Room was well equipped, everything that you could expect from pure 5* hotel.
Breakfast was good, i missed fish.  There are plenty of fresh juices and even wine, and champagne :).

One thing that i did not like, was the quality of water - chlorine amount in water, my eyes were red from it :(, but i think that there is nothing to do with hotel, most likely local purification company is using this method.",5,2014,04,28
46,Great Hotel With Amazing Views,"We stayed in this hotel almost a year ago, when X-games was in Barcelona. (Sorry...a little late on the review)

Absolutely loved this hotel. We stayed on the 4th floor in a corner room, that had impressive view of the sea, and the city, with an extra large balcony to take advantage of it.

The hotel is in a great location if you need to be near the olympic stadium, or just don't want to be right downtown in the hustle and bustle of things. It is located on the 'hop-on, hop-off"" bus tours which makes it very convenient.

The staff was very nice and the grounds are beautiful.  There are amazing gardens off to the side of the hotel that wind all the way down to the sea that you can walk in or go running.

Breakfast was great, with options for everyone including American style breakfast, as well as European.

When we return to Barcelona, we will stay here again.",5,2014,04,25
46,Strange ,"The hotel was great. Perfect view. But there was two things that striked me.. 

1) two days after arrival the staff contacted me and wanted me to pay a deposit of 450 euro despite that I have prepared for my stay one week before arrival after receiving an order confirmation from the hotel. They told me the reason was for the room services that are available. 

2) The day of departure I got an invoice from reception: 50euro in taxes, 65euro in laundry.. An additional payment to what I have already payed. I feel that I was chited since this was not informed at the time I prepayed the hotel for my visit. 

",2,2014,04,19
46,Excellent business hotel,"The design of the rooms and room size are very good. The location of the hotel is great for both business and leisure. There is a beautiful view from the hotel and the hotel is very quietly situated on top of a hill.
Staff is very service minded and helpful.
Food in the restaurant is good with a decent selection of wines.
The gym is poorly equipped whereas the pool area is very nice.",5,2014,04,19
46,Outstanding service,"We booked ourselves an Easter 3 day, 2 night treat and we were not disappointed. On arrival, we were welcomed by polite professional staff. Beautifully appointed everywhere, we felt like royalty wherever we were in the hotel.",5,2014,04,18
46,First class,"The front desk staff set the standard for any top class Hotel and the staff at the Miramar are indeed First Class.

All of the service was of a very high standard. I would highly recomend the hotel to anyone comming to Barcelona.

I will be back.

Thank you",5,2014,04,12
46,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic 5 star hotel, highly recommended. Spacious and modern rooms, meeting my expectation. Great service.  

Two considerations that you need to be aware: (1) it is not in the heart of Barcelona and you would need to get on a taxi to get to the city, just a few minutes drive of course. Taxi cost very reasonable, around 7 Euro. (2) Breakfast is OK, but do not offer a wide range of choices. 

I will definitely go back. Relative to the quality of the hotel and the value offered, the two issues are quite acceptable.",5,2014,04,05
46,5 star,"What makes a hotel a true 5 star? It's not the view (which, as mentioned in so many comments, is sublime, probably the best in Barcelona, only to be rivalled by La Florida but without the disadvantage of being too far away from the city attractions), not the size of the rooms and the bathrooms (huge), not the terrace (you would happily spend your days on instead of sightseeing), not the towels and the bathrobes (fluffy like new), not the spa (beautiful but in need of some practical improvements), not even the restaurant (thoroughly enjoyable - read my comment for Forestier)… it's the hotel's Staff. I've travelled the world and stayed in all kind of hotels and B&Bs  in different countries and I run a small boutique hotel myself so I can appreciate perfection when I see it. When every single member of the team treats you as if you were a personal and a very important guest; when they address you by your name every time you walk through the reception (we only stayed for one night so I couldn't believe it!) and remember where you went (museum, walk, airport…) and are sincerely interested in your experience; when nothing you ask for is an issue but always a pleasure; when everybody, from the friendly barmen serving you a glass of wine to the beautiful spa receptionist smiling at you when you pass her on the way to the pool,  take pride in their job and the place they work at and do their absolute best to make you feel welcome… you know you are staying at a 5 star hotel.

I do have couple of comments, which are by no means criticism but just suggestions coming from somebody from the same industry. It's not very nice to see other guests being offered a glass of cava upon check-in while you are not (I understand it must be part of some package but then maybe it would be better to do it in the rooms). The fact that the sauna and hammam are on timer and need to be switched on 20 minutes prior to use needs to be explained to the guests when they come to use the spa - it's disappointing to come after a swim in the pool (great waterfall wall feature by the way and the water in the pool was warm like in a bath) and discover that you can't use it. The pre arrival communication could be better - I had to make a lot of calls/send a lot of e-mails to book with your directly as opposed to Booking.com (and got a discount from you which I am very grateful for!) and I didn't receive any confirmation until I called again, the day before my arrival, I got an impression my reservation wasn't even in the system, just as well it wasn't high season.

None of the above have spoilt our stay in any way. It was my second time at Miramar and I will certainly be back again. Thank you for all your hard work which you make look so effortless and elegant.",5,2014,03,31
46,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Miramar in Barcelona for a 2nd honeymoon and we could not have asked for a better experience. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, the public areas and rooms are clean and kept in good order, and the amenities abound. 
- Amazing views: We selected a premium room. Our room's private balcony on the 3rd floor had excellent views of both the sea and the city, with a peaceful ambiance looking out over the courtyard below. 
- Bed comfort: The bed was comfortable but perhaps not quite the quality I'd expect for a 5-star hotel, still we had no problems getting a good night's sleep. 
- Location: Overall I loved the location and what it had to offer, the only con here is the trek back up the hill to return to the hill after exploring the city can be exhausting (we made the climb once) - but if you catch a cab close by at the bottom it's only about 5 euros back up, so the advantage of the location for the views and peaceful serenity far outweigh this minor inconvenience. 
- Spa: The indoor heated pool and the jacuzzi are nice options but the water temperature for both of them was at best lukewarm and could have been better. After trying those out, we opted to run a nice hot bath in the huge bathtub in our room instead to get better heating for resting our weary legs. We did not try any of the other spa services.
- Breakfast/Room service: We did not choose to add on breakfast to our nightly rate, but we did order room service in the mornings. The food was average - after the first morning we opted to eat elsewhere but enjoyed our coffee from room service daily.
- Staff: Consistently the staff went above and beyond expectations. You are offered cava as you check in, and when we asked them questions or for recommendations, they always took it one step further and provided a lot of extremely useful info that made our ventures all the more pleasurable and easier.
- Overall: We were extremely pleased with our stay here and will definitely choose Hotel Miramar again the next time we visit Barcelona. The minor cons that I listed were just that - minor and I think that the pros far outweigh the cons to make this hotel an excellent choice. We had a wonderful time!",5,2014,03,27
46,Stunning views,This is a great hotel with lovely relaxing public spaces and good sized rooms but the real highlight is the huge balconies with stunning views! The bathrooms are also lovely with big baths that fill really quickly. I was working for the majority of my stay so didn't get to explore all of the hotel but I couldn't get enough of my balcony and enjoyed drinks there in the evening and a yummy breakfast in the morning. The breakfast is a little expensive but the quality is very good. I hope to return soon but this time for a holiday!,5,2014,03,23
46,Great hotel!!!,"Recently stayed 4 nights at the hotel in a premium double with breakfast included. On arrival staff were very helpful and attentive. The view from the room was lovely over the port/bay.  The spa and indoor pool was nice and relaxing.  The hotel is situated about 15mins from the airport in a taxi.  It's located on top of a hill so out the way of the city centre which we liked.  It was about 10min walk to the main part of Barcelona onto the la rambla.

Breakfast was also very nice and a great selection of food.  All in all a wonderful hotel.",5,2014,03,22
46,Real value for money,"I spent two nights here. Ate in the restaurant two nights. Got excellent service. Great advice on wine.
The hotel is situated with great views from all rooms. Easy to go to meetings all over Barcelona.",4,2014,03,18
46,Perfect place,Great hotel with beautiful rooms. but the biggest attitude is aww view. I was here with few friends and we had great time. The breakfast is pretty expensive but the food was worth that. Also the service was perfect. We have lost our guide book but the brunette girl - Ainoha in the reception staff was so nice and she helped us to plan everything perfect. We havnt lost and had a great sight seeing  in this beautiful city :-) We hadnt got ocasion to thank you for your help. We will come back for sure.,5,2014,03,03
46,Lovely Hotel!,"stayed here with friends for 3 nights... lovely hotel, very clean, staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you, only negative is the breakfast is very expensive hence we didn't eat in the hotel.
would stay here again as it seemed to be the best hotel I saw.

have a lovely stay in Barcelona.",5,2014,02,27
46,Great hotel with great views.,"Reading a previous review on this hotel it would be worth mentioning that, during our stay, the pool was closed, drained, cleaned and serviced. This was a disappointment for us, as we chose the hotel for, amongst other things, its spa facilities. I think, on booking, we should have been notified that this facility would not be available to us. The upside is, that on the last two days of out visit, the pool was clean, fresh and enjoyable. We found the staff and hotel fantastic on many levels and our room, on the fifth floor, had a superb view of the sprawling city below, with all its landmarks and distant mountains as a backdrop. Other rooms had equally stunning views of the waterfront, intriguing cable car (landing in the grounds of the hotel) and Mediterranean Sea beyond. A ten minute steep walk or fifteen minute gradual decline from Montjuec takes guests to eateries and the easy to use Metro system. The open top tour buses stop right outside the hotel and this proved very convenient. The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the experience of wakening up to the stunning views unforgettable. We would happily return to Hotel Miramar and hopefully, one day, will.",4,2014,02,25
46,Don't stay here,"In short it's not a true Spa hotel and the treatments are limited. The pool is only warm enough for a sea lion and was dirty. The haman/sauna/Jaq    were off and were on timers. The staff clean the glasses in your room, two feet away from your open toilet and in your own  sink where you have washed your hands and shaved. They seem to think that this is acceptable. If you confront the staff, they say it is hotel policy and if you speak to the management they say the opposite. Needless to say it's unhygienic and no doubt not a European directive..  So, don't go here for a clean and hygienic break, as you will either catch something or be disappointed. You'll also know the hotel management or staff will lie to you",2,2014,02,15
46,Wife's 40 surprise,"Fantastic hotel, great spot, near to city but far enough away to be very quite and relaxing when you need to get away from the noise etc, staff were nothing but excellent. Room was lovely and the food we had at the hotel was very good, highly recommend this hotel",5,2014,01,12
46,Wow wow wow,"After travelling through the Gatwick system on Xmas eve, losing our suitcase (courtesy of Gatwick), we finally arrived at the Miramar tired and jaded.  As soon as we set foot in the door we were embraced in the most fantastic care.  Ainhoa on reception offered us a drink, took care of the luggage problem, even found me her own nail varnish remover to use.  Our room was absolutely stunning.  Huge. Comfortable.  Gorgeous huge comfy bed with real wonderful pillows.  Huge balcony with an absolutely stunning view over the whole of Barcelona and the sea.  Bathroom - wow! Breakfast was great.  We had dinner in the bar area the evening we arrived and that was brilliant.  I cannot speak too highly about this hotel - just bliss. And fantastic location. Quiet and beautiful and only a 5 minute walk to the Parallel funicular which takes you straight down to the city.  Thank you to all the staff, but especially to Ainhoa",5,2014,01,05
46,Outstanding Property!,"We travel frequently to Barcelona and this is hands down our favorite hotel.  Sitting atop Montjuic, the view cannot be beat.  Add to that the numerous walking trails and park attractions surrounding the hotel, it is a destination location unto itself.  The hotel is lovely; the rooms spacious and the service wonderful.  We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.  The experience here is quintessentially Barcelona and one not to be missed.",5,2014,01,01
46,Inconsistent service - but one excellent night manager,"We stayed here just shy of a week during the summer of 2013. We chose this hotel because the location was close to the venue of the World Championship Swimming competition (BCN 2013) which we went to see 3 days in a row. 
The overall impression I got from this hotel was, although they were trying hard, it was not a 5 star hotel. The service was inconsistent (staff not well trained) and the bathrooms ill designed. It felt as though this hotel was built and owned by a wealthy individual who has no hotel experience, but just the passion to be in the business.

Our room was beside the pool, with a lovely balcony overlooking the Mediterranean sea. It was spacious, well lit and very clean but the bathroom was very strange. The bathroom seems to be the signature design of this hotel, but having a tub right by a large window where guest and staff actually pass by frequently is not a good idea. Yes I can close the shades, but then what is the point of the window? The shower room had no door. There were hinges, so I assume there used to be one, but they did away probably because it broke. Instead of getting a new door, they decided to hang a flimsy shower curtain that kept flowing and sticking to me whenever I turned the shower on (the air flow from the water made the curtain flow inside).
The toilet was behind an opaque glass door, which itself was fine. But the floor was not leveled properly when constructed, and the door kept getting stuck. I was afraid someone might break the glass door during our stay.

One night, there was a private party going on by the pool. It had loud music and went on and on and on. We assumed the music and the noise will be done by 10pm, but no. It was still going strong at midnight. So we called the front desk to complain. Nobody picked up the phone for 30 minutes. I went down to the lobby, and there was a man sitting at the front desk, ignoring the ringing phone, which I assume was from other hotel guests in the same boat as me.
I went up to talk to him but he didn't look up and instead waved me away. I was incensed and shouted that I cannot sleep because of the noise from the poolside. He looked a little sheepish after my outburst and pointed to and empty seat and said ""manager, manager, he come later"".
I decided to sit in front of this lazy man, whoever he was, and waited 15 minutes for the manager.
Apparently, the manager was busy shuttling angry guests to rooms on the opposite side of the hotel. He came downstairs exasperated at another angry looking guest, and apologized right away without knowing what I was there for. He offered a different room for the night so we took it. On the way to the new room, I asked him if there isn't a clause regarding how late the noise can go on in the banquet agreement. Apparently they didn't think of it which made me wonder how professionally run this hotel was.  ""We did not know this was a Jewish wedding. We are angry too. We are losing money"" - this was another comment by the manager which made me realize this place was run by amateurs. Definitely not a 5 star or even a 4 star hotel comment a manager should ever utter. 

The front desk was trying to be helpful in general but utterly hopeless. BCN 2013 was quite a big event in Barcelona during that time. The hotel did have officials staying there and the banner for the event was ubiquitous around the area where the hotel was. Lots of ads on the subway system too. Yet the staff I talked to had absolutely no idea about it. I would expect the staff to know what is going around at least near there hotel!  Another staff I talked to had no knowledge of the public bus system (where the bus stop was, destination of the bus, etc) that ran right in front of the hotel. Another did not know the ""hottest new tapas place"" that was written up in so many magazines (local and international) and which was known to be fully booked for weeks. This staff insisted booking the day before was fine and he had clout to do it, even though he admitted he never heard of the place. He refused to call the restaurant 3 days prior because he was so sure of himself so I had to have another staff call the place instead. It was fully booked anyway and the hotel did NOT have any clout over this restaurant to squeeze us in.
Another staff kept pushing for us to go to this touristy restaurant though I made clear I had no interest in tourist traps. I did some research before traveling to Barcelona, so I had a pretty clear idea of the well known places and what to avoid. I was surprised I was way more knowledgeable than the staff.

By the end of the stay I was utterly disappointing with the hotel. If it is going to call itself a 5 star or even a 4 star it should have the level of service and knowledge of running a hotel to go with it. Staff training seemed next to none.

I was ready to write an even more scathing review since the disappointment was such, but on the last evening of the stay, our son came down with a fever. I gave him some Tylenol which helped a bit during the say but by late night, he was in such bad shape that he would moan, whimper, and scream all at the same time. He would twist in bed, seeming as though he was hallucinating and screech with eyes open but no pupils. Like the possessed child Regan from the movie The Exorcist. So I had to do something, pronto. I had absolutely no faith in the front desk staff but had no other choice. The night manager at that time was someone I had never met before. I initially thought some more Tylenol will do but the manager said regulations did not allow hotels to give any medicine it had to guests. He offered to have staff go out and buy some at a 24 hour pharmacy but also asked me if a doctor's visit would benefit. I didn't think I could drag my son to a hospital but he said ""no, no, a doctor will come visit here. I will arrange everything"". And he did, right away. An hour later, I opened the door to see a Guy Falkes Mask. Alas, it was the real face of the doctor. Very surreal situation with his strange look and my Exorcist son, but he went straight to my son and did all the professionally correct things a doctor should do. His English was extremely good, and relayed to me what needs to be done and how. He also prescribed some medicine which the hotel staff went out to fetch. As we didn't have any cash to pay the doctor (less than $150 - great healthcare system), the night manager worked his magic to produce cash to the doctor and billed us the exact amount on top of our hotel bill which we payed by credit card.
I could not say enough about this one night manager. He was very professional in handling this kind of situation and obviously had years of experience in the hospitality industry. He was superbly competent and knew exactly what was necessary and knew exactly what to do, and how to say it. He was not there in the morning so I could not thank him, but he single-handedly changed our impression of the hotel from ""never come back"" to ""will consider coming back"". I just wish he could train all of the staff there.",3,2013,12,30
46,Relaxing with a view,"We stayed here for three nights at the beginning of December.  Barcelona was a little chilly, but we were prepared.  We love this hotel.  The staff are very friendly and made us feel at home.  Our room was very comfortable and large...we were on the 5th floor with a view of the harbor.  

We never did eat in the restaurant, but we always had room service breakfast which was great...very good coffee.  You can't smoke in the rooms, but out on the balcony is okay.

There is a sort of sewer smell which comes into the bathroom and out in the hallways.  One staff person said he's so used to it he doesn't notice it anymore.  It doesn't seem to be a problem that can be fixed easily or cheaply.  We just ignored it as best we could.   That's the only downside to this hotel.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2013,12,22
46,Hotel with a better view than most in Barcelona,"Lovely hotel located on hillside over looking the Barcelona Harbour. Easy taxi ride to port if you are staying for a pre-cruise visit. Also on the Hop On/Hope Off bus route if you want to do general sightseeing from this location. Modern building with good design and very smart rooms. Beds a little on the hard side, could use improved quality, but staff attentive to needs and listened to our observations. Restaurant meal was good. If you like a room with a bath, ask for it, because not all rooms (even most expensive one's) are equipped.",5,2013,12,15
46,A haven of sanity within the worlds coolest city,"A boutique hotel which is intimate and comfortable. You don't have to pose here - genuinely just relax and enjoy - a haven on Montjuic giving you time and space to relax and recharge. Genuinely helpful staff who are attentive without being intrusive, an air of exclusivity without pomposity and great views. Why go anywhere else?",5,2013,11,30
46,"Decent hotel, good views","The hotel is what you would expect from a 5* hotel. It has excellent staff, a reasonable  bar and high standard finish rooms. We stayed on the 5th floor with views overlooking the city and slightly the sea which actually meant we had a great view of sun rise and sun set. The room was not as big as I was expecting (Premium) but no real complaints as it had everything we needed including free wifi. It has a slightly business feel about it, but again often the case with city hotels so not a complaint at all. Breakfast at 28 Eur is probably too much (didn't take this option) as you can get a load of food just down the road.

The only downside for me is the location, what you gain at the hotel for having such good views over the city you lose because it is half way up the mountain (hill). The walk was fine for us as we are fairly young. But for people who have concerns about mobility it would be a challenge for sure.",4,2013,11,24
46,Be warned: this hotel is 50 meters from a noisy shooting range...,"Beautiful hotel located on Montjuïc, where the 1992 Olympics found place. 

Pro: spacious room, balcony, great bath. Wifi works very well. And iPod dock to sound up your room. 

Con: 
Room not available. They'd call when ready, never happened... 
Asked for a quiet room, but ALL deluxe rooms are on the side where happens to be a.. shooting range (yes, an Olympic one). 
Management says; don't worry; they finish in a couple of hours... 
Could be, but that ruins in this case our afternoon time on the balcony (everyday..). 
And please note; they start around 9:00, yes on weekend days as well. 
What's the value of a spacious room or a design bath or a fine interior, when you can't get your sleep? 
Unfortunately this was not our only complaint about noise. The hotels' atrium works like a giant amplifier boosting every sound near lobby or restaurant up to the highest floor. So if guests like to ignore the fact that their behavior will greatly disturb other guests, we easily got woken up by their loud laughs, shouting, saying goodnight. This happened on two out of three nights @4:15 & @4:30 + 5:15. The management seems not to have or claim any control on sound that disturbs guests. 
The compensation was below reasonable.",2,2013,11,17
46,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff","My husband and I, we had a wonderfull stay. The room are just amazing and we were lucky to have a sea view room. Front desk staff was wonderfull, specially Ainoha,, with her suggestiosn on sightseeing and restaurants, I have to remark her good french speaking that is very difficult to find .Thank you for made us have a wonderfull stay.

I recommend everybody to go and visit the hotel. We will go back for sure.",5,2013,11,16
46,"Great hotel, great staff!","I have stayed in this hotel for one night and I really enjoyed staying here. Especially because of the staff. Laia from the reception was incredibly nice at the check in as well as Ainoa who helped us making a reservation for a nice restaurant and explained us where to go to buy nice shoes!. Everytime we walked in or left the hotel we were greeted and felt very welcome. The room was nice, big and with a great view. I would stay again in this hotel.",5,2013,11,14
46,A room with a view,"This hotel was a fabulous surprise, we booked through Hotwire and definitely got more than we paid for. We stayed for 3 nights October 17th – 19th. 

The hotel is located in the Montjuic area of Barcelona and has sweeping views of both the city and the sea. The hotel is impeccable from the lobby, to the hotel rooms to the grounds. Its a relaxing retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Downtown is a short cab ride (10 euros) but for the more ambitious the walk is doable but long.

The staff at Hotel Miramar were courteous and helpful and always remembered our names. We especially enjoyed our evening in the piano bar with Sebastian our entertainment for the evening, he played a wonderful selection of music and encouraged requests. 

I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for something different.",4,2013,11,03
46,Harassed and threatened by management to pay someone else's bill,"Don't ever stay here! I travel the world for my job.  I've logged millions of miles in travel around the world, and I have never encountered anything as bad as this even in the most remote and under-developed areas.  I stayed at this hotel because I was attending a conference there. One morning, I was awoken by a phone call from the sales and marketing director asking me to come downstairs and pay a bill immediately.  I explained I didn't know what he was talking about.  He said, ""So you're refusing to pay this bill?""  I said I didn't know what he was talking about.  ""Whatever"" was his response.  I almost thought my teenagers were playing a prank as the responses were so juvenile. Later, I was pulled aside in front of the conference attendees and yelled at for refusing to pay a bill that wasn't mine to pay.  I was surrounded by staff and security and forced into a hotel office where I wasn't allowed to leave while I was threatened and harassed to pay someone else's bill.  Because no one would let me talk, or if I tried to talk, I got responses like ""Oh, excuses, excuses"", I couldn't get them to understand they had the wrong person.  When it was finally over, and after several calls with my lawyer, they finally admitted they had harassed and threatened the wrong person.  They did send an apology letter, which basically laid blame on the conference and took no responsibility for the vile and unprofessional treatment I received by their staff.  They agreed to comp my room in return for my public harassment, humiliation and generally awful treatment, but that never happened.  Instead, they tried to offer a free night's stay in the future. Sadly, I would never trust this hotel with my credit card or information ever again.  I'm  still trying to undo the unauthorized charges that came through.  And the staff blatantly lied about what they promised or said.  Luckily, everything is captured on video and if you call the police or bring in a lawyer, all those discrepancies are caught on tape.  But it's best to just stay away because generally speaking, I like to avoid police incidents during my overseas travel. This hotel is like lodging with the mafia or a gang that is trying to extort money out of you  and holding you hostage until they get it.  Rude is too calm of a word.  Criminal might be better.",1,2013,10,18
46,Fantastic View,"This was a fabulous choice from the iPrefer hotel group.
Our stay was for 3 nights  Oct. 2-5 2013. Located At the top of the Barcelona cable car hill. There were plenty of tourists around our hotel every day because of the panoramic views of Barcelona. Our room was clean with a nice balcony and a fabulous view of the port area and beautiful sunrises.
It was a short walk to the hop on hop off bus and tickets can be purchased for a discount at the front desk . A cab ride to Los Ramblas  & museums or shopping was only 10 euros.  We ate at the hotel for one supper and next door at Santini's 
another night and were pleased with the food and service at both.
I would highly recommend this lovely Hotel.",5,2013,10,17
46,Unpretentious charm,"I have stayed in very few hotels in Barcelona because I keep coming back here. I love the cool, spacious décor, and the location. You can be in the city centre in a few minutes (by taxi or teleferique) yet you feel well outside the bustle and the seemingly unavoidable thievery of the city's centre. The staff are extremely welcoming, and there is a charming terrace for breakfast, lunch and sundowners. Our room had a balcony overlooking the docks where the cruise liners moor. The room was simple and well-equipped, not over-luxurious. And the Miro museum is a short walk up the hill.",4,2013,10,16
46,Great location and views!,"We stayed at this lovely hotel for 3 nights.  The hotel is situalted on top of a hill which provides stunning views of the sea and thus you get the added benefit of a good workout if you decide to walk up and down the steep hill to go to see various sights.  The room was basic enough and the bathroom a little small but again, the views made it all worthwhile.  I highly recommend getting a room with a patio balcony overlooking the sea so you can sit outside at night and just enjoy the beauty of the location.  The fitness center is large and spacious and very well equipped.  The restaurant is also very, very good.",4,2013,10,05
46,Very chilled out,"We stayed here on our last night in Barcelona with our 4-month old baby. We stayed in a premium room, which was very large and well designed. I particularly liked the sleek design of the bath.

The terrace had great views; had it not been raining we would have enjoyed sundowners there.

We had dinner and drinks in the bar / lounge, with our sleeping baby and it was a lovely, relaxing end to our trip.
I had the prawn stew which was risotto and a soup combined - so so delicious.

The indoor swimming pool is warm and very relaxing; I could easily have spent an afternoon here. The sauna is lovely but I think the jacuzzi was a but cold.

Beware of other guests smoking in their rooms, as the corridor smelt - but room was ok.",4,2013,10,04
46,"Smells disgusting, rude staff","Terrible service, especially by hotel manager Simone- who was extreamly unapologetic of the fact that there was running water from our room ceiling. Not to mention the stench of the hotel, particularly our room. Food disgusting too, don't bother with this hotel at all. There are so many gorgeous hotels in this city, and this one is certainly not one of them ",1,2013,09,29
46,Very helpful & friendly and a nice hotel,"The Miramar did not disappoint and my husband and I had a short stay here. Staff were very friendly and helpful, for example the concierge sorted out a problem with our 'private taxi' from the airport which we had pre-paid but the driver was insisting we had to pay him too. The Concierge explained to the driver that our paperwork stated we had paid in advance. Problem sorted!
All the staff were friendly and very attentive. The rooms were spacious and clean. Not so sure about the curtain dividing the sleeping area from the bathroom, and yes you can here your partner very clearly using the toilet.
Breakfast was short on choice but tasty. We had dinner in the restaurant, extremely good food but helpings were small and overall expensive for what we had.
The hotel has fabulous views of the port, marina and city. Be aware though that the container port is next to the cruise/ferry port.
We highly recommend using the tour bus to see Barcelona, and the stop across the street from the hotel. It's a hop on/hop off bus and there are 3 different routes. The hotel is on the red route. We loved being to stop where we wanted and saw a lot of the city which we would not normally have seen. The bus has free wi-fi too and an audio guide (in many languages) which was informative.
The cable car is next to the hotel but a bit pricey to go down to the port/marina. There is the Miramar restaurant which is reasonably priced (next to the cable car) and a bar/restaurant to the right of the hotel which did do drinks and food at lower prices, plus the views are great.
We had a late flight and rather than booking our room for a late check out, we were guided to the spa where the lockers could fit in our luggage (cabin size) and use the facilities. We spent the day sunbathing by the outside pool (flies a bit of a problem) and then showered and changed before going to the airport. There was no cost for using the spa or its changing facilities.
Overall we would recommend this hotel for a short stay and it is in a great position to sightsee Barcelona.",4,2013,09,27
46,Lovely hotel but for a honeymoon it is missing the wow...,"We stayed here at the end of August for 4 nights for a mini-moon directly after our wedding. This is a tricky review to write, the hotel is absolutely fine. It's clean, well kept, sleek, modern...but it really is lacking warmth and personality and because I spent MONTHS trying to find the perfect honeymoon hotel I feel I would like to give other couples looking for a similar romantic hotel some honest advice. Because this isn't a romantic hotel. The room was fine, it had a nice view, the bed was HUGE and very comfortable but the room itself is just standard and more like a business hotel. The photos on the website are misleading, they show a large bright room with double aspect windows when in fact it's a box shaped room, very dark and windows on one wall leading to the balcony. The bathroom is very nice, a large walk in double shower and free standing bath. It also has the only mirror in the room which is odd. And awkward! They need one in the bedroom.

We chose the hotel for the outdoor space, we had visions of sipping wine in the evenings on the terrace but it never really happened. Firstly, it's a balcony not a terrace and they are all stacked on top of each other as I guess you would expect of a hotel of this size. This isn't boutique. It's mass. So there's no privacy and you can see and hear your neighbours on all sides through the gaps in the canvas.

The pool area is a real plus. If you are coming here to lounge by the pool I think this hotel is a very good choice. They serve very nice cocktails, at a very hefty price I may add, but we spent many an hour sipping these enjoying the views. The food is not good. We had room service on our first night and we were so disappointed we didn't try it again. It's such a shame and in hindsight I wish I had taken the food more into consideration when making my decision because it would have been nice not to have to go out every evening. And to restaurants in other hotels we had looked at! The breakfast was mediocre at best and in the end we stopped getting up for it.

There are two restaurants at the front of the hotel. One is at the top of the cable car and should be avoided at all costs - except for a drink actually, because the views are good. The other restaurant is new and we intended to eat there but never got around to it but it looked very nice. 

It's a good 15 minutes walk down into the city but a very enjoyable one. Coming back up is quite funny. It is unbelievably steep! We did it a couple of times because it's not that long a walk so it's over quickly but it really is steep!

We got the cable car down to the beach one day, it leaves from directly outside the hotel and that was very nice but it did make us realise we should have stayed on the beach. Being able to pop out for a drink or a walk on the promenade would have been nice. In hindsight I would have gone for Hotel Arts or even the W simply for location and food.

Overall this hotel is a nice hotel. I think it's very over priced once you are there for what you get but that is common in 5 star hotels. It's 4 Euro's to order room service. And during our stay there was an irate guest in the lobby arguing because he had asked for a spoon to be brought to his room and got charged 4 Euros for it. This kind of silliness amazes me at such hotels. They take things to the extreme.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends, only because it's not our scene and I don't think it would be any of our friends cup of tea either. That said, you can see from the other reviews that plenty of people enjoy it. And as I said, there really isn't much wrong with it...",3,2013,09,23
46,Nice hotel but logistics can be improved,"It was a breath taking experience when i arrived at the hotel, very good location on one of the hills of Barcelona, the view is ok, but on the right side you see the habour whish is not so nice with all the containers. My biggest surprise was the logistics and how they handle there room reservatuion, three of my colleagues had trouibles with the room,  2 lost the room without even mentioning or asking if the people would show up( we had big function going on with more than 30 rooms) 2 of my colleagues were evn asked to share as of the second night the room for giving this to other people, what a bad way of taking care of clients. The 5 stars are surely not deserved!",3,2013,09,18
46,Superb views,"Fantastic position. As the other reviewers have said - you have to get a taxi back or walk up the hill - I did the latter and felt virtuous. Breakfast good but not excellent. Beware slippery floor on exiting shower - and a vicious modernistic extension to the end of the bed (one injured shin). Recommended as long as you know about the location  (quiet, but accessibility not great for pure walkers). Rather expensive.",4,2013,09,15
46,Location is peaceful,"We chose this hotel because we (correctly) anticipated a hectic cruise, and we immensely enjoyed the peaceful location, and the boutique feel to this hotel.  When we go to NYC, for example, we like the Ritz in Battery Park - well away from the hectic pace of the Theatre District.  If that's you too, then you might enjoy this hotel.  The hop-on-hop-off bus is just out front of the hotel so if you buy a one or two day pass, it can save you from walking up and down the hill (the hotel can sell you these at a slight discount);   otherwise, a E10-15 taxi is needed to/fro Las Ramblas.  There were some issues:  we had a flood in our bathroom area (which is open to the bedroom, so if you need to go in the middle of the night, your other half will hear you).  The flood got fixed, but it was a hassle to deal with.  Also, the steam room and sauna were both broken.  Not so good for a 5-star.  The pools also look old, but they were pleasant to swim in.  The room service was awesome - nice presentations, and generous quantities.  Pianist in the evenings was amazing. Beds extremely comfortable and very large (at least king size like those in USA/Canada). [Management somewhat made up for the issues but....... I left a flip flop sandal in my room by mistake and when I got home and emailed the hotel, they said it would cost E31 to mail to Canada......]",4,2013,09,06
46,So very nearly a five rating,"Great location although always a taxi ride away from anything but more on that later. The rooms were fabulous, light and airy, sea view, good size bed and all the extras you might expect from a five star hotel. Food was pretty good although we found it repetitive having stayed there for nine nights plus it was a little on the expensive side. Service was mostly ok but the shining lights were the hotel receptionists and management who were very attentive and always eager to please. Regarding the taxis, beware they always try to rip you off but at least I got fifteen Euros back thanks to the hotel staffs efforts in getting the taxi driver back to give me the money he stole from me in excess fare. Overall would go back again so that in itself should give it the fifth star treatment.",4,2013,09,06
46,"Fabulous hotel, great and flexible service, very friendly staff...","I have spent some days in this hotel with my colleagues for our yearly offsite event. This hotel is great! beautiful rooms with a great view. very friendly staff, flexible service, great and fast wifi connection (very uncomplicated in comparison to other hotels). The breakfast buffet doesn't only look awesome but it tastes very good. Everything done very well and with an eye for detail. Check-in area looks like a comfortable living-room. You can sit down instead and relax while the check-in is done very quickly - better than  checking-in standing at a counter. Great spa as well! I can really recommend this hotel for vacation as well as for a business event with small groups. Would love to stay here again..",5,2013,08,23
46,Fabulous stay,"We spent four nights here at the beginning of August 2013 and it was fabulous.  Initial confusion about our room booking was sorted very quickly by the staff and we never looked back.  The room was on the 5th floor with an amazing view over Barcelona city and port and a lovely balcony to watch the world go by.  The pool was small but perfect at the end of a hot day of sightseeing.  Being on the hill, although a short cab ride back at the end of the day, was perfect to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.  Would definitely go back.",5,2013,08,20
46,Amazing hotel,"I spent a long weekend with my girlfriend here in June. Upon arrival it was clear that the hotel was going to be something else and it didn't disappoint. At check in there was a slight confusion on which room I was to be allocated as I had requested a certain type which wasn't originally given. The staff handled this and in no time we was changed to another room (101) which was everything I could have asked for. Many people had complained about the location of the hotel I had noticed but found myself that the location could not have been better. The views are breathtaking overlooking the harbour and it takes a 5 minute walk to get into the heart of the city. We choose to get taxis which where relatively reasonable and perfect for going there and back. The pools, both indoor and outdoor, where fantastic. As well as the spa and gym facilities. 

Overall this hotel is fantastic and definitely one I would recommend. What really made our stay special was the member of staff at the front desk Paula! Every problem or question I had, she was always willing to help and always went out of her way. She helped in sorting out our room and making sure everything was perfect for our stay. At dinner time, I went to her for advice on places to eat and she always made it her business to help and make reservations for us on the places she suggested. It was no surprise that the places we went where exceptional! 

I would definitely recommend this hotel and I hope to get back in the near future!",5,2013,08,14
46,Lovely Hotel but bit out of the way,"Spent a long weekend here in June.
Lovely rooms, more like a suite really.
Very quiet and peaceful.
Only ate breakfast in hotel which was nice Good variety and buffet style.
Bit of a walk into town centre, fine on the way down but taxi back a must!!
Drink prices not too bad.
All in all, great for a short break",4,2013,08,03
46,One of Barcelonas best,"Stayed in lots of Barcelona 5 stars but this was brilliant just for one night before joining a cruise
Wish we have had a week at the mirimar stunning location stunning views rooms exceptional and a brilliant pool in the grounds",5,2013,07,30
46,Stunning location is the standout,"The unbeatable location is the best reason for staying here, although that also has its slight downside. Hotel is an extended former luxury villa perched on the Montjuic hillside above the heat and noise of the city, in quiet parkland where galleries and the 1992 Olympic stadium nestle in exotic gardens. Views from the hotel terraces over the sea and city are breathtaking. Inside, public areas are clean and smart. Rooms have pros and cons. Good size, amply furnished, excellent beds, super aircon, balconies, all bells and whistles. But trendy bathroom design may not be to all tastes. A third of the room is curtained off to hide a large freestanding bath which looks a bit like a beached rowing boat minus the oars. Shower (fiddly to operate) and loo are in separate glass cubicles. Downside of this cluttered arrangement is that someone wanting to use the loo at night has to turn the lights on and wake others up or take a header into the bath. All a bit too design-crazy for my liking although others may love it. Housekeeping, alas, not quite up to standard: Inconsistent and sometimes eccentric: a large florescent light bulb left abandoned one day on a bathroom floor, turndown some days but not others, bizarrely only one side of the bed turned down, confusion over requests for replacement items. Only small niggles, sure, but not really what you expect at this level, although in fairness rooms always well cleaned. Also, despite the outward appearances of splendour, some doors and wardrobes becoming a little battle-scarred with dents and scratches. Outside, the pool is welcome after a hot day in the city but the tranquility is disturbed by the bam-bam-bam from a gun club behind the hotel and the relentless europop music played by the pool (presumably to drown out the gun club). Sun beds run out quickly at busy periods. But for all that, the pool is lovely and a rarity among Barca hotels. Staff are very pleasant and helpful, particularly front desk. Be aware that getting downtown and back is not quite as simple as it might seem: it's a 20 min walk downhill to the centre, or a 10 min walk to the nearest Metro connection. Few are likely to walk back at night (not dangerous, just too hot up a steep hill) but cab fares are remarkably good value ( five or six pounds mostly from city centre) so don't let that worry you. Be aware, though, that there is nothing on your doorstep apart from the hotel's own snack bar (which does have brilliant views). As for food, we ate out all the time apart from a few sandwiches and coffees so cannot comment. So overall, a very smart, clean and comfortable hotel with a gorgeous location that perhaps tries just a little too hard to be uber cool and not quite hard enough on getting it right in the rooms area. Very much worth considering, particularly for a short Barca break, and it is well worth paying the small premium for a sea-facing room at the front.",4,2013,07,27
46,"Friendly staff, amazing views","The hotel is located high above the city, but a nice walk down (and a cheap taxi back).  A found the staff to be extremely friendly, the food excellent and the rooms and bathrooms were large and comfortable.  Some of the technical aspects frustrated a little.  Tricky plumbing and a lot of messing around with resetting room keys for the two interconnecting rooms.  However, next time in Barcelona, I would back to the Miramar without question.",4,2013,07,26
46,"staff and view perfect,rooms not","If only the rooms were as perfect as the staff and the view (sea side)...I am surprised that this hotel is ""a prestigious member of the group small luxury hotels"". I have been in less"" luxurious"" hotels with a more luxurious feel. 
Our premium size room would have been too small for us had we brought a suitcase and terribly small had we brought 2 suitcases. The bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept very well. The view from our balcony was fantastic, the garden furniture comfortable. The refrigerator well stocked. Free Wifi easy to access. Later a welcome letter with some cookies. I did not need it, but stationery and envelopes are something I always find in a hotel. There was only a tiny block of paper.
 Written instructions pertaining to accessing  the swimming pool would be highly recommended. We were told at reception that the outside pool is on the 3rd floor and the inside pool on the 2nd. This is also clearly shown in the elevator. After a long day of walking on Montjuic, I wanted to go to the pool,my husband not. We found the entrance on the 3rd floor, but saw that to return through this door would not be possible. Because I was exhausted, I just did not feel like asking reception how to get back into the hotel from the pool, so I skipped the pool.. The next day we asked and learned that  returning to your room is only possible through the 2nd floor. It is simple as long as you know it.
 The sofa at the foot of our bed had spots on it, which gave a shabby feel to the room. 
But our main complaint is the bathroom,which may have seemed ultra modernly designed, and although the shower and toilet sections are separate and practical in this respect,it is lacking some very essential features. First of all, the floors are very slick,especially when a little water splashes on them. Actually, it is almost necessary to wear the slippers provided to avoid falling,but barefoot in the shower? The shower was very complicated and although there are 3 functions, they cannot be used separately, because one of the other functions leak at the same time. Was frustrating to manipulate. I have NEVER been in a hotel without a shelf for the shower gel and shampoo. Quite a balancing act to reach down on the floor for soap,trying to avoid falling on the slick floor. Almost worse than the shower was the Bidet. No towel rack with a small towel to dry off with. The only option is to go into the sink area after using the bidet (picture this!) and try to decide whether to use the hand towel under the sink or the large bath towel. Ugh!
Every single member of the staff was cordial and friendly. The restaurant staff was also very pleasant and professional. The dinner was very expensive, with small portions, but nevertheless very good. The breakfast was exceptionally generous. The hotel lobby was spacious and elegant, with a luxurious feel. 
We definitely WILL COME AGAIN. We will ask for the same room, bring little luggage,hope the sofa has been recovered,check the bathroom for a shower shelf and the bidet for a towel rack with small towel, will wear the slippers except in the shower, will go to the pool through the spa and change into our bathing suit there. (the pool situation really needs to be explained. For example, that you cannot go to the pool from the 3rd floor in bathing suit and bathrobe, because when you come back through the spa on the 2nd floor, you have to cross the upper portion of the lobby!)
I hope the management will take my complaints seriously. Even if it might be a year until we return, complaints from future guests could be avoided.
All in all, the hotel room was a disappointment for a 5 star hotel. And we will only return because of the fantastic location and the  very satisfying service provided by the staff. They deserve to be complimented.The location should not make up for the qualities lacking. These qualities should not have been lacking in a hotel of this category.",3,2013,07,25
46,Huge rooms with great amenities. Among the best in Europe in my experience.,"I travel to various places in Europe quite frequently and this hotel had the largest and most amenity-filled rooms I've ever seen in Europe.  Spacious room with separate sitting and work areas, comfortable beds and a large ""full-service"" bathroom with double sinks, bathtub and separate shower and toilet areas.  Also, because much of my European travel is for business purposes, the quality and cost of WiFi is very important.  This hotel offered free WiFi and the speed (at least at my room location) was excellent. The only potential negative with this hotel is its location, as it is located atop a small mountain top (called Montjiuc), which is a good 15 minutes walk down to the city (e.g. to Las Ramblas area).   However, if you like a somewhat remote location, then that would not be an issue. There is also a sky tram boarding stop just outside the hotel which provides scenic skyline views and ends at the beach.  Overall, an excellent hotel worthy of its 5-star rating. ",5,2013,07,21

46,Quality location and breakfast,"We spent three days here in March and even then it was cool and sunny. The hotel is on the same hill that the old Olympic stadium is on and has an ideal view of the city and out to sea. It's a lovely small hotel, with a great pool and gym and the breakfast's are to die for. I was especially a fan of the giant Nespresso machine they had. My wife and I love walking, so with the hotel located 20 minutes from the main city centre was something we liked. We got a phenomenal deal on this hotel through otels.com",5,2013,07,16
46,Amazing design with a few faults,"Stayed 4 days which gave us a good inside of the tops and flops. The welcome was very warm, helpful and very friendly.
The rooms are little small considering you may travel with 2 suitcases.
The view and rooms quality is top and I believe in any room. We were on the 5th floor facing the entrance which was the downside since there is a highly annoying noise coming from the opposite building. Sounds like a shooting range. AM to PM and even ruined the pool experience. The gym isn't impressive either, ladies sauna didn't work.
Though, the pool and the staff is lovely. Leonardo, the senior service staff is a star. He knows what he is doing and utmost friendly, fast and capable and training his team well comparing to the management which stands around in their suits and never greeted or smiled on plenty of occasion (eg. tall bald gentleman with glasses)
They should rather work on getting more sun beds because we had to lay twice on the grass since they have only a dozen!! That's a Joke!
The food isn't any great (breakfast is okay but too pricy for what it is)  and definitely recommend to eat outside, Gothic quarter has amazing options.
So, staff is very friendly, rooms are pretty but small, pool is nice but noisy and not enough sun beds, food is okay but below standards. 
Would I come again? Yes, on special offer and not a honeymoon",3,2013,07,14
46,Peaceful and pleasant,"The hotel is a little outside of the main centre so a taxi is needed often, but the hotel has a wonderful view over the city and is directly on Montjuic and so a good place for walking. Service is good - friendly and helpful and the rooms are well equiped. Restaurant is very good if you don't want to go into the city.",4,2013,07,11
46,Absolutely the worst experience,"As a customer I don't care about who the hotels do business with and what type of contracts they have with certain companies. When I make a booking via international booking site I most certainly don't feel it is my responsibility to check the booking, however this is what I did before our trip since the price was quite low compared to normal rates. I got a reply from the hotel briefly emailing me that the booking has been a mistake of the booking company and I should contact them. All in all it turned out that the booking was cancelled at the end.

As a frequent traveler I think this is quite unacceptable. Again, as a customer I feel it is not my business to worry about these things. If someone messes up and this hotel ends up selling rooms for a low rates, it is something they need to worry about without leaving the customer without a hotel on their holiday. 

We have had all kinds of mess up's with even the best hotels but so far they have always been handled with style. Miramar didn't handle it that way. Absolutely a horrible experience. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2013,07,09
46,"Pretty surface, bad execution!","This hotel has a nice lokation and it looks nice, BUT they fail to execute on the promise. Service was often slow and unattentive. Nice pool area and breakfast. The worst part was that they hosted a party until 4 AM which made us get no sleep.",2,2013,07,08
46,"Location looks far from downtown, but it isn't!","When I went in Miramar I was a little bit reluctant, all my data showing that the distance from downtown is big, 4-5 Kilometers. But after a day, I was enthusiastic. Being in a very active outdoor activity part of my life I really enjoyed that fact. The hotel is up to a hill, facing the Barcelonetta marina on one side, an all the city on the other side. Great pics all day. I reached the main shopping area in 20 minutes by foot. All the way is downhill, so no big effort. Walking (or running) around its also a great possibility, because Miramar is surrounded by public gardens. A touristic bus stop is outside the hotel, and a taxi will cost you 6-7 euros to La Ramblas. What else to add? Outdoor pool, spa, gym, and some restaurants ( I didn't check the quality). Downsize? Maybe the staff, which is very nice, but a little bit slow. But that's Spain, don't take it personal!",4,2013,07,07
46,"great hotal, great view","i have spent 3 nights and was very very happy with everything.
large room with a great fancy bath just in front of a great window so you can take in the view, great big shower, a long bed (i am 6.6""), a privet balcony, free WiFi all around, staff is very helpful and happy to make your stay pleasant, nice breakfast, lovely swimming pool, great view and a short walking distance to the city center (take a cab coming back as it is a steep climb).
one of the best hotels i ever been to!
even the prices at the bar are reasonable considering how fancy the hotel is, not cheap but reasonable.",5,2013,07,06
46,Good view but need to pay attention to details,"Hotel Miramar is on a hill, which means we will need to walk up and down the hill to get to the metro station . However if you are a beach lover, you can take the cable car at the back of the hotel straight to the beach in 8 mins! This is the coolest thing of the hotel!

The hotel has been built a long time ago, but I guess they had renovated it fairly recently to keep it look modern. We stayed at the premium room , overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, which is superb! However the facilities of the room are not so good. The door to the balcony can't open properly because the gap with the floor is too small, so it made funny sound when we tried to open with force. The doors of the wardrobe also can't be shut well unless both doors are shut at the same time. 
However the bed and shower were good. There is separate shower compartment and toilet compartment. 

There is only just a semi transparent striped curtain between the bed and the bathroom, it will not be convenient if you are traveling with a not so close friend.

The pool was the smallest I have seen for any 5 star hotel. And seagulls kept stopping over for a dip and swim. There is a spa with sauna but the sauna was not on and you have to wait for around half an hour before it is heated up, so we gave up.

The most annoying thing was there was no electric heater nor tea bags nor coffee powder mix! This should be the standard even in smaller hotels in Europe!

The good views of the sea made up a lot of the good points I gave to the hotels. However it also lost a lot of points from the lack of attention to details. 

",4,2013,06,30
46,First trip to Barcelona,"Stayed here back in March, the hotel on arrival looks very luxurious followed by a warm and helpful welcome. All the staff speak many languages and are happy to answer any questions. One night we asked them to book us a table at a recommended restaurant and organise taxi etc... which they did and the restaurant was an excellent choice. 

The cable car is right outside the back of the hotel and is a great way to get down into the coast. 

The spa/pool area has a smallish sized pool, gym (both unisex) and steam room, sauna and jacuzzi which are single sex. My partner noticed a couple in the male facilities so for the rest of our stay we both went into the males area. 

If you go to La Rambla (which i recommend you do!) keep your handbag and belongings close to you! As like in a lot of cities you will come across pickpockets.  

Overall a great stay, beautiful city full of friendly locals and we are planning on going back August!!

P.s the restaurant serves lovely food with the bar offering nice cocktails with friendly service!",5,2013,06,26
46,Refuge from the crowds,Stayed for a long weekend in may.  Hotel was in a great position overlooking Barcelona. A real escape from the crowded city centre. Drinks very expensive as was the food but would recommend for a lovely romantic stay. ,5,2013,06,22
46,"Better than the W, if it's not your 1st time to Barcelona","Stayed at the W for 4 nights, then switched to the Miramar with a Premium room booking and was wowed, because of the quality of room and huge private terrace (!!). Think romantic relaxation vs. clubby atmosphere of W. There are pros and cons of both hotels; one being a mass chain, the other being more boutique, so you can't compare apples to apples. 

Overall, if it's your 1st visit to Barcelona, then stay at the W. But if its your 2nd or 3rd visit, or near the end of your stay, and you're exhausted from traipsing around the city, do yourself a favor and switch to the Miramar (often less expensive than W too): The cool, chic atmosphere, the nice touches (complimentary gourmet marshmallows and candies in the glass apothecary jars at the bar), and the hilltop views of the water. You get a more for the money and it feels a lot more romantic than the W. 

Here are my comparisons:

Miramar Premium Room

PROS:
-situated mountain top with harbor view overlooking public fountain plaza and ocean
-private terrace/balcony that spans the ENTIRE length of the room - super spacious! you could have a party up there, that's how big it is.
-separate tub (i'm a bath fanatic)
-super cool and design-y outdoor pool area 
-free use of indoor pool, sauna
-boutique feel (only 75 rooms), never overcrowded
-free wifi

CONS:
-service is good (has a Tripadvisor certificate of Excellence), but not as internationally finessed as W
-need a 5 minute cab ride into city (nothing around it since you're on a winding road to the top)

W Hotel (standard double room)
PROS:
-beach view
-excellent W service
-easy, enjoyable walk into the city

CONS
-no separate tub
-no terrace or outside balcony
-must pay for wifi
-often overcrowded and feels ""mass""",4,2013,06,17
46,One Of The Worst Nights I've Ever Had In A Hotel,"I stayed here because I was booked in by a conference organiser. I arrived late (23:00) after a long day and the normal airport hassle so was immediately irritated by the failure of my room key to unlock my room. However, that's getting ahead of myself. 

My room was ""interesting"" - it was claimed as ""Room 203"" yet didn't appear on the signage next to the only other two rooms on the second floor (perhaps not surprisingly, Rooms 201 and 202). I was about to give up when I saw a temporary printed sign for Room 203 on an otherwise anonymous door. 

My first impressions were that I'd been given the owner's suite - the floor space was vast, the furnishings were relatively tasteful and the bathroom was full of high quality fittings. However, first impressions can be deceptive.

A locked door in the bathroom appeared to provide access to some kind of plant or machinery room, which generated a humming noise all night. The main sewers of the entire building seemed to be located in the wall behind my headboard. The room itself was immediately above the main entrance to the hotel and thus the turning circle for all traffic coming to the main entrance.

The upshot was I had about three hours unbroken sleep all evening.

This is clearly not a regular room, which was confirmed by a late drink in the bar. I charged a beer to my room and the barman came back to my table to say in an accusatory way ""there isn't a Room 203"", presumably assuming I was trying to get a free drink. I simply showed him my registration card and he wandered off, never to return with an apology or an explanation.

I was hoping someone would ask me ""whether everything was alright with your stay"" when I left, but sadly they just stung my credit card for just over 200 euros and left me to it.

Maybe my experience was unusual, but it is shabby for a hotel to charge 200 euros for a room which doesn't actually exist and doesn't fulfil the basic requirement for a hotel, which is a comfortable place to sleep.",1,2013,06,15
46,First class hotel,I stayed at this hotel early June 2013 and I must say it was really nice. It has amazing views over Barcelona. The pool area is lovely and the service is outstanding. The people at the reception are doing everything they can to make you feel comfortable. An absolute plus is the coffee they serve at breakfast.  It is from Nespresso which is absolutely fantastic and I would be happy to see other hotels follow this example. The Ramblas is only 15 minutes walk downhill. Overall great hotel!,4,2013,06,13
46,Amazing view,"Stayed here for 2 nights on business and have to say the hotel and the staff were spot on. The room was of a good size and very modern with a lovely walk in shower. The most amazing thing was the terrace for the room which was on the top floor and was circa 20m long. After my meetings had finished i would head up to the terrace log onto the free wifi and sit in the sun catching up on my emails, perfect. i found the walk in to the city centre quite pleasant in the morning but i usually caught a taxi back as the hill is fairly steep. The staff were very personable and nothing was too much trouble. i would happily reccomend the Miramar to any traveller heading to Barcelona.",5,2013,06,10
46,"Great Hotel, Hidden Fees","Stayed at the beautiful Miramar Hotel in Barcelona for 5 nights. Our stay was wonderful, the staff was very accommodating and went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable. The room was very well appointed and had plenty of space. The bed was comfy. Balcony although we did not have a view of the city, was fantastic except your privacy is somewhat diminished as your right above the entrance to the hotel and anyone can look up and see you or anyone walking along the raised bridge will have a birds-eye view into your room if you don't pull the blinds. HOWEVER, we found out on our ride to the airport that since the hotel called the cab for us, we were charged an additional 15 Euros on top of the cab fare which turned a 29 Euro cab ride into a 44 Euro ride! Not cool Miramar. The bad thing is your at the top of a mountain and will have a hell of a time getting your luggage down the steep hill to Paral-lel where you can hail a cab minus the steep surcharge.",4,2013,06,09
46,2 day break,"Could not fault this hotel
Staff friendly and very helpful from sunrise to sunset, then another great team took over.
Restaurant excellent for breakfast and dinner, breakfast outside when the weather had improved, dinner inside where we were spoilt.
To put us in the mood for food, drinks delivered by a great team who worked hard to make it enjoyable.
Did not need to leave the hotel other than enjoy a walk in the area. 
Enjoy the view of an amazing city
Pool and bar wonderful, great service!",5,2013,06,09
46,Fantastic hotel !,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband. It was really very good. The room was beautiful with a fantastic city view from the terrace. We walked into town each day, it takes about 15 mins to get to MareMagnum. The nearest tube (Paral.lel)is 10 mins away. You can walk back too, although the hill is steep but its fine if you are relatively fit. Its safe at night to do this too. Ask at Reception and they will tell you. We didn't eat at the hotel, choosing to go into town where inevitably it's going to be cheaper, and of course there is more choice. There is a shooting range to the rear of the hotel which is noisy, so if possible get a city view room or port view. There was an event on at the hotel (wedding/birthday) but the rooms are very well insulated and it didn't affect us at all. I would definitely stay here again - finances permitting!",5,2013,06,07
46,Excellent location and excellent staff,"We stayed here for two nights and it was amazing. On arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and then taken to our deluxe room, the room was huge, we had a lovely view of the port and gardens. The room had a free standing egg shaped bath and a superb shower (I agree with another review that bubble bath would be good!).

We took an open top bus tour (I would recommend this and Nicolas on reception helped book this and told us where the stop was - very close by!). We saw a number of other hotels we had considered. Whilst more central, none of them had the beautiful and relaxed location of the Miramar.

The hotel was very quiet which was nice. The food was good and the drinks even better (Jonathan behind the bar was very friendly). It was priced about right considering it is a 5* hotel.  Breakfast on the terrace was lovely. The pool area is gorgeous although it would have been nice to have a drink there (it was closed about 4pm probably because it was quiet?).

We wanted to eat out and Simone on reception helped us book a table and ordered us a taxi (even going out to tell the taxi driver where the restaurant was; now that is good service). Reception also booked our cab to the airport. All very easy and thus making our stay very relaxed.

All in all a great hotel, great location and excellent helpful and friendly staff.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,31
46,Nice place to visit,"Miramar Hotel is perfectly situated. Silent, green area, not far from the city centre. Fisrt impression was very nice. The same is with rooms. Nice view, cozy and very comfortable, interesting playlist on CD-player. We had perfect weekends in Barcelona.
The only thing, we didn`t like, is level of cuisine. Very poor Caprese salad. Almost all salad was tomatos but rather few of Mozarella. Cuisine in hotel of such level should be more interesting.",5,2013,05,29
46,Inconvenient location a serious drawback,"If you are attending a wedding or meeting at the hotel or you like to always take taxis then this might be the place for you.  If you are a traveller who likes exploring a new city by foot, wandering its interesting small streets and finding fantastic eateries then this is not the place for you.  Its location up Montjuic is a twenty minute walk to the closest Metro stop.  We walked down each morning but ended up getting a taxi home every evening.  For a city with a fantastic subway system, this is an inconvenient hotel.  Why did I book it then?  It was a blind hotwire booking.  I chose a 5 star in a prime portion of the map but this hotel resides in the farthest corner of that circle.  Lesson learned, don't use Hotwire unless you know a city really well.

Also, this is not a 5 star hotel.  The hotel looks great with modern design but look closer and the fit and finish is not there. It has some 5 star views but the rooms are 4 star at best.  Probably the most important thing for me in luxury hotels is the bed and these were not very comfortable, we could actually feel the springs.  The shower has no shelves or places to put your shampoos or soaps.  Housekeeping was uneven, some days they would forget to replenish face towels or other items.  Some things were nice like the large modern soaker tub, the fast free wifi and the friendly helpful staff.",3,2013,05,28
46,Best hotel ever!,"You know the swank hotels you see in the magazines and don't think you can afford? This looks like them, but you can afford it!

The location and views are beautiful and the service is top-notch. It's a bit from the city center, but the quality of this hotel makes paying for a cab to get in and out of the center worthwhile. I'd come back to Barcelona just to stay here!",5,2013,05,25
46,"View, service and convenience!","Picked this place due to its apparently good reviews, location to La Rambla and the tourist district, and 'quiet' location.  We were not disappointed!  The rooms were very eclectic and quite different from the usual hotel room.  We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a city view (occupancy was obviously very low the week we were there) and the views are stunning.

Service was very good and friendly, and typically prompt.  We liked that, though this location appears out of walking reach of the tourist areas, there is a nice shortcut path that leads straight downhill to the tourist areas (it's a respectable uphill climb to get back though).

The place is a bit pricey, but not atypical of a 5-star location.",5,2013,05,16
46,"Lovely Hotel, needs a few improvements","The hotel commands stunning views across the port and city with access to the Miramar gardens. These are beautiful for a post dinner stroll and a path leads through them down to the port. The rooms wee large, clean and well equipped. We had a large sun terrace near the pool area. This area was an oasis of calm and lovely to relax after sightseeing. The reception staff were friendly and helpful in suggesting restaurants and the quickest route for me to take to the Formula one. The location, whilst being the major benefit is also a drawback. We would walk into town (down steep paths) and this would take able bodied people 20 minutes, however due to the climb back we opted for taxi's. As soon as they knew the location all sorts of surcharges appeared and the price ranged from 5 euros to 17 euros for the same trip. I would recommend calling reception out if there is a problem as the cab drivers spoilt the whole experience with their thieving.

With regards to improvements at the hotel, there was no evening entertainment, or music in the bar areas and drinks were very expensive, as such our children were bored and we chose to go out every night. The buffet breakfast was included in our package and was of a good quality and fresh, however even tea and coffee was self service which let down the 5 star expectations. The service in the lobby bar was poor, to the extent that we refused to pay one day as we waited 40 minutes for a tea and a beer. The pool bar, snacks and service were excellent as was the spa, although all were slightly overpriced leading to most guests eating at the cable car snack bar at lunch (a 2 minute walk away)",4,2013,05,16
46,Perfect Location in an amazing city,"Having not been to Barcelona before and having read loads of reviews on the city and various hotels I was not sure what to expect.
After reading lots of reviews we decided to book with the Miramar and I cannot tell you how right this decision was.  The hotel is absolutely lovely, very modern, clean and fresh inside, the rooms are very modern and upmarket and a good size, we had our own balcony with fantastic views.  The staff are very friendly and the food in the restaurant absolutely fantastic, we spent two evenings in the hotel restaurant where the manager Jaume not only took pride in his work but also made sure we had a good time and were happy with every aspect of the meal.  The atmosphere in the hotel and restaurant is very clam and relaxing, exactly what we were looking for I a busy city.  
However the best thing about the hotel had to be its location.  Sat on the side of a hill to the western side of the city centre this hotel is surrounded by stunning gardens, has its own outdoor pool and garden area.  You have fantastic views across the city from this hotel which in my view is unrelieved anywhere else in Barcelona.  Getting into the city centre could not be easier; it’s only a 10-15min walk, ok to one side of the hotel the walk down is a little steep in places but to the other there is a nice gentle walk down (or back up) through lovely gardens, this took about 5 more minutes, once down you are right into the hustle a bustle of the city centre.  
After a day spent in this fantastic and frenetic city it is so nice to retreat back to the tranquillity that is the Miramar hotel with their superb manicured grounds relaxing in the warm evening sun with a glass of wine.  This really is the ideal combination and I would highly recommend it.           
",5,2013,05,11
46,"Helpful and efficient staff, peaceful location, great views","The hotel is close enough to all the tourist attractions but the location means you can relax when you want to get away from it all. The bus service just outside of the hotel was great and took us to the hotel Espania quickly from there the metro takes you anywhere. The staff were just lovely, efficient and professional, always quick to help. Of course the hotel was not fully booked so I couldn't say how they would cope with full occupancy. The room we had was very comfortable and very clean, there were a couple maintenance issues that needed sorting but they didn't really affect our stay. I was disappointed that there was no DVD player for the room, again minor detail. Breakfast was fresh, relaxed and plentiful. I would happily stay again.",5,2013,05,07
46,Great option to downtown hotels,"I spent three nights at Miramar Barcelona in April.  The hotel is beautiful - contemporary and elegant in an understated way.  The rooms are well equipped and comfortable.  Ours had a balcony overlooking the ocean, which is not as glamorous as it sounds as this area is where cargo and cruise lines dock, but a nice view nonetheless.  The staff were wonderful and very helpful in making suggestions of restaurants (Cal Pep and Bar Toro were two excellent recommendations) and where to go.  I thought one of the advantages of the hotel was that it is slightly out of the way - certainly within a good walk to the shopping areas - but not in the thick of things.  Barcelona was crowded and noisy and it was nice to escape from the action each night.  The surrounding property is gorgeous and lovely to walk around.",5,2013,05,03
46,An excellent hotel,"I and my husband visited Hotel Miramar Barcelona four days in April 2013. We liked the hotel very much. It is situated on Montjuïc with a fantastic view over Barcelona and with marvellous parks and museums nearby. We had to use a taxi when we wanted to go down-town, but it was just a short drive. The staff was friendly, the room nice and the terrace was marvellous with its view over Barcelona and the Mediterranean Sea. The breakfast was very tasty, but could have been even better with more fruits and berries. We absolutely want to stay in this nice hotel again!",5,2013,04,28
46,"Great views, great hotel.","I went for a long weekend in the one of the Premium rooms looking over the gardens.
The rooms are very clean and modern looking with an open bathroom and terrace. If you look at the website the picture is spot on! (looks just like the room I was in, minus the flower petals lol). The toilet and shower has frosted glass but you can also pull a cutain (still quiet see through) around the bathroom area for a bit more privacy. The bath is a stange shape (egg) but really nice, would have loved some bubble bath thou. I didnt get to use the spar or gym but took a look on my first day, they look very clean and the staff in here are extreemly helpful and gave me a tour. I also didnt have breakfast but enjoyed a burger from the dinner time menu one afternoon, quiet £ but a great burger. The staff in reception are really helpfull.
Overall a great stay, shame I only had a long weekend and didnt have enough time to really enjoy the facilitys.",4,2013,04,19
46,Relaxing experience,"Just returned from 3 nights in Barcelona at the Miramar......cannot wait to return. Extremely helpful staff, fantastic location and the views are the best in Barcelona. Lovely rooms and all the facilities you expect from a 5 star hotel.",5,2013,04,16
46,Great living at a steep cost,"I went to Hotel Miramar during the Mobile World Congress 2013 and spent 4 days in the second week of February.
The staff members are courteous and polite. Although they have a strong Spanish accent, its understandable. The morning buffet breakfast was good but repetitive. I didnt see much variations in the 4 days breakfast. You should specially try the strawberry punch, which in my opinion was one of the best I have had till now.
What makes this hotel so awesome is the view that you get from the top of the hill across the Mediterranean sea. I wish they had a better bar considering the price they charge for the stay. I saw El Clasico on saturday night at the bar but was disappointed to realize that there was no projector and a large TV instead.
The cleaning lady didn't seem to speak a word of English and that was a bit of problem because she wouldn't understand what I was trying to say. 
Not to forget how these people hike the price during an international event, which is beyond my understanding. And its not a marginal increase but 250% increase in the room tariff. 
All in all, I had a great time in this hotel, specially because of the view and clean rooms !",4,2013,04,13
46,great hotel,"I stayed here for a week with my friend at the end of August 2012. 

The view is absolutely breathtaking and the rooms were very spacious. The breakfast was delicious and so was the room service.

I spent a lot of time at the pool just relaxing and taking in the sun. The hotel staff was very helpful and gave us good tips on where to eat as night. 

One does need to take a taxi into town which really adds up. But the location and view was worth it.

Overall, a great experience and a lovely hotel!",4,2013,04,09
46,Wonderful Weekend Stay,"Just back from a very enjoyable weekend stay at the hotel.

We booked the hotel via a voucher website and decided to upgrade to a Superior room.

The room was very spacious with a variety of mod cons (iPhone docking station was a nice touch) and the bathroom featured both a large bath and shower area with high quality marble style finishings.

Our room offered excellent panoramic views over the bustling city and I believe rooms to the front of the hotel offer stunning sea views.

We used the Spa facilities including indoor pool, steam room, jacuzzi and sauna and all good on that front.

Breakfast had everything you need such as cereal, meats, fruit, eggs, bacon and we certainly had no complaints.

We decided to get a taxi to the hotel from the airport and this cost €25. Check-in was painless and we were given a map with key points circled including the location of the hotel.

As many reviewers have stated the hotel is located at the top of a rather steep hill overlooking the city and perhaps the location of the hotel is the only reason I can think people would choose an alternative option.

For us it was actually perfect as we would walk into the city centre which would take about 15 to 20 minutes do a bus tour or have an evening out and then get a taxi back which would cost around €10. Because the hotel is removed from the city centre I would say the difference in tranquillity between this hotel and one that is slap bang in the city centre is tangible.

For a weekend the above is fine but I could see how someone might tire of having a twenty minute walk or a taxi each day if you were staying for a week or two 

If however you are looking for a hotel that can offer both luxurious relaxation while offering access to a captivating city and you don't mind walking or can afford the additional taxis then you can't really go wrong with the Miramar.

Finally, for the geeks and Facebook addicts the code free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel was also very welcome.",5,2013,04,08
46,Fantastic location - which gives this hotel the fourth star as it had some issues,"There's no denying the fantastic location, beautiful views and proximity to the centre of Barcelona due to the cable car and public transport.

All the staff were incredibly helpful and the breakfast (though rather pricy) gorgeous. We ate in the restaurant on our first evening and apart from having to wait a rather long time for our main course, it was worth is as everything we were served was delicious. (The head waiter apologised profusely for the delay and offered us a drink on the house as compensation.) We also tried out room service which again was superb (and actually reasonably priced). The free wi-fi worked without any problems.

The room was very boutique as described on the hotel's website, however: The doors to the shower didn't meet properly, hence one stepped into a pool of water after each shower. Obviously a design fault. The flatscreen TV was quite small - I had expected something bigger for a room this size. It almost felt like an afterthought.

What was really frustrating was the noise from other guests and the bar. The layout of the different floors means that most rooms are facing a 'common area' which is the centre of the hotel. Consequently, as sound travels upwards, we could hear people talking on our own floor and below us. Friday and Saturday evening we couldn't choose to listen to the pianist as the music was audible in our room behind our closed door. The room doors also slammed from early morning and into the late evening. So noise was an issue. 

For the price of our stay, we did expect something more exceptional and unfortunately, we didn't feel that the hotel lived up to that.",4,2013,04,08
46,Great Hotel,"We spent 9 days at this hotel from 25th March till the 3rd April, we chose the Hotel Miramar because of all the great reviews on Trip Advisor. We had upgraded to a suite before our stay and upon our arrival, the reception staff were helpful and our room was ready straightaway. I would say after staying in Barcelona for that length of time that this hotel has got one of the best views, we certainly picked the right hotel for us.  Our suite was very spacious, queen bed and large bathroom. The only problem we had was that the canopy kept coming out onto the balcony shading the sun, to cut a long story short we changed rooms to another suite, which was not as big as the first but had better views. We used the gym and spa facilities, I had one of the best massages (called Journey to the nile) i've ever had.  Overall the hotel ticked all our boxes, very helpful front desk staff, bar staff good fun and the waitresses at breakfast, brilliant! and we could relax and chill out using the hotel facilities and then head off downtown when it suited us. The only gripe we had was the rather unhelpful restaurant manager, we liked to go and get our breakfast, take it up to the room then go have a gym workout and eat our breakfast later, he didn't like this and certainly told us so. We did speak to the general manager who was very helpful and kind, all in all if you are looking for a relaxing break in a busy city, we would definately recommend this hotel.  Tip: A great locals tapas bar called Canete, just off the La Ramblas in Union Street is a must!",4,2013,04,08
46,"Beautiful hotel, rooms with an amazing view, helpful staff, good food!","This was my first time in Hotel Miramar so I did not know what to expect. I was very surprised with the warm welcoming at the reception. The staff explained me what to do where to go in barcelona and gave me many good adresses. The room was beatiful with a breathtaking seaview. I had really good dishes and amazing wine in their restaurant Forestier. I'd say that was one of my best vacations, I could enjoy the calm relaxing atmosphere of the hotel and the fun of Barcelona at the same time",5,2013,04,07
46,Easter 2013,"An outstanding hotel in a stunning location. Satff were brilliant and the rooms clean and beautifully turned out. One slight problem - though the weather was anything but red hot - the ouitdoor pool was closed for renovation work. Let's hope we can enjoy it on our next stay.
The Forestiere restaurant where we ate on the final night was stunning. I can highly recommend the sample menu - and reckon the six course menu is probably even better if that's possible!! Thoroughly enjoyable and would recommend this hotel to anyone who fancies an upmarket stay in this fantastic city.

46,Shocking - not recommended,"When we arrived at this disgusting looking building which looked like a car park, there were no staff members at the desk or front door so we had to wait 15 minutes until served. As soon as we checked in, we were told to make our own way up to an absolutely horrible suite with no facilities. The pool and spa were both shut during our visit which was not meant to be the case, resulting in a very unhappy family. The food was horrendous, as well as the unhelpful staff. The worst part of this horrendous hotel was the outrageous cleaners who didn't replenish any of our bedroom amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, bubble baths towels, and drinks which caused mayhem. 

This hotel is a joke, next time we're staying in the 'W' which is far better.

Not recommended under any circumstance whatsoever. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.",1,2013,04,03
46,Outstanding in every way,"My husband took me to hotel miramar for a birthday treat -and what a treat! I have one day of my trip left and I simply could not wait to post a review. The setting is delightful - extremely peaceful, overlooking a quiet park; 20mins walk to centre or 2 mins to cablecar to barceloneta. Room unbelievable -modern, kingsize bed, enormous bathroom and I have never met such charming, helpful, friendly and welcoming staff - a special mention to Marc on reception for answering our endless questions with such grace, and to Mohha who welcomed us in the bar each evening with such friendliness and professionalism - I cannot thank you all enough for what has been my best ever hotel experience (and I have travelled a lot!)",5,2013,03,27
46,Haven with a view,"Spent three nights here and used as a base for exploring the city on foot.
The room, food and personal service from the helpful staff were all beyond expectation, as were the views from the terrace and our room.Only spoiler was the officious and rather silly maitre d' who made us feel less than welcome at dinner on the first night. He wanted us to know how busy he was and how lucky we were that he found us a table (all nonsense of course).
Although he let his colleagues down, I did not think it fair to mark the hotel down. There are of course plenty of excellent restaurants in Barcelona if you don't wish to be treated thus.",5,2013,03,18
46,Almost perfect,"Great hotel, amazing sea view !
Not the room I expected but nice even though, the TV is too small for a room of this size.

Staff really nice and helpful but the English level is not adequate with the standing of a 5 stars hotels.

I had had booked my room online and took the breakfasts with it. I had my breakfast delivered in the room and had the unpleasant surprise of being charged for a full room service breakfast regardless of the buffet breakfast I had paid before.

Otherwise, very peaceful place, piano player at the bar during the week end, spa with indoor pool, jacuzzi, hammam and sauna.

Miramar staff : please offer a delivered breakfast in your online choice, and don't make your customers pay for a full room service breakfast full price when they have already paid for a breakfast...even it's a buffet breakfast...",4,2013,03,17
46,A fairytale birthday experience! Wonderful hotel!!,"My boyfriend took me away to Barcelona for my birthday in March 2013 where we stayed at the Hotel Miramar. After reading the reviews beforehand and making the decision to stay here I was not disappointed.  We stayed in 2 different rooms as we had 2 different bookings. The first rooom was a superior room and was what only can be described as amazing. I have high standard of hotel rooms and have stayed in some really good 5* star hotels around the world and this room was up there with the best. The room was very spacious and had an amazing view from the balcony looking down at the scene of the city and habour, and in the distance the cable car down to the beach and sea. The bathroom was huge, and the standing bath in the middle of the room which could fit two people in it was that big was the feature. The toliet and shower all where in the same area but with there own cubicles, and there was a ""his"" and ""hers"" sinks. The bed was massive and the comfy. Tv, coffee making facilties, cd player which was left playing classical music upon arrival of the room, and i pod docking stacking were excellent features to the room. My boyfriend especailly loved the dressing gown/ robes and slippers provided in the room. 

The second room was not facing the sea, however even though it was a cheaper room the view to the side of the hotel of the city was great. Although smaller in size, the bathroom layout was differrent but equally as nice. In this room there was not coffee making facilities and the i- pod docking station didn't work. With both rooms the air conditioning was very cold.

The breaksfast was good, I especailly liked the champange provided at breakfast which was included. My boyfriend and I ate our breakfast and then took a glass of champagne out on the terrace to enjoy the sun while our breakfast digested. The food at bar and room service was expensive and not what you would you expect from a 5 star hotel- not inspiring. The desserts were nice and elborate thouhgh. The hotel restruant was shut on a Monday - which happened to be the night we were going to eat there on my birthday. The recpetion staff were good in helping us to find alternatives plans for the night. The reception staff could not have been faulted, helpful and lovely friendly people. They would call you a taxi and even open the doors for you to get in! 

On my birthday my boyfriend ordered room service in the morning as a surprise and got me a amazing bunch of flowers, chocoloate brownie with a candle and 2 glasses of champange, which the reception staff helped to organise.

The spas was lovely, swimming pool was nice but dispointed to have mixed spa/sauna/steam room as my boyfirend and I wanted to do this together. We also ordered a double massage for my birthday and only 1 hour before the massage we were informed we could  not have it done together as they couldn't get the staff to do both that day. I was disapointed as it was my birthday treat! 

Easy walking distance to Las Ramblas 20 minutes, metro, hop on hop off tour bus and cable car. We used taxis quite a bit and they were expensive. 

All in all a wonderful stay and lovely hotel. I definelty recommend it and would go back.",5,2013,03,16
46,A different side of Barcelona,"We had a long weekend last month (February). great property, obliging staff, fabulous breakfast, very comfortable rooms in a quiet rural like location, not like my other favourite in Barcelona The Arts. My only criticism is the limited food service in the hotel and around it. I know its a short taxi ride or fair walk to the city but lack of a non-formal non-fine dining option was a challenge particularly for the kids.",4,2013,03,15
46,a real 5 stars hotel in barcelona,"We spent a week end in this hotel and we were lucky enough to get a room with balcony. The location of the hotel on the monjuich hill allows to have a marvellous landscape of the city with all monuments. The staff is really welcoming with a real will to help. The indoor swimminh pool is really nice as well as the spa. No problem for parking. 
I recomend this hotel for people willing to discover Barcelona and take a rest in a quiet place far from the noisy city.",5,2013,03,15
46,Quality and comfort,"The Hotel y very nice, clean, breakfast is very good. It is at a very good location to go to concerts at the Palau Sant Jordi o the Olimpic Stadium. And well communicated with the city centre with the cableway just near the Hotel.",4,2013,03,15
46,Romantic break for 2,"My partner and I visited Barcelona together for the first time and chose Hotel Miramar. 

It was slightly more pricey than other hotels, but it was worth every penny. The staff opened your doors of taxis/cars on arrival and were readily available upon your needs.

There was a large group booking that overrun their stay for whatever reason, so we received a free upgrade to a suit, which was amazing. The view was right accross the harbour and port of Barcelona.

The location was fantastic - only 5 minutes can ride from Las Ramblas & a 15 minute trip to Gaudis district.

Breakfast was very expensive for what it was & the evening menu wasn't very vast, would recommend eating out.

Will definitely return",5,2013,03,11
46,Absolutely beautiful hotel in a great location,Located at the top of a steep hill (good exercise to get there each day) the place was just immaculate. Beautiful views and secluded enough to be peaceful but close enough to the city centre to be convenient. Fantastic hotel in one of the best cities in the world.,5,2013,03,10
46,Great hotel for weekend break,"My friend and I stayed at Hotel Miramar in Jan 13 and it was really lovely. Great hotel, excellent staff who were ever so helpful. Definitely felt like a 5* hotel. We didn't eat there so can't comment on the restaurant and food. Overall a great stay.",4,2013,03,10
46,"Excellent, best hotel in the city!","Excellent stay at Miramar over Valentine's day.  Everyone on the staff was really friendly and helpful.  We stayed at two five star hotels during our 7-day visit to Barcelona and this was far better than the first.  The views are incredible and the location is great!  

It is a bit further away from the main tourist attractions, but there are plenty of cabs, buses, etc. that stop just in front of the hotel. To save money on cab rides, catch a cab on the street just in front of the hotel to avoid the pick-up charge.

We didn't get to ride the cable car in front of the hotel, due to limited winter hours, but is a great way to get to the beach and access lots of restaurants.  Loved walking around Montjuic hill in the mornings and evenings.  Very easy access to Olympic museum, Milo museum, and Barcelona National Art Museum.  

The rooms are very spacious and come with amazing views of the city.  If you are an iPrefer member they will give you a welcome drink and upgrade your room if available.  The staff were very gracious and friendly.  Would really recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a beautifully modern hotel, with luxurious amenities, and great staff.",5,2013,02,28
46,Disappointing,"My wife and I stayed at the Miramar in July 2012 for 7 nights.
 
On arrival we were told at check in that our room would not be ready for another 4 hours.  So we spent time looking about and having some food etc.  After 4 hours we returned to reception to get our key, but we were told it still was not ready.  They asked us to take a seat in reception for a few moments until it was ready.  We sat in reception for 30 minutes (no member of staff spoke to us during this further wait) watching other guests arrive and getting their key straight away.  After 30 minutes my patients had ended and I went to reception to see why the room was still not ready.  When I asked what the holdup was, the member of staff seemed surprised as the room was ready 20 minutes ago!  It’s just no one bothered to let us know.
 
In terms of the gun range, we knew about it through reading comments on Tripadvisor.  It does become a bit of a problem, as it is a constant noise from first thing to last thing in the day.
 
On one of the nights we had a few drinks in the hotel after returning from dinner in the city.  As usual the bar was very quiet and we were the last guests to leave (although it wasn’t very late). The next morning I remembered I had left a good pair of sunglasses on the seat I was sitting on the previous night in the bar.  I went down to the reception and bar to see if the member of staff who was clearing our table when we left had found the glasses. But they said the sunglasses had not been found.  I also asked the member of staff who cleared our table, but he said he didn’t see them.  Now I know I can’t say for sure, but I am 99% sure the member of staff would have seen them, and he must have kept them.
 
On the Friday night of our stay we decided to get a early enough night (about midnight) so that we could get up early to go on a tour.  Unfortunately for us there was a wedding on that night in the hotel.  Even thought we were at the other end of the hotel on the second floor, the noise was so loud from the party and guests who were partying away around the outside pool.  At 2am we rang reception to complain and ask when the party would finish the reception said in maybe an hour or so.  We told him that was not good enough and what can they do.  Their solution was to move US to another room in the hotel at 2am for the night. Unbelievable.  The party and noise ended about 3:30am.  Weddings on a Friday night seem to be a regular theme.  My wife and I are only 32 and enjoy a party as much as the next person, but when you stay in a ""5-star"" hotel you do not expect to have that level of noise forced on you.
 
There also seemed to be a problem with staff cleaning away trays and plates etc from guest’s room service.  On a number of occasions we noticed trays/plates/bottles from room service sitting in the corridors from breakfast to last thing at night.
 
Another complaint we had was in relation to the Spa.  It is very poor. If a Spa is an important part of your wish list for a hotel, Miramar is not for you.  The changing rooms were dirty (staff do not look near them throughout the day) and there was unfinished building work. There are Spa pools which we did not use as you cannot use them together. There is one in the male changing rooms and one in the female changing rooms.  They must think it’s still the 1970's.  They have a list of treatments you can have, that is if you find a member of Spa staff, we never saw one.
 
We were having a bite to eat at the pool one day, when I opened the condiment jar I found out someone had been there before me, which I pointed out to the staff member.  This on its own is a simple enough mistake, but it wasn’t the last time it happened!  It became a running joke between us.  In the end it happened about 5 times when we ate in the hotel areas. Not very hygienic or 5 star.
 
Lastly, if you want to spend the day by the pool - get there early!  There is a shortage of seats/loungers.  Most days people arriving late had to sit on their towels on the grass areas.
 
Believe it or not I don’t often complain, and if it had been only one or two things I could look past it.  But there were so many problems/issues that you should not have to accept when you stay in a 5 star hotel I just had to comment here on it.
 
The hotel location is good (apart from being beside a busy shooting range) but the overall experience was poor. As a result I would stay somewhere else on my next visit to the wonderful city of Barcelona.",3,2013,02,25
46,"Nice hotel, one or two improvements","Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. Overall the hotel is very nice and very stylish. The rooms are very spacious and well-designed, and the bathroom in particular was lovely. We had a standard room but even so, it felt special and lived up to its 5* billing. We found the location to be OK - the views etc, as others have said, are fantastic, and it is nice to escape the bustle of the city. However, when we enquired in advance as to the best way to travel from the airport, we were given the directions for public transport without any indication that the hotel is situated at the top of a very steep incline, and that although the underground stop is '10 minutes away' this involves a walk up a very steep road, which proved very difficult and uncomfortable with our bags. We got taxis back for the rest of the trip! Another small complaint is that our deal supposedly included a free welcome drink, but we were never offered this. Also, we were looking forward to enjoying the spa together, but this was also a bit of a disappointment as all the spa facilities are single sex - although I understand why this would be the case and some people would prefer it - not very romantic for couples though! The room does not include any facilities for making tea and coffee - and I for one missed this. We have stayed in other 5* hotels where there have been coffee makers in the room, and this would have been a nice touch in keeping with the general high standards. Overall, we really liked the hotel and would definitely recommend/return, but there are just a few small extras that we have come to expect from 5* hotels which the Miramar fell short of. I would imagine that the hotel comes into its own in the summer, when the outdoor pool is open.",4,2013,02,18
46,Lovely views and quiet location,"We booked this hotel through Secret Escapes so got a bit of a bargain. We had a superior room with double aspect which looked out over the port and city and it had a huge balcony. Bathroom was big and great shower and bath. Staff were very welcoming and attentive and helpful with directions.Close to the park and funicular railway (closed when we were there) It is situated up the hill which gives the benefit of great views and peace and quiet and is only about 10 mins walk downhilll to Las Ramblas and the tourist bus stops just over the road. For the way home we normally used taxi which varied between 5 - 8 Euros depending on the time of night and where we were. 
Breakfast buffet gave a good choice and you could have eggs, bacon etc on request if there was no hot buffet. Dinner menu was pricey but the snacks in the bar were a bit less. Champagne by the glass and wine was reasonable. The spa area was very nice and always quiet when we were there Jan/Feb 2013. I would definitely go back. Reception staff and bar were particularly helpful. Some of the restaurant staff could have been a bit more attentive..",4,2013,02,16
46,Great value for money; an amazing property,"Last weekend I stayed in Hotel Miramar Barcelona for three nights. First we were a bit worried about the location - as we read the hotel is located on top of the Montjuic Hill - but as it turned out this proves to be a major strength of this hotel; AMAZING views! Imagine waking up and the first thing you see after opening your eyes is a breath taking panorama view over the city of Barcelona (we stayed in Premium Room 412). Also the hotel was a great place to rest after a long day of sightseeing. The atmosphere in the hotel could best be described as soothing, peace and quiet, yet 'at home'.
Also, we were pleasantly surprised as the walk from the hotel to La Rambla took only 15 minutes when crossing the Raval neighborhood. It is true that walking back up requires a bit more energy, but we usually just took a taxi for our journey back (which was always around €5 to €7 euros; really cheap!).
A few more notes: truly great - very extensive - breakfast buffet, the spa was very relaxing (we were always the only ones there, even though the hotel was fully booked), and very friendly staff. Housekeeping brought us fresh towels and chocolates every night and Front Office staff was very professional and helpful (a special notice for receptionists Manuel and Marc - thank you for all your help!).
Maybe the most important thing: all of this for a reasonable rate! There are equally fancy hotels out there in Barcelona that charge double or triple the amount for a night's stay. In Miramar we found that we got real value for our money. We are looking forward to returning to this hotel in summer, and to experience the attractive-looking outdoor swimming pool area. Recommended to couples, business travelers, families, actually anyone who is looking for some efficient relaxation during their stay in BCN.",5,2013,02,16
46,One of the best in Barcelona,"We had a lovely premium room at this hotel and arguably the best view of Barcelona including the city, port and sea. The room was very spacious, huge bathroom and comfortable bed. Breakfast was very pleasant, a nice way to start the tours! We spent 3 nights here and always had a drink at the bar before bed, which was relaxing with a piano player. Would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Barca if you enjoy views. There is a 10 minute walk to La Rambla, and that worked for us.",4,2013,02,16
46,"Great location & view, otherwise average","Location is great, on the mountain near the Olympic stadium with view across whole cityView from the rooms is spectacular, especially the sunrise over the harbour. Comfortable bed, nice terrace and modern room with iPod dock. Bathroom is very trendy but not very functional: bath tub for instance has nowhere to put shampoo/soap. Moreover the water drainage from shower through floor slots doesn't function and water leaks into bedroom (a colleague had same problem); made worse by the over-complicated taps in shower - I was unable to turn it off and had to call front desk.
Food in the restaurants was pretty poor for Barcelona, where there are much better places to eat in the city",3,2013,02,10
46,excellent stay,"we were staying at the Hotel Miramar for a romantic weekend getaway and it was all we had hoped it to be.
We arrived only at 11pm because of a delayed flight and was still served at the bar with cocktails and all the extras. The reception even made an exception after our drinks to open the pool complex for us so we could use the whirlpool.
The spa facilities are very good.
We had breakfast on Sunday morning and although a bit pricey it was worth the treat.
The hotel's location is excellent if you are fit to walk - 10 minutes uphill to the Olympic park and no more that 15 minutes to the Plaza Espanya. 
The view from the hotel is great and the location feel quiet, secluded and remote - despite so conveniently located to the city.
Great not to have a hustle and bustle of the city so close to you for a break.
I forgot my hair dryer in the hotel and no effort was spared to get it back to me to the United Kingdom which reflect the high standard of service and attention to detail.
I would return without doubt.",5,2013,01,24
46,Beautiful location,"Stayed here in Oct '12. On arrival we were upgraded free of charge to top floor room which was roomy and beautifully decorated but best of all was the view - floor to ceiling window along the length of the room which overlooked Barcelona and the port (saw cruise ships come and go) and marina, truly stunning! also the balcony was massive and included sofas, table and lounger chairs with comfy cushions. Staff were excellent and very helpful. Only tried their breakfast once (as it was expensive), was buffet style with plenty of choice.  About a 10 min walk down steps through gardens to the town and marina, we caught taxi's or used bus to return (bus stops right by hotel). Was such a lovely place to stay.",5,2013,01,23
46,Favorite!,"We stayed at the hotel Miramar on the 3rd leg of our eurotrip in October 2012.  We stayed in a premium room, that overlooked the entire city and the marina! it was so gorgeous.  The balcony was huge.   We loved everything about the room.  They were playing opera music on a cd when we got into the room.  Started off the vibe right.   

Only negative was that they have like, one worker in the spa the entire time.  My fiance couldn't book a massage, b/c the  only appts they had were mid day, and who wants to be in the hotel at that time? you want to be out and about.   Other than that, we enjoyed our stay.  My favorite hotel room.",5,2013,01,23
46,Luxury,"This was everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel; huge room, superb amenities, friendly staff.  My room (Premier room) was in the original part and had a lovely balcony overlooking the harbour. I used the pools and jacuzzi which were immaculate.  

Food was expensive, but a glass of wine from the bar was very reasonable.  I loved the location which may not suit everyone as I didn't want to be in the bustle of town, but slightly out of it with a spacious garden feel and views.  I walked everywhere - or used the funicular occasionally and it was only 15 minutes to Via Diagonal and Las Ramblas.  It is on a hillside so required walking either up or down quite steeply, but the location of the hotel was worth it for me.

I was travelling on my own and enjoyed every minute.",5,2012,12,30
46,"Almost excellent, a few hickups","We arrived the hotel at lunch time and decided to enjoy the lunch in the hotel restaurant.The set menu was nice and well presented, but when we got the check, the price was much higher than listed in the menu. The waiter corrected it, but not with a smile.
We paid extra for a room with terrace when checking in at was given 324 which was a very nice room. On the second night we observed several small and black ants crawling around. The staff tried first to remove them, but after some time, we were moved to 501 without any apologies.
When booking the hotel we added for the breakfast, but this wasn't worth the extra charge.
Fantastic view, easy parking in closed garage, free parking outside.",4,2012,12,14
46,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"This is a wonderful hotel. The desk staff were always charming helpful and efficient.  The few minor problems we had were solved instantly.  All their recommendations of the easiest ways to get to the places we wanted to visit were accurate and clearly explained.  After I got mugged ( apparently an occupational hazard in Barcelona!) the staff could not have been more concerned,or kinder and very helpful in what to do next.
Our room was stunning with breathtaking views. The hotel is situated near the Olympic Park and the Miro museum. It is an easy walk, funicular ride or short taxi ride to the main city.",5,2012,11,24
46,Great views!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights during our 2 week European vacation. We absolutely fell in love with Barcelona and this hotel! We had a great room on the 6th floor with a huge balcony with comfortable seating. The room and bathroom were both spacious and clean. Extremely efficient and friendly staff who were accommodating to our travel times and schedule when it came time to checking in and out of the room. Since we were traveling in mid to late September, we did not get use of the pool but if the weather was nice enough we definitely would have spent time there. The location is slightly remote as the hotel sits on top of a mountain overlooking the port and the town of Barcelona. Even though the hotel was slightly in the distance, we were still able to walk to most things and take a taxi or the metro when needed.  Overall, great experience. Would definitely recommend it and would stay here again ourselves!",5,2012,11,14
46,Great Veiws,"I stayed for two nights, rooms were well appointed, a very large bathroom and a nice balcony with great veiws over the city.
Dinner and breakfast were both good.

The only downsides are that the hotel is a bit away from downtown but I guess thats the price of the great veiws and the Gym/pool that look a lot better in the photos than reality, both are pretty small.

But overall a nice place with helpfull and friendly staff.",4,2012,10,26
46,Nice but remote,"The Miramar is a nice hotel, very comfortable and spacious with fantastic views over Barcelona but very much on it's own. To get into town it's quite a walk or a short walk and a couple of stops on the tube.

It is ideal of you are looking for somewhere close to Palau Sant Jordie or the Olympic Stadium.

We enjoyed the hotel and didn't mind the walk",4,2012,10,23
46,"great hideaway, relaxing experience","This hotel is located on the top of a mountain with beautiful view of Barcelona ports. It is also on a stop of Barcelona city tour bus (abt. 100 meters away from the hotel lobby). It is about 15 min. drive to city center. The hotel itself is luxurious and modern, with calming decor and freshly scented smell. Compared to other European hotels, the guest room is spacious with its own balcony and recliners. Stand-alone tub in its bathroom is very modern. The hotel also has a garden and a restaurant overlooking the garden. There is a lovely sunroom wedding venue attached to one end of the hotel. Hotel staff are helpful with all of your enquiries. Overall, the stay is very relaxing. We will definitely come back again in our next visit.",5,2012,10,04
46,Great Location and Service,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Miramar for a week. I researched a lot of different Barcelona hotels before settling on this property. 

The front desk service was great. After checking in, we had a problem with our credit card allowing international charges which affected room payment. The front desk staff were very gracious and patient while we contacted the credit union back in the United States to fix the problem. The front desk staff also provided great tips for sightseeing and getting around Barcelona.

The hotel is set in a great mountainside location that provides breathtaking views of the city. The hotel grounds include a beautiful courtyard with nice greenery, flowers, fountains, statutes, and park benches for taking a break after strolling. The red sightseeing bus stops at the front of the hotel and there is also a taxi stand. The metro is a 5 minute walk down the mountain through a Barcelona community. 

The Mirarmar Cafe (not run by the hotel) and the city's trolley are on the other side of the courtyard. Food at the cafe was okay. The cafe has indoor and outdoor seating. Like Hotel Miramar, the cafe offers magnificent views of Barcelona. Two medium size cats freely roam the cafe waiting for patrons to drop a morsel. We even saw one cat jump into a chair and start eating remains of a meal left on the table after patrons departed. Service was quick and courteuous. 

The city's trolley that leaves from the courtyard of Hotel Miramar is not for those who have a fear of heights. The trolley ends at the beach. So, it's a quick and inexpensive (7 euros) way of getting to the beach. The entire trolley trip from hotel to beach took about 10 minutes. It can get crowded during mid-day and late afternoon when the queue is longer than the trip itself. 

Hotel Miramar's interior is upscale boutique. Their resaturant's breakfast buffet was pricey (50 euros) but good. We found ourselves eating elsewhere due to the restaurant's high prices. The lounge areas are very nice and the pool area is nice as well.

The rooms are nicely appointed. The balconies are large with nice furniture and a table for resting your drink. We found ourselves resting on the large balcony enjoying the Barcelona city view and sunset each evening, not really wanting to move. We stayed in a Premium Room which was nice. Premium Room Pros: decor, lovely shower with rainfall, refrigerator, iPhone and music centers. Premium Room Cons: very hard bed mattress, bathtub had awkward structure (seemed like it was installed with the wrong end at the faucet), since the bathroom is in the room light woke me up when husband used it in the middle of night, and the maids kept leaving just one washcloth when there were two of us in the room. My husband and I love each other but didn't want to share washcloths while on vacation. Each night, my husband had to contact housekeeping to obtain an extra washcloth. 

Overall, Hotel Miramar is a good choice when staying in Barcelona. We are travelling to Barcelona again in 2013 and will stay at this hotel.",4,2012,09,22
46,"Luxurious, beautiful ....expensive",Amazing hotel and very luxurious. When we arrived there were buildings renovations ongoing in front of hotel(its been a while since we stayed) We were given a room looking onto building so asked to get moved straight away. This was no problem and they moved us immediately to another room but to a twin room. We again asked to be moved to a double room as this was waht we paid for. We felt bad complaining but staff were so professional and friendly and more than happy to accomodate us and we got a beautiful room. The pool is so relaxing with comfortable loungers. The only negative thing I would say is not enough pool space and loungers for all guests. Pool bar and restaurant are way over priced. 16euro for a club sandwich. Spas and indoor pool are amazing also.,4,2012,09,20
46,"Make your stay here longer, it's just lovely!","This Hotel was perfect in every way. It is clean and fresh, spacious with calming, subtle decor. The reception staff are extremely pleasant and helpful inviting you to sit with a cool drink while checking in. The foyer is area is lovely & smells fresh. it has a nice bar and sitting area.

The room was nice & not too small, pleasant decor, spotlessly clean, light and airy with big windows and a good balcony. The beds are big and comfortable and the pillows are nice. The cupboard is big for all your hanging needs. The only thing lacking is a rack for all the suitcases, then the room would stay clutter free. The bed for our 11 year old child was a fold out which is always a disappointment, especially at a 5 star hotel. A mini bar fridge is available much to the kids delight!

The bathroom was a favorite of mine and I am a bit fussy with bathrooms. Spotlessly clean, it is a really good size with the toilet having it's own door within the bathroom. The shower is great, and a free standing big bath. The toiletries were very nice with all you need. Fluffy towels as well as robes and slippers were supplied and thankfully, face washers (which I discovered are not the standard throughout Europe).

The outdoor pool area is wonderful, the bar staff absolutely perfect, they really know how to pour a nice cold drink and they find you if you wander off to the beautiful shaded area outside the pool to give you your yummy order. The pool was clean and really nice with big fluffy towels given fresh to you while you're there. Plenty of comfy sun lounges are scattered around. The gym is convenient and an indoor pool is next to it. We never located the indoor spa pool shown in the pictures of the hotel .... where is it? 

Breakfast was really delicious with plenty to choose from, all fresh and lovely with nice chilled bottled water amongst other choices. The dining on the balcony is delightful.

The view from this hotel is spectacular,  You can see the big ships down in the port which is especially exciting for those waiting to take a cruise as we were.No way would I stay down right in the city after staying here. It is easy to jump on a bus (they run until 9pm) and go down the hill to see all the sights etc. If you're fit you can walk it. It was very hot during our stay (our excuse),  we caught a taxi back after dinner it was about 10 Euros. The hop on hop off tourist bus is right outside the hotel door as shown by the reception staff (thank you) and it's an awesome way to see Barcelona & highly recommended.

Check out the special packages before you book, that way you'll get breakfast included. I think the breakfast should be included with all the reservations and not ""an extra"". It's the only Hotel we stayed at in Europe that didn't automatically include breakfast in the price. Kids stay free though which encourages families and we met some lovely people at this hotel. We felt safe at all times. It would be a lovely place to have a function, such as a wedding.

We loved our stay here and would return in a heartbeat. Thank you for a lovely stay, we just wish we had longer!",5,2012,09,13
46,Amazing hotel in a beautiful location,"For our final three days in Barcleona as part of our holiday we had decided to stay in a hotel with a pool where we could relax and spend time by the pool and visit the Fundacio Joan Miro.
 We chose this one as we also found a very good deal.
 We ended up staying in  one of their luxury suites a 35sqm room with a beautiful bath own terrace a beautiful sofa..  about four of us could have stayed in a room this sizw.
 The bed was a wonderful kingsize.. enormous and very very comfortable.
 There was a great view from this hotel. 
 The cleaniliness was not great and we did not find all the toiletries we were promised , plus annoyingly the car we had booked with the deal never materliased until two hours before our departure which meant we could not use it.
 However the location is stunning. The pool which was generally quite clean except on the day they had a trainee staff member covering the pool.
 I really enjoyed being there for the comfort of the room, the beautiful location and the pool.
 However the breakfast is not the best nor is the food the greatest I have had .
 However the location of where we could have breakfast on a terrace overlooking Barcelona on this mountain top hotel was stunning.
It is very romantic and comfortable",4,2012,09,11
46,Amazing Time in BEAUTIFUL hotel,"Stayed in a standard room with double bed. Room was perfect including separate bath, shower, double bed, balcony, large flat screen tv. Everything you could need in perfect condition. Everything was very clean and well presented.

Hotel pool, pool bar and restaurant was all amazing. Very nice indeed. Only downside would be the prices. Abit expensive but that is to be expected with a hotel of this standard. Not really a moan, rather a heads up.

Also has a lovely spa which is complementary with the rooms.

Great location away from busy streets, but close enough to walk to las ramblas, although it is at the top of a large hill, way back takes a while longer, we normally got a cab which was about 5 - 6 euros. Beach easy to get to, sky rail just next to the hotel (dont eat in the restaurant next to it though).

fantastic time had. Would 100% go back.",5,2012,08,31
46,"Elegant, beautiful, great views.","As the hotel is located on a hill, the views are breathtaking. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms extremely well appointed and luxurious. The breakfast was excellent. The pool area is very beautiful.",5,2012,08,20
46,"Good Hotel, Amazing Views.","Got this hotel on a special 'club' rate. Overall the room was fins- a litte dated and dark (brown ). The thing that made the room (and the stay) was the private terrace/balcony. It was very cool and following the recent hot weather- it was great to have a shaded area. The views on an evening on the bright lights below were fantastic and that is where we spent the evenings sharing a bottle of wine and enjoying the views. On the last day- the heat just proved too much and it was nice to be able to retreat to the shade of the balcony and relax on the loungers in the afternoon. The interior of the hotel had quirky touches and, for some reason, I felt it had a 70's feel about it - but very plush.

Had breakfast on the first day. It was very nice. Typical hotel breakfast but lots of choice. Found lots of places to eat within walking distance. The bar was very busy and appeared under staffed. That is the only gripe. Would stay here again. You really get the best of both-cool parklands and easy access to all the major attractions- either by public transport or on foot. I would reccomend as you can be in the thick of it in 10 minutes or you can treat the hotel as a resort to mooch around when you feel like having a mid holiday 'lazy day'.",4,2012,08,19
46,'Great views from Montjuic',"Lovely hotel on Montjuic with views of the city, rooms are very spacious & nicely decorated. Large beautiful bathrooms, the shower knob came off the first time I used it, but one call to reception had maintenance knocking at the door to fix it within 10 minutes. 
Lovely large balconies with automatic canopies for shade/privacy & lovely comfortable balcony furniture. Exceptionally clean.
Hotel staff are very polite & friendly.
Only downside, hotel has many functions, we were there for four nights and there were two large functions, one of which took over the pool area, subsequently the pool area was closed to hotel guests. The functions also lasted till 4am.",4,2012,08,14
46,Fantastic holiday hotel,"Ideal hotel for family holiday, ideal for city break or even quite few days away, the pools and spa are very relaxing, hotel bars and food very very nice , and location and hotel views are amazing !!, perfectly placed fir the city the beach or idea just for a stroll though the park to the busy sea port with the most tasty sea food restaurants ,,",5,2012,08,03
46,Relaxing and luxurious,"I stayed here for 4 nights with friends in July. The Hotel is beautiful with amazing views of Barcelona and the sea. Although it is within walking distance of the Metro, and many attractions, it feels like a peaceful escape from  the city, so you get the best of both world.The rooms are modern and luxurious and I found the staff to be  friendly, helpful and professional, from the chambermaids to the reception staff. I will have great memories of drinking coffee and fresh orange juice on the terrace overlooking Barcelona and the sea! My only gripe is that when we booked the room we were under the impression that our room would come with a balcony and it didn't. We did have fantastic views from the window however, which made up for this. I am looking forward to coming back already!",5,2012,07,29
46,Perched up high looking down over Barcelona.,"Stayed 3 nights, good weather - less humid up high. Breakfast: a good selection, room perfect, pool area relaxed and not overly busy. Very clean, gym sufficient, had a lovely massage in spa. The hotel does host functions, weddings etc around the pool area so some cheesy music playing quite loud. Service polite but bar staff aren't in a great hurry! Would definitely recommend and will revisit. ",4,2012,07,29
46,Fantastic Stay in Barcelona!,"I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for one of your employees, her name is Paula Forero.  I stayed at your lovely Hotel in June as I had family attending to Madonna's concert, so I was able to explore Barcelona at my leisure.  Thankfully, Paula Forero was there to help me with every question, she gave me the best advice on attractions, clubs, restaurants, shopping and transportation.  Paula is an exceptional lady, full of knowledge and kindness but more importantly made me feel most welcome.  I have travelled all over the world, and I have to say, that the service and hospitality of Miramar Hotel and Mrs. Forero made my trip so much more enjoyable.  Please give my best wishes to Paula and I hope to stay at your Hotel again in the near future.

Kindest Regards,

Alfred",5,2012,07,28
46,"Fantastic, classic hotel with great views of Barcelona","I stayed here for my last night in Barcelona, after a disappointing stay elsewhere. The hotel is located half way up Montjuic, surrounded by attractions and only a short cab ride into the city. It is a 15 minute walk to Plaza Espana. The room was excellent, with a large bathroom with fantastic tub and monsoon shower. It featured a balcony with panoramic views across Barcelona and the ocean. 

The hotel is quiet and elegant, with a spectacular spa area and indoor pool featuring a glass wall with water cascading down. The outdoor pool was very relaxing with a large well manicured lawn area in full sunlight. Views from the pool across the harbour were amazing. 

Staff were incredible, and eager to attend to guests' every need. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a cab, and check in is swift and professional. The nighttime view from the room was something very special, and would be very romantic if staying with someone special. 

My only criticism is that the beds were very hard, and on a twin room too narrow. But this seems to be a common feature of all hotels that I have stayed at in Spain.",5,2012,07,26
46,Modern oasis overlooking Barcelona,"We stayed for a few nights in July. Beautiful modern rooms and an amazing property overlooking Barcelona. The pool was a highlight during the warm summer days. Best of all -- the staff here is fantastic. Whatever we needed, they were able to help us with from car rentals, taxis, restaurant reservations, and room service.",5,2012,07,25
46,"Amazing, peaceful property",The Miramar is a great hotel that is not too far from Las Ramblas. It is ideal if you are looking for a big pool and big luxurious rooms at a reasonable price. The staff were also very accommodating for special requests. I will definitely be staying here again!,5,2012,07,25
46,AMAZING,"I stayed here with my boyfriend in early July for 3 nights. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Clean and Luxurious! Breakfast was great, pool area was so relaxing, staff were brilliant. 

Although it's up on the hill I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and the views

Thank you - we'll be back",5,2012,07,23
46,Fantastic,"We loved this hotel. Only stayed for 2 nights as it was fully booked but would've stayed longer.

We had a fantastic room with a huge private patio (as it was a corner room).

Breakfast is expensive at 30€ pp for buffet but you can get ""express breakfast"" in the bar area, which is a hot drink, fruit juice and two croissant per person.

The spa has single sex hotubs and saunas, an indoor pool, and an outdoor pool with sun loungers - you get a nice breeze up on the hill.

Great location to experience montjuic - get the cable car up to the castle!

Only downside is you have to walk or get a taxi to town for dinner. There isn't much of an atmosphere at the hotel and it was hard to believe it was full. But still a lovely place to have a drink outside looking over the sea!",4,2012,07,20
46,Best in town for the money! Nice location,"I choose Miramar after a keeping in mind many properties cause I traveling with a family of 9 members and needed a bullet proof choice. Miramar did not disappoint. It is located on montjuic hill overlooking Barcelona. It is a spot where tourists will actually stop to take pictures in front of that breath taking view. Rooms were VERY clean and smelled really nice just like the whole property and not to forget the room and patio size that is rare to find in Europe. One of the 4 rooms we booked even had a hot tub in the patio. All perfect in that hotel except one point which is ""unnecessary charges"". We were charged for ice, empty mugs, silverware .. etc. Front desk said that they have to charge 4 euros for every time something is delivered to our rooms. Also since its located up there, front desk has to call taxi every time we needed to go out which incurs extra charges compared waiving to the taxi in the street.",4,2012,07,09
46,Excellent Hotel but lacked atmosphere,"We have just returned from Hotel Miramar after staying there for 1 week. It is a lovely hotel situated at the top of a hill overlooking the whole of Barcelona with amazing views. The hotel is very stylish and the staff are very professional. We upgraded to a premier room and it was really nice with a huge bathroom within the bedroom but separate shower and toilet. It also had a big balcony with an electronic awningl! The pool area was lovely. There were always beds available and a bar which offered good food and drink. The service was a little sporadic as there was often only 1 person looking after the whole bar area but he did try his best to serve everyone and was very professional. If you are thinking of getting married abroad it would definitely be a lovely setting. We saw a wedding being set up by the pool with a huge marquee and it looked amazing! The only downside for us is that the hotel lacked any atmosphere. Even though it was busy around the pool area in the day, the lobby bar in the evening was always quiet. We only saw 2 people in there at any one time.  We are in our mid 30's so are not party animals but we just wanted somewhere with a bit of life! For this reason we didn't eat in the restaurant in the evenings even though the menu looked good. We got a cab into town every night which cost at least 10 Euros each way so it ended up being quite expensive over the course of a week. We did take a leisurely walk into town one day which took around 20mins walking down steps so it wasn't too bad. If you take sensibly shoes (unlike me!) you could do the walk into town in the evenings and save some money on cabs. The only downside is that you have to walk up the hill on the way home! It would certainly walk off the dinner though!",4,2012,07,08
46,"Exceptional hotel, views and staff","I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. Gorgeous, stylish, very spacious rooms. Mesmerising views over Barcelona. Lovely, lovely pool and grass area. And utterly amazing staff. We stayed five days and honestly, I could have stayed a month. 

Breakfast is huge. Lots of pastries, breads, sandwiches, cheeses, fruits, hams, cereals and even chilled champagne, you know, in case you’re in the mood. Far far better than the average European five-star.

Ditto the bed. None of that two-beds-pushed-together rubbish that you find all over Europe – this is a giant soft bed with perfect pillows. There’s a desk and a sitting area, and all rooms have a fantastic terrace. Try to get one overlooking Barcelona – early evening on your terrace with a bottle of something cold will be the best hour you spend in the city... Oh, and the room has proper blackout blinds too. The room is DARK when they are drawn. 

Bathrooms are big: huge egg-shaped standalone baths, walk in shower, lovely toiletries, two sinks (ah... relationship happiness). Some rooms divide the bathroom from the bedroom with just a curtain, so if that’s not your bag, request a separate bathroom ahead of time. 

Absolutely best of all are the staff – most particularly Paula on the Front Desk, who is warm, charming, efficient and genuinely lovely.

Paula made a huge effort to ensure everything was okay for our baby, and always greeted us with a huge smile and a chat – just such a lovely lovely woman. She also returned my phone when I stupidly left it behind - Fanny on the front desk is also delightful and also helped track my phone down (when I rang for the sixth time and housekeeping insisted it wasn’t there, she went to our room and found it herself!) The staff at breakfast are also really lovely and chatty. Always nice to talk to.

On the downside? The menu is very, very limited – it’s the same for room service, in the restaurant and by the pool. Three salads, three sandwiches, and a burger. (The burger is good.) The housekeeping staff are a little charmless and some of them are better than others. And apparently if you have a room on the atrium, it can get a little noisy as sounds echo up from the lobby. But all in all? An exceptional hotel.",5,2012,06,28
46,Miramarvellous!,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of June and could not fault it. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. We arrived late (after 10pm) and were pleased to find the restaurant still open. Wow! The food was amazing and again the staff were excellent - attentive & very informative. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a huge bed and great facilities (fridge, tv, cd player, i-pod/phone dock and even a mechanical sunshade for the large balcony).We didn't find the walk into town (about 10-15 mins) a problem, in fact we really enjoyed it as we got to discover lots more and agreed that we were in the perfect location.The hotel is a welcome escape from the hub-bub of the city after a busy day sightseeing. Both pools and the spa areas are tranquil and well maintained. The gardens are beautifully kept and the views are just amazing. We've already recommended to friends and family and cannot wait to return.",5,2012,06,26
46,Perfect few days,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and had an absolutely fabulous time!

We only had a basic room, but to be honest we couldn't really wish for much more! It was spacious, well appointed, immaculate, the bed was enourmous and comfortable and the bathroom was large and fantastically well-equipped. Plus to top it off we had a large balcony with a fantastic view across the Port.

The buffet breakfasts were top notch with a bewildering array of options, all of them seemingly very high quality produce. We ate in the bar and also once in the main restaurant for dinner and the food was delicious, if a tad pricey!

The staff were always extremely attentive and polite to a T. The location is excellent too, far enough outside the hustle and bustle of the city centre to be peaceful and relaxing, but close enough that you can amble down to the Ramblas with relative ease whenever you fancy.

Would recommend to anyone looking for a classy and luxurious stay in Barcelona!",5,2012,06,24
46,Peaceful haven in a bustling city!,"My husband and I enjoyed a 4 day honeymoon in this fabulous hotel. We were a bit worried that it was out of town but actually it couldn't have been better located. It sits at the top of the city overlooking all the wonderful sights and yet is only a 10-15 minute stroll downhill into Las Ramblas and the old gothic quarter. Getting back up the hill was a bit more energetic but a taxi was only around 5 euros. The staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful, always on hand but not intrusive. It was also my birthday whilst we were there and the chef made me a wonderful chocolate cake! Beautiful spacious rooms (we had the executive) with their own enclosed garden and the biggest bathroom I've ever used. Would highly recommend this hotel for the best of both worlds from a city break.",5,2012,06,20
46,"Relaxing, luxurious stay in Barcelona","My husband and I loved our stay at Hotel Miramar Barcelona. It was wonderful that it was a bit away from the city center so it felt like a retreat and relaxing destination. We enjoyed access to the spa and outdoor and indoor pool which we swam in daily. The breakfast spread is amazing - so many fresh choices. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious with a nice sized balcony, loveseat and large tub in addition to the shower. The staff were all very helpful and eager to provide suggestions on activities or restaurants. You can walk down from the mountain to the city and the train station but the hike up is a bit difficult at the end of a day of sightseeing and we always took a cab to dinner, but it was less than 8-10 euros every time. We hope to come back again!",5,2012,06,06
46,An oasis in Barcelona,"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel ,we experienced excellent and very polite service,the staff was very helpful and fortunately everybody speaks English,and the atmosphere was exceptional.The hotel is situated on a unique place overviewing the city and the harbour,very close to all areas and yet a quiet place to live in,wonderful garden and very good breakfast.Though we were offered a garden viewing room and there must be something like a ""shooting place"" on the top of the hill with considerable noice,we had a really very large and comfortable room (no 302),so we presumably believe that rooms 402 and 502 would be of the same size and luxury.
 The location is ideal for those who like walking around Montjuit hill with lots of things to do,like visiting the castle on the top,have a ride on the funiqular or jogging.Fine restaurants at the port are easily reachable and we must admit we experienced a very good selection of seafood.",5,2012,06,02
46,Hotel Miramar: Worth a visit,"Hotel Miramar is a good choice if you are looking for a hotel near the tourist attractions of Barcelona, but you also want space, peace and quiet, views, a nice good sized outdoor pool, and high quality accommodation. The hotel is very modern, and overlooks Barcelona. I had a large corner room complete with walkout terrace with views of the city, ocean, and the hotel grounds. This is not a luxury hotel, but the standard is very good. (Look at El Palace if you want a luxury hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant.) Walking into the tourist areas is possible (perhaps 15 mins), but it is a climb back up to the hotel so some visitors might prefer to take a taxi (which is not particularly expensive). The hotel is probably about 20 mins from the airport by taxi. This was the second time I stayed at Miramar, and I will likely return again.",4,2012,05,28
46,Don't let the location put you off,"Fantastic location giving amazing views of the city and coast. It's only a 15min walk (all downhill) to Las Ramblas. If you're not up for the uphill trek back a taxi home won't set you back too much either.

Loved the pool, enjoyed tapas and beers in peaceful surrounds.

The room was probably one of the nicest I've ever stayed in.",5,2012,05,28
46,What a view!!,What a great hotel! We stayed for three nights prior to picking our motorcycle up to tour northern Spain. Nothing was a problem for the staff they were happy to help with whatever we needed. Out room 604 was a premium room with a private balcony over looking the port of Spain and although it was a little noisy when the liners docked the noise was easy to ignore. This hotel is in a great location too - away from the hustle and bustle of the city but within walking distance to Las Ramblas. Don't be afraid to use the Barcelona metro it's clean and very user friendly. Oh! They have Soy milk available for breakfast too - bonus points for that because most of Europe look at you as if you have two heads when you ask for soy! ,5,2012,05,04
46,"Relaxed, luxurious, beautiful","We booked a Premium Room with private terrace. I had some requests (view to both the city and the port, away from the shooting range), and they did not go unnoticed. Our room (416) was amazing: a big private terrace with great views, and the bathroom was to die for. Minibar had a great selection (not too cheap though), the walk-in closet was huge (great for longer stays) and did I already mention the terrace ;)

The public areas of the hotel were very relaxed and peaceful, I loved the garden outside the hotel and the spa/pool area. The service was friendly, and the receptionists gave me an impression that they were always genuinely happy to help. We had a late night drink at the lobby bar where the bartender made me a delicious non-alcoholic drink - something I've found many bartenders aren't always too keen on making! 

We had a small issue with room service, as our order had apparently been forgotten. We called again approx 40 minutes later and they said they will prepare the meal as quickly as possible. Less than 5 minutes later we had the hotel manager call us and apologize, and when the meal was brought up the waiter said it was on the house and apologized again. Very well handled! 

Another complaint would be the wi-fi, which was free, but did not seem to work at all. We had a better wi-fi connection even in a hostel in a tiny village in the middle of a national park up north on the French boarder. Would like to see this improved!

Other than that, we were very satisfied and felt relaxed in this beautiful, luxurious hotel. Will most definitely go there again!",5,2012,04,29
46,Great Staff - Terrible Wifi,"I know that may sound like a strange title but it sums up the hotel.  The staff were SO friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Attentive, polite, respectful but fun.  For the staff alone I would return.  Location is a mixed bag for me.  Stunning in the fact that it's up high and has great views across the harbour and city and we had a sea facing room with huge balcony and lovely grounds, although they are frequented by anyone who cares to wander around as they are also a walk through for people visiting the cable car and taking in the views.  The problems is access to and from the town.  There is a bus (No 50) that runs up to the hotel but we couldn't find it.  There are Taxis (hugely expensive and rude drivers) or a long steep walk either up the sea front steps or the steep main road.  Either way it's a walk and not a walk for the faint hearted (literally).  BUT - in the day there is a furnicular railway from the Metro (which is brilliant) which runs up the hillside and then it's a down hill walk back to the hotel.  The only two real options are walking or Taxi's. The hotel is really well designed and beautifully decorated, especially the bar area.  The restaurant is very good, not cheap (120 Euros for 2 with wine etc) and again the staff are very friendly, if a little slow.  The room was lovely, well furnished, decent TV with loads of chanels BUT.... This is a 5* hotel - No Coffee or Tea making facilities in the room - The 'modern' way seems to put the bath, loo, shower etc in the room behind a curtain - fine, I guess, but trying to have a bath and read next to the bed with the wife watching TV - Using the Loo which is again off the main room, behind a frosted glass door which doesn't close fully - same for the shower...not really ideal - and the glass doors scrape on the floor when you open then (not good in the night), no extract fans working in either the loo or shower and as for the Wifi - useless. I run my own company and when I go away 'I NEED THE INTERNET' it is hugely important to me.  So hit and miss everywhere in the hotel that I just couldn't return with it like this.  It seemed best in the restaurant strangely!  NOT GOOD ENOUGH Mirimar.  I love my coffee in the morning and the lack of facilities in the room is not acceptable as you are then forced to get ripped off in the bar at 4 Euros for a Nespresso Capsual Americano - eeeeeeeeeek that's a rip.  Done once and then Coffee and Breakfast taken 100yds away at the Cable Car Cafe.  That's my rant over with but if you, like me, are in business, you need the internet connection to work all day, every day and work well - this is 2012!  

As for Barcelona - Loved it but Too Expensive in the tourist areas.  Tapas in a Spanish Tapas Chain - £75 for 2 - ouch.  Beware - extra charges everywhere - a 15 Euro taxi ride jumped to 18 as soon as we stopped - extras!  Fancy sitting outside to eat or drink (where else would you sit) an extra 15% + Service charge.  Pick Pockets - Watch out for them - keep everything in front pockets.  The Metro is amazing good though - get either a day or week pass or, as we were only there for a short time, a 10 journey ticket which worked out at about 90p per journey. If you do manage to get away from the tourist areas then there are some fantastic restuarants and great value.  We were recomended one by a waiter at our hotel, one she lives near and uses all the time.  It is really worth a visit, the food, staff, atmosphere, everything, just fantastic and at a great price - Bottle of Cava 7.90 Euros - huge meal for 2 with Cava - 45 Euros - now that's more like it.  It's called - Can Recasens - at Rambla Del Poblenov, 102.  You Must Go.
The Zoo was good as was the harbour tour.  Shopping is good too. To sum up - The Miramar needs to shape up a bit, keep that staff but think of the value a little more - Barcelona - Great - Expensive but go out of the tourist traps and it's great.  BTW - Do the tour of the Friexent Cava Factory with Julia Tours - Very Good",4,2012,04,28
46,Booked for Honeymoon....service was shocking!!,"I booked this as a gift for my sister on her honeymoon, it was made quite clear to the hotel at the time of the booking that this was a gift for the newly weds and that we would be footing the bill and to try and make it extra special for the couple.  On arrival they were not given the room they were promised, they were also promised loads of extras like rose petal bath, etc, - their room did not even have a bath...!! They were also approached for payment several times throughout the trip even although it was clearly stated throughout several conversations with the hotel staff by us not to do this.  They also commented on the general manner of the staff within the hotel as being rude and customer service not the best...after their return from honeymoon, I have contacted the hotel several times wanting an explanation, stating my complaint, and have had no feedback from them whatsoever...given the fact we paid just under £1000 for a four night break, and were promised so much...I think it is a downright disgrace that we have never even been so much as emailed an apology!",1,2012,04,23
46,Private views of Barcelona,"Mira (Spanish for Look) Mar (Sea) It does not get any better to take in the beauty of that is the city of Barcelona and the Mediterranean , while standing on you hotel balcony. Only a 5 minute cab ride from the city center this 5 star hotel offers a perfect staff, very calm atmosphere and  modern rooms with balconies. The outside patio is relaxing in the afternoon for lunch or evening for drinks. The breakfast buffet is simple but elegant. Worth the splurge for this 5 star hotel compared to others in the city.",5,2012,04,12
46,Great view of the city from Hotel Garden,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights before our med cruise. The location of the hotel may not be for everyone as it's quite far from all the touristy areas, restaurants, and shoppings, but we certainly enjoyed it. The view of the city from the back of the hotel is wonderful. you get to see the entire Barcelona by just standing there. The hotel room are quite big, there is no separate bathroom area, bedroom and bathroom are only separate by a curtain. The design of the room certainly looks great, but the details are not perfect. Shower room door could not be closed and the sofa in the sitting area was a bit wore. Overall, a good hotel room for short stay and sleep.

If you want to tour the city, take one of the tour buses, they have a stop right next to the hotel, which acted as your transportation to and from the city for the day, of course, it also takes you to the rest of the barcelona.

The cost of the taxi from airport is around 30 euros and 15-20 euros will take you to the cruise terminal.",4,2012,04,07
46,Spain is a riot,"A bit of a mixed bag. The rooms were booked well in advance via booking .com. We did arrive earler than intended using the excellent serice of  pre booked Holiday Taxis  for both sides of the journey from the airport strongly recommend  this as pre charge of £61 between four people was reasonable and efficient. It does state rooms are not available until 15:00 hours however both rooms were not ready until after this time. My room was 408 i didnt complain  about it but realy 5* should have inspections glass was cracked in balcony window, ceilings in shoer room and bathroom were discoloured by flooding from above with paintwork hanging down in bathroom. The toilet door was hanging loose and made a right racket when closing ( I fixed it myself) Problems with air con blowing only hot air. The hotel staff were all friendly sheets and towels were changed regularly. Friends room had none of these problems. Location meant it was hard to walk overcome by using Barcelona pass (recommended) no 50 takes you right to Espanya place. Unstuck on Thurday due to natonal strike. Even with these faults woild recommend hotel for the peace and tranquility esaping from city noise and pollution. garden view isnt that bad either. Dint eatb in because of budget",4,2012,03,31
46,Good views and Nice staff,"Stayed in suite and premier room with seaview
Nice big room with private terrace and beautifull view.  Room service was good.
Staff very helpfull and friendly, changing my room for a more quite room was not a problem.
Nice big bathroom with separate bath and shower, the bath salts were only available in the suite not in premier rooms.
Getting there by walking can be a bit difficult since the hotels on a mountain, but since taxi is relative cheap this should not be a problem",4,2012,03,20
46,"Nice hotel, shame about the water and the smell.","Stayed here for just under a week. Hotel is very nice, views over the port are amazing. Staff were very helpful and accomodating. The rooms and the bathrooms are also pleasant. 

However, the week that I stayed, they had a LOT of problems with the water and the sewage- type smell in certain parts of the hotel. This included the water in my bathroom turning brown, smelling unpleasant and on two occassions stopping flowing altogether. Unfortunate as I was half way through my shower covered in soap!! 

The corridor that takes you through to the breakfast area has a BAD 'sewage' smell which remained throughout my visit and I was not the only guest to run through there, holding my nose. 

I have just returned and been to the Dr. today for an upset stomach (not eaten for 3 days in Spain as feeling too poorly) which I attribute to drinking the tap water (brushing my teeth)  in the bathroom first few days of my stay before it had turned brown. The water was VERY heavily chlorinated at times at the start of my visit.

This experience is unfortunate because it spoiled an otherwise very enjoyable stay at what is unquestionably  a very nice hotel as other reviews will testify. That said, a quick google search when I got back showed that the problem with the water would be appear to be a recurring rather than an isolated incident. I hope that the hotel reads this review and acts upon it because this water issue is spoiling an othewise nice place to stay and I would not return unless I was absolutely convinced that the problem had been solved permanently.

If you do decide to go, ONLY drink (and brush your teeth in)  bottled water and you'll probably be fine.",2,2012,03,09
46,"Bad Maids, and horrible water","3 main issues here. 

1) The hotel maids dropped my laptop whilst cleaning my room and moving it from where I left it - causing me to have a £700 bill

2) The water in the hotel gave 2 of my colleagues a stomach bug to content with for 3/4 days.  With occassions when the water was no longer running in the shower, or the water being brown. 

3) The hotel smelt very badly in certain areas of the hotl due to poor drainage or sewage works.  

The hotel looks lovely, but deep down, it is very very poor!",1,2012,03,09
46,Probably a good hotel but not a nice experience at all.,"Introduction:

I was in Barcelona attending a conference hosted in Hotel Miramar.
This review will be short as I didn’t want to stay at the hotel during the conference because of the bad organization which turned the hotel in a building with nice rooms but that is all.
Although my better half and me only spend one night in the room, I hope this review will help.

Dates of stays:
Booked from march 2 to 5, 2012 
Sleep one night, work from 2 to 5 in the day time.

The Exterior:
The building is very “modern” but well integrated to the hill of Barcelona, Mont Juic.
 
The Area:
Perfect location is you want to chill out a bit out of town.
A bus, 55, will take you downtown in around 25 minutes.
A cab will cost you 10€.
If you’re looking for action, well you are not in the right spot.
If you’re looking for a nice place to rest and have a romantic week-end, it’s great.

The Interior:
Very nicely arranged and decorated. 
The lobby is small with two desks for checkin/out.
Stairs will take you to the lobby bar, which opens on a very large terrace facing the sea.

Check in: 
The check in was ok. 
Difficult to comment as when you stay in a hotel hosting the conference you’re attending you should expect some troubles.
We were taken care of by a lady who helped a colleague for at least 5 or more minutes before talking to us while we were sitting in front of her waiting for assistance.

We managed to get the key cards after having been warned that everything will be charged on the credit card right away with no refund option.
Well, now I understand why as it’s not the hotel handling the billing but the conference.
Much to our surprise, we will discover that everything else would have to be paid in cash.

The room: 316 
I think this was a deluxe room.
Quite nice with a very large king size bed, a small balcony with a sea and park view.
On the balcony, only one armchair though. 
No way to sit for a romantic two person aperitif with my better half thus.
The room has a long working desk, a big enough closet, a minibar and a flat screen TV.
The bathroom is “integrated” in the room, separated by a design curtain.
Everything you can expect in a hotel of this category was there: bathrobes, slippers (but cheap though), sewing kit … 

The Bathroom:
Separated from the bed room by a curtain, the bathroom is an open space with a egg shaped bath and a single sink. 
It’s very nice looking but the bath is not so comfy.
Design kills comfort sometimes.
There is a separate shower, very large, with a hand shower and a “rain” type one on the ceiling.
The only problem is that when you shower with the hand shower, the ceiling one is leaking and you get some cold water drops falling during the entire time you spend in the shower.
Both of us tried to avoid that, but we couldn’t.
There is a large toilet, separated from the rest of the bathroom by glass walls and door.

The Bed:
Excellent quality, very large, great sleep.

The Breakfast:
What can I say?
It was totally stupid.
Breakfast was between 7 and 9 AM.
On our one and only morning there, there were only 18 people who came in time for the breakfast. 18 out of 400 attendees shows that none of us would expect such a short schedule for the breakfast.
On top of that, as the restaurant was closed to host lounges for attendees, we had to cross a freezing corridor to end up in a sort of meeting room. At least the place was surrounded by the gardens, and the buffet although very limited was good enough.
And you know what: that breakfast wasn’t even included in the price of the conference apparently.

Room Service:
Well, again due to the organization, there was NO room service menu available.
If you want to eat, you’ll get the same limited sandwich choice than in the lobby bar and will have to provide prepaid tickets (in cash)!

Check out:
Long and complicated.
2 persons on duty to check out 400 people?!
Wow, that was the icing on the cake.

Fitness center/Wellness:
Didn’t even have the time neither the mood to check it out, sorry

The Restaurant:
Closed!

Business center:
I didn’t visit, so I can’t comment. 

I really liked:
- The hill of Mont Juic is nice. There is a great promenade to do in the parks around the hotel.
- The view on the city and sea, the nice back terrace of the hotel are very enjoyable.

I really disliked:
- As my better half and me were completely NON aware of the greedy organization, I will not put the blame on the hotel but on the conference.

My conclusion:
I’m sure that this hotel is potentially a great choice.
But they choose to sell their soul to greedy conference people.
In our case it will make us keep a bad souvenir of our one night stay in the room and my 4 days stay in the rest of the hotel.

Thanks for reading one more bad English review!

All the best,
Stephane",3,2012,03,08
46,Before you die:) you have to stay here!!!!,"This is my favourite hotel on the planet! :)
My G/F & I decided to go to Barcelona for the first time, for a short break ( 5 days ) and I searched high and low for the perfect hotel which offered luxury, relaxation, views, and the WOW factor... and then I found it.

This hotel is ontop of a very high hill/cliff with stunning views of Barcelona. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the front of the hotel and many of the landmarks it has to offer... its simply breathtaking. The hotel entrance is hidden away under a small tunnel, and then their it is... and we both said OMG this s our hotel as the taxi pulled up as it is incredible. Straight away a porter was there to open the taxi door and take our bags to our room while another member of staff welcomed us and asked us to come and sign in. The staff are so welcoming, professional and anything you want or any questions you need answering they are 1st class. As we were escourted to our room all we could do is stare at the architecture of the hotel, the furnishings, and the amazing function rooms, gym, indoor pool, and spas. When  we got to our room, our mouths hit the floor, is was the most incredible room and view we have ever got ( and we've stayed in a few pretty amazing las vegas hotels ). Our room was more of a suite than a standard room... huge bed, cd/ipod player that could play in the bedroom our through to the bathroom with a flick of a switch. A huge flatscreen, nice mini bar, a massive free standing deep bath, the shower and toilet were behind two seperate doors in the bathroom which was nice, and the sink had a huge mirror, and lots of free toiletries. There was also a walk in wardrobe, and a few comfy chairs. Our room was on the corner of the upper floor with views of the gardens on one side and a few of the pool and sea/port on the other. Our balcony had very comfy chairs and a table, and they supplied robes and slippers for free.
The poolside is beautiful, the grounds are so well looked after, beautiful bushes/flowers, the sun loungers are so chic and comfortable, and the pool itself is perfect. This hotel although high up, feels so private, safe, and everything is onsite, so you dont even have to leave the hotel if you dont want to. Also at the back of the hotel is the cable car that takes you down to the beach.
We had the best time ever here, and the hotel owners/staff should be very proud and happy, because they have a gem and make all there guests feel special and give them a great holiday :)
We would love to return someday!!",5,2012,02,20
46,Not Safe,"Afer returning to my room my last nightt, I found that we were burglarized. After noyifying management and calling the police, the manager refused to reimburse for my loss ( around $900 ). Subsequent calls have been ignored. I would not recommend this hotel. It is not safe and management is non responsive. Many better hotels in Barcelona.",1,2012,02,13
46,excellent !,"This is a fantastic hotel ! It is a bit further from the centre, but well connected by public transport or even by taxi that you can share if it is more of you for acceptable price.  It has a wonderful orange garden with a view over the city and the sea, where you can sip your morning coffee which, is excellent by the way! We were having coffee outside even in December! Also delicious french style pastries are available for brekafast.
The rooms are spacious and in modern style, super clean. Contrary to some reviews we had had great experience with the staff in the hotel.
The spa is nice, but I have personally enjoyed the swimming pool the most. Unlike many, quasi 5 star hotels. this one has a decent size and I was having my morning workout there. Gym is also available, but I have not tested it as I prefer swimming. I could not recommend this place more!",5,2012,01,30
46,Great place but could be better,"The Miramar is a great hotel in a great location, it is quiet with a great view of the city and it is a great location to retreat to from the intensity of the main tourist areas.  The rooms are great, the shower in our room was so good I had to be dragged out of it, the staff are friendly.

Here are a couple of things I think this hotel needs to improve on:
1.  The hotel bar could be such a great place, the views are perfect but for some reason the place is generally empty.  If they could create a but of a buzz here it would be a fantastic place to 
2.  The hotel seems to have a general problem with water, when it rains staff need to put buckets at strategic points around the common areas as the rain come through the roof. Lucky for them that Barcelona doesnt get a lot of rain.  In some of the rooms there is damp by windows or in showers.
3.  The hotel breakfast is too expensive which is a real shame because it is a great location and their buffet is very good.
4.  We did a couple of Spa treatments and although they were good again the prices we felt were higher than what we thought they should be even for such a highly rated hotel

Dont let any of the above put you off going to the hotel, it is really a nice hotel and I will go back to it.",4,2012,01,22
46,Great Off-Season Deal!,"Spent a fantastic weekend at the hotel during mid-december. The price for our spacious double room was a joke given the quality and stunning location of the hotel! Our balcony including nice outdoor furniture with cushions etc that actually made you want to spend time there had a beautiful view over both the city beneath as well as the ocean...not sure if many other hotels can actually offer that in Barcelona. Don't get too worried about the distance from the hotel to the city centre. It's an easy 5-10min walk down and after a long day out in Barcelona we always took a very affordable cab back. Taking cleanliness and the nice spa as a given the most striking positive feature was the great staff. In my experience Barcelona unfortunately increasingly develops Parisien traits when it comes to hospitality and giving it an effort to actually make tourists feel welcome. The Miramar staff was a refreshing exception! Very good English (I know it's sad that this is a feature worth mentioning...welcome to Barcelona), extremely friendly at all times and going the extra mile to make your stay more pleasant. 

Especially during the off-season a great value-for-money hotel that will make your entire experience of Barcelona just a little bit more special.",5,2011,12,17
46,Didn't want to leave!,"What a great hotel! The registration staff was attentive and couldn't do enough for us. We stayed for 2 nights prior to our cruise and returned for a 1 night stay after the cruise before flying home to USA. Our first room was fabulous, beautifully appointed and very spacious, with a terrace overlooking the Mediterranean and the beautiful gardens. Our room on return was on the 5th floor, equally beautiful, with a balcony facing the pool and cruise marina. We had brunch in the restaurant which was absolutely wonderful, lots of delicious choices and a very attentive staff. The hotel, no matter where we went, from the gardens to our balcony or the hotel lobby was just beautiful, clean and very peaceful and quiet. I highly recommend it for pre- or post-cruising or a visit to the wonderful city of Barcelona!!  Will certainly return if I have the opportunity,",5,2011,10,18
46,A great place to stay with amazing views and friendly staff,"Having had a really bad stay here during 2010 we were invited back, and we thought hey ho lets give a go for 1 night.

In fact this time we had such an enjoyable stay we decided to stay for an additional 3 nights.

We stayed in a room with a view over the city, this room had a large balcony which was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the amazing views.

Wow what a staff transformation - this time we found them all to be very helpful and personable.

We know where we will be staying on our next trip to Barcelona - many thanks everyone for making our stay so enjoyable :-)",5,2011,09,21
46,Such a shame,"What am amazing location & view. 

Such a shame there is a gun club just 20 meters from the hotel. We are currently staying in the hotel and sitting by the pool. The shots are constant, loud and it has unfortunately ruined our time away. 

I stayed here based on a recommendation and didn't check the other reviews until now. Really wish I had...",1,2011,09,07
46,Fabulous,"My Mum and I stayed at the Hotel Miramar over the weekend. We were blown away by how efficient and charming the staff were, they could not do more to help us. The hotel itself was spacious, clean and very calming. Our room had fantastic views over the port and the city itself, which was especially magical in the evening. We did have a bit of noise from people coming up for the view and the cruise ships in the port, but thankfully it didn't bother us too much due to the comfort of the beds! I would highly recommend this hotel and will be back as soon we can!",4,2011,09,06
46,"A good experience, but not quite worth the price","We stayed here for four nights, enjoying the short walking distance to town, the nice outdoor pool, spacious rooms (with beautiful bathtubs perfect for drinking cava in) and excellent room service. The view from Montjuic is great. 

But on hindsight it probably wasn't worth the premium price, as there was little attention to detail, the service ranged from very friendly to condescending, wifi failed to work for a day and even though the description was ""garden view"", our room was on the ground floor with no view (as it had curtains around the terrace to protect our privacy).",4,2011,09,05
46,A touch of luxury,"This hotel facilitated us with a lovely large room for us and out two children (ages 15 and 10). The breakfast was overpriced and past reviews encouraged us to have room service. That was better priced. So too was the nice lunch at the pool!  On site, there is a good outdoor restaurant with a stunning city view. The hotel should warn guests who venture to descend the hill to the city that it is a challenging climb back up!",4,2011,08,28
46,Great place to relax after a long walk in busy Barcelona,"This place is the perfect hide away after a long day enjoying the buzz of the city. Amazing views over the mediterranean sea. Very quiet and relaxing, decorated with great taste. The hotel overlooks a beautiful botanical garden.The staff is really friendly and helpful. The outdoor and indoor swimming pools are a great plus when you come back from a long walk in the hectic city. 2 things you should be aware of before booking is :1/ if you are lucky enough to get a balcony in your room, you will hear the noises of the ferry boats down in the harbour 2/ although it doesn't seem like a long walk on the map it's actually quite a walk considering that the hotel is located on a pretty steep hill. A lot of people had to use taxis to get downtown.",5,2011,08,26
46,Great views and lovely hotel,"We had a very nice night at Miramir. The view from our balcony was fantastic (over the city), the pool area was nice, the food from both the poolside bar, and the evening restaurant was good, and the room was clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the interior of the hotel is very nice.",5,2011,08,04
46,"Didn't quite live up to expectations, but not awful either","We booked this hotel for a 5 day break for my birthday. Expedia made a note on the booking that it was a celebration and could we be surprised, but this seemed to fall on deaf ears as there was no surprise! We booked a duluxe room and it was very nice, but smelled of bad drains which was a little off putting. The balcony was of good size with comfy chairs, but was a shame that the shooting range was on the same side of our room and so was a little nosy. The bathroom was good with a huge rainfall shower cubicle and a seperate egg shaped bath next to a huge window. The sound system in the room was a nice extra. We had a couple of instances in which we had to talk to management. My husband bought some shower gel (which was about £5 for a small lynx gel) as he had forgotten to bring his. On the second day we returned from our day out and couldn't find the gel which had been left in the shower cubicle. We called reception and it took a while for them to understand that the gel had been taken presumably by the maid as no one else had been in the room. They said they would look into it and come back to us. About half hour later we had a knock on the door and they had bought us some hotel shower gel. My husband explained it was his own gel that had been taken. They said that they had spoken to the maids and no-one remembered the gel but that maybe they thought it was finished or that we had checked out - which seeing as our other things were still in the hotel room and it was a full bottle of gel, didn't really stack up. We explained that at the end of the day it was only shower gel, but the more worrying thing was that it had been taken from our room. That evening, we had another knock on our door and the reception manager came to personally apologise and offered us breakfast the next morning on the house. We are not complainers normally but it was good that they had taken on board what we had said and tried to compensate for the error. Also on checking out there were some extra mini bar charges added that we did not have, so again had to explain what we did have and that the extra 15 or so euro charge should be removed. They tried to tell us that it would have been a bottle of wine. Well we didn't have a bottle of wine from the mini bar! We used the spa and gym facilities were good, but shame the jaccuzi's were split into the male and female changing rooms which meant my husband and I were not able to relax together. We ate in the hotel restaurant on our last night, which was a little pricey, but couldn't fault the food. It was beautifully presented and very tasty. Atmosphere was a little lacking as there was only one other family dining at the same time as us. Location was good if you like to get out of the hussle and bussle of the main city, but a bit out of the way if you like to be in the hub of things. Fine if you like walking! If we went to Barcelona again, we would probably rather stay in something like the Pullman or W which were situated nearer the beach and bars/restaurants on the nicer side of the city. All in all the Miramar was nice, but maybe not as five star in some cases as they would like to think.",4,2011,07,30
46,Nice Place,"One word to describe this place: Posh. It was a nice welcome to a long 12 hour flight from Los Angeles. The reception desk was friendly and they made all attempts at accommodating us even though we arrived earlier than the check-in time. We did have to talk to the supervisor though about that, and the hotel does not have a policy which lets guests stay in a room temporarily until their room is ready, especially for those weary travellers who have been in flight for a good part of a day. Other than that, the place was really chic, the decor was nice, and it lent an overall calming aura. I really liked this hotel and all the amenities both onsite and at the park adjacent. They have this terrific shower set up that even our 5 star resorts in CA don't have! We had terrific views from our balcony deluxe room, 508. And our room was spacious - especially taking into account that many hotel rooms in Europe tend to be on the smaller side, this is a nice welcome for those in the States who are accustomed to much larger accommodations. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2011,07,21
46,"Fantastic views, excellent location and nice design !","Centrally located, overlooking the city and harbour, the Miramar is an excellent hotel; big, luxurious and nicely decorated rooms and very nice and courteous service.
One bad point, the restaurant is not open everyday; this does not allow the Miramar to claim 5 stars, but this is the only bad point !
One of our 2 communicating rooms had an open bathroom space only separated from the bedroom by a big curtain... A designer fantasy, but really not very practical or even good looking !",4,2011,07,18
46,A hotel with a splendid view,"The hotel is built around an old palace from 1920. Despite the isolated location this hotel is not among the quietest in Barcelona. The ships in the harbour below the hotel and music from the hotel restaurant caused some noise through the night.
Our Grand Mediterranean suite was spacious. The promised jacuzzi on the terrace was out of order as all other jacuzzis in the hotel. according to the front desk. The receptionist suggested that we visit the pool instead. 
The hotel's website mentions the jacuzzi so it is apparently giving false information.
The lobby was grandiose and the pool area looked nice. The panoramic views over the city were great. The cable internet was fast. There was no wifi signal in our room.
Because of an early flight we did not any meals at the hotel. 
The personnel was very amiable.",3,2011,07,08
46,Unfortunately we won't be back,"We received a room with balcony with view to the garden almost above the entrance area. During our one week stay we enjoyed daily the sounds of shots (the neighbour of the hotel is a sports shooting ranch) from 9 am to 8 pm - each day even Saturday and Sunday. You could hear those shots also in the very nice outdoor pool area. When we asked the staff of the hotel about it - they told us that the shooting ranch is very far away (...) We ended up not using the nice balcony very much and avoided spending too much time during the day in the hotel (changing the room was somehow not possible even if the hotel was not too crowded). Besides the shots there were constructions in the entrance area that also produced a lot of noise. 
Restaurant and breakfast in the hotel are also overpriced (breakfast € 25,- per person) - compared to the very good food that you can get in the restaurants in the city. But once you are in the hotel there is no alternative as the hotel is situated a bit outside the city centre.
Service personel seemed to be overwhelmed a couple of times and very slow.
For a 5-star hotel the complete package was not satisfying. So all together the great view and nice rooms didn't help it - unfortunately we won't be back.",3,2011,07,05
46,Best Honeymoon experience!,"As our first destination in our honeymoon to Spain :) it was fun we had a room with a balcony, the service was nice and the breakfast was yummy..

Perfect location, walking distance from all major attractions, and not near alot of the noise and distributions..",4,2011,06,30
46,Very Nice Boutique Hotel,"I was actually sent over to the Miramar Hotel by the W Hotel because they were over-booked.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Great rooms - huge, comfy bed, decent sized balcony with chairs, beautiful bathroom with separate tub.  The hotel also has a nice spa with a pool and a decent gym.  
My only problem with this Hotel is the location.  It's NOT in the heart of the city.  Its close to some sites and a metro station.",4,2011,06,05
46,We were tricked!,"We stayed at the hotel during easter. Booked a deluxe room approx 2 months before arrival with a request of having a good view. What we got was a conference room with a temporary bed inside!! The promised things supposed to be in the room did not exist. No towels, no bathrobes, no hair dryer, no stereo, no working refrigerator, no safety box, a view over the hotel entrance (where anyone standing outside the entrance could see us) and more.  We were basically fooled, put into a temporary room, and the staff just tried ignoring and pretending it to be normal. Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel in our opinion! Even if we got a reduction of the bill after a discussion we would not recommend staying at this hotel.",1,2011,05,17
46,"Superb hotel, relaxing environment","We have been at Miramar Hotel for three nights before a cruise in mid April 2011 and we really enjoyed our stay.  Located at the hilltop of the Montjuich Park, the view is spectacular facing the Mediterranean sea. Our Mediterranean suite was, large, clean, quiet and very well appointed.   Restaurant Le Forestier was excellent for the breakfast although it could be better for dinner.  We also appreciated the large garden and pool area.  Because of its superb location, the relaxing environment, the quality of room and service this hotel is really a five stars.",5,2011,05,17
46,Horrible.,"This hotel is horrible. Service is absolute garbage. I was using the day spa.  My locker key fell between the slats of the timber in the sauna and all of my clothing was locked in the locker.  A day spa staff member in the area said she was too busy to get help and that I should go down to the hotel lobby myself, naked but for my towel. She then left. I waited for the next person to use the spa area, who kindly went down to ask for help. It never came.  After TWO HOURS trapped in the day spa I broke the locker door open so I could get dressed. I went to hotel reception to see why help never came - completely disinterested staff advised the maintenance man had gone to do something else and was planning to come along at some stage. I have also uploaded photos of the shower in my room.  It was sickening. These photos should tell you all to NEVER STAY AT THIS HORRIBLE HOTEL. Also it is far from everything.",1,2011,05,13
46,"Amazing Hotel, Great Location.","The hotel Miramar is a beautiful hotel. The location is spectacular, the view over the city is great. 

Our room was a delux, and had a great bathroom (with seperate bath and shower cubical) and the bedroom itself was very spacious. Some people have mentioned the noise coming from the shooting range but this wasn't something that bothered us, we hardly heard it. 
We didn't have time to use any facilities at the hotel but they looked very good.
Our luggage didn't arrive in Barcelona, and the hotel were very helpful. They provided us with additional toiletries. They also tired to contact the airline for us, and called us (on a UK mobile) to tell us that our suitcase had arrived.

Overall, a wonderful experience and we would definitely return.",4,2011,05,10
46,Not as good as expected,"Our high expectations where not met. First of all the breakfast is ridiculously expensive (30 EUR / person). The only reason for this price is probabbly that there is no alternative in the neigbourhood. A la carte breakfast in the room is even more expensive. We opted for one can of coffee with milk to find out is costs 16 euro!! I really donnot mind paying for quality, but this gives me a strange feeling.

Views and roomssize for the suites are great. But sitting outside on the nice teracce is spoiled by continuous loud noise from ferries waiting to leave Barcelona (with engines on).
There is a great spa, but men and women are seperated! I mean what age are we living in???
And as mentioned before, watch out for cabs taking you from the hotel to the aiport. They charge you approx. 10 euro extra...
The weekend was great, the hotel ok (the pool is a nice extra), but as you may notice, the next time we visit Barcelona (once a year) we will look for a different place.",2,2011,05,09
46,Flawed Service,"We did not stay at the hotel; however we had a lot of expectation to try the restaurant. We live in the city and regularly frequent the various eateries in town. 
We elected the sample menu which really is a good idea, however none of the plates were explained by the waiter and when asked what the dish was, the waiter went any and by the time they returned with the information we had finished the food.
Our evening was ruined not necessarily by the restaurant; however we had a 22:00 reservation, specifically ask for a table with a view separate from other tables. Now upon arrival there were 3 other tables occupied in a sixty seat restaurant.  
However 20 minutes into our meal a family entered with young children a 3 year old with an overcharged fire engine and a 5 year old who wasn’t hungry but insisted in running rings around the table, under the table and sliding around the floor. The parents evidently had no interest in the children or the disturbance that was being caused; neither were the waiters or restaurant management.
Finally we couldn’t stand no more and spoke to the waiter; we received a shrug of the shoulders, upon then asking to speak to the head waiter, no apologies, we were simply moved outside into the March night air...
The hotels actions simply ruined the meal for us and brought me back to the fact this is a hotel and not a restaurant therefore the service received was that of a hotel and not what you would expect of a restaurant of its advertised standard. 
The food was correct; the service was of a very basic standard.",2,2011,03,29
46,Lovely stay,"Great hotel,got a good value stay with last minute deal. so we were very pleased when we arived. Great location eventough it was a bit of a stroll from in to town but we managed to get around with the bus turistic that goes outside the hotel every 10 minutes and the cable car down to the one of the beaches wich was a plus. 
The staff was amazing, so pleasant and polite, also good with advise.
So we got a room that was quite big, I was a bit worried at first since it was my first time booking trough last minute and thought maybe I would get a smaller not so nice room , but I was surprised! Fantastic! Our room faced the back of the hotel, were there is a shooting rink of some sort , but its only open from 9 till maybe 6 or7 at night so the positives from that was that you got up in time!Did see that some reviewers thought that was a bit of a problem but it's not that bad.
We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel but the patio outside was amazing, sun beaming down on you whhile having a coffe in the morning from the bar...
The only down side was that as soon as you ordered a taxi trough the hotel wich you kind of have to since there isn't that much traffic around, they charge you  about 30-40 procent more. ex. taxi from air port 24, taxi to airport 40 € so that was abit of grief.
And also the hill is quite big, we didnt bother walking around it .But we did take the telerific to the castle at the top, the experience up and down was nice but I didnt tjink it was worth going up there so save your money and go down to the beach instead with the other cable car.
There is this lunch/coffee/icecream place just next to the cable car wich has a lovely view but eat somewhere else!
Overall we had a lovely stay and would stay in this hotel again , it is so nice after a day in city centre to come up to this lovely relaxing hotel.",5,2011,03,25
46,Amazing hotel - complete relaxation guarenteed,"We booked this hotel through the top secret hotel section on last minute.com making it an absolute bargain which helped. It is the most sumptuous hotel I've ever stayed in from the pool sized bath to the view out of the balcony and the excellent service throughout our stay. There's car parking, indoor pool, sauna, jacuuzi, minibar, room service, CD player, robes, slippers, steam room and it's all just brilliant. Yes it is a little way out of the hustle and bustle of the town and the walk into la Rambla isn't thorugh the nicest streets but a quick and cheap cab ride will see you in the centre of town rapidly, failing that the funicular that connects to the tube is a short walk up the hill. Even though we weren't facing the sea the views were incredablWe didn't have the breakfast included and ended up with pastries and orange juice on the balcony in the morning which was lovely and a lot cheaper than the 20€ per person breakfast the hotel provide. The hotel was in the off season so there was a bit of remedial work going on to the fountain in the courtyard and the outdoor pool wasn't warm enough for a dip but that really wasn't a problem. Although our room wasn't ready when we arrived we left our bags with reception and went to lunch, our bags were taken to our room when it was ready. The olypmic shooting range just up the hill did make a bit of noise but it wasn't that loud and not most of the time.",5,2011,03,01
46,"Ants, bad service and bad value for money","I was there on a business trip and woke up in a bed of ants on my first night (on the fifth floor) No upgrading, no reimbursement, no apology even though the hotel made a lot of money through the event we organised there for our clients. Someone came to bring me a bowl of fresh fruit to apologise without knocking on my door when I was standing there naked. Total disaster. 
The location is brilliant though and the rooms are pretty and large. I guess I was just really really unlucky. :( Complete disappointment.",3,2011,02,24
46,Incredible Views of the Sea and the City of Barcelona,"We stayed at the Miramar Hotel in early January 2011 and really enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is more like a resort with restaurants, lobby bar, indoor and outdoor pool, steam room, hot tub, sauna, etc.  We booked it through a great deal on www.lastminute.uk, although we upgraded from a 'classic' room to a deluxe for 20 Euro per night.  We opted not to take the breakfast at 20 Euros  per person.  The upgrade was well worth it, the views from our terrace were stunning.  Waking up every morning to such a beautiful view of the sea and the city, I really felt like a queen.  The same view at night is breathtaking.  We ate at the lobby bar one evening and the food was of very high quality.  Staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful.  We walked up and down the mountain during the day and took cabs at night into the city.  

We were scammed by the taxi driver that the hotel called to take us to the airport though - the meter came to 22 Euro and he pressed a surcharge button and charged us another 11 Euro (we were told by hotel staff the taxi would be between 22 and 27 Euros).  

My only negative about Miramar is that the jacuzzi and steam rooms were not operating during our stay.  Our room, although very spacious, could use some TLC - stains on the carpet and maintenance in the bathroom.  The toiletries were not replaced throughout our stay.

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to go back!!",4,2011,01,11
46,Fantastic 5 star hotel with amazing views over the city,"This is an absolutely stunning hotel, and possibly the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, certainly the nicest in Europe. The faciliites are superb, and the attention to detail is unreal, with the staff impeccably professional and polite from the moment you walk through the door. We were greeted by one of the receptionist (all of whom are kitted our in chic black suit, shirt, tie) and offered an ice tea and cookies, which is kept fresh at reception all day. We upgraded from classic to deluxe for €40, which I would recommend doing, as the views are simply spectacular from the balcony - you can literally see the entire city! The room has all mod-cons; a wet room shower room, under floor heating, flat screen, cd/radio, awesome furniture on balcony, and ridiculously comfy beds. All toiletries are Molton Brown, and everything is prepared beautifully. Staff are always professional, efficient and helpful. The Spa is amazing, we visited in January and it felt like we were one of about 4 couples staying in hotel - we had jacuzzi, steam room, sauna all to ourselves (probably not the same in high season), and the outdoor pool area is like something out of an architecture magazine! Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try the outdoor pool, but it's a great place to just chill out. The entire hotel has a tranquil, relaxed ambience, and as we sat on our balcony, limousines and tour buses were bringing people up to enjoy the views from the area below the hotel. You are a bit out of the city, but not much (15 min walk) and buses (and the tour buses) go regularly past the hotel and pick up/drop off. On balance it is more than worth it for the luxury you get to enjoy. Negatives? Obviously expensive, we got a good deal off-season, but still paid through the nose for extras (bottled water at €8.80 etc) but that's only to be expected in the premium resorts. No iron and ironing board! Instead a daily service, which didn't help when we need clothes ironed that night! But these are very minor things, Overall this is a hotel we would very highly recommend.",5,2011,01,09
46,not quite up to standard - 4 - 41/2 star at best.,This hotel is not really a 5 star hotel.  We stayed in a junior suite - the views are amazing and the balcony is a great size. The room is lovely if you are staying for a couple of nights on business but not for a romantic weekend away. Everything in the room is looking a little tired and certainly not up to the standard of 5 star hotels I have stayed in previously. Room service food is less than expected - limited menu and not brilliant taste either. We ordered breakfast each morning and received varying quality and varied amounts included in the breakfast. Would recommend for business travel or overnight before departing on a ship.,3,2010,12,16
46,"Stlylish, great views from the hill , but vulnerable to thieves","A stylish hotel in a quiet location, with great views of the harbour and city from its hilltop in Montjuich Park. It is possible to walk down the hill into town. But this location is also the hotel's biggest weakness -  its terraces open out onto a public park, and thieves operate there. Sadly, I know this from first-hand experience - in a classic on-trick on the hotel terrace, a friend was distracted by one thief while another stole hger handbag and ran off with it. The hotel management weren't very interetsed and had to be pressed hgard to bother to look at footage from security cameras. The rest of the day was spent in a crowded police station and rranging a temporary passport at tyhe British Consulate. But that's Barcelona - cool, contemporary and crime-ridden.",4,2010,12,04
46,Just Perfect!,"This hotel really concidered as 5 star Hotel. Breathtaking view to the city, people who are not staying in the Hotel are visiting the area just to enjoy the view. Very stylish & compfotable funiture. Amazing swimming pool. The staff where very helpful, they have changed our room when we weren't comfortable with the opend bathroom. Specious room & very comfortable bed. The closest metro station is 5 min walking from the hotel. Defienetly coming back when visiting Barcelona next time. The Internet is free!",5,2010,11,25
46,great hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Miramar for 3 days before our cruise.  We loved it!!  

We arrived around 11 am, and they had a room available for us, however, it did not have a balcony.  We asked for a balcony room and they told us one would be ready around 3.  We decided to fight our jet lag, and go explore a bit of the city while waiting for our room.  Upon return we were taken up to our room, which was lovely.  Larger than we expected, with a great balcony overlooking the mountain and pool.  We could hear the target range at times, but it didn't really bother us.  (as an aside, the blowdryer in the room was fantastic, full size and powerful!).  

We didn't eat in the restaurant, but we did end our nights with a drink outside the lobby bar.  The hotel has an incredible view overlooking the city and out to the water.  

The staff was exceedingly helpful and polite.  They should have had more than one bartender working the lounge area, as when more than a few people were there, it would be quite a wait for a drink, but that was the only problem we encountered-if it could even be called a 'problem.'  

We thought the location of the hotel was great, but are active and enjoy walking.  There are 2 bus stops almost across from the hotel, if you'd rather ride.  One of them is for the open top tour bus, which is a must do.  The hotel is on a hill, about a 10 to 15 walk into 'town' -we would walk there in the evenings then cab it back.  During the day we'd either walk or hop on the bus.  We thought a morning jog around the castle up the mountain was a great way to begin the day.  

The downside of the location, for us, was there was not an outside snack or coffe bar close by for snacks/morning coffee.  While the hotels coffee/breakfast was good, it was a bit expensive for everyday.  However, the view made it worth it!!",5,2010,11,24
46,great hotel,"I would recommend this hotel for many reasons. Primarily the service and the fantastic views. 

The main shopping area is only 15 minutes walk. Some of the previous reviews would indicate that the hill would be an obsticle, which l admit is quite steep, but certainly not a difficulty,",5,2010,11,11
46,Great Location With Fantastic Views - Top Hotel,"We got this hotel at at a very cheap rate (about £130 per night for 2 people booked about 6 months in advance) and wow what a bargin it was.   It was such a nice stay that it played a big part in making our holiday in barcelona a great few days.  If we are ever back I would like to stay again (if we could get another good deal).

It is located on the side of a hill/mountain and close to the cable car system which goes down to the beach.   The walk from the town to the hotel is a bit of an effort,  but we thought of it as good exercise and anyone with a little fitness will be fine. As it is located close to the city centre I'm sure the cost of taxi up the hill would not be much.

We were upgraded to a room with a great view.  We could see the sea, port and parts of the city.    The room was a good size with decent facilities.  The balcony was also a good size and had two large chairs and a coffee table and still had plenty of space to walk about. 

The hotel looked very stylish and modern.  

The hotel has very nice outside pool lounge area,  and a very well equiped gym.

We ate in the resteraunt twice and found that the food was very tasty and good value.  The staff at the restaurtant were very professonal and pleasent.

In the evening the hotel has a nice relaxed atmosphere and great place to chill out after a busy day sight seeing.

Good points
View from room
Location of hotel
Nice staff
Clean rooms
Gym
Outside pool
Food at resteraurt and service

Not so good points
Indoor pool was not availble as it needed repairing.
Toilet had a slight whiff but nothing to bad.
Breakfast in the bar was expensive.
Just one laptop was available for web access.",5,2010,11,08
46,Fantastic room and great location,"My group of 4 stayed at the Hotel Miramar in Barcelona for just one day before we went on our Med cruise.  We had 2 rooms - one was a bit larger than the other - but both were huge compared to typical European rooms.  The larger one (corner room) had a sitting area with a sofa, table and desk.  The smaller room had a smaller sitting area.  Both had a tub in the room, separated with a curtain that served to separate it from the beds.  It was a bit uusual - not for everyone.  The toilet was in a small room by itself, as was the shower.  If my husband was traveling with my - this would have been perfect - great for a romantice getaway.  However, I was traveleing with my mother (my neices were sharing the other room), so it was a bit awkward when trying to get out of the shower - not very private.  

The location was on a hill with a fantastic view of Barcelona.  We walked to the Hop on Hop off bus stop which was just a block from the hotel.  Taxi service from Las Ramblas to the hotel was only 10 Euros.  The taxi drive to the port cost us 14 Euro for 4 adults with 6 bags of luggage.

I would defintely recommend this very modern contemporary style hotel.",5,2010,10,10
46,Stunning View at an accellent location,"For my work, i always look for a hotel near the marina or port. Halfway up the Montjuic hill lies this beautifull modern building. It is walking distance from the old city with the Ramblas visible from the topfloor rooms and overlooking the port. Walking downhill to the city is always easy, to the port you have to walk around it, and coming back in the evening you might prefer a taxi (less than 10 eur from plaza Real) as it is a steep climb back up. It lies very quiet in the beautifull park, so no disturbance from the noisy city.
I was kindly upgraded to one of the 6th floor suites which has a stunning view over the city and the harbour. The room is modern, beatifully styled, bathroom facilities also roomy and modern. Breakfast buffet is enormous (only some the Mövenpick hotels are better) and staff are friendly, though their english is a bit limited. All in all a great stay, and where i normally just want to get home when a job is done, this time i would not have minded to have to stay a bit longer.",5,2010,10,07
46,Offer advertised is not real,"Both the hotel's ad on Tripadvisor as well as their official website are advertising 135 Euro per night for a 7 days in advance reservation. Tried from both sites, the offer doesn't actually exist, the minimum is 233 Euro/day. Wrote to the hotel several days ago, no reply to this date, which confirms this is false advertising. I think everyone should be aware about hotels using such methods.
It's obvious that more and more hotels rely on TA's traffic to draw guests. But such methods are pathetic just as reviewing your own hotel. Which unfortunately may be the case for many.",2,2010,09,30
46,Not for a relaxing / friendly stay,"We booked this hotel for our 20th wedding anniversary and main holiday due to the description on the hotel's website 

Relaxing retreat
- Tranquil gardens & pool
- Escape to a tranquil retreat
- Refresh body & mind in the outdoor pool

On arrival we have found things to be very different:
- You arrive via a building site
- There is building work going on by the pool
- There is a shooting range infront on the hotel

The shooting range is not mentioned anywhere and shooting typically starts at 9am and is non stop until 8pm every day.

Furthermore on 2 occasions our balcony door was left unlocked by the maid, when we brought this up with reception the girl just said yes, after pointing out that we would like the door locked, she replied why. Our balcony was connected to another room and if things where to go missing from our room our insurance would not have covered if the door was unlocked.

It took the hotel more than 2 weeks to answer our complaint email - the reply did not address all the issues raised!",1,2010,09,22
46,Excellent but with one minor glitch!,"After reading reviews on tripadvisor I booked the hotel Miramar for a 6 night stay!Fortunatly the hotel website was being updated and we booked a suite for 145!1 hour later I recieved an email explaining the mistake and offering us the same suite for 120 plus breakfast a night!We had a wonderful stay!Very luxurious and to anyone who sayds it is a long walk to the city is clearly very unfit!It is literally a 8 minute max at most to La Rambla, while till offering a very secluded and peaceful setting! Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of healthy options!Pool and staff were fantastic!Our one problem was on checkout!Our rate was clearly stated as 120 plus breakfast a night not including tax, little did we know they were only including one breakfast per day ie. we had to pay for the second breakfast everyday, which brought our bill to 100 euro more than expected!We werent happy with this and we feel that it was quite sneaky!They knew that there was two of us and I have never heard of a hotel offering breakfast  for just 1 person!
Other than that we had a wonderful stay!Would reccommend it to friends but would warn them about breakfast!",4,2010,09,11
46,Amazing Views,"Fantastic views with very modern facilities. The pool was closed during our stay but the outdoor area was still accessible and very well maintained during the cooler months. 
I would ask for a room with a balcony and sea views although the rooms overlooking the city are pretty good too. Great breakfast!",5,2010,09,07
46,"Great location, nice hotel","We stayed two nights here. The hotel is great, the views are very scenic (try to get a room with view on the sea). The rooms are nice and well designed. The pool outside is terrific. The prices in the restaurant and bar are rather high and overpriced. Through the hotel you could see some wear and tear, giving the image of the hotel someone would not expect to see that. The service is allright, but some of the staff could be more friendly. If you want to have a great view, there is a small restaurant with a terrace overlooking the harbour and the whole city in the parc in front of the hotel, the food is good, but nothing great, but view is unparalleled.",4,2010,08,15
46,Hotel Miramar was great in every way,We stayed at the Miramar for 2 nights and loved  everything about it.  The front desk was very helpful on all our questions.  The views and area are wonderful.  We mostly used cabs or the tour bus to get around.  Spent time at the pool and ate at the restaurant which we all liked.,5,2010,07,21
46,lovely and relaxing but pricey!,"On arriving at the miramar we were really happy with what we found. The reception staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. The room we had faced the hillside but being an end room had a brilliant view over the cityscape. The bed was massive and the bath almost as big! The shower was the best i've ever used, with a large head on the ceiling of the shower and another adjustable one on the wall and plenty of room for dancing!! There's a good hairdryer and a minibar which u needed to remortgage your house to buy things from but we took out the drink and bought water and beer from the shop down the hill to put in there. You did get a free bottle of water each day though. Room service wasn't so great, the cheaper breakfast options were poor i.e. Wholemeal toast was bread rolls with no butter or condiments, so basically dry bread for £4!! In all the food and drink at the hotel was soooooo expensive, a burger and chips at the pool bar was 19euros! The pool area was very nice though with lots of space, loungers and umbrellas. The hotel is at the top of a very very steep hill, which is ok but in 40 degree heat can be a mission, but we did it and felt great at the top! Miramar is about 15 mins from las ramblas and going down is a nice walk through the streets. There is the cable car from out the front of the hotel which takes you to the beach although again is quite pricey for what it is, but this is a running theme in Barcelona! all in all this hotel is great if you plan to spend some time relaxing by the pool and some time sightseeing, next time i would rather be slightly more central, maybe in the gothic quarter. I really enjoyed my stay here and it was perfect for what we wanted. I would recommend it to anyone but be warned it's quite a pricey stay!!",4,2010,07,19
46,Miramar Hotel on Montjuic in Barcelona,"We had a Carpe Diem moment. We decided the day before to fly out to Barcelona for the night to catch the world cup final in Spain! Although July's Conde Nast Traveller currently has a Barcelona special in whihc the hotels look gorgeous, their choices were all  expensive. Instead we took Tripadvisor's advice and booked into the Miramar, up on the hillside of Monjuic 0.5 miles above the Ramblas. Excellent receptionist = Alexandra. 
Hotel website directions were not great and it was hard to find initially by car. But in the July heat, this was a superb location. The fresh breeze and view of the blue Med immediatley cooled us down and the super stylish pool area was like an oasis in a hot city. 
Arriving there at 12pm we were told that our rooms wouldn't be ready until 3pm, so to use the pool until then. The lunchtime BBQ menu seemed expensive at €35 pp but, as we had decided to spend the afternoon relaxing there poolside, it was infact good value, plenty of high quality food, in a stunning, natural environment (except for the red safety ribbon tape unaesthetically draped around part of the decking area). 
Our beautiful, modern rooms were no. 502 (huge room, double bed, big balcony Marina view) & 505 (smaller room, twin bed but great bathroom & lovely poolside view) and we paid about €90 pppn. The breakfast was really top notch, generous & the coffees are free, although breakfast normally costs €27, which is steep if it's an extra cost. 
Yes, you have to pay a bit more for taxis up and down the hill (€10 across the city) but it's definately worth it for the tranquility and stylish surroundings. 
Having stayed at the very nice Calderon near the Ramblas last time we were there (1998) which was also a good choice of city hotel, the Miramar is in a league way, way above!",5,2010,07,13
46,Another amazing stay!,"Our second stay - and it was just as good as the first. We stayed for 4 nights, 5 days in a Classic room which is excellent value.  The room is large, clean, modern design with a gorgeous bathroom and huge terrace!

The pool area is spacious and beautiful - it feels like you're so far from the busy centre of Barcelona, but your only a short walk down to the Metro to get into town.  The pool bar is expensive for lunch, but worth it to not have to move from your sun lounger all day.  Dishes go from about €4 for bread with tomato to €30 for beef fillet.  Sandwiches with chips are between €12-€16.  Try their desserts - good value at €6, delicious cheesecake!  There is a shop down the road for snacks and drinks though if you can be bothered.

We'll definitely stay again if we head back to Barcelona.  

Recommended restaurant - Cheese Me in El Born - fantastic €20 set menu with fab people-watching tables.",4,2010,07,04
46,Fantastic Barcelona hotel!,"Just back from Barcelona and have to let others know about this lovely hotel, where we stayed for a week.  We found that after a busy day of sightseeing it was so nice to be able to retreat ""up the hill,"" away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We slept very well - not only is there not a lot of outside noise (although you do hear the cruise ships sometimes), the doors and walls are fairly thick, so there's not a lot of interior noise either.  
Views, of course, are outstanding.  Furnishings and interior design are both mod and comfortable - not always an easy combination to find.
Housekeeping staff was one of the best aspects of the hotel - they did a superb job without being intrusive, making up the room around our late morning/sporadic schedule, and providing a nice re-clean/turn down service.  After the first day, when they noticed that a little kid was in the room, they added a plush child-sized robe to our bathroom.  First time we've seen a hotel do that!
Location - it is a bit out of the way.  That has pluses and minuses.  We felt that the views and serenity were worth it.  It is a one block walk to the city bus (#50), so we got transportation cards and used the bus and Metro to get around.  On the way back up to the hotel there is a funicular that takes you from the Metro stop (Paral-lel) to the street that the Miramar is on.  We found that the bus doesn't stop at the funicular stop, so you have to walk the rest of the way.  It's a few blocks, but a pleasant walk, past the Olympic swimming and diving pools that are nice to look at, and of course great city views.  Sometimes going into the city we just walked down to the Metro instead of taking the 50 bus - that's a bit of a walk and there's nothing much to see on those streets once you get off the hill, but it is downhill and not a big deal.
Yes, there were times our room key demagnetized, and the wi-fi was spotty; there was also construction behind the fence near the pool...however the pool and furnishings were gorgeous, and most of the staff seemed to be friendly and helpful, so overall we were very pleased to have picked this hotel.",5,2010,07,02
46,Disappointing indeed,"On arrival, we were upgraded to a junior suite which was nice, clean and spacious.  The views are quite nice, overlooking Barcelona and the port.  However, the overall feel of the place is that its a bit tired - e.g. in our case, balcony door handle snapped leaving us stranded outside with our daughter sleeping inside (the front door to our room failed at the same time - odd!).  Breakfast is a bit pricey but nicely stocked.  Shame about the building works going on literally just behind and above the pool area - hardly peaceful - or would you rather listen to the blaring music from the pool bar that starts up at noon, with rubbish speakers?  Worst sin of all (and you won't believe this) - we asked for a bottle of Rose wine at noon on a Saturday at the pool, and were informed that the hotel had run out (wot, no time to pop down to the shop before noon??) - very poor excuse indeed.  5 star?  Not even close.  Finally, I agree with the other reviewers - the restaurant staff are offhand and surly.",3,2010,06,05
46,awesome view with private outdoor balcony,"From the La Rambla the hotel could be mistaken for some fancy restaurant or a private club, since this hotel sits on the highest hill of mountjuic hill over looking the city and the sea. 
We were staying at another 5* hotel when visiting the mountjuic hill to see the old olympic village that we came across the hotel, that is surrounded by the parks, and decided to go check out the hotel and ask the hotel staff if it was possible to see one of their hotel rooms, I was really impressed with the modern room they showed us and the condition the rooms were in, i have stayed at a lot of 5* hotels around the world and when it comes to hotel rooms I am really picky, i was also very impressed with the washroom and shower, what really blew me away was the outdoor private balcony with the most amazing view of the city and the sea from this height. 
We ended up checking out of the hotel we were staying at and booked 3 days with miramar hotel, we found the staff to be very professional, infact we were traveling with a car and they were kind enough to let us park our car around the entrance of the hotel with no charge, they advised us to not park on the government park property as they would tow the car.
We have booked to stay again at this hotel on june 10th, 2010, for 3 days, one thing is that we did not eat at the restaurants so could not comment about the food. 
The only reason I ended writing this review about the miramar hotel because we received nothing but the best service with always a smile, even from the cleaning staff, maybe the people who writing bad reviews were just some rudy people nitpicking on little things, I can assure you this hotel is located in excellent and safe place and you will really enjoy your stay.",5,2010,05,29
46,Very disappointed....,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and really wish we hadn't.

We paid almost £800 for three nights in a junior suite.  

The service was poor - it felt like you were putting the staff out by checkig in, asking questions, ordering room service etc.  That was our general feeling anyway.  

Having stayed in hotels all over the world of greatly varying standards I was surprised to see no tea and coffee making facilities in the room - a barely stocked but very over priced mini bar we did have though.  Not wishing to pay the overpriced 25euros per person for a continental breakfast I ordered a coffee to the room on our first morning.  It took nearly 40minutes, was a tiny cup of luke warm hot milk rather than coffee and I was charged 4euros for the coffee, 4euros service charge plus tax.  

I also woke that morning to find a note shoved under our door informing us that there would be no water in the hotel between 3pm and 7pm.  

Being on our honeymoon one of our best men had arranged a slap up meal for that evening at a restaurant he had (because needed) booked almost 2 months in advance. With a table booked for 8pm, I enquired at the hotel reception if the water would definately be back on by 7pm as I would need a shower in order to go out that evening.  I was met by the same not bothered attitude and after a 5 minute wait at reception was told it ""probably would be back on by 7pm, but there was no guarantee"".  Helpful.

We were lucky enough that the restaurant were more understanding and managed to move our booking to our second night.  So we went out for the day and did not return to the hotel until well after 11pm.  All in all though it was a big inconvenience when your on your honeymoon staying in a supposed 5* hotel.

The sun canope over our balcony was broken and could not be extended which made the balcony too hot to sit out on.

Also a bit disappointing was the hotel made NO reference to our marriage or why we were staying at the hotel at all.  They were fully aware that we were travelling to Barcelona on our honeymoon and although I'm not sure what I was expecting I didnt expect nothing!  We mentioned it to the receptionist when we checked in and she just smiled and carried on typing into her computer.  To say congratulations would have been nice!  

Good points are the pool area - although small it was stunning and a real sun trap with amazing views.  The view over the marina from our balcony was amazing too.  The bathroom in our suite was probably the best bit - a massive free standing bath and huge walk in shower.

But is a shower and a nice view worth the money - and the walk up that hill?!?!?!  I am afraid it isnt.  I'd save your money and stay somewhere else....",2,2010,05,20
46,Awesome View,"Generally we like this hotel and would return.  it was a bit of a mixed bag in terms of the good and the bad.

Pros:  Hotel was very nice and modern.  The staff spoke pretty, good engish and were always friendly.  We had a large room with an amazing view from our balcony.  Thanks to the french rail workers we arrived at 3 am and the staff was incredibly kind and helpful even at that time of the mornng.  The rooms had modern technology, including free wireless interne. There is a Barcelona tour bus stop right outside the hotel and the hotel will sell you discountd tickets so if you plan to do that activity it is very convenient.  The gardens surrounding the hotel are beautiful as is the accompanying view all the way around the property.  There are a couple restaurants across the gardens overlooking the port, neither of which are very good but the view is unbeatable.  

Cons:  The hotel is at the top of a hill so to get to the port and most of the attractions in town you have to go down the hill - the bad part is the return hike up that monster of a hill.  The lesson:  take a backpack with everything you will need for the day.  After 3 or 4 trips up and down that hill we were beat and we are both in pretty good shape.  The hotel is a pricey for what you get, especially the express breakfast, which will get you about 2 croissants, a cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice for 10euros.  Also, the restaurant is really mediocre and overpriced.  I think they are trying to make it seem better than it is by requiring reservations.  This was funny to us because when we entered the restaurant there were only two other tables occupied.  After a leisurely 2+ hour dinner with drinks and dessert, the place was still half empty.  The biggest disappointment we had was a 50 euro charge to check out 2 hours after noon.  Seems like this should be a courtesy (especially when we were there becuase the volcano ash halted all air traffic so its not like they had many incoming guests).    When we were checking out a couple of brits were literally yelling at the front desk staff about some incident with their laundry. The staff handled the situation pretty well.  Not sure who was right and who was wrong but no redress was offered to the angry couple.",5,2010,05,08
46,Very good! Just a little short of being exceptional,"We travelled in a big family of 3 generations, and took 4 rooms, from a Junior Suite to a Deluxe, and a Standard Room. None of us had anything to complain about during our 3 night stay.

From the entrance, you are immediately impressed by the interior design by the local architects. And the hotel never disappoints with its interiors. Suffice it to say that all the 4 rooms were quite different from each other, and none of us was disappointed. Everything in the rooms was perfect - beds, living areas, bathrooms, amenities, etc.  The view over the city and the port area is nothing short of stunning. The jacuzzis were, however, not in all the rooms, and all of them were tented. I'm not sure whether we needed to ask for it, or it was out of service - we didn't feel like taking an outdoor jacuzzi in early April anyway :)

The hotel staff was always attentive and helpful, answering all possible questions and recommending things around the city.

On to the downsides.
The outdoor pool is really quite small, but the view from the sun deck is terrific.
The breakfast is too expensive to my mind. But we found that ordering coffee with yoghurts and a basket of paistries in the room was quite enough for the beginning of the day, and costed less than a half of a breakfast price for 2 people. You have plenty of breakfast options in the city anyway.
The location is both the hotel's strong and weak side. The view is absolutely fantastic, and the area is very quiet compared to Ramblas area for example. But it is quite far away from the city center. The air tram doesn't help much because from its next station there is still a lo-o-o-ong walk to the center. And the foot path is quite steep and about a mile long. We ended up using taxis for our trip around the city. Alternatively, you can use a day ticket for a sightseeing bus that stops right in front of the hotel. Montjuic area also offers quite a lot of sightseeing and pleasant walking.
The hotel's restaurant is not really good. You'd be better dining off in the city.
The final downside was the taxi to the airport. For some reason it costed us about twice more than the taxi from the airport to the hotel. It may have nothing to do with the hotel staff, but I've seen other reviewers here suggesting that the price difference was attributable to the commission for calling a taxi. It was no big deal, but I'd rather have my extra 20 euro with me.

All in all we were very satisfied with our stay at Miramar (and a good discount for early booking quite added up to this!). But maybe it was also because we realized the pluses and minuses before booking it. For views, quietness and good interiors, this is your choice in Barcelona. For business trips, or being in the center of city life, you might be better with more centrally located hotels.",5,2010,05,04
46,"Fabulous, fabulous, fablous","Hotel Miramar is exceptional.  From the reception checking in to the beautiful room, the area surrounding the hotel and I could go on and on....   I booked the standard room which is located on the backside of the hotel with a view of the garden and limited view of the city. If I ever return I would get a front facing or side room as we are balcony/view people but even though, we were not disappointed.  And, the back facing rooms also can hear the shooting range which is located on the hill behind the hotel. It sounds like a nail gun going off often, but so what as everything else is prefect. The room was spacious and  comfortable with a nice balcony and the bathroom was BIG. Giant shower with 2 shower heads and a separate bathtub.  There is a flat screen tv (which we never turned on) a radio w/cd player, a sofa, desk and nice patio furniture also. you are 1/2 blk from the hop on-hop off bus, local city bus and taxis.  If you go to the city by foot it is a 12 minute walk to Las Rambles.  If you are a runner or walker you couldn't be in a better location to walk the paths up to the Castle on top of the hill with the most beautiful views of Barcelona.  You are steps away from the arial tram.  Hint: at the arial tram there is an observation platform with a place to get coffee and something to eat as the hotel coffee and food is expensive.  
Bring your own hair conditioner as they do not provide this (nor did the other hotel we stayed in) and the blow dryer they provide is the best I have used anywhere. 
If you are staying here pre cruise you can watch your ship come in as the hotel also overlooks the port.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,05,01
46,Lovely hotel - Shocking room service!,"A lovely hotel with beautiful gardens and rooms. Only problem I had was the room service was awful. I ordered a pasta dish which was very disappointing. Looked like something that had been zapped in a microwave for 3 minutes. Also, EVERYTHING comes at a cost. I asked for some hot water and received a bill for 3 Euros. Also, dont expect to get an iron / ironing board. Staff were very friendly though.",4,2010,04,19
46,"Nice room, poor location and noisy.","Positives room was spacious and luxury fittings, service was fine, express breakfast at £10 was fine
But view from balcomy was over the reception area and firing range which was noisy from early till late 7 days a week.  Indoor pool was tiny, spa was seperated into male and female with no connection allowed which made a romantic trip pointless.  No coffee etc in room was disappointing to.  Worst of all was location, billed as 10 minutes to city which it was but this was through the worst back streets of the city sex clubs etc.  Ended up spending a fortune on taxis to get to the city.  Book somewhere near Port Olympic or Gothic Quarter and give this overpriced hotel a miss.",3,2010,04,15
46,Amazing Stay... perfect start to our cruise!,"My husband and I stayed here one night prior to a 1 week Mediterranean cruise. The rate was a mere 90Euro and upon check-in, were told that no rooms were available and that we would be upgraded. We were upgraded to a fabulous 3 room suite overlooking the Med! The service was amazing -- staff was very welcoming, helpful, and bi/trilingual. 

The location cannot be beat! You are overlooking the city on the mountaintop of Montjuic Park. It was absolutely beautiful and felt like we were tucked away in a state park instead of in the middle of Barcelona. Just steps from the hotel is the entrance for the cable car which will take you down to Barcelona Beach. 

The indoor pool and spa are very nice. Relax and enjoy the amenities! 

I cannot wait to go back to Barcelona to stay here again. We absolutely loved this hotel!!",5,2010,03,16
46,Does not deserve the 5 stars,"Hotel is located on Montjuic hill. While view is awesome and location is great (15 min walk from La Rambla), really below expectation for a 5 stars.
The room had a bad smell coming from bathroom, insects crawling ... At the bottom of the hill is the harbor of Barcelona - this makes hotel noisy day and night.
Otherwise breakfast is very good and gym also good.",2,2010,02,28
46,Fantastic but pricy hotel.,"A great hotel that looks odd from outside, but when you get in your room you really appreciate the view over Barcelona and the harbour, couldnt get any better!

The staff was most wonderful and truly dedicated to serve in most pleasent way. The room was fantastic, a modern but still contemporary. The gym was a positive supprise, but the surroundings offer great outdoor cardio excercise (try the running path aound the castle). 

Wonderful stay, which I and my wife will remember always.",5,2010,01,26
46,THE most OUTSTANDING HOTEL!!!!,"The hotel sits on top of the highest hill in Barcelona and over looks all of the city and the sea.  We found EVERY aspect of this hotel to be simply of the highest quality.  The hotel and rooms themselves are stunning and the facilities are amazing.  There is an outdoor pool overlooking the sea, an indoor pool with a two story wall of cascading water, spa facilities, saunas, and a fitness center.  There is a restaurant in the hotel that was amazing for a special dinner and we highly recommend afternoon drinks (local beers) and tapas at their bar lounge, which has a beautiful seating area.  Finally, we can not stay enough good about the staff of the hotel.  Whether it be the front desk, the bell person, the spa personnel, or the restaurant staff--THEY ALL WERE THE VERY BEST AND MOST PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE.  The staff was both pleasant and SO helpful and most speak 3 or more languages.
This is an amazing hotel and we can not possibly recommend it strongly enough.",5,2010,01,06
46,"Nice rooms, terrible service, below average food & beverage","I am currently staying in the hotel as part of a business trip. The good things first: I am staying in a standard room and they are nicely decorated, with a spacious bathroom and bedroom and a high quality finish. 
Like: non-alcoholic drinks in the minibar free; free wifi. 
Dislike: no evening turn-around service, no shoe-shine service, no shoe cleaning sponge in the room, used up Kleenex not filled up several days in a row

Whilst the rooms are nice and the decor of the hotel is very funky, the service is terrible. There is no one around to look after guests in the lobby bar (I ALWAYS had to go looking for someone to order AND ask for the bill as no one ever stayed behind the bar). The same terrible service occurred during breakfast. Only one person was responsible for the entire breakfast buffet and table service. I had to get up and request coffee and then get up again and ask for milk. The variety and quality of the buffet is poor. For EUR25 per person, only scrambled eggs were offered (which were overcooked and stale), no fried eggs, no eggs benedict. Overall, not worth the money and more disappointingly, the service was totally inadequate. 

This is a real shame as the hotel fails to live up to SLH standards. It certainly does not fulfil five star standards from the F&B side or the service. Stayed at La Florida in Barcelona before, which had very average service too, but still scored more highly than this.

PS - the steam room in the spa was out of order and the indoor swimming pool smelt strongly of stale water. Totally unacceptable.",2,2009,11,19
46,Beautiful and unique hotel - awesome views,"We stayed here on our honeymoon and enjoyed the hotel and pool very much.  Location is a bit more remote than other hotel options (set in the mountains), but provides a great reprieve from the busy city, and it's pretty easy to get in the city -- either walking or taking a taxi.  The views are incredible.  We stayed on the top floor corner room and could see the entire city from our balcony.  Good service.  And free fantas in the mini-bar!
Pool was quiet and relaxing.  Recommend.",4,2009,11,18
46,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Miramar for our honeymoon the night prior and the night after our cruise. This beautiful hotel sits atop a hill, overlooking the pier one side and a view of the courtyard on the other. 

We arrived tired and jetlagged, hours before check-in was to occur, but our room was ready and waiting for us. The rooms are very large by European standards with a large closet, with safe, comfortable bed and couch and desk. Bathroom has raining showerhead and very modern tub. The decor couldn't have been any cleaner - everything was perfect. 

Staff was quite friendly - greeting us at the door - walking us and our luggage to our room. We asked for directions to La Rambla, which is a short walk down the hill and maybe 10 minutes walk on street level. We took a taxi home at night and found rates to be reasonable - taxi from airport to hotel around 30 euro and from La Rambla & Gaudi's exhibits around 10-15 euro. 

Their internet was free, which was a nice touch in getting ahold of people at home. They have two laptops available, that we never had to wait for. One computer was in and out of wireless service, but once we asked the staff to fix the problem, it was taken care of within minutes.

Our final day there was a Sunday, which means a lot of restaurants (including the hotel's) are closed, so the front desk helped us with making reservations at a local restaurant. I've read plenty of reviews that make the hotel staff out to be inconsiderate and so, but we never had a problem. I'm used to five star hotels (Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, etc.) and I would mark this hotel right up there with it's beauty and ease in getting around town. Really made for a pleasurable experience in Barcelona.",5,2009,11,12
46,Good Hotel but poor service!,"I stayed for 3 nights with my husband and 2 sons. Hotel was nice and that was all!

 Service was not great...room service trolley was left outside the room for over 24 hours in spite of reminding them at least 4 times!

Too much chlorine in the in-door swimming pool, my husband`eyes almost popped out! Free internet did not work. Reception staff friendly and nice.",3,2009,11,02
46,Beautiful location.,"We stayed at Hotel Miramar in July 2009 with our small children.  The hotel is located in Montjuic park above the city and boasts amazing 180+ degree views of the city and the Mediterranean.  We stayed for 3 days prior to a cruise with our 3 small children. Our parents and some friends from London also stayed at the hotel so we were able to see several rooms.  

The hotel is located just above the city and it is about a 7-10 minute walk down into the center of the city.  Our 3 year old was able to walk into the city with ease, but we took a taxi back up the hill. (Tip: Taxi's in Barcelona only hold 4 people so we had to split up and take two unfortunately.  It cost us about $10-15 per taxi to get back up to the hotel.)  The hotel is located within a large public park with many beautiful walking trails. It is also located right next to the Fenicular (Sky tram) which you can take down to the sea. 

The hotel is very neat, clean and modern.  I do not think you will find a better bathroom in any hotel in Europe.  We were able to get rooms that joined by a short private hallway.  The original rooms we had were farily small with lovely balconies that looked over the city and the Mediterranean.  Unfortunately the battery on our adjoining door ran out so we had to be moved.  We were disappointed to lose our view, but the ground level rooms they gave us did not dissappoint. One had a very large deck that must have been over 700 square feet and the other room was very large- probably 700 square feet as well.  All the Superior view rooms are a bit smaller than the ""delux"" rooms.  The hotel is built into the hill and many of the rooms also come with private hot tubs.

There are two pools: one indoor and one out.  They have bar and lunch service at the outdoor pool during the day. It is a large pool with lots of grass around it and nice lounge chairs and tables.  The have a nice breakfast, but it is $25 Euros.  They have a smaller coffee/pastries option for 10 Euros.

The staff was very friendly and English speaking. They made sure that we were taken care of and were very nice to the children.  Check in time was later in the afternoon, but when they saw us arrive at 8am with 3 jet lagged kids they put us in a room as soon as one opened so the kids could sleep.  

If you want to be in the hussle and bussel of the center of the city, this is not the hotel for you. If you want to be in a position to take in the sheer beauty of the area this hotel is great!  We will definately stay here when we come back.",5,2009,10,21
46,Great Start and Finsih for the vacation,"Very short ride between the hotel and the Airport, even closer to the pier the cruis ships have the terminals on.
We did 2 seperate stays, 2 days before the cruise and 2 days after, before returning home- the latter during the Columbus Holiday - ANOTHER STORY!.
Anyway, we had a ""Superor Suite"" for the start, and once we got past the ""She She"" accomodations as the wife called them things could not have been better.
Private balcony surounded by green hedges tall enouogh to ensure privacy. Huge bed and sitting area, larger bathroom facility with a shower bnig enough for 3 people. the closets and changing area being in the rear of the suit was a bit odd to us.
The restraunt was devine, even if their hours didnt conform to our US ideas; but room service covered anything we wanted and during our second 2 day stay, was even beter then what we had in the restraunts localy during the day. The view from the restraunt espicaly if your dinning outside is the thing you read about in romance novels.
The staff is not only profesional in their work, they are knowldegable, and helpfull beyond anything I would have expected at some of the finest hotels in the USA; even seeming to want you to be happy and know they are happy working there.  Right dwon to the staff member we stumbled onto down on the lower level laundry, whiel we were stumbeling around and got sort of lost outsdie and had to re-enter through a back door.
The cost is a bit high for my taste but in the end it was more then worth it considering the second hotel that the Mirmar staff rescued us from on a Sunday afternoon.
The hotel sits on top of the Miramar mountain, with the rooms in the front overlooking the harbor. The park along the mountain side is quaint and serene - pleasant to walk in the late evening.
The spa, jacuzzi, and indoor pool were excelent, and even if a bt small from what we are normaly used to, they were more then enough for us while we were there.  The outdoor pool looked like a prize but it was simply too cold for us to venture out there.
The entrance to the hotel is a bit hidden from the road and the park, but it has a quaint little court yard that was easily acesable.  The 2 major tour buses in Barcelona both go right past the hotel but only the Blue line has the city divided into 3 loops with the red loop having a stop right across the street (2 mnute walk if that).  The bus ticket allow for free transfers between all 3 loops, and unlimited on and off during the day, making shopping even more fun as well as providing some nice information about the city as you go round about.  Having the Miramar to come back to as we came to the end of a given day was almost as good as going home. Everything down to the towels was well portion, prepared and placed to please.
We are planning a return trip for when the Family church (Gaudi) is completed, and we will most definetly stay at the Miramar.",4,2009,10,20
46,Very helpful staff,"I booked the Miramar after reading many mixed reviews of other Barcelona hotels, and was not disappointed with my choice.  The facility was spotless, the rooms spacious with trendy decor, the pool and spa area also pleasant and relaxing (although no 'couples' hot tub).  The bed was fabulous (especially by Spain's standards; usually hard beds); I suffer from hip bursitis, so this was a very imporant issue for me.  When I inadvertantly left my camera in the room upon a 6:00 am departure, they expedited in forwarding the camera by courier (COD; very affordable) to our next stop in Spain.  All staff were kind, friendly and courteous.  The only down side was poor allocation to restaurants, the ""one down the hill"" being closed, as was the one on-site,  when we returned back from our day's adventure.  However, happily we caught a bar/snack restaurant on the Miramar Park patio that was still open, where the food & drink was excellent and ambiance 'local'.  Lastly, I suffer an allergy to perfume/cleaners, and I am happy to say that there was no perfume/chemical odour to our room.  A very  nice experience overall.",4,2009,10,20
46,100% recommended,"I took my partner here for his birthday and honestly couldn't fault this hotel.  The room was immaculate with fresh towels everyday, the bed is huge and the minibar was refreshed daily.  
The food and drink was abit pricey but nothing more than you would expect.  The bus turistic stop is at the front of the hotel offering a hop on hop off service, the cable car station is towards the rear of the hotel so transport wasn't an issue. (the rambles is easily within walking distance) and when all public transport has finished for the day a taxi from downtown back to the hotel was a max of 10 euro.  The staff were friendly spoke good english and made us feel very welcome. I would definatly recommend this hotel.",5,2009,10,16
46,"Tranquil, modern and convenient","This hotel seems to have been a severe disappointment to some people, but my experience of staying there was really  very good.  It is in Montjuic, described as ""the lung of Barcelona"", so you can expect fresh air, space, and relative tranquility, with only the distant hum of the harbour in the background.  It is cool, modern
 but comfortable,  and the staff were indeed young but  very efficient nonetheless.  Heard no guns or slamming doors.  You need to be intrepid and tackle the funicular which is about a five minute walk away and that takes you down to Parallel metro station and joins you up with the very efficient metro network.  It is extremely straightforward.  1.35 euros (or your debit card)  in the machine at the funicular station and a single ticket takes you anywhere across Barcelona.    Also you can pay on the buses rather than  having to organise tickets beforehand, but there are very good deals to be had on books of tickets at the tourist kiosks.  We did the Bus Turistica, which takes you on one of two routes around the city (if you want to see the bally football stadium you need the red one, otherwise the blue route is best) and as always it's a great way to get your bearings and see some of the amazing buildings.
Loved it all: beach great, sightseeing sensational, people delightful,  food great.  Except, I would have to say, the 'menu del dia' in the Miramar hotel which was very dreary indeed.
The a la  carte food was very  good, except for the sandwiches in the bar which were repellent.   Saw the pools, and yes  the grouting is a bit grubby in the outdoor one, but if it was 95 degrees I don't suppose I'd care a jot.  It's in a very pleasant garden with sea views etc.  Had an amazing egg-shaped bath in the bedroom, a huge bed, lovely crispy sheets.  So if peace and quite and comfort matter, and you like a bit of fresh air, go for it.",4,2009,10,08
46,"Excellent Room, Great Service","We arrived after being spoiled on our 12 day Mediterranean  cruise.  I had booked a room on Expedia, and wasn't sure what kind of room we would get.  Alejandra, our check-in clerk was very courteous, professional, and competent.  Since we arrived around 10 A. M.  after disembarking from our ship, our room was not ready.  She did offer the use of the spa and pool, and helped us with additional orientation for sightseeing in  the area. The room we had, #407, was exactly like the rooms shown on their website. The room and bathrooms were clean, comfortable and trendy.  Sodas and water in their refrigerator were complimentary-- a welcome refreshment after wandering the streets of Barcelona in the summer!

As others have mentioned, the hotel is out of the way, as it is the Montjuc area.   Cabs were easy for us to get-- usually no more than a 5 or 10 minute wait.  The front desk staff  made the calls for us.  Occasionally, there is a cab sitting outside the hotel, but note that if you need to have a cab called, the cab charges for the distance it has to travel to get to the hotel.  We did not mind having to pay for a cab, since our rate on Expedia  was such a good one.   You can, if you want, avoid taxis if you take one the double decker tourist buses that stop half a block away from the hotel.  Be aware however, that some of these buses go in a single direction on their circuit before they come back toward this hotel. 

As mentioned by other TripAdvisor reviewers, the breakfast buffet is expensive-- 25 euros.  I would agree that this is not great value if you are traveling and converting back to U.S. dollars.  Breakfast was satisfying, however, and had we not enjoyed the food on our cruise so much, we might have enjoyed more of the breakfast buffet.  The view from the patio as the sun rises is gorgeous.  Our waitress was also kind enough to find us some boxes we could use to pack some of the we knew would not fit in our luggage.   

I did go out to use the pool.  I was a bit surprised to be told by the pool attendant/bar waiter that if I wanted more than one towel, I would have to pay extra.  I looked into the pool and thought the pool grout needed cleaning.  I ended up having a drink from the bar and reading the Financial Times instead of going into the pool.  

I liked the fact that this hotel was not in the middle of the city.  I valued the peace and tranquility the hotel offered. I would recommend this hotel for business travelers who need a respite from the city.  I travel on business and thought that this hotel would be good for a senior executive group.",4,2009,09,05
46,Beautiful hotel - horrible service!,"Stayed 4-9 July 2009, superior room #502
The hotel has a wonderful setting with a beautiful view of Barcelona and the sea! The décor is magnificent; modern and tasteful with warm colors. Our room was large and modern, tastefully decorated and comfortable with a big terrace overlooking Barcelona and the sea. Bathroom was huge with center bathtub and separate shower. The pool area is great with comfy sun loungers, BUT too few chairs which is very strange since there is plenty of space. The gym was very good with modern equipment. So PHYSICALLY this hotel has all the parameters to be a 5 star luxury hotel, however it fails completely on its poor service and their lack of interest for their guests!!

We had booked a romantic package through SLH which included buffet breakfast, “candle lit” dinner for two, special bubble bath, bottle of Cava and strawberries with chocolate in the room upon arrival and a welcome drink on arrival. 
No welcome drink was offered. Nor was there any Cava or strawberries in the room (but was brought up to us later when we asked the reception). When we arrived we requested dinner reservation on the terrace at 10.00 but was told only available time was a 9.00. As we thought it was a busy evening we accepted it but was astonished to see an empty restaurant when we arrived. We didn’t even get a table on the terrace since they claimed it was already fully booked (which we were not told about earlier). Interior of restaurant pretty dull so we had to re-scheduled the dinner for another evening with a guaranteed terrace table. Miramar is not quite in the centre of town and there are no nearby restaurants, so we ended up having our dinner in the hotel bar (which wasn’t an overwhelming experience).  The “special” bath in our package was never presented during our stay. Package also included free soft drinks in room mini bar and on arrival we requested it to replenish with water, which never happed despite the promise.

We sent an email to the GM explaining about all these issues and asked why the hotel offered the package when they were unable (unwilling?) to deliver? We never got a reply.
 
More issues: 
- The air-condition didn’t work properly and only after several requests (and promises) we were informed maintenance was only carried out during weekdays. When it was fixed 2 days later we could not put temperature above 16 degrees, so choice was freezing or sweating. When we spoke to reception about this they only laughed. 
- The service around the pool was inadequate. Cleanliness much the same. Arrived around 10.00 in the morning to the pool area and towels, bottles and glasses from previous day hadn’t been removed. Astonishing! 
- Hotel’s turn down service wasn’t regular.
- To get a taxi was a laugh! The hotel seemed to have some sort of deal with one taxi company and it would take between 15-30 minutes to get a car despite there was a long line of taxis in queue 2 minutes drive down the hill on pl de la Carbonera! 
- The service in general was really bad and slow. No smiles, no greeting, no one to take your luggage upon arrival etc. Apart from one very nice and friendly waitress in the bar/restaurant who was flabbergasted to hear our story and tried her best to improve our disastrous experience.
- Concierge... well don't think they know the meaning...

It is a real shame the GM (and owners) of this hotel lack a complete interest to maintain a good relationship with their guests and running a hotel with such a low service standard. We would definitely have stayed here again if it wasn’t for the complete ignorance. As mentioned, the physical aspects and the setting of the hotel are magnificent! Pity!",2,2009,08,26
46,A different opinion about the service,"I am writing this review because I really want to defend Miramar hotel of its service!
We have stayed for 4 nights. We used a lot the room service which was really quick & of high quality. We have once dinned at the restaurant were the service was slightly slow but professional and quite friendly. Staff should work a little bit on the English language!
 
Overall the hotel is really nice. Great views, very nice rooms, modern furnished and a really big bath! We had the chance to have a room on the sixth floor: Room 605 is highly recommended: huge veranda with deck chairs and Jacuzzi combined with breath taking views of Barcelona made our stay wonderful. The location is great if you are about to visit the city from May to October, so as to take advantage of the pool, or else choose a hotel closer to Plaza Cataluña
Do not hesitate to visit this place, is value for money and reaches high standards",4,2009,08,26
46,Unscrupulous hotel that has gone to customer service ruin,"I took 50 people to the Miramar in June. I would never recommend it to anyone. The hotel looks from all marketing material almost perfect and as long as you don't value customer service, helpful staff, security of your possessions or any amenities. It seems like someone designed it well and then left it to be fall to ruin. 

It would have been good to enjoy the spa, which looked great on the website but the steam room and jacuzzi were both broken. One place there was fresh running water was through the roof of the corridor outside and the roof just inside our room. Hardly the same. It just seemed as if they never thought to maintain the place. That is just one area of their obvious understaffing.

Staff are there. If you can find them. Having to go into the restaurant every time you wanted a drink to find someone to come out and stand behind the bar was a little frustrating. It would have been lovely to have a drink at the pool but they won't come to you or serve to the pool. No, you have to go and wander around the restaurant in the hope of snagging someone who may begrudgingly man the bar and give you a tray to take drinks out yourself. There is a bar at the pool but it was 'shut today' every day we were there. 

The staff seemed almost annoyed that they had to talk to us. Not in a French way, which is sometimes cool but an awful, nonchalant, couldn't give a damn way. That also extended to the reception staff, the concierge (or lack thereof) and the assistant manager. This was exemplified by their attitude to the fact that three of our cars were broken into in the car park during our stay. The assistant manager immediately attempted to absolve the hotel of any blame, first by denying it was their car park (it's the one between the hotel sign and the hotel on a private road a few feet from the front door...hmmm). She then told me we should have parked in the indoor car park. We were on a rally so we took 30 cars, they could not accommodate this. Added to which, the entrance to the garage was steep and unusable to cars with low fronts. She them said that was because we should have told the reception staff we had a car (we arrived at a specific desk for a car rally). No one advised of it's existence on arrival. 

When I suggested that, having had a car broken into at a 5* hotel, the staff should notify other guests, she shrugged her shoulders. Even after a car had been broken into late evening, it took members of the group to tell each other and all have to be woken up to move their cars closer to the front door for security's sake. She claimed it wasn't the hotel's job to notify guests of such things.

To add insult to injury, on arrival home it became apparent they had overcharged us for our stay. 

Never stay here.",1,2009,08,19
46,I suggest you read this before staying at the Miramar,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Miramar and it almost met all of our expectations. Views were amazing, rooms nice and clean and out of town enough that it was quiet but not too far out that it takes too long to get to. An 8 EU taxi ride will get you to the hotel. If you want a hotel that is quiet and a good place to escape to then this is a nice hotel. 

The big issue with this hotel is management and front desk staff. I recommend you read the rest of this review choosing to stay here to make sure you avoid our situation. 

Although we booked and paid directly with the hotel 6 months prior to arriving, we were told upon arriving that they had not received our booking and that they had therefore made arrangements for us to stay at another hotel. They then put us into one of their sister hotel in the middle of the city. The other hotel was very disappointing. We managed to get back to the room we should have been in the next day. In the end it seems that they have a habit of over booking, swapping you to other hotels owned by the chain. The hotel manager managed to hide from us for the next 4 days and the front desk staff continued to lie about anything we asked and suggested that even though reservations had sent us an email confirming our stay it was not part of their system.

So if you want to stay at hotel Miramar I highly recommend the following. After booking send an email directly to the hotel and state in the email that you are aware of what they did to the Burns Family during their stay from July 25th to the 29th . That you want an email confirming that you have a booking and that the hotel front desk will know about it when you arrive. Also ask for confirmation that you have a room with a view of either the city or port. It is only by letting them know that these unacceptable actions are now known by everyone that the hotel may change its approach to treating people with respect. Do not expect management to sort our issues when you are there.",2,2009,08,08
46,excellent by all means,"great hotel, excellent location with great views overlooking the sea and barcelona.  great value with advance purchase price. 
the room itself is top class 5 star hotel. bed excellent, big and confy with first class sheet/pillow etc. nice flat LG tv, cd player and 3 jacob jensen phones in the room(overall modern room). small sitting area and nice balcony. the bath is top class as well, all tabs,shower..etc are hansgrohe and the rest is villary and boch(excellent brands) the shampoo etc are Molton brown. all soft drink mini bar are free of charge. wireless internet is free(I'm using it now to write the review) but you need to get code from reception every day). haven't tried restaurant but room service is excellent and Ok price(about right) we had breakfest in the room every morning but there is buffet for 25 euro down stairs.
the spa,gym are nice with indoor and outdoor pools. small size but if you are to relax rather than train for the olympics, it should be fine for you.
we have little baby so they had a crib ready for us before check in.
taxis are plenty (7-10 euros to la rambla and plaza catalunia, 20 to the airport and about 14 to sagrada familia). bus turistic blue line stops about 1 minute away from the hotel and teleferic to the sea side is 1 minute as well.
room very clean and chage towels twice a day.
I was worried when few complainedit wasn't five star treatment, I'm sure they are fussy peolpe(  i usually stay at IC hotels, hilton, westin ...etc and this one has same and even better service in some aspects). initially, I booked at Le Meridien at La rmbla but later  changed as I thought we wanted to enjoy view and pool and we are more than happy that we did.",5,2009,07,25
46,"Nice hotel, NO CONCIERGE!!!","We (husband & 16 year old daughter) stayed at this beautiful hotel for 6 nights.  The location is a little out of the center--up on Montjouic hill.  It is a 2 minute walk to the subway which gets you into the core (Plaza Catalunya) in 15-20mins.  The walk into the city is on a dirt path that is littered with broken bottles and some homeless people camping out, but if you venture that way, you'll get to Las Ramblas in 15 minutes. You generally have to call for a taxi as it is quite secluded, and it takes a bit of time for one to arrive. The staff are all VERY YOUNG--no one seemed beyond late 20's or early 30's which would have been fine, BUT they were not knowledgeable about restaurant recommendations or about events happening in the city.  There is no concierge to help you with requests of any sort.  Aside from that, the rooms were very nice, modern and large.  Ours had a small balcony and great view of the Mediterranean, although the room did smell a little musty.  Our daughter's room was a little more expensive, but larger, with a huge balcony without a view.  The pools are gorgeous as is the area around the outdoor pool. There is one computer in the ""business centre"" but it is not often available. Thus overall very nice, but not 5 star when it came to services.   The price is definitely right!",4,2009,07,21
46,"Bounas Noches"" :)","That was a great experience for Catalunya. The hotel was comfortable, staff were friendly. I recommend this hotel for happy hours:)",4,2009,07,17
46,Beautiful hotel with friendly staff and immaculate grounds,"Unfortuntely we arrived the hotel at 10 pm and had to leave at 7 am the following morning. we wish we could have stayed longer because the hotel was so beuatiful and we would have enjoyed relaxing by the gorgeous pool or getting a spa treatment. The staff were excellent and friendly. The room was quite large, modern and clean with a outdoor patio. Many of the rooms looked to have balconies that overlooked the city and/or ocean. The landscaping was immaculate with a wonderfully designed pool and outdoor lounging area. The outdoor dining areas had magnificent views over the ocean. The only issue is location. You'll have to take a cab to get into the heart of the city but if you are interested in just relaxing with the ocassional trip into the city, this is the place for you.",5,2009,07,08
46,Wonderful hotel - beautiful setting and spacious rooms,"The Miramar was a lovely hotel - one of the best I've stayed at in Europe.  My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of July.  I tried not to get my hopes up having read previous reviews but I have to say that on arrival I was really impressed with the hotel.  The lobby is nice and modern and the room (classic room 303) was very large, with a separate room with toilet and bidet, separate bathroom with walk in rainwater shower and stand alone bath and then the bedroom/living room which was very spacious and a terrace with space for two chairs and a table and two sun loungers.  We were convinced we must have been upgraded, but I don't think we had!  We were at the back of the hotel so had no view, but that wasn't a problem for us at all.

The pool area was absolutely gorgeous, surrounded by gardens and a great size pool.  It was virtually silent up there for most of the day, apart from the subtle sounds of pigeon shooting in the distance.  Loads of sunloungers, which didn't get taken until about midday anyway so no need to rush out in the morning to get one.

The location was really nice, far enough away from the city to feel secluded and relaxed, but only a ten minute walk to the nearest metro (Parallel) or a €5-6 cab ride.

Service wasn't amazing - but still polite and professional.  All in all we had a really relaxing stay and were sad to leave - we will definitely be back again next time we're in Barcelona.

There were a few small cons:

The mini bar was only refeshed every two days.

The hill to get back from Parallel metro was crazily steep - and I'm not afraid of walking.  It only took about 5 minutes to walk up it but it is definitely a trek!   We had to get a taxi back each evening - about €8-€10 from Villa Olympic area.

The pool bar was hideously expensive and quite limited in choice - €12-€16 for a sandwich!  Although the €6 cheesecake was amazing ; )  There was a cheaper bar, part of the hotel, a short walk away which didn't make very nice food but was better than the hike into town if you just wanted a quick lunch without moving far from the pool

Breakfast was €25 per person.  We didn't use this as paying close to £45 for our breakfast between us seemed a bit over the top… There was also a smaller breakfast option of €10 for a coffee and pastry in the lobby.
 
Barcelona tips:
Go out without a bag if possible.  I have been robbed before in Barca and we saw an unfortunate guy get robbed on the metro - he was standing by the train entrance with a big camera in his hand.  His stuff was grabbed and the thief ran off before anyone had a chance to stop him.  Keep valuables hidden and keep away from places where thieves can make a quick exit (like the door of a train, busy café…)

Take the metro to Jaume 1.  There are loads of lovely tapas bars and mediterranean restaurants down the side street with Hotel Banys Orientals on it - you can easily spend a whole night there wandering in and out of bars.

Try Balthazar restaurant near Hospital Clinic metro.  It does great food at an unbeatable price.  We had cannelloni and smoked salmon and lobster mousse for starters, shared a paella mixta for our main, one dessert, coffee and a bottle of wine and the bill came to less than €50!  Also try Mayura for a fantastic Indian in a really stylish setting - again the bill was under €50.",4,2009,07,06
46,Beautiful Hotel Miramar!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Miramar and loved it.
Since the hotel is not in the main city we decided to split our trip between two hotels:  Hotel Omm by Passig de Gracia and Hotel Miramar in Montjuic.  This was a perfect choice for us as we had the chance to explore the city while within it for the first part of the trip and then see the city from the hills at Miramar.  While at Miramar we took a walk to the Montjuic castle, visited the National Museum, rode the cable car from Port Vell directly to the hotel!  

The hotel has the most amazing pool that is open all night for a late night swim.  The views from this hotel should not be missed.  I found the staff to be extremely wonderful and helpful.  They arranged for taxis, wake-up calls and provided the codes for free wireless internet.  Our mini bar was restocked daily and our requests fro more soda and water was met.  We had the romantic barcelona package and they provided everything as described.

Hotel Miramar is a wonderful place and I would recommend that this hotel supplement your stay after a few nights in a hotel located in the city.",5,2009,07,03
46,Great location but inconsistent service and poor internal communication between staff,"We spent a long weekend in the Miramar in late June 2009. Our room (321) was spacious and clean however did not have a jacuzzi on the balcony (although the hotel description implies all rooms have one). The glass door in the bathroom opened outwards and is a definite health risk esp. if responding to a call of nature at night!!!! The outdoor pool is nice - however watch out for broken glass in the grass!! We experienced the now well documented problems in having the minibar restocked and our several requests to reception did not materialise through housekeeping. We enjoyed a nice lunch, however dinner was very dissappointing (e.g. starter was three lukewarm prawns swimming in a sea of cold blitzed avocado!!!), and the quality of service was very poor. When travelling from the hotel you can take either the ""PM"" or ""50"" bus from near the roundabout left of the main entrance road into Place Espanya where you can buy an integrated travel card in the metro station which is great value. Alternatively walk up the hill towards the Olympic stadium and take the funicular railway to the metro at Parral lel  (you can buy a travel card in the funicular station). Great views from the hotel and be sure to take a trip on the cable car just around the corner from the hotel. When booking a taxi at reception make sure to remind / double check as they seem to forget!! (staff were very polite however seemed not to follow through requests which can be frustrating).",4,2009,07,02
46,Beautiful hotel in park setting.,The Miramar is elegant with big rooms and a beautiful quiet setting yet a short hop to La Ramblas and the vivacity of Barcelona.,4,2009,07,02
46,Quiet and secluded,"This is a beautiful and artistic hotel tucked away in Montjuic Parc.  This was the second hotel we stayed at in Barcelona, and it was nice to get away from the busy hustle bustle of the city.  We stayed in room 603 (one of only three on the top floor) and it was large, clean, and beautifully decorated.  It had a large bathroom, one sink, with a shower and a separate bathtub.  The best part of the room was the large balcony that overlooked the city and the port.  There was one bad thing about the hotel though.  They were severely understaffed in the bar and restaurant.  They only had two servers working both areas combined.  We were there on a Monday, so I do not know if that had anything to do with it.  But, it was very frustrating and we ended up getting up from the restaurant, because no one would come wait on us, and took a cab into the city to eat dinner.  
They have a magnificent outdoor pool area with a beautiful surrounding terrace and garden.  It is really spectacular scenery and a great place to relax. So overall, great room and receptionist service, bad bar and restaurant service.",4,2009,06,25
46,"Fantastic hotel, terrible service","The hotel itself is lovely and the location and gardens outside fantastic.  We didn't find the steep hill a problem and we had a toddler with us.  The proximity to Barcelona means that views from the balconies (if you get one) are fabulous.

Unfortunately service really let the hotel down.  We arrived and were put in a small room with no balcony even though we'd paid €320 a night.  We eventually moved 2 days later and the room we got was twice the size, had a hot tub, etc.  We feel we didn't get what we'd paid for.  The hotel says they provide bottle warmers for babies; it doesn't.  So instead of reception making the effort to help, we were told to go to the restaurant ourselves to get it warmed.  We asked for the mini bar to be re-stocked (the soft drinks are free) and it took them all day to do it.  Some days they didn't even bother re-filling it.  Some days they turned down the bed and some days they didn't.  Towels were never refreshed at the pool, you had to help yourself.  Sometimes the pool bar was shut for no reason.  

Whilst these issues might seem trivial, when you are paying £300 (excluding breakfast) a night and the hotel is a member of small luxury hotels of the world, you expect service to be immaculate and at the very least helpful.

HOWEVER, due to the location and the fact the rooms and grounds are so nice we WOULD go back, but we would ensure that we specifically request a balcony!",4,2009,06,22

46,City hotel without the city hassle,"I loved this hotel.  My fiance and I got a $200 per night rate and were very happy with the value.  We stayed in room 102 which was the handicapped room.  We were sad wedidn't have a balcony, but instead we had a huge patio with 2 chairs, a table, 2 sun loungers, and a jacuzzi (which was not working).  The room was nice and the bed was comfortable.  The staff was very helpful and spoke very good English.  I highly reccomend the breakfast.  At 25 Euros per person, it is expensive, but there were eggs, sausages, cheeses, fruit, muffins, ham, salami, croissants, tea, coffee, fresh juices, and smoothies.  The outside of the hotel is very calming and the pool has comfortable loungers.  The hot tub, steam room, and saunas were all included for guests. This hotel will not nickel & dime you on the extras - like our beer & sode in the mini fridge were restocked every night around 6:30pm (perfect for happy hour).  The lobby bar always had people ready to serve between 6pm and 10pm.  Other times were more hit and miss.  It is very easy to walk into the City from the hotel and we found it to have beautiful views as you work your way down the side of the mountain.  

I will try to upload some pictures soon - but really its a beautiful hotel - a little ""different"" - but serene and smelled wonderful with all of the flaura around.

BTW - bring conditioner ladies - they do not stock it in the toiletries!",5,2009,05,05
46,Great modern hotel in beautiful setting.,"We were very pleased with the miramar hotel.  The setting is in a beautiful park called Montjuic, away from the noise and crowds of downtown Barcelona.  The rooms are beautiful as well as the bathrooms with a great shower.  We had a great balcony with the most exceptional view of all of Barcelona.  The hotel staff were very accomodating to all of our needs. The restaurant is also quite good.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again. 
My only complaint which is minor is that the wifi does not work well in the rooms and it is not free.",5,2009,04,23
46,"Great Location, Beautiful Facility; Execution Needs Work","A fabulous ""plant"" in a great location, if somewhat removed from the center to Barcelona.  The Hotel Miramar has the potential to be a great destination ... but, the execution falls far short.

I was given a lovely, spacious room with a wide terrace that included a jacuzzi.  The jacuzzi did not work.  The water in the room was cut off for over three hours with no notification or progress reports from reception.  Then, the shower with its many spray heads leaked into the entry hall.  Off I went to another room.

Again, lovely, spacious room with large terrace.  Again, no hot water in the early evening and no notification from the reception.  The receptionist explained that it was Sunday and there was no maintenance!

The ""world class"" spa is potentially fabulous ... but!  No bottled in the refrigerator for bottled water.  Soiled towels were strewn about the spa and shower room.  Jacuzzi temperature was tepid with mud around the rim.  One ha man was cool; the other not working.  There was no light in the sauna.  There was so much standing water in the halls of the spa that one could easily have fallen.  Over a period of four days, there was never an attendant in sight.

A very nice breakfast is offered at the ridiculous price of 25 €; 12€ for a continental breakfast.  Similarly, internet access was offered at 12€ per day.  A dial-up telephone connection would have been MUCH faster.  

The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful, just lacking training and supervision.

Same on the management of the the Hotel Miramar Barcelona for blowing such a great opportunity.",2,2009,04,08
46,Hotel Miramar in Barcelona... muy bien!,"Hotel Miramar is located in the Montjuic area of Barcelona. It sits atop the mountain, which allows for spectacular views of Barcelona. Hotel Miramar was originally opened in 1929 for the Great Universal Exhibition, but was restored in 2006. Having just spent three nights at Hotel Miramar, I can say that I never would have guessed it's been around for so long. The place is very cool and modern, with 75 luxuriously appointed rooms and a staff that prides itself on delivering good service. 

Most of the rooms at Hotel Miramar offer large balconies, complete with chairs and a table or even chaise lounges. There's an indoor and outdoor pool, a small gym, a spa with male and female facilities, a small boutique, laundry services, a bar, and a restaurant. There are also business and party facilities on site. 

Checking in 

We arrived in Barcelona at around lunchtime on Friday afternoon. A cab ride to Hotel Miramar took about twenty minutes or so and cost roughly 20 euros. When we entered the very modern looking lobby, we were asked to sit at a desk where two hotel employees dressed in sleek black suits began the process of checking us in. As it turned out, our room was not ready. Check in at Hotel Miramar is at 3:00pm; checkout is at noon. The staff took our bags from us and we decided to take a walk into downtown Barcelona for some lunch. 

Our room 

Our room was definitely worth waiting for. A member of the staff showed us to room 309, which was a superior class room that appeared to be part of a suite. She smiled and said this was a great room and we could soon see why. The room had three huge windows that offered magnificent views of Barcelona and the Mediterranean Sea. Our terrace was about four times the size of the one above us and to the side of us. It had two chairs and a table, two chaise lounges, and a jacuzzi. Unfortunately, the jacuzzi was covered up. That appeared to be the case for all of the superior rooms. I don't know if it was because it was broken, out of season, or simply because we never asked to use it. 

The bed was king sized and outfitted with extremely soft sheets and three different kinds of pillows. A very nice flatscreen TV was mounted on the wall and it got CNN and BBC news, as well as local channels. The minibar was stocked with beer, water, soda, wine and liquor.  There was plenty of closet space, as well as a safe.  The beer, water, and sodas were included in the room rate. There was a desk with a CD player/stereo on it which was playing music when we came in. There were two phones in the room and one by the toilet in the palatial bathroom. 

The bathroom 

Speaking of the bathroom, I have never in my life seen a hotel bathroom the size of the one we had at Hotel Miramar. It was almost as big as the room itself. There was a separate stall for the toilet, which included a bidet, his and hers sinks, a wonderful rainfall shower that was enclosed in its own stall, and a huge bathtub. A small range of toiletries were available as well as little touches such as a spare toothbrush and toothpaste, a shoe shine kit, and a razor and shaving cream. Naturally, there were robes included as well as huge bath towels.  And to top it all off, a flick of a switch turned on the floor heating.    

A word about the location 

I mentioned that Hotel Miramar is on the hilltop in Montjuic. That's an important thing to note, because the location makes walking around Barcelona a little tricky. There is a pathway that goes down the side of the hill. It's no so bad going down, although there were a couple of mud puddles we had to dodge. Going up, on the other hand, might be difficult for people who aren't in somewhat decent shape or those who are disabled. Other options for getting to downtown Barcelona include getting a cab, taking the funicular (which is right next to the hotel and goes toward the beach), or taking bus 50, which has a stop close to the hotel.  I did notice that the hotel has parking available.  Since we didn't use it, I can't say how much it cost.     

The spa/gym/pools 

Because Hotel Miramar is a bit out of the way in Barcelona, we ended up doing a lot of walking. I was happy to do some walking since I desperately need the exercise, but it did tend to wear me out. On Saturday, after a grueling stroll back from La Sagrada Familia, we paid a visit to the spa and the indoor pool. 

The hotel offers locker rooms for men and women. We had to get the keys to the lockers from the front desk, which was a bit of a pain. Once we got the keys, my husband had to locate the men's locker room. We put on our bathing suits, we went down to the indoor pool, which is about 3 feet 7 inches deep-- about deep enough for a few laps. There were a half dozen chaise lounges next to the indoor pool, which would have been very nice to doze on had we felt so inclined. There was a huge window fountain which allowed for plenty of sunlight while offering swimmers a little privacy. 

The spa area/locker room was a little disappointing. My husband said the sauna, whirlpool, Turkish bath, and steam room on the men's side were out of order. Since there weren't any women in the locker room, he got in the whirlpool with me for a few minutes. As I was sitting in the warm water, I noticed that the place was a bit of a mess. Someone had left an empty beer glass and a half eaten bowl of potato chips as well as their shoes. There were dirty towels strewn about and it looked like the area hadn't been cleaned up in awhile. 

The outdoor pool area is very cool looking. Unfortunately, it was a little too cold for us to use it. We also didn't visit the gym, though we did notice there were treadmills, ellipticals, and free weights there. And the small boutique can be opened on request for those who need to buy workout clothes, ear buds, or a swimsuit. Of course, I noticed that the clothes that were on display would probably only fit women who wear a size two or smaller. Those who are interested in massages or other spa services can arrange them as long as they give two hours notice. 

Food and bar 

The lobby area sports a small bar where cocktails can be had for a mere 8 euros or so. We had cocktails on our first night at the hotel. I had a Kir Royale and Bill had a Manhattan. Both were well prepared and served with a bowl of potato chips. When I accidentally spilled the chips on the weird looking coffee table, the bartender was quick to clean them up and bring me a new bowl. He smiled and said potato chip spills happened often there. 

Hotel Miramar also has a full scale restaurant, which serves lunch and dinner and handles the 24 hour room service. A breakfast buffet is available for 25 euros a person. We opted for the express breakfast, which cost 10 euros and was served in the lobby. For that price, we got a cup of coffee, juice, and assorted pastries. The pastries were fresh and delicious and the orange juice was extremely good, though I often wished for a little more coffee. We thought it was an okay deal for 10 euros. 

A few things I didn't like 

Overall, we really enjoyed Hotel Miramar. However, there were a few things we didn't like so much. First off, the hotel has what it calls a ""pillow menu"". Basically, that meant there were three different pillows to choose from in the room. One of the pillows was supposed to be filled with down. Much to my chagrin, none of them were. I usually bring my own pillow with me when I stay in hotels because I prefer down. This time I didn't bring it, because I figured a five star hotel would have down pillows in the room. Sadly, I was mistaken. I made do, though... and the wonderful sheets on the bed were almost enough to make up for not having a down pillow. 

Secondly, Hotel Miramar offers Internet service, but it's a real hassle to access it. It costs 10 euros a day and requires users to input a passport number and a Spanish mobile phone number. When my husband's German mobile number was rejected, he gave up. I guess it's just as well, since we spend enough time online. I just think that might be bad news for business travelers. 

Thirdly, we did have to deal with some noise. There's a shooting range behind the hotel that we could hear sometimes. The sound of gunfire may be a problem for those who suffer from war related PTSD. I wouldn't mention this, except my husband spent time in Iraq and he knew exactly what the cracking sounds were. There was some kind of rowdy party going on in the hotel during our second night that was very loud and ran until late. I was exhausted and wanted to sleep... thankfully, I had thought to bring some Advil PM, which knocked me out cold. Otherwise, I would have been very upset by the noise. The third night, we were awakened at 2:30am by the loud cheers and honking horns of people who were celebrating Spain's football victory. Once again, Advil PM came to my rescue. 

And finally... this is a very minor quibble... the minibar wasn't restocked every day. The staff made a special point out of telling us that everything in the minibar but the wine and the liquor were included in the room rate. But the maid didn't replenish the supply each day when she cleaned, which to me seemed kind of chintzy. Also, the minibar menu advertised snacks, but we didn't see any in the fridge, nor was there any coffee maker in the room. 

Final thoughts 

We liked Hotel Miramar, despite the few glitches and complaints we had. It's a beautiful hotel, and for what we paid (about $630 for three nights), we think we got a good deal. However, I don't think this hotel will appeal to everyone. The one major issue is that it's a bit out of the way. We spent a lot of money on cabs to and from restaurants, and while my body will eventually thank me for the workouts I got climbing up and down the hill, I think the location may be a turnoff for travelers who can't or don't want to do so much walking. 

On the other hand, the hotel offers good service, breathtaking views, and a beautiful orange tree grove. We didn't have a perfect stay, but it was definitely good enough. I would certainly consider staying again, but I'll be bringing my own pillow!",4,2009,04,07
46,"AMAZING place to stay... beautiful setting, state-of-the-art rooms","Okay, you're up on a hill (Montjuic) overlooking all of Barcelona and have amazing views of the city and harbor. If you like to be in the middle of all the chaos in town, this is not the hotel for you. But if you want a resort experience a few blocks from the city, this is the place. LOVED it. We always walked down into town (5 minutes to the nearest neighborhood) and took a quick and cheap cab ride back. It's an ultra-modern hotel built around a ""historic"" radio/tv studio with beautiful grounds. Mostly very classy, quiet guests.
Room: Brand new, modern, sophisticated. We had a balcony overlooking the harbor (due to the economic ""crisis,"" as they call it in Spain, we got bumped up from a garden view, which would have been all right, too... but not as magical). Bathroom takes up half the room. There's only a sheer fabric screen separating you from the sink and tub... which some people wouldn't like. Toilet and shower are in separate opaque glass cubicles.
Public Areas: Great bar with excellent club sandwiches and burgers with amazing french fries. Beautiful, glass-enclosed indoor pool.
Staff: Very friendly and accommodating. Not too many of them, as the hotel was pretty empty most of the time during the current economic ""crisis"" (it fills up on weekends).
Downside: At the end of the day, due to the location, we ended up hanging out in the bar and not going down into town. It's just easier. The outdoor pool doesn't open until April (then again, the weather doesn't really warrant it).
This hotel is EXCELLENT and the people of Barcelona were great.",5,2009,04,05
46,Service over and above the norm,"I can't praise the Miramar and the staff enough.  My son and I arrived feeling lousy and with flu,  yet we were still made welcome and nothing was too much trouble.  The room was fab, the views lovely, and the staff all concerned to see that we were ok - plenty of clean sheets, cold water and so on.  They looked after us well over and above the course of duty.  I cant say that we really enjoyed our stay in Barcelona, but if you are going to be ill on holiday make sure it is somewhere like this.

I'm sure it would be a great base for a holiday too!  Easy to get in and out of town, and beautifully peaceful.",5,2009,01,05
46,Far from the Madding Crowd,"What a relief to leave behind the teaming streets of baking downtown Barcelona in peak tourist-throng season at the end of July and discover the super-cool ambience of Hotel ACMiramar. Perched half-way up a mountain overlooking the whole city and harbour, this cleverly-converted old post and telecommunications building provides a very chilled-out ambience. The welcome was slick and professional, rather than warm but they allowed me to park my Land Rover right in front of the entrance which was a plus. I had the cheapest room in the house -- at the back, overlooking wonderful botanical gardens with the sound of running water -- but it still boasted a spacious balcony with armchairs etc. In the lavish bathroom -- and it's a ""room"" not a cubicle --  the shower was huge and worked wonderfully, the bed beyond comfortable with wonderful silky sheets, the design and detailing of everything was exceptional. Total silence at night. Little things, like complimentary drinks in the mini-bar helped improve one's mood. Lunch on the terrace with a fabulous view, proved rather grand and just a tad formal, Customers were clearly well-heeled locals, rather than the t-shirt and shorts brigade. This is really quite a grand hotel and you pay the price when it comes to the extras. I share an earlier correspondent's reservations about absence of an intimate bar and having to beg for a drink in the lobby. But the quality of everything is exceptional.  Location is probably a bit too far up the hill for most folk on foot who want to wander back from an evening on the town,, but ideal if one is with the car.",5,2008,09,26
46,Overpriced Overhyped,"Checked in promptly, room not ready. then when we did book in it was a rush job - we were given a lovely room with a great view, we were in this room for ten minutes then we had to move to a pokey room at the back. We were not able to discuss our booking at reception as we were rushed, because of a misunderstanding with the terminology on the website booking form we did not take breakfast thinking it was not included, on checkout we found it had been included ands we missed it! This hotel is extremely expensive if you get a pokey room at the back and no breakfast. Position of hotel first class for sight seeing bus service/metro, funicular, castle - relaxing  however when we were there the beach cable car was not working and this was one of the reasons for choosing this hotel.",2,2008,09,20
46,A fab long weekend away!,"My husband and I stayed in this gorgeous hotel for 5 nights recently, as soon as we walked into the modern reception we knew we`d made the right choice. We were dealt with by the reception staff in speedy time and were shown to our room. As soon as the door was opened we were wowed with a lovely speacious room, huge bathroom with a walk in shower and v deep bath tub.Decor was neutral with dark wood furniture. The balcony had comfortable table and chairs and had one of the best  views we`ve ever experienced over looking the city!
We would definitely recommend doing the city tour bus, the stop is just left of the hotel, at 20 euros each for one day it was a little pricey but we felt it would be the only way you could see the sights of Barcelona.
We would also recommend the Miramar restaurant which is near the stairs down to the city, we had an excellent meal there on our first night, views of the city were stunning and food was one of the best we`ve had from around the world!
As the weather was so hot whilst on our trip we spent two days around the pool, where we received fresh towels and comfy sun loungers. The pool bar serves excellent snacks and drinks even if a little expensive buy hey you`re on your hols!
If we ever returned to Barcelona we would definitely stay at this lovely retreat once again- can not recommend highly enough!",5,2008,09,19
46,Very disappointed,"The location and style of this hotel on the side of Montjuic overlooking Barcelona is faultless. Stunning. However the actual running of the hotel, the service and the atmosphere is slow and lacks warmth and friendliness. On both nights trying to have an early evening drink in the empty bar was a joke. We had to go to reception to ask to find the bar tender and when the drink came there was not so much as a peanut to accompany it. There was no service on the terrace and we had to go through the whole thing again when we required a second drink. The only lift to our room on the sixth floor was broken one evening so we had to walk and it remained broken the next morning. No one apologised for the inconvenience. Our bed was not turned down on the first night and our room remained unmade at 2.30 in the afternoon - four hours after we left it. On the morning of our departure an alarm call, booked with two separate people, failed to materialise and the taxi to the airport charged us an additional ten euros because he was called by the hotel tp pick us up. Very, very disappointing and not what one expects from a 5* hotel. We are not difficult or demanding - but these things tarnished  what should have been a wonderful experience. All of this was made worse by the off hand reaction from staff at reception when they were mentioned. I would recommend this for the building and location with the proviso the this is a hotel of style over substance",3,2008,08,27
46,a tranquil oasis,"Having just spent 5 days at this lovely hotel is definitely on our return list. We were a bit concerned  about the location on booking from previous reviews, however having stayed at this oasis  we would only want to stay at the Miramar when we return again to Barcelona. After long hot days in the city  you were grateful to escape to the hills for the seclusion and tranquility of the hotel. 

You can stroll down to the city in 10/15 minutes if you take the steps route(20 yards to the right of the cafe/restaurant Miramar).The road route is a lot longer. As for getting back (especially at night), then I would recommend that you just pay the 4 or 5 Euros to get a taxi back up. We found to our cost that you only hail a taxi in the direction that you want to go. They don’t do U turns but instead  will take you round the one way systems, quarter of an hour later you are back where you started from. Always have a map with the Hotel ringed as most of the drivers had no idea where the Hotel was located. The reception hands out excellent tourist maps.

The rooms were very modern and luxurious with free soft drinks and beers in the mini bar replenished every day. The staff we found were very attentive and it only took 5 minutes for room service to bring up some pillows I had chosen from the pillow menu, and that was at 11.30 at night.
Bad points ? There is a shooting range over the hill beyond  the outdoor pool where the dull thuds could get on your nerves, but it wasn’t loud enough or on long enough to get upset about.
I would definitely  recommend this Hotel and just accept that  the taxi fares are the cost of  escaping the hustle and bustle of the city.",5,2008,08,03
46,Best Place for Chilling after a day in Barcelona,"The Miramar in Barcelona, Montjuic is simply fantastic for a long weekend getaway. 

Stayed with 4 friends in July `08 - we just loved the pool with its beautiful terrace and barman concocting us fruit shakes, rooms are beautiful with free soft drinks from the minibar, Molten Brown toiletries, rain shower, spa incl jacuzzi and indoor pool, and very friendly staff - they are very knowledgable about places to go out in town.

The centre of Barcelona is a short trip on the funicular/ tube, or if you want to get there quicker, the hotel will get you a cab in no time, and its only 5-10 mins into town

If you want to be really lazy about it, the Bus Touristic (blue line) stops right outside the hotel, and does a great tour of barcelona - you may want to avoid getting on at placa catalunya/ sagrada familia in high seasion though as there are huge queues.
 Also the blue line is a bit more interesting than the red one.",5,2008,07,26
46,WOW !!! Amazing,"This is a top contender to my all-time favs.
Located on Montjuc the Olympic mountain and overlooking the harbour this is a gem of a hotel.
We had a room with  a huge terrace overlooking the harbour.
What an experience this is. Great stylish hotel, You are in the barri gothic in 5-10 minutes by cab and 20 minutes via foot. You can take the cable car to go directly to Barcelonetta beach or you can just bask all day by the sunny pool and relax.
If you go to Barca, this is the one. It might not be as happening as the OMM or as chique as the Arts, but if u are after a great hotel with good value for money and an awesome view make this the hotel of your choice.",5,2008,07,24
46,Nice hotel but a long way from the centre,"The hotel was quite stylish and extremely clean. We felt that room service was rather slow for a 5 star hotel but the snack food was very good when it did arrive. The biggest issue for us was the location - despite very good views over the city and the harbour (and we chose it as it was away from the centre of town)it is a long walk into town and walking back is up a steep uphill trek from the nearest metro station. Some of the main sights are a few stops on the metro from there. I know this is not a reflection of the quality of the hotel, but when booking a city break it is a huge consideration. We did use taxis a lot but the traffic in Barcelona is terrible at times so it was by no means quick or easy all the time (eg at around 7pm on a weekday, avoid!)
The pool area was top notch and very relaxing. No real complaints about the hotel but just wanted to make people aware of the location issues we had.",3,2008,07,10
46,Beyond our expectations,"We chose this hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and it was our third trip to Barcelona. As previous reports we found the staff very helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived. Our room was beyond our expectations with an enormous balcony complete with jacuzzi for two that overlooked the harbour and city (perfect after long days sightseeing).
Free items in the mini bar, Molton Brown toiletries, chocolates on turndown,a very good restaurant and away from the hustle and bustle.
Restaurant service was impeccable with starters and mains to die for (cannot comment on deserts as didn't have one). No bar, you order from waiters in lounge. Wine list pricey.

For anyone wanting to explore independently the Montjuic funicular is about 10 minutes walk away from which you are able to access the whole of the Metro system (get a T10 card at the entrance). We also found that the No. 50 bus goes by the ""Magic Fountains"",the Sagrada Familia and the top of Passeig de Gracia for the Padrera, Placa Catalunya etc. The stop for this is within 5 minutes of the hotel. We did use the cable car to get back to the Hotel but at 9€ each we thought it was a spectacular but expensive form of transport.",5,2008,06,06
46,Pure Sophistication,"Wonderfully Designed.
Peaceful location with amazing views.
Very classy hotel.

First impressions are impressive.
In the courtyard at the front of the hotel there is a large water feature.  Water drips from large chains suspended from above into a large pool of water, the ripples are mesmerising.

Check-in is conducted not at your usual imposing counters but at sleek desks and comfortable chairs.

The Room was very luxurious.
A large stand alone bath large enough for two was the centrepiece of the bathroom.
A Huge marble rain shower large enough for four made it the best bathroom in the world.
A small error of design was that the door to the toilet cubicle was frosted, meaning it wasn't completely transparent but slightly.
The sheets were silk, the pillows were the most comfortable I have ever rested my head.
Some of the drinks in the minibar were complimentary as were three tins of cocoa covered treats.  These were to die for.

Breakfast was expensive and rather disappointing.  Your options were limited and we were the only ones who were not offered coffee, but all of this is avoidable, just don’t bother with the breakfast, or be prepared to pay more than what it is worth.  If it was 10 euros per head I would say 'wow it was amazing' but at 25... it’s a little steep.

The outside pool area was lovely.  Contemporary but on a lovely sunny day, very relaxing.
Huge woven beds in the shapes of leaves surround the pool.  Perfect for a cuddle with a loved one while soaking in the sun.
A repetitive banging sound which I guessed was Clay Pigeon Shooting or similar was a little annoying.

The Jacuzzi's were located in the male & female changing rooms; personally I would have liked a unisex one.

The overall presentation of the hotel, care of the grounds and friendly helpful staff make this a hotel well worth visiting!  
I will definitely be returning!",5,2008,06,05
46,First time in Barcelona and couldn't have stayed anywhere better,"Spent 5 days at this fantastic hotel at the end of May. After reading some of the views I was slightly concerned about location but we needn't have worried. It is located on a hill at the edge of Montjuic but if anything, that adds to the appeal. The views are stunning, spanning the whole city. The cable car in front of the hotel takes you right down to the beach. 
Rooms were comfortable, large balcony, superb bathrooms. What more do you need. 
I can't comment too much on the staff as we were out from dawn till dusk every day, but when we did come across them they were extremely polite and helpful.
All in all, a great place which I would recommend to anyone.",4,2008,06,03
46,AC Miramar Barcelona -fantastic rooms!,"The AC Miramar has been completely renewed about two years ago. My room was very large with big windows, overlooking the harbour. It had  fantastic features, such as a flat screen TV, a very spacious marble shower with water coming down like the Niagara Falls, a designer bathtube in the room, screened by a semi-transparent curtain - and an unbelievable comfortable bed. I never slept so well anywhere! Everything was extremely clean.

The personnel of the reception were very helpful, the waiters professional, but for my taste the food was not up to the standard of the Hotel. The microphones in the meeting room did not fuction well.
Unfortunately I had not the time to use the well-equipped Wellness-
Centre. Maybe the next time.",4,2008,05,20
46,Great room with hugh balcony!,"We stayed here for 3 nights in April and were very impressed with the Hotel. During our stay there was a Ducati Motorbike convention and an Austrian football club staying, but we were still given  personal space and attention. Our room was nice and large and had a fantastic balcony/terrace.  A chocolate and bottle of water was left free every night and the soft drinks in the minibar were also free.  The staff were polite and helpful and spoke good english. We managed to walk to quite a few places and used the tour bus, which stops very near by, to get to places further afield. The views of Barcelona are quite spectacular.",4,2008,04,14
46,Loved the tranquility,"Set overlooking the city with magnificent views . Hotel it self  had the best soundproofing .Rooms beautiful ,small touches much appreciated -  complimentary cold drinks ,Chocolates,& temperatures for following day left by our bedside.
Staff very pleasant , room service  s very efficent. Restaurant accomadated us despite our late arrival ( 11 pm ) Meal was  fantastic with extras given complimentary .",5,2008,04,11
46,Best Hotel Ever!,"I have just returned from the AC Miramar where we stayed for 3 nights.
The hotel was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. From the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out the staff were very friendly and helpful but not over the top.
We had a AC Executive room and it was spotless. The massive bath and the walk in shower were amazing.
The room service was quick and the food was very good. The soft drinks and beer from the mini bar are all included in the rate which was a nice touch.
We walked down to La Ramblas on our first day and it took us about 10 - 15 minutes and we were only strolling. We didn't notice any homeless people (there are loads on La Ramblas) on our way down.
If that is too far to walk, a cab ride is only a couple of minutes and costs about 4 Euros - the hotel will call you one and it arrives almost straight away. There are also loads of taxi ranks dotted around.
The indoor pool and spa facilities are excellent - the outdoor pool looked lovely but the weather wasn't quite warm enough for swimming outside.
On our last day we checked out but left our bags at the hotel as we had a later flight. Everything was as we left it.
We didn't leave any cash in our bags but I wouldn't have left cash in a bag in any hotel in the world where I wasn't there to look after it. 
All in all, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - it was brilliant!",5,2007,11,07
46,Horrific Experience Avoid At All Costs,"I was robbed by someone in the hotel staff. Here is my story.

I would like to let everyone know that my new wife and I are 24 years old and we had an extremely unfortunate time at the AC Miramar. (And we were on our honeymoon ;( If you thought you had to worry about the pickpockets in the town of Barcelona they are even worse in the AC Miramar.  The morning that my wife and I checked out she counted an envelope with 1,000 US that we had been using for travel money. She told me of our total funds before heading out for our final day in Barcelona. We checked out at 9am and asked to leave our bags at the front desk. We received a locker tag and went off without worry. We got back at 6:30 pm and were greeted very quickly outside by the same bellboy who checked us in and noticed us carry our valuable bag ourselves on our first day there. He did not need our locker ticket nor did he see us drop our bags off in the morning yet he was very quick to get our bags and hurried us off. I feel like such a jerk knowing that I tipped him. Anyways before we left we made sure our important envelopes were still in the bags, but we did not count the money. (Who would in a hotel courtyard?) We went straight to the train station and the bags stayed in our sight and possession the entire time until we checked into our hotel in Paris. It was then when we learned we had been ROBBED. A nice portion of money had been taken out of our envelope. I have called the hotel a lot and spoke extensively with their not so 5 star management. Finally the next day I got to speak with some sort of a head person and ultimately their was no recourse and they basically called me a liar and claimed that their security tapes prove their innocence. I asked the head manager what I was wearing when I checked my bags in that morning to which she had no answer because she had not reviewed the tapes herself, nor called me back in the morning which they said they would. And just so everyone knows I am in Paris right now on my honeymoon and I am so upset that I am spending my time writing this review to warn all other travelers. DO NOT GO HERE. (Think about that.....with the way the U.S. dollar is now and I am spending my very expensive time in Paris just so I can write this review) The hotel offered NO HELP. I will never stay there again.

P.S.- They advertise that they have Jacuzzi's. They do, but they are cold and broken. If the weather is not 85 you are in trouble. I had a personal guarantee via email that they had working Jacuzzi's for me before I went to Barcelona, and I would like to add that I did not sit in one the entire time. There was a bunch of other things...mostly how poorly the staff handled any kind of a problem. (They told us to get into another jacuzzi before putting a hand in it to see if it was warm. Common sense people!) Also the way that I was treated was as if I were a con artist by the management staff when I made my accusation of being robbed. (I spoke to them at first with a polite calm and sincere demeanor and not like a jerk) I was extremely insulted and disappointed. Anyways you would think that a 5 star staff is smart and trustworthy but just so you know they are rude, clumsy, and basically called me a liar and told me that there is nothing that they can do except file a police report! HAHAHAHAHA who does that in Spain?

Buena Suerte...You'll need it!",1,2007,10,27
46,Avoid!!,"We booked this hotel for a quiet romantic break, but they were still finishing the hotel when we got there. It turns out they were  getting ready for their grand opening, and some facilities (like the spa area and pool!) werent ready. It was noisy every day, and the staff were more concerned with the opening event than the guests. Shame the hotel didnt see fit to warn us before we got there.  Then they promised a refund, but 4 months on and we're still waiting. It's a real shame, since the hotel was OK, but I wouldn't  ever use the Small 'Luxury' Hotels group again - when you spend a lot of money on a hotel, you have to know you can trust the operator.",1,2007,10,05
46,Well Meaning Service and No Bathroom Doors,"What an interesting hotel!
We arrived to a room with a huge balcony with a Jacuzzi - not working. I don't believe any of them do- and a bathroom with no door at all.
Our second room also had no bathroom door. We were told that the bathroom doors had been made of glass and all were broken. The toilet had a little ""cabinet"" it sat in, in the second room, affording a little privacy, so we stayed in this room. The room was large with many amenities but it appeared it was often form over function.
We only had turn down service the first night. After that we had to call nightly to request.
The front desk staff was well meaning but often relatively incompetent.
We witnesses the taxi drivers arrive at the hotel and hand the desk staff Euro notes and then found amounts of up to 10E already on the meters when we got into the cabs. When questioned about this, we were told it was a ""supplement"" to come so far to the top of the hill.
I can't imagine how it could take someone 10 minutes to walk to the center of town from Montjuic! This is a HAUL to anywhere! Forget going out to dinner without a cab. The cautionary tale is in the reviews below in the number of people who wanted to ""dine in"".
The restaurant never had a sole in it the 4 nights we stayed in the hotel. We did have room service one night and there was a choice of 3 entrees, one of which was a chicken club sandwich (which we had). Mediocre at best.
The pool area is very attractive and fits with the Barcelona as a ""resort"" destination that we felt when we stayed there. The lobby is tiny with room for only 4 or 5 people to sit which becomes problematic when a couple of parties have called for cabs in the evening. The wait can be lengthy (20-30 minutes at least!).
And yet the hotel has an appeal. The room we had was large with a great balcony overlooking the harbor.
The staff was kind and not dismissive. The room was very large and clean with lovely outdoor space.

46,amazing hotel,"Absolutely amazing hotel.  Stayed there for 5 days in a standard room, however there was nothing standard about it!  Gorgeous bed, bathroom and views.  Especially enjoyed the complimentary minibar with beer and water topped up daily.  Total best of both world situation.  Very quite peaceful location yet only 10mins walk to the busy la ramblas.  Have to say it is the best hotel I have stayed in to date.

46,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for 5 days and loved everything about the hotel. The room, staff and service are excellent. The attention to detail is superb and the food excellent including the room service. The outdoor pool area is perfectly relaxing and there is a lovely indoor pool and sauna. The hotel is located 10 minutes walk from central Barcelona, it is quiet and ask for a room with a city or port view. There is a good bus service (50, 55) to town if you need it. It is a few minutes walk to the Miro museum and NMAC.

The best hotel we have stayed in and worth every Euro.

I really wanted to love this hotel and having read the reviews, had very high expectations. Our room was lovely (balcony, views over the sea, hot tub, huge bathroom) BUT i found the staff really rather unproffessional considering it was a five star hotel. 

While we were there, we experienced a number of little problems which just niggled at us, and eventually ruined our trip as we constantly felt disappointed by the service which, quite franky in a five star, should be excellent. 

Firstly, we asked for our hot tub to be set up for use, which they said they would, When we returned hot and sweaty to our room the next day, the hot tub was still empty, I rang reception and they just told me ours was broken - nothing they could do about it. No offer of a different room with one that did work or anything - they just made us feel we were unreasonable for expecting it to work!

We then ordered breakfast to be delivered to our room the next morning...the time came but nothing arrived. After half an hour of waiting i eventually rang room service to find out where it was....but they had no record of our order and when i checked i found our breakfast card was still hanging from our door!! We then had to wait an hour for our breakfast to arrive. 

That night we then tried to book a table at the restaurant but were told it was closed that night for a private function (which it was for two nights of our stay, even though none of the staff told us that during the day) Disappointed, we ordered room service for dinner, which then took over an hour to arrive. By this point we were just irritated by the general lack of service, which unfortunately marred what physically is a lovely looking hotel. 

We tried to book a table the following night at the restaurant, and reception said they would try to find us a table but, as the restaurant was currently closed, they would leave us a message in our room to let us know what time we were booked in for. When we returned from our day out shopping, looking forward to a relaxing meal in the hotel, we found no note or message had been left. The restaurant was fully booked again but no one bothered to let us know or even recommend or make another booking for us. 

On our last day, myself and my partner decided to use the spa facilities - the sauna was broken and closed off, and there was no hairdryer. Again, disappointing for a new 'destination' hotel. 

Finally, when we checked out, i accidently left my jacket in our room. I only realised this two days later, but no one at the hotel made any attempt to let me know this. I had to email them a week later to check i had left it there, which of course i stupidly had - but they didn't even think to let me know, even though clearly they know who you are and all your contact details. 

On the plus side, we eventually got into the restaurant on our last night, and would you believe it, were the only table in it all night!!! The food and the waiters were amazing, and i cannot recommend it highly enough. It just seems you can never get a table, which when youre a guest of the hotel, seems odd. 

SO, beautiful setting, looks stunning, but the staff and their attitude to the guests let this place done. As one of the waiters told us - ""they say it's a five star, but it's not. They haven't got a clue what five star means!!""

46,Amazing!,"We stayed at the hotel for a week in July and we were quite simply amazed by this hotel and its staff. It is without a doubt the best hotel we have ever stayed in, and definitely the place to be when visiting Barcelona. The staff was superb and friendly, they assisted us with everything we asked for, access to a computer etc., and even allowed us to stay in the hotel until in the evening of check-out day, without any extra charge. The hotel is extremely luxurious and modern, the architecture and furniture top notch, and our room was tremendously spaceous, with a private patio and a bathroom that was bigger by itself than many hotel rooms! Also, to our surprise, the water and soda from the minibar was free of charge (refilled everyday!), which is an amazing idea and tells you that the hotel wants to treat its customers well. The hotel also has an indoor as well as an outdoor swimming pool. which is essential in the July heat. The hotel is beautifully located in the hills of Montjuic, a 15 minute walk down the hill to the Rambla and the harbour. We also recommend that you use the opportunity to visit the Montjuic itself, for example the Miro foundation (10 min away) and the carriage lift up the mountain (5 min away). We will without a doubt return to the Miramar.

46,A superb hotel.,"We returned from the hotel yesterday after a 3 night stay...I can honestly say that it is one ot the best hotels that we have stayed in...All aspects that you hope for in a first class here are covered and I have recommended it to all our friends already and we are sure to return.

We stayed on the 6th floor in a deluxe room, it had everything...Large double bed, plasma tv, sound system, mini bar - soft drins and beers are free at AC hotels - superb walk in shower etc...All this was excellent but what can you  say about a large private terrace with a jacuzzi and stunning views over the sea, port and city below? The first class room paled into insignificance..Waking up to this view  out of your window or having a drink at night overlooking the sea and twinkling city lights was a memory that will never fade.

We ate at the restaurant on the first night and the food was similarly very good, very well presented and the wine list was excellent too. As one reviewer has already stated the breakfast choice is large and will cater for all tastes (if there is one negative with the hotel is that the breakfasts are expensive at Eur54 for 2). Room service was good and quick.

The facilities are first class - the pool area is clean and you really can relax, my wife had a massage which she reported was excellent, and good value too...The lounges and bars are everything that you'd expect from a top hotel too, clean, well managed and a place to chill out and chat with friends.

There is one other thing that the hotel does well, the service. All staff were incredibly polite and professional, it's so disappointing to go to a 5* hotel in Europe and be greeted by people that don't care about their guests...It's the opposite here, they couldn't do enough to help and went out of their way for guests. It was a pleasure to be greeted by people that obviously enjoy working there.

We looked at Le Florida too but were put off by comments about the staff. After staying at the Miramar the complete opposite is true here. Also the Miramar is 15-20mins from the airport and Le Florida must be 1hr + away, if you are looking for a hotel with a view go here.

If you visit make sure that you ask for a room overlooking the city, the ones that have garden views simply aren't the same. This is possibly one of the best hotels in Europe to go to to relax in and with a view like that, it is one of the most unique.

46,Excellent!,"Excellent hotel!! Lovely views of the of the harbour and the city.
We stayed here for 3 days in early march '07, and simply loved the experience.
The rooms are great. I was highly impressed with the bathroom fixtures :)  Service is good.  But like most european hotels there is no tea-coffee making faciliitels in the room. 

The breakfast is again great, lovely fresh strawberries  and various pies, pastry and fresh bakes. Quite filling to keep you through most of the day.

 The hotel is located in Montjuic right where the cable car starts.  You can take the cable car down to the harbour and walk from the colon and Las Ramblas. You get some absolutely amazing views of the sea and city from the car.
There is a bus stop near the hotel for the Bus touristic route (blue route). And the metro is a short walk downhill.  There are no shops or dine-ins close to the hotel, that is  a flipside, but well...the location is for the view and not for convinience of shops and restuaruants 

 would definitely not mind staying at this hotel again!

46,A magical experience in the lap of luxury,"I have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world and this is by far one of my favourites to date. Nestled atop Montjuic, the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the sea. And on top of it all, the staff is first rate and friendly -- they gave us a room upgrade when we requested a room with a view. Do not miss an opportunity to stay here, it's the perfect way to experience Barcelona at its finest.
",5,2007,02,19
46,"Nice hotel, nice view... not exactly 5 star services.","The hotel is a nice hotel with quality DJ materials, it is a few years old and it shows but it is not a decadent place as described by some customers. Some things certainly don't befit a 5 star hotel, the television in the rooms is not a smart TV, there were no slippers that were requested at reception, the welcome water was not there when we arrived, the gym is a fitness room unworthy even for a three star hotel with only one isotonic machine also broken.
I really appreciated (I took the hotel for this reason) the indoor swimming pool of the spa which children can access, never crowded with a pleasant temperature, my 5 and 2 year old daughters used it every day.
The breakfast, perhaps due to the low season, did not offer a lot of variety but the products were all good and of good quality, very good omelettes on request.
Room a little dated but spacious and comfortable, super king bed, large bathtub, very scenic terrace of the premium room, really beautiful with a view of the marina but which allows you to see almost all of Barcelona.
Room service ok, in the norm of 5 stars in terms of price, as the hotel is a bit isolated we had to make use of it.
Free parking appreciated when booking from their site.
We had two little girls and a stroller, the return can be challenging because it is uphill but it is something you can know before booking as it is located on a mountain, however the center is very close.
I never like to criticize the employees because I know that working in tourism can be hard, but most of the time when we returned to the hotel at the reception they didn't even say hello and were busy looking at their cell phones, it's fine at the hostel on the Rambla but in a five stars, great luxury that aims to be such, saying good evening to anyone who enters the door seems to me to be the bare minimum.
However we liked it and had a good time, room temperature ok without touching anything and quiet, in summer it must be even better, they have a beautiful garden with orange trees and other essences.",4,2024,01,16
46,Congratulations !!,"One more year we celebrated my mother's birthday, we were 16 people,
As always, we were phenomenal,
I want to highlight the service, quality and presentation, congratulate the kitchen and dining room staff, especially Eric for his kindness and high degree of professionalism.

Congratulations and thanks to all.",5,2023,11,20
46,It is not a five star,"This hotel is five stars only on price. We booked it because it was “close” to the Palau and it is not even close, half an hour uphill walking (we went by taxi). It is very far from the center, and it is a good walk to a metro stop. And also to the cable car.

The staff was friendly, but the hotel is ugly (it has two tired, horrible green annexes), the rooms don't even have a complimentary bottle of water, the furniture is very worn and nothing feels fresh. The bathroom ditto, it looks a bit from the 90s-2000s. And breakfast is 28 euros per person after charging you 280 for a crappy room. In short, one and no more. In Barcelona the offer is expensive but very wide and there are a thousand better options.",2,2023,10,19
46,Remove the stars,"First trip with our daughter and obviously, seeing the place and the stars of the hotel we trusted and chose the Miramar hotel.
Dated place but the shameful thing is that the day before our return to Italy the hotel had the brilliant idea of throwing a private pool party with loud music until four in the morning. The whole hotel complained and some left to stay somewhere else... they should remove the stars from this place. I strongly advise against it",1,2023,10,01
46,The best hotel in Barcelona,"For me, Hotel Miramar is the best hotel in Barcelona! It may lack small details, but the location and atmosphere are unique! Here you can relax by the pool or reach the center in a few minutes. The view is magnificent! I would never stay in any other hotel in Barcelona!",5,2023,08,02
46,Fantástico,"Habitacion espectacular , espacios comunes amplios, terraza con vistas incomparables.

46,Lleno de atenciones y amabilidad,"Hemos estado la familia en este hotel y les he de dar las gracias por tanta amabilidad con que nos han acogido , atendiéndonos en todo cuanto pedíamos y necesitábamos , desde la recepción , bar , restaurante, servicio limpieza habitaciones ,

     Tuvimos la suerte de comer allí y estaba delicioso 
Todo cuanto pedimos , el desayuno abundante con productos naturales de la zona

Si volvería !

Gracias ",5,2023,05,26
46,"Le sobra una Estrella, el gran lujo y le falta calidad","Un hotel al que le sobran una estrella, el calificativo de Gran Lujo, y le falta limpieza y mantenimiento es pésimo. El estado de la habitación es francamente mejorable, y no guarda proporción calidad-precio. Camas duras, baño sin intimidad, habitación ruidosa…A la llegada, el portero del hotel solo habla inglés, ni español ni catalán, algo inaudito en un 5 estrellas. El recepcionista frio, con manifiesto desinterés. El ambiente, impropio de un hotel de la máxima categoría. El colmo, la existencia de un restaurante que pone música a tope, y que se oye desde las habitaciones por deficiente insonorización. Es totalmente poco recomendable",1,2023,03,29
46,Experiencia increíble. Volveré a repetir,"Desde la recepción, Bart el chico alto rubio con gafas ha sido muy amable y sobre todo profesional. Los demás, creo recordar Olga, Marta y Costanzo también me mostraros la gran clase. Sin duda merecen 5*. Gran atención de Martin y Elena. Son los mejores. Sin duda volveré a repetir. Muy buena comida en restaurante y bonitas vistas al mar!",5,2023,03,06

Todos espectacular! Estara mi hotel fijo cuando estare' en Barcelona!!",5,2023,01,08
46,Am Wochenende mit Partylärm zu rechnen,"Gut ausgestattete Zimmer, gutes Frühstück, abseits der City zum Meer hin ruhig.
Am Wochenende gab es an zwei Abenden laute Partymusik aus dem Garten bis 03:00 Uhr morgens. Schlaf war nicht möglich. Zum Berg hin und am Pool hört man neben der Partymusik die Schiessanlage, die bis abends stark frequentiert wird.",3,2022,10,09
46,Vecchia nobiltà,"Camere spaziose ed allestimento sontuoso ma estremamente datato , porta del bagno che non si chiude , sanitari scheggiati , pavimenti vistosamente macchiati.
Spazio esterno della terrazza davvero abbandonato.

Palestra con panca combinata parzialmente priva di bulloni.
Eccellente il buffet della colazione ma personale poco attento.
Una volta era un bel cinque stelle ..",3,2022,09,27
46,Pésimo,"No es de recibo que un Hotel de 5 estrellas Gran Lujo, tenga el balcón sucio y lleno de telarañas, que falte el mando a distancia del televisor, que coloquen dos tazas con sendos sobres de infusiones sin tener ni cafetera ni hervidor de agua, que la bañera esté en las condiciones de suciedad como demuestran las fotos, que en la ducha al utilizar el grifo de agua fría, quede en mi mano, que la banqueta de los pies de la cama haya tanta suciedad, que en la pared del WC se observen goterones de orina de anteriores clientes, etc. etc.
Ya viendo botellas de plástico en el suelo de la entrada del hotel, así como las terrazas de la planta baja completamente abandonadas, su hotel no merece en ningún momento la categoría de 5 estrellas Gran lujo.
El desayuno no está a la altura. Las instalaciones anticuadas. Lo único positivo, las vistas.
Esta cadena es la misma que tiene el hotel Miramar donde fui el año pasado. Más de lo mismo, hormigas en la cama, cucarachas en el baño, el mini bar no funcionaba, goteras en el techo. Sinceramente no entiendo como esta cadena hotelera puede tener sus dos hoteles con 5 estrellas Gran Lujo.
Tanto el Miramar como la Florida son hoteles de 4 estrellas y aún. Les recomiendo una lavada de cara y a los clientes que vean bien las habitaciones.
El precio con parking incluido por una noche es de 367€, no quiero ni imaginar si fuera al Bullí o al Celler de Can Roca, encontrar la vajilla manchada o algún insecto en uno de los platos. Al cliente se le debe dar una calidad real por el precio que paga.
Siendo barcelonés, de buen seguro que no volveré a estos hoteles",1,2022,08,09
46,Kein 5 Sterne Hotel!,"Frühstück gut. Personal freundlich, oft aber nicht englisch sprechend. Zuwenig Personal, bis 30 Minuten auf den Drink auf der Terasse gewartet. Terasse, Kissen schmutzig und kaputt. Wärme-Turm, kein Gas vorhanden, läuft angeblich nur im Winter. Am Abend vorher lief der Wärmeturm aber noch. Minibar nicht wieder aufgefüllt. Die weiteren Kleinigkeiten erspare ich mir.",3,2022,04,24
46,Solo funciona bien el F&B,"El Hotel tiene un problema principal: que su categoría oficial es la maxima de la legislación española, partiendo de esa base las expectativas del cliente serán acordes a eso independiente de la tarifa pagada que a veces se bastante buena (por debajo de 200€)
He estado varias veces y esta ha sido la peor experiencia, el hotel esta falto de una puesta al día, los muebles están viejos, paredes manchadas, el servicio en general es pobre … solo funciona bien el F&B (restauración) que son muy profesionales.
Aún con todos los problemas que tiene… a tarifas de 160-180€ lo recomiendo por que al final prefiero dormir en una cama de 4000 €vieja que en una de 100€ de IKEA como las que hay en los hoteles modernos de 4*",3,2022,02,18
46,"Gastfreundlich, komfortabel","Das Hotel ist vom Flughafen gut erreichbar, man kommt fußläufig in den Hafenbereich. Vor dem Hotel endet die Seilbahn über das Hafenbecken. Die Aussicht ist toll. Der Frühstücksraum bietet einen phänomenalen Ausblick. Das Frühstück ist gut und reichhaltig! Die Zimmer sind großräumig, allgemein gepflegt und sauber. Das Bad ist sehr groß, die Dusche ebenso. Das Bett ist bequem, es gibt einen Flachbildschirm. Es gibt einen Spa-Bereich, mit diversen Anwendungen sowie ein Schwimmbad. Manche Zimmer haben einen Balkon.

46,Miramar mira hacia Abajo,"Ni cualidad, ni servicio, ni agua caliente, ni wifi…no sin 5 estrellas y menos  gran lujo.

Indtallaciones viejas, tiempos d’espera para todo, room service inedito! En fin, no és lo que era.",2,2022,01,02
46,Le sobra una estrella,"Es una pena que con la ubiación y espacios de que dispone, no sean capaces de mantener un mínimo de calidad en el servicio y sobre todo en las instalaciones, que están muy, muy lejos de estar bien mantenidas, dando sensación incluso de dejadez.",2,2021,10,25
46,5 stelle da sogno,"Ci siamo un pochino persi sulle strade di Barcellona e per finire in collina abbiamo trovato questo magnifico hotel a 5 stelle e le vale tutte, con garage per la moto. Bellissima camera, ottima colazione, personale veramente gentile e disponibile.",5,2021,10,22
46,Pésimo,"Ciertamente como leí en los últimos comentarios de Tripadvisor, este hotel ya no merece tener el valor que tiene y en concordancia tampoco el precio.
250€ la noche (mínimo) con una habitación maloliente, con oxido por todas partes, sucia, la puerta del baño ni cierra, la puerta de la terraza ni abre. Cama de matrimonio solapada. Porqué por muy cómoda que sea son dos camas individuales juntas.
Y si la habitación ya es un completo desastre, imagináos las zonas comunes… dejan muchísimo que desear.
La piscina sucia, paredes descorchadas, todo parece antiguo y mal cuidado. El spa no funcionaba…
Las imágenes engañan. Lo único que se salva es el personal que es muy amable y las vistas (solo si tienes la suerte de que te toque en las vistas y no mirando al parking que fue nuestro caso)",1,2021,08,31
46,Sensación de dejadez y pasotismo,"Me sabe mal ponerle 2 estrellas sobre 5 en cuanto a puntuación porque un hotel cuyas características lo tendría que hacer único (ubicación, vistas, entorno, etc.) no lo es como tal.

Cogimos la habitación más alta y supuestamente de más categoría y en el cristal del balcón habían restos de cagadas de gaviotas (en la foto, los puntos blancos que aparecen en el cristal, donde se ven las sillas de fondo).

Nos dijeron que como éramos los primeros huéspedes tras haber estado el hotel cerrado por el tema Covid, no habían observado este detalle.

A pesar de que subió a verlo el recepcionista, tampoco vinieron a limpiar el cristal en días posteriores.

En cuanto a la ducha, los mandos no ajustaban bien y había goteo constante de ésta aunque llevase horas sin usarse, aparte que la puerta de la ducha tampoco ajustaba bien.

Estos detalles, que en otros hoteles me hubiesen parecido aspectos de poca importancia, en un hotel de estas características y a este precio es imperdonable.

Pongo también otra foto de una puerta del pasillo de nuestra planta, donde un líquido marronoso invadía el marco y la tapicería del alrededor de la pared estaba rota.

El resto bien: buena atención tanto en recepción como en el restaurante y platos elaborados en su restaurante.

Pero nada justifica, ni el Covid ni la supuesta falta de personal de limpieza, la dejadez del hotel teniendo en cuenta de que se trata de un hotel de alta categoría.

Es totalmente inadmisible.",2,2021,08,12
46,Etwas in die Jahre gekommen,"Etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Für 5 Sterne abgerockt, aber immer noch interessant. Der alte Flair ist noch erkennbar. Der Blick natürlich grandios.

Leider ist das Hotel nicht so ruhig wie angegeben. Es liegt direkt an einem Schießplatz. Pool dadurch nicht entspannt und auch Mitten in der Nacht wird vom Schiessen  nicht Abstand genommen. 
Das Personal ist sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich ins Frühstück ist gut. Zimmerempfehlung ist Premiumzimmer, die den besten Blick haben. Ansonsten hält auch noch die Seilbahn vom Hafen direkt vor dem Hotel, was toll ist.",1,2021,06,27
46,¡Una experiencia sublime!,"Fuimos una amiga e yo a disfrutar de unas mini-vacaciones de una noche para salir de la rutina. Sin duda esperábamos una gran experiencia pero fue mejor aún de lo esperado. 

Hicimos el check in con Jonathan, un chico encantador, y nos proporcionaron un upgrade gratuito para tener terraza como habíamos solicitado, aún así al llegar a la habitación nos esperábamos la bañera redonda y en esa categoría no tenían de ese tipo, pero muy amablemente nos ofrecieron  otra habitación que a pesar de no tener terraza tenía la bañera y era mucho más espaciosa, con el baño separado por una cortina super cuqui, sin duda preferimos la segunda. La cama era enorme con un montón de cojines super cómodos. 

El spa es algo limitado, pero dadas las fechas solo había un par de parejas y casi no coincidimos en los diversos espacios. El jacuzzi podría estar algo más caliente, pero es soportable. La cascada de la piscina interior es una fantasía. 

El hotel dispone de una zona-bar en la que se puede cenar o tomar copas, y el restaurante del hotel que ofrece menú para cenar, bastante completo y variado. Sin duda una de las mejores experiencias, fue el desayuno incluido en la reserva, se puede escoger entre dos menús: uno más ""healthy"" y otro más ""americano"". Ambas escogimos el menos sano, te dejan decidir como quieres los huevos, el café el té, etc... sin duda el mejor final de estancia.

Los alrededores son super bonitos, ideal para pasear disfrutar de las vistas de la ciudad y del puerto. El hotel dispone de una terraza en la zona de atrás muy agradable para tomar algo y relajarse con los sonidos de la naturaleza.",5,2021,04,06

46,En algún momento fué un 5 estrellas,"La verdad que necesita alguna mejora, para poder decir que es 5 estrellas.
Las habitaciones se nota que en algún momento estuvieron bien, pero a día de hoy necesitan mejorar.
Al spa, el nombre le queda un poco grande; la supuesta zona de aguas deja mucho que desear, necesita una reforma ya; lo unico por lo que se salva es por la piscina climatizada.
Lo que si vale la pena es el trato del personal, y la comida.
Por eso, por la ubicación y por las zonas comunes si volveriamos; pero sin duda el estado de las habitaciones y el spa deja bastante que desear para ser un 5 estrellas.",3,2021,02,02
46,UNA EXPERIENCIA DE 10,"Hemos estado este finde y la experiencia ha sido fantástica. El hotel y las vistas EXCELENTES pero LO MEJOR el personal!!! El trato de Carles en el restaurante ha sido inmejorable, siempre atento y pendiente de nosotros. Por encima de lo que esperábamos!!! Lo recomiendo muchísimo",5,2021,01,24

46,LE SOBRA ALGUNA ESTRELLITA....,"En general el hotel esta bien, limpio y correcto, pero no esta dentro de los niveles de un 5*.

çDebido a la Pandemia nos dijeron que el Room Service teníamos que recogerlo en Recepción..Como?! no entendible, según ellos por seguridad...no veo el riesgo de dejarte bandeja en la puerta y recogerla en el mismo sitio, esta claro que se debía a la falta de personal....sea la situación q sea, el servicio debe darse y mas cobrabndo lo que cobran.

Buena situación y buenas vistas.",3,2021,01,18
46,Me esperaba más,"Reservamos una de las habitaciones más caras con la promesa de algo espectacular y aunque en general el Hotel esta bien  no llega a ser lo que ofrecen , no hemos podido utilizar la terraza de la habitación porque tenían un evento privado y el ruido era insoportable, el jacuzzi y la zona de relax siempre ocupada ya que en la piscina exterior también tenían evento privado.
Pienso que estas cosa deberían comunicar antes de hacer la reserva",3,2021,01,11
46,Un poco cûtre!,Habiamos pedido vistas a la ciudad y un piso alto. El recepcionista frances dice que estan bloquedos los pisos altos por unos grupos y las vistas a la ciudad cuestan 50€ mas. Quien se cree que en plena crisis de corona y un lunes hay tantas habitaciones ocupadas?! Em estos tiempos los hoteles deberian intentar de satisfacer los cliebtes. Me parece bastante cûtre.,3,2021,01,11
46,"Excelente, super recomendable!","Hemos estado muy a gusto durante 3 noches. Un hotel limpio, tranquilo y con vistas espectaculares. El servicio y el personal de 10. A destacar sobretodo la comida, tanto el desayuno como el menú y el room service.

46,Un oasis en Barcelona,"A poco metros del bullicio de la ciudad de Barcelona, uno puede encontrar paz, tranquilidad, privacidad y buen trato en un hotel de 10. Vale la pena hospedarse en él.

46,Excelente Elección para disfrutar en familia o en pareja,"Un lugar exclusivo, bien cuidado, el personal muy atento, amable y profesional , con medidas sanitarias y  protocolos Anticovid en todas las zonas del complejo.. Es ideal tanto para  parejas , como para ir en familia. Las habitaciones son espectaculares, la limpieza excelente. El SPA  , la zona de piscinas, gym  y jacuzzi en perfectas condiciones con cuidado impecable. Recomiendo este hotel que convierte  una estancia en  una experiencia inolvidable. Muchas gracias a todo el staff.",5,2020,09,22
46,No hay medidas anti covid!!!!,"No hay medidas anti covid. Lo único que tienen es gel desinfectante en algunos puntos y eso no lo es todo para evitar contagios. El spa está abierto durante todo el día sin control de aforo,ni vigilancia ni desinfección. De ahí que fuimos a meternos en el jacuzzi y encontramos a una pareja teniendo sexo de lo más salvaje. Lógicamente, Fuimos a quejarnos y algo les dirían pero fue un espectáculo de lo más desagradable, además de anti higiénico.
 Además, en la zona de piscina, hay unas camas que tampoco desinfectan a ninguna hora del día ni entre clientes. También encontramos en la zona de piscina un señor con 2 señoritas de compañía haciendo el espectáculo mientras él le untaba a ellas aceite por los pechos y los culos 
mientras dichas chicas se encontraban sin bikini. Una asquerosidad. Supongo que tuvimos mala suerte con encontrar tan despreciables clientes, pero esta serie de cosas tendrían que vigilarlas para asegurar el bienestar y comodidad de los demás huéspedes. El camarero del pool bar tampoco les llamaba la atención a estos últimos. En fin, una experiencia de lo más asquerosa y desagradable.",2,2020,09,07
46,Fin de semana,"Fuimos en el mes de Julio para fomentar el turismo nacional y nos salió mal, para empezar faltava personal, en principio se puede entender por la situación que atravesamos pero cuando esto afecta al cliente de forma ostensible ya no es razonable, y menos en un 5 estrellas gran lujo, todo bastante dejado, limpieza muy justa hasta decir q tuvimos una bandeja con comida todo el fin de semana delante la puerta de otro cliente anterior a nosotros, en la terraza una pobre chica para 9 mesas, cogimos unos masajes en el spa que una vez allí no nos hicieron sin razón alguna y para rematar el fin de semana no nos quisieron dar mesa en el restaurante del hotel el domingo a las 15’10 porque cerraban a las 15’30 y la chica estava sola en el restaurante, en fin, para olvidar. Después se quejaran que el turismo nacional no les visita, pero con estos precios y este pésimo trato cualquiera pisa ese hotel otra vez!!",1,2020,08,13
46,"Ojo, os pueden dejar tirados el mismo día de llegada","Esta misma mañana poco antes del check-in he recibido una llamada diciendo que no me podía alojar en el hotel dando como motivo lo que parecía una excusa de lo más mala ya que comentaban que no podían dar la habitación con las peticiones hechas (las cuales no correspondían a las mias) dando como opción otra fecha o hotel en otra ubicación de inferior categoría. 

Pésima gestión y trato por parte de un hotel que se categoriza de “gran lujo”. 

Evidentemente tras la nefasta experiencia y el perjuicio ocasionado no me planteo reservar nuevamente en este hotel para evitar sorpresas. 

No lo recomiendo para nadie que pretenda una estancia corta ya que si reciben solicitudes para más días os cancelarán la reserva. 

Pésimo es poco.",1,2020,07,04

46,Bien,"En general bien, claro que un precio un poco desorbitado por una habitación con bañera de película pero sin vistas. La habitación daba a la terraza del bar por lo cual teníamos que tenerla cerrada todo el rato por que nos veía todo el mundo.

El spa segun ellos de l'occitanne, lo unico que tienen es la tienda. Ya que también deja mucho que desear.

Pongo bien, por que la habitacion por dentro y las instalaciones del hotel estaban bastante bien en general.",3,2020,03,15
46,Opinión sobre el spa,"Repetimos noche dado el buen recuerdo que teníamos de una estancia anterior, pero el spa nos decepcionó, el hammam no funcionaba, el agua del jacuzzi fría, la sauna oscura i sin reloj de arena, el sistema de suministro de hielo de adorno, suerte que la piscina seguía como hace un año. La habitación y el personal de servicio excelente.",4,2020,01,26
46,Traumhafte Aussicht,"Wir hatten uns ganz spontan zu einem Wochenende in Barcelona entschlossen und waren ein paar Stunden nach der Reservierung im Hotel, Ankunft spät am Abend. Der Check - In verlief sehr ruhig und professionell, wenn auch nicht wirklich besonders schnell. Vielleicht waren wir aber auch einfach nur zu müde.

Unsere erste Suite hatte eine riesige Terrasse, mit Blick von der Sagrada Familia bis über Port Vell und den Hafen, einfach nur ein Traum, gerade auch dann der Sonnenaufgang. Leider gab es ein paar Mängel im Bad, die wir reklamiert hatten. Das wurde professionell gehandhabt und wir wurden dann für die zweite Nacht in einer anderen Suite untergebracht. Die hatte dann auch die im Internet angekündigte Badewanne im Zimmer, dafür eine deutlich kleinere Terrasse und einen etwas eingeschränkteren Blick. Aber beide Zimmer waren sehr schön, groß, sauber, gut eingerichtet. 

Das Frühstück war gut, die Auswahl ausreichend, wenn auch nicht ganz das, was man in einem 5 - Sterne - Haus erwarten würde, auch der Service beim Frühstück wirkte nicht ganz auf der Höhe, kein echtes Problem, aber eben auch nicht 5*. Dafür waren die angebotenen Speisen sehr gut.

Der Zimmerservice hat auch toll geklappt, war schnell und das Essen war gut, was man bei den aufgerufenen Preisen natürlich auch erwarten kann.

Besonders erwähnen möchte ich noch das tolle Personal an der Rezeption, alle haben sich intensiv um uns gekümmert und das kleine Problem wurde schnell gelöst. Und falls ich es noch nicht erwähnt haben sollte: die Aussicht ist wirklich einmalig.",4,2019,12,09
46,Hotel descuidado,"Me parece que un hotel con categoría 5 estrellas Gran Lujo no se corresponde a este establecimiento completamente descuidado y que se cae a trozos. Tiene un mantenimiento nefasto. Los techos y paredes de sus instalaciones dejan muy poco a la imaginación. El hamman tanto masculino como femenino no funcionaban. Grietas por todas partes, moho en las tuberías de la piscina del spa, la ducha de la habitación se caía por estar despegada de la pared, los muebles carcomidos....en fin, un listado interminable de detalles desastrosos. Se salva el desayuno que es correcto aunque sencillo. También echamos en falta un servicio de recogida de maletas al aparcar el coche a nuestra llegada como se correspondería a un gran lujo...eso si, las vistas preciosas pero nada más.",1,2019,12,08
46,Increíble restaurante,"Excelente servicio, grandes vistas excelente combinación para sorprender a alguien.

46,Una experiencia única en una localización incomparable,"Celebramos nuestro aniversario de boda en el Hotel. Tiene unas instalaciones exquisitas en un emplazamiento con mucho encanto con vistas al puerto y a cinco minutos de las Ramblas.

La habitación es muy espaciosa con el buen gusto que esperas de un hotel de cinco estrellas. Toda la plantilla del hotel se volcó en hacer de nuestra estancia una experiencia inolvidable, siempre atentos y eficientes. Disfrutamos de la zona de spa y la piscina. Comimos en su restaurante y el desayuno del hotel nos gustó mucho.

Muy recomendado para unos días visitando Barcelona, ya sea en pareja, con familia o amigos.",5,2019,10,13
46,Rest Miramar,"Buen sitio para celebraciones. Buena comida bien elabirada y servicio competente.  Vale la pena comer en el restaurante.
El entorno muy bien. Y el lugar al estar fuera del centro de Barcelona es muy tranquilo.",4,2019,10,13
46,Muy mala experiencia,"Hoy, domingo, por la mañana vinimos a Barcelona por despedir a nuestro hijo. Decidimos ir a este hotel y desayunar en su homenaje i tambien ver como estaba por proximos viajes. Preguntamos en recepción si podriamos desayunar aunque no no alojabamos en el hotel y nos dijeron que si indicandonos la entrada en el comedor. Quando llegamos alla, la  chica nos dice de mala manera que estan llenos y no tenemos sitio para desayunar....en el momento habian CINCO MESAS I TODO EL COMEDOR VACIO!!!!

Muchissimas gracias por estropear-nos este dia...",1,2019,10,06
46,Almuerzo en el restaurante Studio Miramar,"Durante mis vacaciones fui con mi familia a almorzar a restaurante Studio Miramar, soy residente en Barcelona y me lo habían recomendado por las vistas y la calidad de su cocina.
No nos decepcionó en absoluto, para empezar un aperitivo generoso i rico, los platos bien elaborados y presentados destacando la calidad de la materia prima, los postres buenísimos.
Especial mención por su amabilidad y servicio impecable a Raquel y a Alejandra de lobby-bar por su simpatía y los magníficos cócteles que nos preparó.",5,2019,09,11
46,Muy buen hotel,"Hotel muy bien situado, comida muy rica sobre todo el desayuno, es muy completo y variado. Las habitaciones son amplias y confortables. Estuvimos muy bien atendidos, personal muy amable. Lo mejor de todo son las vistas, espectaculares!!

",5,2019,07,18
46,Cafetería/ terraza,"Decidimos comer en la cafetería/ terraza porque estábamos en la zona. La carta es de cafetería no es muy amplia pero si variada, todo lo que probamos estaba muy bueno, ademas la atencion de Ines y Richard ha sido muy amable en todo momento. Muy recomendable en la zona, buenas vistas y entorno tranquilo. La próxima vez volveremos a probar el restaurante !",5,2019,07,14
46,Fuimos a tomar algo y NO NOS QUISIERON ATENDER,"Vinimos el día 16 de junio a las 20:00 de la tarde, nos sentamos en la terraza y los camareros fueron muy groseros, nos veían y optaban por atender otras mesas y la nuestra no.

Puede que sea un “hotel de lujo” pero pésimo servicio al cliente sin duda el peor de todos los que hemos ido...",1,2019,06,16
46,Gran descubrimiento,"Situado en la montaña de Montjuic, ofrece unas vistas bonitas de la ciudad. El precio 12€ por copa más o menos como en cualquier sitio de esta categoría, la única pega la tardía de copas ya que era un chico (no me acuerdo del nombre del chico era morenito) para servir y preparar lo bueno los cócteles muy buenos recomendados el de fresa  de pimienta y maracuyá y jengibre. Volveremos...pero habría que mejorar la espera",4,2019,06,08
46,Blick auf das Meer,"Sehr gute Lage, wenn man den Schienenverkehr außer Acht lässt. Innenstadt und Strand bequem zu Fuß erreichbar. Parkplätze sind sehr rar. Die Nähe zu Barcelona ist zu einem Kurztrip geeignet. Die Fußgängerzone in der Altstadt ist interessant.",4,2019,05,19
46,PERSONALE MERAVIGLIOSO,"Premettiamo che l albergo è molto carino curato è posizionato molto bene, ma quello che mi ha colpito e il personale ..... Ginevra alla reception , ragazza italiana , stupenda gentile accogliente sorridente e molto portata per questo lavoro, e al ristorante c è una ragazza anconetana , mi sfugge il nome , stupenda , mangiato benissimo consigliato da questa bravissima ragazza ! andateci vale la pena ! 
GRANDE MIRAR STAFF!!!!!",5,2019,04,28
46,ESTE HOTEL ES UNA RUINA,"A pesar de su bonita ubicación, el Miramar carece de mantenimiento y se ha quedado ya muy obsoleto. Habitaciones - pongo plural ya que tuve que visitar varias antes de quedarme con la ""menos peor"" - tristes, oscuras, mobiliario vetusto y en mal estado, olor a rancio de poca ventilación ……. Y si queréis pedir un room service, más vale armarse de paciencia antes de que alguien os coja el teléfono - ni siquiera marcando todas las opciones disponibles : room service/restaurante/recepción … NADIE parece oír el teléfono. Tras cenar en la habitación, colocamos la mesa fuera para que alguien la recoja. Al día siguiente, a las 7h de la mañana, la mesa seguía delante de la puerta. Lo peor es que también seguía el cartelito de solicitud de desayuno en la habitación para la 10h00. Y claro, a las 10h00 pues ni llegó el desayuno pero eso si, seguía en la puerta la mesa de la cena. De nuevo, tras esperar bastantes minutos que alguien atienda al teléfono, se pudo solicitar el desayuno que llegó 50 minutos más tarde. Moraleja : poner 5* GL en la entrada no es en absoluto una garantía de que este establecimiento vaya a cumplir con las expectativas que uno pueda esperar.",1,2019,03,20
46,Agradable estancia ,"Este hotel cinco estrellas, con una vista impresionante de muchas áreas de Barcelona y muy cerca del teleférico, nos acogió muy bien. 
Si bien el menú restaurante no me motivó mucho es de destacar que el desayuno es completo, apetecible y variado.
El personal muy amable, especialmente la joven Maria, en la recepción, que se toma el tiempo necesario para guiarte en cualquier excursión, restaurante o cosa que necesitas. Siempre sonriente.
Las habitaciones amplias, limpias, claras y confortables.",5,2019,03,14
46,Buen hotel,"Estancia agradable, habitación correcta, tranquilo, a unos diez minutos en coche del centro de la ciudad. Paseo agradable por los alrededores, teleférico a un minuto, imprescindible cotxe o taxi para moverse por la ciudad, a no ser que tengas muy buena forma fisica",4,2019,02,14
46,Le sobran Estrellas y le falta GL,"Buscabamos con mi esposa un hotel especial para celebrar nuestro aniversario de boda, y sobre el papel el Hotel Miramar Barcelona, nos encanto por su ubicacion y los servicios ofertados, un autentico 5 estrellas Gran Lujo. Pero.....empezamos con mal pie, ya que en esta categoria de hoteles en la puerta acostumbran a tener un servicio de conserjes que se hacen cargo del equipaje y te acompañan a tu habitacion, bien pues aqui NO. Una vez realizado el Cheking y accarreado nuestras maletas por medio hotel, llegamos a la habitacion, que si bien es suficientemente amplia, le falta algo de mantenimiento, en lo referente al restaurante, y al bar, nada que decir buen servicio y comida acorde con el precio. Pero nuestra gran decepcion llego al acceder a la zona de aguas del complejo, mala atencion, poco personal, y lo peor no funcionaban ni la sauna ni el haman, ante esta decepcion optamos por salir a la piscina exterior, y alli llego lo peor. Nadie te explica que el hotel esta justo al lado del campo de tiro Olimpico de  Barcelona, donde los socios no parar de disparar toda su artilleria durante horas y horas, un verdadero suplicio cuando estas buscando relajarte y un poco de tranquilidad y no precisamente un episodio de la guerra de bosnia. En resumen le sobra una esterlla, le falta mantenimiento, y el GL brilla por su ausencia.",3,2019,02,04
46,Escapada finde,"El hotel está ubicado en Montjuich, rodeado de zona verde. Las habitaciones son confortables, aunque el colchón no pareció adecuado: muelles algo duros y, por encima, un colchoncillo. La habitación disponía de una terraza muy agradable. Predomina el diseño pero, precisamente por ello, le resta confortabilidad: la imponente bañera era muy incómoda. Se agradecería cafetera/tetera, que no hay. Por lo demás, un buen sitio para descansar en Barcelona en un entorno muy agradable. El personal muy atento.",4,2019,01,15
46,Plata a precio de oro,"Llegamos al hotel para pasar un finde romántico, y quedamos bastante decepcionados. Las habitaciones no son todas como en las fotos, algunas no tienen bañera y son una lata de sardinas (para compensar tienen buenas vistas). El mobiliario de las habitaciones un poco anticuado, se nota que se le ha dado mucho uso y no se ha renovado. El Spa deja muchísimo que desear (baldosas de la piscina que faltan, pocas tumbonas, instalaciones escasas), la limpieza de la habitación también deja un poco que desear. La ubicación y las vistas son bonitas, pero un poco alejado de todo si se está interesado en adentrarse en barcelona sin intenciones de caminar. El personal bastante amable pero por el precio que tiene la estancia en el hotel, no vale la pena.  Muy caro para lo que es.",2,2019,01,07
46,"Best Service, State of the Art *****","Vorweg: Wir buchten über die Homepage des Hotels. Es ging einfach, war aber ein Chaos, da absolut Nichts klappte. Die Buchung wurde bestätigt, kam aber nicht an. Gott sei Dank erhielten wir dennoch 1 Zimmer.

ABER: als wir ankamen hat uns ‚Albert‘ empfangen. Er ist ein First Class Rezeptionist!!! Absolutes ***** Niveau!
Er könnte problemlos im Danieli Venedig, Adlon Berlin oder Atlantik Hamburg arbeiten! Dort habe ich einen gleichwertigen Service erlebt. Ein Traum!!! Service auf TOP Niveau. Danke Albert!

Er rettete ALLES! Er war aussergewöhnlich freundlich, sehr natürlich professionell, bedingungslos hilfsbereit, souverän, zielorientiert, kundenfreundlich. Auch beim Taxi war er sehr aufmerksam. Die Kombination ist das Geheimnis!

Wir verbringen 2 Nächte im 5. Stock zum Jahreswechsel und sind sehr glücklich.

Personal ist das A und O!!!! Dadurch ein Hotel auf Topniveau!!!! 

Zum Hotel selbst: es liegt über der Stadt, mit Blick gen Hafen und Stadt. Die Zimmer sind 1a, das Bad sehr gepflegt. Die Dusche ein Erlebnis. Auf das Spa freuen wir uns bereits heute!",5,2018,12,30
46,Abans de Barcelona,"Che vista ragazzi! Che hotel! Grandi, eleganti e moderne stanze. Colazione continentale, ricca e gustosa. Reception 24 ore. Gestione sempre cortese e professionale. Si va sul sicuro. Il ns albergo anche per incontri d'affari.",5,2018,12,24
46,Hotel de lujo,"Hotel ubicado en una de las zonas con más encanto de Barcelona y con unas de las mejores vistas.
Todo bien en lo referente al hotel, a excepción del bar, ya que las bebidas eran muy caras.
Una cerveza normal cuesta 6 euros. ",3,2018,12,22
46,Hotel excelente,"Hotel excelente con un servicio muy bueno , muy recomendables lasbhabitaciones con terraza con vistas sobre el puerto.Desayuno a la altura del hotel.Ideal el lobby bar para una cena ligera de calidad.

46,"hotel precioso, increíble localización, excelente servicio.","Estuvimos en una preciosa habitación con una gran terraza y unas vistas de Barcelona privilegiadas, por la noche pedimos un club sándwich con patatas fritas y estaba delicioso. Por la mañana fuimos a tomar el desayuno y Patricia nos trató con mucha amabilidad y profesionalidad. Durante el check in y el check out el trato personal fue excelente. Un gran hotel y una experiencia inolvidable.",5,2018,10,30
46,Fin de semana perfecto,"Me encanto este hotel, las personas nos atendieron muy bien, fueron muy amables.
Esta ubicado en Barcelona pero al estar en Montjuic le da privacidad.
Las instalaciones muy cómodas. La zona de la piscina es muy amplia en un jardín muy grande.
El desayuno muy delicioso, con una gran variedad.",5,2018,10,18
46,Concerto e relax ,"Ottimo hotel sulla collina di Montjuïc a pochi minuti dal centro con taxi sempre disponibili davanti all’hotel. Vista su tutta Barcellona e sul mare, 10 minuti a piedi dallo stadio olimpico e dal palazzo dei concerti (dove abbiamo visto la Pausini, 🔝). Ottima colazione, camera deluxe spaziosa con balcone attrezzato. Sala da bagno con vasca davanti ad una vetrata che dava sul parco. All’arrivo champagne offerto in attesa del check in. Da consigliare se non si vuole la confusione del centro. ",5,2018,10,18
46,Increible,"Mi pareja y yo teniamos una reserva en el hotel la florida, por motivos de un evento del hotel nos cancelaron la reserva y nos dieron habitacion en el hotel miramar.
Ibamos un poco descontentos por el cambio de hotel, pero al llegar ahi... increible.
Nos dieron una suite con vistas al mar y a la ciudad, una terraza increible y la habitacion era preciosa.
El unico fallo que ví fue cuando bajamos a cenar al bar, y pedimos 2 platos de macarrones a la boloñesa que tardaron 1 hora, al preguntarle a la chica que pasaba con los platos se dieron cuenta de que se habían olvidado de pedirlos..
A todo esto el bar estaba vacio.
Y el desayuno, para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas, deja mucho que desear.
Por todo lo demás, la estancia y el personal muy amable.",4,2018,10,12
46,Fantástico trato y relación calidad-precio,"Nuestra estancia en el Hotel Miramar fue excelente. Hicimos con la reserva un conjunto de peticiones porque se trataba de una estancia especial, y cumplieron al 100%. La relación calidad-precio es de las mejores en Barcelona, con unas vistas y un entorno ideales para descansar y gozar de la ciudad",5,2018,10,02
46,Atención inmejorable y vistas increíbles a la ciudad,"Pase la noche con mi novia y los dos disfrutamos de una habitación muy cómoda y la terraza con vistas panorámicas a la ciudad. Además, el personal fue muy amable, nos invitaron a una botella de champagne. El único inconveniente fue que no hizo un día demasiado soleado y no pudimos disfrutar de la piscina cómo nos hubiera gustado",5,2018,09,19
46,Sinceramente mucho que mejorar por lo que pagas,"La verdad es que no se por donde empezar, el adjetivo calificativo GL les queda muy grande. ha sido decepcionante desde el minuto cero de nuestra estancia. Iré por partes.
Llegamos al hotel nadie sale a recibirnos, ya que llegamos en coche esperamos que haya alguien que introduzca el coche dentro del parking, pero nadie hace el gesto (tampoco me preocupa en exceso), entramos y a la recepción un chico muy educado no tiene demasiado claro cual es nuestra habitación, nos comenta que no esta preparada a las 12.30 ( mas o menos) y no lo estuvo hasta las 16.20h, algo que para mi no era aceptable, pero aún así no me molesto. 
Después de comer vamos a ver la habitación, andando por el pasillo noto un olor a rancio y me transporta a mi juventud cuando residía UK con sus moquetas típicas que huelen a humedad. 
Llegamos a la habitación y me fijo que la cama esta hecha deprisa y sin cariño pero bueno lo paso por alto, nos hacemos una ducha, me sorprende que el teléfono de ducha sea de mala calidad y tenga cal incrustada, pero el colmo es coger una de las toallas dobladas y encontrarme que una de ellas tiene 6 agujeros, me quedo perplejo y mi mujer me dice que lo diga pero no le doy importancia.. voy sumando puntos para no recomendar a nadie este hotel pero no quiero quejarme, ya que trabajo muchas horas cada día y quiero estar tranquilo.
Vamos al ""SPA"" entre comillas por que no se le puede llamar SPA, una piscina sin mas,pero sin mas con suciedad en el fondo y baldosas rotas, la zona de aguas de los mas dejado que he visto. En el CNB tiene mejores condiciones, solo funcionaba el jacuzzi, el resto con desperfectos que no hacían hábil su uso. Nos vamos de allí a los 5 minutos .
Bajamos al bar, el chico del medio día fue muy atento pero los de la tarde son un DRAMA, 3 camareros para 7 mesas como mucho. 40 minutos de espera para que nos traigan unas cartas, otros 20 min para que nos traigan las cervezas y cuando llegan, el aperitivo de cortesía que traen es espantoso las patatas parecía que hubieran saltado encima de la bolsa, y en ese momento me fijo en el chico que nos las trajo muy educado si pero ni idea de este oficio. Ni formación ni sentido común, y si hay formación es pésima. ( lo se por que he trabajado en hoteles de gran lujo en UK, allí las formaciones duran una semana, 8 horas cada día y hay un examen antes de empezar, si no pasas con un 8/10 no trabajas en ese hotel). Nos fijamos que uno de los trabajadores llama a un responsable para avisar de los errores de sus compañeros pero el responsable parece que no le hace demasiado caso y se va, el camarero se queda con una cara contrariada y sigue con su trabajo.
Después de un día que no esta siendo lo esperado miro la carta del restaurante y no me convence, prefiero ir a la habitación y pedimos la cena.. mientras tanto nos relajamos con mi mujer y mientras estábamos en un momento cariñoso entra una trabajadora sin previo aviso a la habitación. Eso me incomodo mucho. Ella al ver que estábamos dentro cierra rápido y se esconde. Salgo para pedir explicaciones y me dice que es la chica que viene a preparar el baño que era a las 23 pero que esa es su hora de irse y que sin previo aviso decide que entrará para prepararlo a las 22h. INACEPTABLE!!!!!! No diré el la gestión del hotel ya lo sabe. Pero poco no es. 
Aquí ya no estaba demasiado contento.. Nos traen la cena y las cocciones que se pidieron hicieron caso omiso. Al despertarme esta mañana me fijo en la cuenta por que pasamos de un precio de 8€ por un ítem a 17€, repaso la carta y todos los precios de la cuenta están mal en relación con la cuenta final.
Al irnos vamos hacer el check out y le comento mi disgusto a ls recepcionista que se llama Maria, ni me pregunta el por que de mi insatisfacción. Le comento el error y llama a la chica del restaurante me dice que me tengo que esperar, mi contestación educado pero serio le digo que no tengo por que esperarme que ya me esperé suficiente al entrar, que le error es garrafal y que el precio de carta es el que se tiene que cobrar. Su respuesta me parece surrealista y me dice que le tengo que dar un numero de cuenta para que hagan el cargo si es pertinente, mi replica es que se que no se puede cobrar nada mas de lo que pone en carta. Su falta de modales en un Gran Lujo es esperpénticamente cuando me alza el tono de voz con una frase "" A ver Sr. Martinez"" la corto rápidamente,  contestando que no me hable así que no lo aceptaré y de malas maneras me devuelve el depósito que dejamos al hacer el check in. Fuera llueve y nadie sale para acompañarnos con un paraguas hasta el parking... nos mojamos .. y nos vamos ... un cliente cobrado un cliente perdido. No soy el típico que haga comentarios negativos, solo los hago cuando creo que que es una aberración por lo que se ha pagado y en este caso lo ha sido! muy mala experiencia de un hotel que pensaba que estaba entre los 10 mejores de Barcelona... mucho que hacer todavía para llegar a ese puesto",1,2018,09,18
46,De lujo,"Trato execelente y con detalles del hotel que se agradecen. Instalaciones de lujo. Habitación excelente y enorme. Desayuno increible con mucha variedad atendiendo a la necesidad de los clientes. 
Excelente todo!!!",5,2018,09,17
46,Servicio y atención insuperables,"Las instalaciones modernas y elegantes

46,Hotel de lujo en Barcelona muy recomendable,Muy buena relación calidad precio. Hotel muy bien situado en Montjuic con vistas a la ciudad y al mar. La habitación amplia con terraza con buenas vistas ideal para familias. Muy buen servicio y el personal amable y atento. Muy recomendable. Dispone de piscinas tanto exterior como cubierta con spa.,4,2018,09,06
46,Un hotel fantástico,"Un hotel con vistas Preciosas, habitaciones cómodas y amplias. Con piscinas exterior e interior. Un lobby súper agradable y la atención del personal de primera.  La recepcionista Maria encantadora. Volveremos sin duda.",5,2018,09,05
46,Trato exquisito,"Un gran hotel, con un trato excelente de todo el personal. Si no quieres renunciar al lujo de un cinco estrellas y sentirte como en casa, este es el hotel que estáis buscando. Unas vistas excelentes de la ciudad y una excelente comida",5,2018,09,03
46,Room with a view and more,Perfektes 5* Hotel. Wunderschöne Lobby mit edler Terasse. Zimmer mit riesigem Balkon und Ausblick über den Hafen und Barcelona. Besonders aufmerksamer Service. Wahrscheinlich die beste Wahl in BCN und bei unserem nächsten Trip nach Barcelona unbedingt auf dem Plan. ,5,2018,09,02
46,Klare Empfehlung,"Wir sind mit der Metro angereist und hatten zunächst Probleme , das Hotel zu finden, lag klar an uns. Bei der Ankunft sind wir sehr herzlich und unkompliziert aufgenommen worden, durchgeschwitzt wie wir nach dem Fußmarsch auf den kleinen Berg waren.

Wir fanden die Lage für ein Stadthotel außergewöhnlich im besten Sinne, der täglich Fußweg auf den Berg Montjuïc fehlt uns schon der Fitness wegen. Man ist dort weg vom Trubel und hat eine relativ ruhige Umgebung mit Blick ins Grüne und auf den Hafen.

Unbedingt ein Zimmer auf der Seeseite nehmen denke ich, es lohnt sich. Die Balkone sind groß und mit Sitzmöbeln ausgestattet sowie einem elektrisch betriebenen Sonnenschutz. Das Zimmer selbst ist für einige Tage Aufenthalt wirklich passend, 1 Raum Konzept mit einem wie wir fanden guten Bett und vor allem einer AirCon die leise war und funktioniert wie sie soll. Die Zimmereinrichtung ist an einigen Stellen schon etwas älter etc., aber Sauberkeit und Funktion alles im grünen Bereich.

Wir fanden die Möglichkeit abends auf der Terrasse einen Cocktail zu nehmen mit dem Ausblick sehr schön. Frühstück von guter Qualität und mit einer genügenden Auswahl, auch mit der Möglichkeit draussen zu frühstücken, sehr angenehm.
Der hoteleigene kleine Pool ist an das Spa angegliedert und bitete gute Sonnenliegen und wg. der Lage auf dem kleinen Berg auch mal frische Luft, dort kann man die heißen Mittagsstunden ganz angenehmen verbringen.

Wir möchten noch abschließend betonen, dass uns der unaufdringliche und stets sehr lockere und freundliche Umgang mit allen Mitarbeitern sehr gut gefallen hat, das macht bei einem Hotelaufenthalt viel aus. Vom Empfang bis zum sehr engagierten und netten Team abends an der Bar, immer schnell mit Ratschlägen zur Hand und alles im Griff. Wir kommen gerne wieder.",5,2018,08,17
46,Servicio nulo en la terraza del Bar,"Estuvimos la otra tarde en la terraza con las vistas de lujo de Miramar. Por desgracia, el lujo se acaba en las vistas...

La experiencia muy por debajo de cualquier expectativa. Habrá un máximo de 10 mesas en la terraza, hemos contado como mínimo 5 camareros apareciendo de vez en cuando y atendiendo (!). Servicio ultra lento: media hora para pedirte la comanda y otra media hora para servírtela. Me pregunto cómo harán caja en este sitio?

Tuvimos que pedir que nos limpiaran la mesa después de los anteriores huéspedes, porque por su cuenta nos ponen lo que pedimos entre los platos de otros (!). No se dignaron ni a repasar la mesa con un triste paño.

Si pedís aperitivo, los calamares se sirven en un cuenco de juguete, la porción es microscópica a 12€.

Pedimos agua sin gas de tiempo y la trajeron fría. No protestamos por el riesgo de que desaparecieran otra media hora. Sí que pedimos pan y chips de patatas aparte de las bravas que ya traían y nunca llegaron.

Al cobrar querían cobrar una coca-cola que ni siquiera pedimos. Un descontrol y falta de atención impresionantes. Creo que nunca he estado t a n mal atendida en una terraza de hotel de 5*.",1,2018,08,07
46,5 Sterne nicht verdient,"Mein Freund und ich besuchten das Miramar Hotel im Juli 2018. Das Hotel hat die 5 Sterne eindeutig nicht verdient. Es ist sehr in die Jahre gekommen und manche Mobilien wie z.B. das Sofa in unserem Zimmer war sehr schmuddelig und schmutzig.

Aber das, was uns am meisten aufregte, war der Service des Hotels. Es hatte eine Person, die an der Pool-Bar arbeitete und diese war überfordert und sehr ungeschult. Man musste also selber an die Bar gehen und fragen, ob man die Menu Karte haben könne. Auch nachdem man die Menu Karte verlangte, fragte niemand, ob man was bestellen wolle. Eine Familie hat sogar die Teller etc. von den Vorgängern abgeräumt und an die Pool Bar gebracht, sodass sie sich hinsetzen konnten. 

Das Essen an der Pool-Bar war bei diesen Preisen ebenso zu wünschen übrig. Viel zu überteuert bei schlechtem Essen.

Auch die Bar im Hotel hatte bei ungefähr 11 vollen Tischen nur eine Servicekraft, sodass wir für ein Cola nach zwei mal Nachfragen 45 min warten mussten.
Nur der Concierge Service war sehr zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit, dadurch auch die 2 Punkte.

Das Hotel würden wir nicht weiterempfehlen und das Geld besser anders investieren.",2,2018,07,26
46,Espectacular,"Una gran experiencia, el servicio fue excelente y con un trato inmejorable. Estoy seguro que volveremos con mi pareja, recomiendo tambien tomar una copa y disfrutat de las buenas vistas de Barcelona.

Gracias.",5,2018,07,22
46,TRanquilidad en Barcelona,"Increíble piscina con una gran tranquilidad. Habitación premium superbien, amplia cama muy cómoda y muchos detalles en la habitación.

Como mejora la comida del pool bar:mala relación calidad precio.  Tardo bastante en llegar la comida.

Recepcion muy agradables y detalles con los niños",5,2018,07,17
46,Leider Mangelhaft für 5 Sterne,"Vor ein Paar Wochen war ich auf einer Hochzeit eingeladen. Die Veranstaltung lief das  ganze Wochenende im Miramar Barcelona.
Beim Check in am Vormittag wurde klar , dass die Zimmer noch nicht bezugsfertig waren. 
Kein Problem, das ist üblich, dennoch zog sich die Prozedur des Check in ewig, dafür dass man nur unsere Kontaktdaten benötigte, um uns zu erreichen, wenn die Zimmer fertig sind. 
Als wir unsere Zimmer erhalten haben, wurde uns unser Gepäck gebracht, dies dauerte auch wieder länger als üblich und ich bekam leider auch nicht mein Gepäck, sondern dass der Anderen Gäste der Hochzeit. 
Die Ambition diese Kritik hier zu verfassen bekam ich aber erst an dem Tag der Hochzeit selbst. 
Um 14:30 haben wir an der Rezeption ein Taxi für 16 Uhr bestellt und Ein Freund von mir orderte an, dass sein Hemd nochmals gebügelt wird. Laut Information war das mit Express service möglich und das Hemd  sollte auch vor 16 Uhr auf dem Zimmer sein. Als ich um 15:55 in die Lobby ging, sah ich meinen guten freund, der im Stress nach seinem gebügelten Hemd fragte, es wurde einfach vergessen. Nebenbei hörte ich mit, dass sie jetzt erst die Taxis bestellten, dementsprechend waren die Taxis erst um 16:30 da, das wurde auch einfach vergessen. Wir wollten eigentlich pünktlich in der Kirche erscheinen.
Auf meine Frage hin, wie das passieren könnte, bekam ich nur ein Schulterzucken der Rezeption. 
An meinem Letzten Tag fragte ich 5 min nachdem das Frühstücksbuffet geschlossen hatte, ob es eventuell noch möglich wäre 2 Kaffee mit Milch zu bekommen. Obwohl die Antwort ja war, lief die Kellnerin Kopfschüttelnd von mir weg und machte eine Abwertende Bemerkung in Richtung ihres Kollegen. 

Das Hotel ist schön gelegen, kein Zweifel. 
Die Zimmer wirken auf den ersten Blick modern und haben einen tollen Ausblick, auf dein zweiten erkennt man, dass sie ihre besten Zeiten gehabt haben, Löcher in den Fliesen, Glasschiebetüren die Kaputt sind, der Tresor gibt auf einmal den Geist auf.. Das wäre aber alles nicht so schlimm gewesen. 
Auch Fehler dürfen meiner Meinung nach passieren. Aber wenn der service in einem 5 Sterne Hotel so schlecht ist, stimmt das Preisleistung Verhältnis einfach nicht mehr. 
Es beginnt und endet damit, dass man sich für die Fehler, die nun eindeutig passiert sind, nicht ein einziges Mal richtig entschuldigt haben und ich wegen Planlosigkeit des Hotels fast die Hochzeit einer guten Freundin verpasst hätte.",2,2018,07,15
46,Erwartungen nicht annährend getroffen,"Wir waren Anfang Juli für eine Veranstaltung von Freunden im Miramar und hatten aufgrund des Rufes, der Kategorie und des Preises sehr hohe Erwartungen.
Wir kamen gegen 12 Uhr im Hotel an und der Check In drehte sich eigentlich nur darum, das wir vor 15 Uhr das Zimmer nicht bekommen würden. Das Personal gab sich leider auch keine Mühe, das Zimmer vorher fertig zubekommen. Nachdem ich dann endlich um 15:05 den Zimmerschlüssel bekam, war das Zimmermädchen noch im Zimmer. Das Zimmer ist schön eingerichtet und entweder mit Balkon oder Terrasse ausgestattet. Leider sind hier die Möbel in die Jahre gekommen, wir hatten noch Müll vom Vorgänger im Mülleimer, im Bad funktionierte nur das die Hälfte an Licht, die Bodenplatten in der Dusche waren so locker das es eine extreme Verletzungsgefahr darstellt. Auch vom Frühstück hatten wir höhere Erwartungen. Kaffee/Tee ist Selbstbedienung und die Teller stapeln sich meterhoch auf dem Tisch bis endlich mal abgeräumt wird. Ausser das Personal an der Rezeption grüßt leider keiner der Angestellten, stattdessen wird sich unterhalten oder weggeschaut.
Fazit: Unsere Erwartungen wurden leider bei weitem nicht getroffen und es gab nicht mal eine Entschuldigung.

46,Inaceptable limpieza,"Celebramos un evento en el salón Mediterráneo y el grado de limpieza de los baños fue impresentable, sucios, nada mantenidos.Simplemente repugnantes,recibiendo innumerables quejas de nuestros invitados.Vergonzoso!!",1,2018,07,07
46,Noche de hotel familia,"He pasado una noche con mi familia en una suite. De el hotel muy bien realizada muy confortable y muy comoda con unas vistas buenas . 
Tema piscinas tambie buenas pero no adecuadas a ninos no tienen entretenimiento ni canguraje ni nada. Para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas. Tema comida fatal precios por 2 mini bocatas fe desayuno un cafe 28 e ? Cena dos teozos de berenjena 18 e enderio despues de pagar 490 e de habitacion por una noche no entra nada??? Y encima estos precios .... Los trabajadores muy amables pero todos eztranjeros que lo entiendo pero luego llega uno de aqui no los entiende y te llegan las sorpresas de la factura al irte. ",2,2018,07,05
46,Falta de mantenimiento y desayuno decepcionante,"Nos alojamos por una noche en habitación premium, numero 416, este fin de semana. Fantástica habitación con vistas inmejorables y espectaculares a Barcelona incluso desde la bañera. Hay que destacar la amabilidad del personal de hotel y los detalles de bienvenida en la habitación, así como botella de cava y bombones de Oriol Balaguer fantásticos, o detalles de la marca Occitane. Pero creo, que para la categoria del hotel, no puede pasar inadvertida la falta de mantenimiento en diferentes zonas del hotel, así como en la segunda puerta de acceso al hotel que tiene rota una esquina de la parte inferior de uno de los cristales, o los cojines de los sofas del hall de la entrada, así como el barniz levantado de la barandilla de acceso al jardín de la piscina desde la tercera planta, etc... 
Lamentablemente, tampoco está a la altura el desayuno tipo buffet, en el que se hecha de menos mayor variedad de fruta, o simplemente la posibilidad de comer unos huevos recién hechos, o unas salchichas o bacon acabados de hacer y no los tipicos huevos revueltos o bacon/salchichas hecho con anterioridad.... La reposteri, justita! Y lamento decir, que a pesar de la amabilidad del personal del restaurante durante el desayuno, destaca su falta de experiencia. 
Creo que es un hotel que por ubicación tiene ganado parte de su prestigio, pero requiere una renovación, tanto en su decoración como en su mantenimiento para poder continuar presumiendo de sus *****GL .",3,2018,06,18
46,TIEMPOS PASADOS FUERON MEJORES,"Ayer lunes tuve la ocasión de cenar y alojarme en el Hotel Miramar. Por temporada y ubicación, el hotel estaba practicamente vacio. 
Tomamos una copa en la terraza, excelente servicio. Una cena estupenda en el Restaurante del Hotel, nuevamente con un servicio ejemplar.
La habitación 310 sin embargo, no estuvo a la altura. Ni por las vistas, que daban a un lateral del hotel, ni por el diseño, ni por la variedad de los amenities, aunque sean de la prestigiosa marca Occitane. 
Pesima iluminación en el baño.Tremendo levantarte a media noche y no disponer de una luz tenue para ir al aseo. 
No puede tratarse de un hotel de 5* y faltar detalles obvios, como un espejo de aumento en el baño. Desproporcionado tamaño del mismo, con una distribución extraña.El inodoro frente a la ducha y en frente de la bañera. Ninguna intimidad.
La habitación de tamaño medio, como digo sin ningúna particularidad que la haga recordar en un futuro. Una habitación estandar y corriente, como la de muchos hoteles de 4* o incluso de 3*.
El interruptor de la luz del baño, viejo y rascado. Mala impresion.

En fin, hay en Barcelona muchisimas mejores opciones para alojarse. Claramente decepcionada.",3,2018,06,12
46,Excelente evento celebrado en el Miramar,"Celebramos un aniversario familiar en el hotel Miramar. La ubicación del hotel es fantástica, con unas vistas inmejorables. El edificio es precioso, respeta la antigua fachada del edificio Miramar de Tv. 
El aperitivo en la terraza muy agradable y después la comida en el comedor. Todo exquisito y servicio impecable. Y por encima de todo destacar  el excelente trato y amabilidad recibidos que hicieron que nos sintiéramos muy a gusto.
Vale la pena dar una vuelta por Montjuic i pasar por el Miramar.",5,2018,06,12

46,"Hotel maravilloso, spa regular.","Elegimos el Hotel Miramar en Montjuic para celebrar la noche de nuestro aniversario. Lo elegimos expresamente porque vimos que tenía spa, y queríamos una opción relajante para nuestra estancia. 

Sin embargo el spa es bastante justo para un hotel de esta categoría: una piscina interior, una sauna, un jacuzzi y un hammam. Nada más. El resto de “prestaciones” del spa (masajes y tratamientos) son de pago. No hay circuito termal como en la gran mayoría de spas de hoy en día.  Eso si: nosotros visitamos el hotel en invierno, pero si vais en verano podréis disfrutar de una piscina exterior que tenía muy buena pinta.

Por otro lado, el hotel y el trato recibido, son excelentes. La habitación, amplia y cuidada, con una cama muy grande y cómoda y una bañera de ensueño. Las vistas desde el lobby del hotel, preciosas. 

Una muy buena opción para disfrutar de las vistas de Barcelona. ",4,2018,03,18
46,Gran hotel situado en un lugar tranquilo con vistas a toda Barcelona,"Estuve una noche por trabajo, es un hotel de lujo que trata muy bien a los clientes. La habitación esta muy bien, grande, y con productos de baño de lujo.
Esta situado en Montjuic, el pulmon verde de Barcelona, y cerca del centro en taxi.
Como puntos a mejorar, mencionaría la velocidad del servicio del restaurante (aunque la comida, una vez que llega, es buenisima, el pescado con salsa de coco y verduras al vapor es de los mejores que he probado), y los precios del minibar, que son muy altos. Un kitkat a 5,5€... te compras 5 por el mismo precio en el kiosko de al lado...",5,2018,03,09

No hay servicio de aparcacoches, ni botones para equipajes, la recepcion y muchos servicios son atendidos por becarios, con buena voluntad pero en fase de formación, faltan  complementos de baño o son excasos, (champu,  disfusor, limpieza de zapatos... etc) 
En dos que estuve no cambiaron el cd de la musica de ambiente.
Ambiente acogedor, restaurante correcto, buena terraza .

46,"Ubicación, vistas y calidad","Una muy buena experiencia en este hotel. A destacar las vistas y su ubicación, también la tranquilidad en todo el recinto. Su Spa particionado por la marca L'Occitane es muy recomendable, al igual que sus productos. Como único punto a mejorar, la cobertura  Wifi en las habitaciones que apenas permitía navegar. ",4,2018,01,20
46,"Muy bonito, pero no perfecto. ","He visitado el hotel en enero de 2018 y estoy bastante contento con la experiencia en él. 

Las habitaciones son bastante grandes y muy muy bonitas, además de super bien decoradas y con unas vistas increíbles. Lo único malo, es que en mi caso, la ducha se veía que tenia algunas grietas y agujeros e incluso el agua se salía y mojaba todo el suelo, lo que hace que la calidad no esté a la altura de lo que se le pide. 

En todo lo demás la verdad que genial, el hotel es muy bonito y como digo tiene unas vistas espectaculares, además de tener una atención al cliente muy satisfactoria. 

Por último otro punto a criticar es que para acceder a las habitaciones de la planta 6, tienes que bajarte en el ascensor en la planta 5 y subir por una especie de escaleras de incendio hasta la 6, no sé si sera por culpa de reformas, pero creo que podría haber estado mejor resuelto ese problema. ",4,2018,01,15
46,Un hotel con mucho detalle y excelentes vistas,"Nosotros pasamos una noche en el hotel, es perfecto. Las habitaciones muy amplias y comodas, nosotros utilizamos la piscina climatizada y está super bien. Agua caliente y mucha tranquilidad.

46,Restaurante Forastier: Comer con tranquilidad!,"Comida tradicional con pequeños cambios como croquetas rebozadas con cortezas de cerdo o carpaccio de wagyu con mostaza y parmesano y muchas cosas más a buen precio. 
El restaurante no se encuentra situado en el lugar habitual pero a cambio la distancia entre las mesas es muy amplia, las mesas son grandes, las sillas cómodas y el servicio ejemplar. ",5,2017,12,06
46,Increíble ubicación,"Es todo lo que esperaba y mucho más! El hotel tiene una excelente ubicación, como esta en el Montjuic la zona es muy tranquila y con una vistas increíbles. Y lo bueno es que uno tarda solo 10 minutos para llegar al centro.",5,2017,11,30
46,Gran hotel casi perfecto,"Repetía por segunda vez en este magnífico hotel y la verdad me ha dejado una sensación muy diferente a la última. Sigue siendo un hotel increíble con unas vistas de ensueño, pero ya toca renovar... el baño de la habitación tenía varias manchas de humedad, el pequeño sofá tenía una mancha inmensa de ""algo"", al igual que las paredes de la habitación con marcas y golpes... el personal del SPA también estaría genial un trato más amable, nos hubiera gustado contratar una masaje.
Por lo que pagas la noche en el ""Luxury Hotel"" esperaba la habitación al mismo nivel, sigue siendo un hotel increíble y recomendable, pero en mi caso me lo pensare dos veces la próxima vez.",4,2017,11,26
46,Unglaublicher Blick!,"Ich war schon sehr oft in Barcelona, aber dieses Hotel und dieses Zimmer was das tollste das ich in dieser Stadt hatte. Der Ausblick auf die Stadt und das Wasser, ist einfach einmalig. Als Krönung dann noch einen Balkon oder Terrasse, wirklich toll. Das dieses Hotel etwas abseits für einen kurzen Abstecher in die Stadt liegt, spielte für mich keine Rolle, da ich dort mit Roller unterwegs war. Da ich dort jedoch nichts gegessen habe, kann ich darüber nichts sagen. Dafür bietet einfach das Viertel unterhalb des Berges, einfach eine zu tolle Auswahl an Essen. Der Service war immer sehr freundlich und ein Wechsel des Zimmers, wurde entsprochen und ich hatte wirklich ein sehr tolles Zimmer! Ich komme jederzeit wieder, auch wenn es nicht ganz günstig ist.",5,2017,11,19
46,Habitaciones con vistas únicas en la ciudad y una atención incomparable!,"Me hospedé en el hotel por una noche y la experiencia fue muy agradable.

46,CONFORT Y BUENA ATENCIÓN,"Como cabe esperar de un 5 estrellas en Barcelona, el hotel es bello, confortable y la atención muy atenta. La cama es una maravilla. La habitación espaciosa y hasta el último detalle. Dispone de aparcamiento.
Quizás un poco apartado de todo, obligando a depender de taxi o coche, pero la quietud y las vistas desde la terraza y algunas habitaciones lo compensan

46,Perfecto,"Durante todo mi estancia en el Hotel Miramar el personal tanto de recepción como restauración fue muy agradable con nosotros e hicieron que fuera una experiencia digna de repetir. 
Asimismo, la habitación era como me la esperaba y estaba muy limpia. Dado que era el cumpleaños de mi pareja nos sorprendieron con una botella de cava para celebrar la ocasión, hecho que nos sorprendió gratamente. 
Las vistas y las instalaciones están fenomenal. 
Sin duda alguna, una experiencia para repetir.",5,2017,09,12
46,Buen hotel con fantásticas vistas,"Reservé una habitación Premium, y me asignaron una esquinera con vistas al mar y a la montaña. Me pasé muchísimo tiempo viendo la ciudad desde la terraza de la habitación. Nunca la había contemplado con tanta comodidad, a pesar de que habitualmente resido en Barcelona.
Absolutamente nada que objetar al servicio y limpieza del hotel.
Su piscina exterior (y zona adyacente), facilita un total relajamiento.",4,2017,08,31
46,Un 10,"Nos alojamos en una habitación premium y cumplió las expectativas. Todo excepcional. El único ""pero"" que en la habitación no había agua.

Totalmente recomendable, hicimos la reserva a Jonathan Rodríguez y quedemos totalmente encantados por cómo nos preparó todo al detalle en el hotel, incluyendo una ruta de los mejores sitios de Barcelona para visitar, otro agradecimiento al responsable del restaurante ya que su trato fue excelente, no recuerdo su apellido pero su nombre es Jaume.

Una pena volver a Madrid! Encantados con la ciudad y el Hotel!",5,2017,06,18

Das Hotel glänzt mit gutem Service, schönen modernen Zimmern mit grossem Bad und bietet allen Luxus, den man von einem solchen Sternehaus erwartet. Zudem war der Schlafkomfort sehr gut und das Frühstücksbuffet sehr üppig. Und bei schönem Wetter sollte man unbedingt auf die Terrasse sitzen oder im Garten zu Abendessen, herrlich.",4,2017,05,27
46,Obligado si te lo puedes permitir,"No es barato, porque es un hotel de cinco estrellas, pero si te lo puedes permitir, el Hotel Miramar es casi un punto obligado de paso en tu visita a Barcelona. Ubicado en Montjuic, goza de unas vistas magníficas hacia el Puerto y la ciudad, y tiene unas instalaciones excelentes, tanto las zonas comunes como las habitaciones, que son de primera clase por dimensiones, decoración, cuarto de baño y vistas. Y la mía tenía una terraza impresionante. Nada que criticar: buena cama, tranquilidad, limpieza, ducha excelente, bañera con las mejores vistas posibles... El desayuno es estupendo, y en el restaurante el trato es amable y profesional. Lo dicho: no es barato, pero lo vale.",5,2017,05,27

46,"Top Service, schöne Aussicht, Zimmer wirken alt","Die Aussicht aus dem Miramar macht Richtung Meer und Richtung Sagrada Família Spaß. In der schicken Parkanlage vor dem Hotel lässt es sich prima mit Blick aufs Meer flanieren. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, das großzügige Hotel-Treppenhaus macht was her.

Die Zimmer sind allerdings finster und könnten eine Renovierung vertragen - das Gleiche gilt für das dunkle Bad. Die Bedienung der Klimaanlage ist ja in vielen Hotels ein wenig undurchsichtig - im Miramar erschließt sich einem die Funktion gar nicht.

Das Frühstück ist, aus der Sicht eines Mittelueropäers, für spanische Verhältnisse große Klasse.",4,2017,03,05
46,Ubicación y entorno ,"Sin duda algo que hace a este hotel especial es su ubicación en Montjuic. Las vistas son maravillosas.
Destaca su cuidada decoración y habitación cómoda y con una bañera espectacular.

El desayuno es bueno, pero no está a la altura de otros hoteles de su categoría.

46,Zimmer mit Aussicht,"Nach einer Kreuzfahrt mit vielen Aktivitäten suchten wir in Barcelona ein Hotel, dass nicht mitten im Trubel liegt. Das Miramar ist hierfür ideal. Wunderbar auf dem Montjuic gelegen, mit Traumaussicht über den Hafen. Ein Stop des Hop-on/Hop-off Busses liegt 2 Gehminuten entfernt. Ebenfalls liegt die Seilbahnstation direkt vor dem Hotel. Unsere Suite 422 war sehr gross und wohnlich eingerichtet. Einzig das Licht im Zimmer war abends ungenügend. Die von vielen Bewertern bemängelten Zustände beim Unterhalt fanden wir auch in unserem Zimmer vor. Allerdings war es in unserem Fall nicht so störend, dass die Bewertung zurückgestuft werden müsste. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich, das Zimmer aber erst nach 15.00 Uhr bereit. Für südeuropäische Verhältnisse sehr gutes Frühstückbüffet. Das Restaurant abends bietet ausgezeichnete Qualität, jedoch etwas steif, aber es gibt ja genügend Alternativen in Barcelona. Um die Aussenanlagen mit Pool zu nutzen, war es bereits etwas zu kalt. Den Lärm des Schiessstandes auf der Rückseite des Hotels hört man beim Pool ebenfalls recht gut.",5,2016,11,13

Per quanto riguarda il servizio, essendo un albergo 5 stelle, mi sarei aspettata un passaggio della cameriera nel tardo pomeriggio per portar via gli asciugamani usati e preparare il letto per la notte ma questo non è' successo. Anche per quanto riguarda la lavanderia ho consegnato un tailleur da lavare a secco il pomeriggio in cui sono arrivata e mi è stato detto che la consegna sarebbe stata fatta entro le 19 del giorno successivo. Alle 20.30 non avevo ancora ricevuto niente. Ho sollecitato e sono uscita. L'ho ritrovato nell'armadio al mio rientro alle 23. La qualità' e varietà della colazione buona.",4,2016,10,10
46,Keine 5 Sterne!!,"Tolle Lage des Hotels mit schöner Aussicht und in Stadtnähe, allerdings mit einigen Mängeln. 
- Zimmer nach hinten sind sehr laut, Schiessstand direkt nebenan beginnt morgens um 8 Uhr, auch am Wochenende
- der Pool wurde am Samstag Mittag für eine Hochzeit geschlossen und die sehr laute Hochzeitsparty ging bis morgens um 5 Uhr
- Ameisen im Zimmer
- Room service ( nur Kaffee) sehr teuer
- Zimmerreinigung sehr spät und nicht sehr sauber (Teppich noch von den letzten Gästen etwas schmutzig)
- Frühstück nicht das Geld wert (auch keine 5 Sterne) 
- der Pool ist eigentlich sehr schön und die Pool Bar mit freundlichem Personal besetzt. Aber einige Ecken bräuchten etwas mehr Pflege (rostige Schrauben, Abfluss unsauber, Treppe wackelt, ...)
- die Bar und die Aussenterasse ist sehr schön und die Getränke sehr gut, aber das Personal etwas unfreundlich.  

Die Lage und der verbesserte Pool würde uns wieder zu einem erneuten Besuch animieren, aber nur mit einem Zimmer mit Seesicht. Ich hoffe auf einige Verbesserungen bis zum nächsten Besuch.

Hochzeitsparty am Samstag mit lauter Musik bis 5 Uhr morgens ohne das man vom Hotelpersonal vorgängig darauf hingewiesen wird. Personal ist teilweise unmotiviert. Auf dem Zimmer war der Kühlschrank der Minibar kaputt. Kissen auf den Balkonstühlen fehlten. Frühstücksbüffet entspricht nicht 5 Sterne Erwartung. Hotel ist renovierungsbedürftig.,2,2016,09,19

Se equivocaron con nuestros plantos en el restaurante y esperamos más de 1/2h entre plato y plato, poca atención y trato poco educado en la piscina y spa. A parte nos encontramos rallado el coche que teníamos en el parking del hotel y no hicieron nada.",2,2016,09,15
46,5 estrellas GL???,"Fuimos al restaurante del hotel recomendados por las buenas criticas recibidas por parte de amigos y familiares. 
El recibimiento muy malo, no encontraban nuestra reserva y alegaban que el sistema informatico no funcionaba bien. El ritmo del servicio muy lento. La calidad de los platos dejaba bastante que desear. Durante la cena contamos con la presencia de varios gatos que paseaban a nuestro alrededor. En definitiva, ha perdido muchicimo. No creo que vuelva
",2,2016,09,14
46,Simplemente... ¡Perfecto! Un lugar inolvidable,"Al recibirnos en el hotel, nos recibieron con una copa de cava. Una excelente manera de empezar esa estancia ideal en este hotel. Es ideal para el relax en medio de una Barcelona ajetreada, lejos de la playa pero con preciosas vistas al mar. 

La habitación, una de las habitaciones más bonitas del hotel. Vestidor en la habitación independiente a la habitación, escritorio y TV de 47"" en pared con soporte móvil. La luminosidad de esta habitación era espectacular. La cama, una cama inmensa muy cómoda, la verdad que vale la pena dormir. Nuestra habitación, preciosa un balcón doble con cómodas sillones y hamacas donde ver un amanecer enfrente de la playa, sin duda una habitación de lujo y 100% inolvidable. El cargador o altavoz para iphone es antiguo, por lo que no lo pudimos usar. El baño, de dicha habitación, justo debajo de un ventanal enorme una bañera de diseño, no tengas prisa en llenarla, os recomiendo un baño relajante con sus Jabones de l'Occitane. También dispone de plato de ducha. 

Una piscina preciosa, donde la paz reina y la calidad de su comida y comodidad en dicha piscina vale la pena saborear. Os recomiendo en la piscina probar La ensalada de quinoa con aguacate.

El Spa de l'Occitane, no llegamos a probar ningún masaje pero si el jacuzzi, aunque nos pareció un poco flojo, además de realizar masajes disponen de jacuzzi, sauna y hamman, aunque no se podía permanecer dentro por las altas temperaturas en el hamman. Además el dispensador de hielo que había en este espacio, salía muy poco hielo.

El restaurante está por encima de las expectativas con las que iba, una carta de vinos buenísima, recomiendo 100% el plato de tomates ""Cor de bou"", sencillo pero exquisito.

Sin duda un lugar ideal para ir en pareja, que recordaré siempre por mi cumpleaños y la petición de mano que hizo mi pareja en esa preciosa habitación. Sin duda todo un acierto de mi pareja, escoger este hotel, para darme una sorpresa y realizar un acontecimiento tan importante. 

Si quieres paz, tranquilidad, comodidad, lujo y sobre todo disfrutar, este sin duda es tu lugar.",5,2016,09,07

46,Mejor no se dejen nada olvidado..,Nos olvidamos unas gafas en la mesa de la habitación y no las hemos vuelto a ver. Lo dijimos en recepción al salir y nos dijeron que nos llamarían y nadie llamó. Les escribí un correo y me enviaron un correo con otras gafas que encontraron en la piscina. De las gafas de la habitación nada de nada. No parece un hotel de 5 estrellas,1,2016,08,02
46,Increible cena en el mejor ambiente,"El pasado sábado tuvimos la ocasión de disfrutar de una cena de amigas en la terraza del restaurante Forestier. Todo salió a la perfección, la comida excelente pero sobretodo cabe destacar el trato recibido por el personal del hotel. Gracias Javier por una gran velada, con quien estuvimos bromeando y creamos un ambiente muy distendido. Y por supuesto gracias a Larraitz por la organización y perfecta coordinación de la cena. Desde el primer contacto con ella todo fue especial, realmente nos hizo sentir especiales y muy tenidas en cuenta.Todo fue maravilloso y seguro que repetimos pronto. Os recomiendo 100%!! Gracias por todo",5,2016,07,14
46,En la montaña de Montjuïc con vistas al mar,"He estado en diversas ocasiones. La última para una boda.
El hotel tiene mucho encanto. Es moderno, habitaciones espaciosas, espacios al aire libre, piscina... Un hotel muy completo aunque en mi opinión, un poco apartado del centro. Si eso no es un inconveniente, lo recomiendo!",4,2016,06,27
46,Perfect!,"Wir haben, nach mehreren Kurzaufenthalten in der Vergangenheit, diesmal 11 Tage im Hotel verbracht und waren begeistert. Alle ""Probleme"" oder Anfragen wurden zügig in unserem Sinne erledigt und das gesamte Personal war bemerkenswert freundlich. Unserer Zimmer war fabelhaft und alle Wünsche wurden erfüllt. Kommen gerne wieder!",5,2016,06,27
46,Miramar,"Pro: Super Lage, tolle Aussicht 

Con: das Hotel v.a. Das Zimmer in dem wir sind hat sichtbaren renovierungsbedarf.

Personal freundlich, man muss halt klar sagen was man will dann funktioniert das auch alles

Preis für ein 5* in der Lage angemessen und nicht zu teuer

Alles in allem passt es wir würden wieder kommen",4,2016,06,25
46,Un hotel de ensueño,"Pase dos días y una noche con el grupo de trabajo Bare Minerals y estuvimos muy agusto.
El personal muy agradable, pedimos cambiar de habitación y el mozo Mateo superamable nos acompaño y ayudo con el equipaje. La habitación era preciosa, con jabones de baño L'occitane que huelen muy rico, la cama muy grande y confortable y la terraza y vistas de la habitación INCREÍBLES!!! Se veía toda la ciudad y puerto.
El spa es una pasada para no salir de allí en horas.
Salas de reuniones muy amplias y cómodas.
El desayuno buffet muy variado y delicioso; y almuerzo con menú también buenísimo con platos muy  detallistas.
Volveré seguro!!!! Gracias :-) ",5,2016,06,16
46,Pessima esperienza,"La mattina del check-out la reception sbaglia l'addebito su carta di credito di un mio compagno di viaggio e addebita esattamente la cifra opposta a quella che avrebbe dovuto. 

Il pomeriggio, la reception consegna il mio trolley ad un altro cliente a me sconosciuto e mi rendono il bagaglio solo poco prima della partenza in aeroporto.

Per scusarsi, il manager dell'hotel mi telefona il giorno successivo proponendomi di tornare nella loro struttura e assicurandomi un trattamento di favore. Ho scritto un'e-mail per avere un preventivo due settimane fa, sono ancora in attesa di risposta.

Trattamento inaccettabile da ogni hotel, men che meno da un 5 stelle. Sconsigliato.",1,2016,06,16
46,muy lindo,"lindo , limpio , servicio freindly , y sobre todo la ubicación
sin duda cuando volveré dormiré otra vez por allí...gracias  a todo el equipo y vuestra hospitalidad  ......sin duda recomendable , el precio bastante alto",5,2016,06,13
46,Fin de Semana Romántico,"La ubicacion del hotel es perfecta, desde las habitaciones con terraza en la esquina del hotel puedes ver toda Barcelona. El mobiliario de las habitaciones es adecuado, aunque la television y los dispositivos multimedia estan anticuados. Lavdecoracion de la habitacion tambien es adecuada y la estancia amplia, aunque la ducha del cuarto de baño no funcionaba correctamente. Las instalaciones del hotel estan un poco anticuadas, uno de los ascensores no funcionó en todo el fin de semana y algunas zonas del spa no funcionaban. El desayuno lo mejor.",4,2016,05,22
46,Buen hotel ,"El hotel muy guapo y a un precio más que correcto.
La atención de los conserje estupenda.
La atención de bar deja algo a desear por falta de personal de terraza, igualmente todos encantadores.
El restaurante desde el servicio a la cocina un desastre!!me esperaba de un hotel de este género una carta moderna y no de viajar al año 80.
Año 80 no conseguido...
Una decepción ",3,2016,05,17
46,Cena de final de curso,"Eramos 200 personas, entiendo que sea mucha gente pero tenian un servicio pésimo, los camareros al principio secos, leugo bordes y gritandonos por que para 200 personas havian 3 camareros y no davan abasto. La comida seca, de poca calidad y lo poco de carne que habia era malissima y con textura a harina. El vino de poca calidad por el precio que pagamos.",1,2016,05,05
46,Un sitio para evadirse...,"Cocina de mercado que cuida la calidad del producto. Carta escueta con opciones adecuadas a cada gusto y paladar. A destacar la sobriedad y excelencia en la elaboración. 
El local, de cuidada decoración, se haya en una atalaya  abierta al mar. 
Podremos disfrutar de las mejores vistas de la ciudad  y de su puerto,  desde este mirador, rodeado de jardines, enclavado en la vertiente de la mágica montaña de Montjuic. 
Resulta muy apetecible el paseo por los alrededores y cabe la posibilidad de coger el teleférico, en la cercana estación de Miramar, que nos lleva a la Barceloneta, donde completar, junto al mar, un día distendido.",4,2016,05,01
46,Fantastico,"Nos alojamos en este hotel por los buenos comentarios que se leen en internet, la atención desde el primer minuto,  fue de un hotel de estas características , servicio y amabilidad por el personal de recepción , nos alojamos en una habitación con vistas al puerto y a la ciudad , una verdadero,lujo, tener enfrente tan buenas vistas, la habitación grande y espaciosa con todos los detalles , no cenamos en el hotel por motivos de trabajo , pero si que probamos el desayuno, muy buena calidad y variedad de productos , un servicio impecable y atencion por parte del personal de sala. Volveremos seguro.",5,2016,04,29
46,Cinque stelle un po' vintage,"La posizione è incantevole e rende giustizia al nome: non si vede solo il mare, ma anche quasi tutta Barcellona (casermoni dei quartieri popolari inclusi, purtroppo) e la Sagrada Familia. L'albergo è evidentemente stato costruito o pesantemente ristrutturato negli anni Novanta, e propone nel bene e nel male lo stile di quel periodo. È comodissimo, con stanze molto ampie e personale gentile e poliglotta, ma porta più di un segno dei tempi (per esempio, la vasca con il tappo che non funziona). Peccati anche veniali, se fosse un quattro stelle. Ma un ""cinque superiore"" non se li può permettere.",3,2016,04,25
46,Magnifico almuerzo!,"Elegimos mi pareja y yo el sabado pasado el restaurante forestier, porque unos amigo quedaron muy contentos con el menú degusta. y el trato personal. Y la verdad que no fallaron en ninguna detalle durante el almuerzo, genial! El maitre (Jaume) estuvo a la altura de una restaurante de un hotel de 5*GL, simpleme mente perfecto. La verdad que nos soprendieron gratamente y muy posiblemente volvamos a repetir la experienci en el restaurante Forestier. ",5,2016,04,20
46,Imposible reservar en el spa,"Llevamos 3 días llamando a este hotel para poder hacer una reserva en su spa (tenemos un bono regalo que incluye entrada al spa y masaje para dos personas).
No hemos conseguido hablar con la persona que se encargar de gestionar la agenda del spa. Cada vez que llamamos, hablamos con el personal de recepción que, muy amablemente, intentan pasarme, me cogen nota y me dicen que me llamarán en algún momento. Pero eso no ha ocurrido aún en tres días.

Considero que es intolerable que un hotel de esta categoría tenga un servicio de recepción de spa tan pésimo. No sé si al final conseguiremos reservar (hemos solicitado a la empresa que gestiona el bono que nos devuelvan el dinero).

No lo recomendaremos a nadie, hay hoteles con mucho mejor nivel de atención al cliente.",1,2016,04,06
46,Tolles Hotel in traumhaft ruhiger Lage,"Wir waren im Vorjahr in einem der Strandhotels und fühlten uns dort sehr gut aufgehoben ABER: Ruhe, Lage, Ausstattung, Personal und Service im Miramar waren einfach sehr viel besser. Abends auf dem Balkon zu sitzen und in Ruhe den Tag Revue passieren lassen...das war einfach super!!! Fahren sicher im Herbst nochmal hin!!!",5,2016,04,06
46,"masaje, spa y comida","Fuimos con unos amigos hacernos un masaje, spa y comida, todo fue muy bien, la recepción del entrada, nos trataron muy amable, no dijeron donde teníamos que aparcar, nos acompañaron al spa, con mucha amabilidad, el hotel muy bonito por dentro, nos hicimos un masaje de 1 hora, fue espectacular, os recomiendo que vayáis hacerlo, sales nuevo, desde los pies a cabeza, muy profesionales en este sentido, luego fuimos al spa, bajo mi punto no me gusto mucho, muy simple, un jacuzzi, sauna y piscina, poco mas, la comida otra cosa muy buena, el servicio muy bueno y con profesionalidad muy alta, nos dijeron los platos y la verdad es que todo muy bueno, seguro que repetiremos, os recomiendo que vayais solo por probar el masaje.",4,2016,03,15
46,"Excelente, pero le falta un poco para ser sublime!!","Nos alojamos mi pareja y yo un viernes, la atención muy correcta, ofreciéndonos bebida a la llegada y con mucha simpatía.
La habitación, enorme, limpia y con bonitos detalles. Una pena que las cortinas que separan la bañera no se puedan correr para unirse con el resto de la habitación, en las fotos del hotel sí se podía!
Destacar que el párquing es gratuito, cosa a agradecer en Barcelona!
El desayuno, espectacular, todo exquisito y con una atención con una enorme sonrisa siempre.
Sin duda, repetiremos!!
PD: Se agradecería que la dirección del hotel, ya que contesta dando las gracias a los comentarios positivos, lo haga para los negativos, ya que, por ejemplo en mi caso, nos guiamos mucho por esto y si el hotel no contesta, da una imagen de dejadez hacia el cliente.",4,2016,03,13
46,Tolles Hotel,"Sehr schönes Hotel in super Lage. Die Shopping Strasse von Barcelona ist innert 15min zu Fuss erreichbar. Gutes Breakfast und gute auswahl. Kaffee mit Nesspresso top. Die Zimmer sind schön, leider war meins bereits defekt. Eine Fensterscheibe Scheibe hatte ein riesen Sprung. An einer Wand löste sich bereits die Tabete. Auch bei der Decke wo die Klimaanlage ist sah man das Wasser Spuren hinterlassen haben. Das zimmer an sich ist sehr gross und auch das bett ist kingsize. Die matzratze hatte schon ein wenig gelitten. Das personal ist freundlich und zuvorkommen. Würde wieder gehen.",4,2016,03,13
46,Super Hotel in einer super Stadt,"Sehr guter Hotel in einer sensationellen Stadt. Hoch über Barcelona gelegen inklusive Ausgangspunkt für Touristic Bus und Cable Car Station. 

Sehr freundliche Bedienung vom Ein- bis zum Aus Checken. Auch das Restaurant im Hotel kan empfohlen werden für das Abendessen.

Natürlich ist auch der Preis entsprechend einem 5 Stern Hotel 😜",5,2016,03,08
46,Deja mucho que desear,"Lamentablemente no pude disfrutar de su SPA que tanto anuncian ya que lo tienen completo durante los próximos dos meses. Ojo si se alojan porque no podrán disfrutar de la oferta completa de este Hotel Cincoestrellasgranlujo.  Además de esto, total inflexibilidad, incomprensión y trato deblorables al cliente por parte de su personal de atención.",1,2016,02,17
46,Schöne Lage mit einigen Wermutstropfen,"Aufgrund der Lage am Montjuic ist die Aussicht am Morgen, wie auch am Abend, sehr schön. Beim Frühstück sind die Tische auf der Terrasse sehr begehrt. Freundliches und kompetentes Service und ordentlicher Gesamteindruck. Großes Zimmer mit Terrasse, wobei die meisten technischen Spielereien nicht funktioniert haben und auch schon mal die eine oder andere Tür klemmt.",4,2016,02,12
46,Como una princesa,"Me encantó. Fue un regalo de mi chico por mi cumpleaños y la verdad es que me sentí como una princesa. Me regalo la habitacion deluxe.
A la bienvenida, cava o agua. Despues te suben las maletas. En la habitacion, una mega bañera en el baño. A demas de la ducha, claro. Con albornoces y zapatillas para ir al spa que también esta incluido. Y la cama.... dios!!! Pero que cama tan comoda!!! No me podia ni despertar... que bien se estaba!! Y musica para poner(poner cd o usb; sino ya hay un cd puesto)  tanto en la habitacion como en el baño.
Sin olvidarme de las vistas... dios, que pedazo de vistas de barcelona!! Nosotros nos toco ver el puerto, pero fue genial.
Me hubiera gustado algun obsequio por mi cumpleaños, porque los de recepcion lo vieron que era el mismo dia del hospedaje, pero bueno no pasa nada. 
Muy amables todo el personal.",5,2016,02,09

46,Fa fantastico per tutto,"Dovendo passare tre notti per lavoro ho riscelto questo hotel....
Ottima posuzione, camere fantastiche e molto pulite...spa con vasca idromassaggio e piscina riscaldata coperta...
Un consiglio...lasciate perdere il ristorante....veramente troppo caro...",5,2016,01,20

46,"Ottimo hotel, camere molto belle, la vista superba","Siamo stati in famiglia in questo albergo, abbiamo preso una camera con la vista sul mare, con una gran terrazza. La camera molto molto bella, unica pecca forse è che l'arredamento è, seppur di ottima qualità, un po' vecchio rispetto ad altri begli alberghi in Barcellona come W, Grand Marina. Però la vista sicuramente è la cosa migliore di quest'albergo, veramente mozzafiato. Bello il bar, non ho mai provato il ristorante, se non per la colazione, che a dire il vero è abbastanza scarsa, non di qualità, che è ottima, ma come varietà, soprattutto la colazione dolce non ha molte cose, comunque se siete qui per lavoro e dovete solo fare colazioni veloci, andrà più che bene. Se dovessi tornare a Barcellona riprenderei sicuramente una stanza in questo stupendo albergo.",4,2016,01,17
46,Überteuert ,"Sehr schön gelegen oben am Hang mit herrlichen Blick auf die Stadt , schöne garten- Poolanlage , Suite sehr angenehm mit Terrasse und grandioser Aussicht , Freistehende Badewanne .
Aber : viel zu teuer für das in die Jahre gekommene Hotel , essensauswahl im Restaurant sehr eingeschränkt und dafür noch teuerer , Personal : sehr überheblich , wenig service orientiert , wir waren jedesmal die einzigen Gäste im Foyer und mindestens 3 -4 Mitarbeiter zu der Zeit an der Rezeption , die sich lebhaft Untereinander unterhielten und Ansonsten vor Desinteresse strotzten, kein Doorman, Koffer muss man selber schleppen , Taxi sich selber kümmern : und das für dieses horrenden Preis : Frechheit !

46,Workshop in Barcelona,"Der Empfang an der Reception war bereits freundlich und kompetent. Bei meinem Inspektionsbesuch im Oktober bekam ich einen kostenlosen Upgrade, wo ich doch ""nur"" die Inspektionsrate bezahlte. Im November war ich dann mit einer grösseren Gruppe geschäftlich dort. Wiederum freundlicher Empfang und effiziente Abwicklung der Formalitäten. Wunderbares Zimmer mit Meersicht und grossem Balkon und riesigem Badezimmer. Schade, konnte ich das Zimmer nicht mehr nutzen aber wir waren zum Arbeiten dort. Der Tagungsraum war grosszügig aber hatte leider kein Tageslicht, was für fast drei Tage manchmal etwas schwierig war. Dafür war die Kaffeepause jeweils unter den Orangenbäumen und mit Weitsicht aufs Mittelmeer. Das Frühstück, Mittagessen und Abendessen war mit regionalen Zutaten lecker zubereitet. Der Service effizient und unsere Gruppe on 48 Personen bekam das Abendessen am ersten Abend innerhalb kurzer Zeit. Mittagessen war jeweils Buffet mit schöner Auswahl frischer Produkte. Die zuständige Event-Managerin des Hotels verstand ihr Handwerk und konnte bei grossen und kleinen Problem helfen. Ich und die Teilnehmer waren sehr zufrieden mit dem Hotel. Ein paar wenige bekamen ein Zimmer zur Rückseite, die halt leider keine Aussicht hatten und da waren sie enttäuscht. Aber alles in allem ein tolles Hotel, das zwar etwas vom Zentrum weg liegt aber ruhig ist und sich für einen Workshop gut eignet. Es ist zu Fuss (15 Minuten) oder mit Taxi aber nicht weit von der Rambla entfernt. Ich würde da jederzeit wieder hin gehen.",5,2015,11,16
46,Schönes klassisches Hotel mit traumhafter Aussicht,"Wir waren drei Tage in diesem schönen klassischen Hotel, mit traumhafter Aussicht auf Barcelona und Hafen. Zugegeben, das Hotel ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber es wird ständig renoviert und ist trotzdem immer noch im Schuss. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig und mit allem ausgerüstet was man so braucht. Das Personal ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Die Umgebung auf dem Montjuïc lädt zum spazieren ein und mit dem Transbordador Aeri del Port, kommt man praktisch vom Hotel mitten in den Hafen und zum Meer. Der Wellnessbereich ist leider zu klein, etwas bieder und nach Geschlechter aufgeteilt. Aber sonst kann man dieses Hotel nach wie vor empfehlen...",4,2015,11,12
46,Desconexión en una ubicación excepcional de la ciudad condal.,"Si buscas un lugar donde desconectar en una habitación con vistas de la ciudad condal, en la que no te falte de nada y el lujo del detalle se refleje en todo lo que utlices, este es tu hotel. Si además te apetece disfrutar de una buena piscina interior o exterior o de un masaje relajante, aquí también lo puedes encontrar. El trato correcto pero demasiado serio, quizás un poco más de proximidad haría de la estancia una experiencia insuperable. Visita su bar y terraza, simplemente para disfrutar.",5,2015,11,03
46,Luxus über Stadt,"Perfekte Herberge abseits des Rummels der Rambla mit allen Anehmlichkeiten. Mit dem Taxi sehr schnell zum Kongresszentrum, zu Fuss zur Metro oder mit der Seilbahn vor der Haustür zum Strand. Atemberaubende Aussicht über die Stadt. Zimmer bereits etwas abgewohnt und Service nicht sehr aufmerksam. In einem 5 Sterne Hotel erwarte ich das mir die Koffer auf das Zimmer gebracht werden etc. darum auch der kleine Abzug sowie für die 28 Euro Frühstuecksgebühr- etwas überzogen. Allen in allem jedoch ein mehr als gelungener Aufentalt.",4,2015,10,25
46,"Precioso, romántico y agradable","Nos gustó todo, desde la limpieza de las habitaciones, el personal que nos atendió (espectacular) hasta la decoración y disposición de la habitación, los jardines y las vistas alrededor del hotel. Una estancia que repetiría con gusto.

El ''pero'': El precio del restaurante y del desayuno me parecieron un poco caros.",5,2015,10,18
46,"bello , peccato per errore","bell hotel e bellissima posizione panoramica, ottima colazione e camere belle peccato che avessi riservato una camera e poi me ne fosse data un altra e solo dopo aver insistito e aver ricevuto piu volte un :"" tutte le camere sono piene"" mi abbiamo dato cio ch emi spettava. per il resto nulla da dire.",3,2015,10,18

46,Giudizio dello snack,Ci siamo fermati per un veloce snack poco prima delle 15 ordinato 1 piatto di pan tomato con jamon e uno con acciughe - siamo stati serviti dopo 45 minuti e c'era solo un altro tavolo !! Ovviamente il bicchiere di cava rosado era caldo quando ho iniziato a mangiare - oltre a questo il prosciutto era tutto grasso e la parte magra secca stantia - le acciughe ultra normali niente a che vedere con le celebrate cantabriche - conto salato!,2,2015,09,27
46,"3 Tage Barcelona, ein zauberhaftes Hotel mit engagiertem intern. Personal in Ausbildung","Schon bei der Ankunft wurde ich positiv überrascht: Ein Upgrade mit Meerblick wurde preiswert angeboten. Als ich das Zimmer betrat war ich begeistert. Die Einrichtung ist modern und geschmackvoll gehalten. Der Blick von der geräumigen Terrasse einfach
traumhaft. Barcelona lag mir inclusive des Hafens praktisch zu Füßen. Es war bald dunkel und die Ruhe und das Lichtermeer Barcelonas werde ich vermissen.
Auch das Bad mit Blick auf den gediegenen Pool- und Gartenbereich war toll. Eine freistehende Wanne mit Tablett + Civas Regal 18 years habe ich bis Mitternacht genossen.
Im Gegensatz zu meinen Vorkritikern kann ich keine Mängel vermelden. Das junge Praktikumspersonal ist auch mir aufgefallen. Geführt von einem perfekten Oberkellner aus Rotterdam wurde auch das Restaurant zu einem Erlebnis der Sonderklasse.
Als Delikatesse gab es zum Schluss 6 selbstgemachte Pralinen von Haus. Die Rechnung war mit Entree + Vorspeise(Carpaccio vom Fisch) Hauptgang gebratetenen Fisch auf Gemüse (Seebarsch) Dessert Eisvariationen (suuuper) Wasser, 1 Flasche Weiswein (Fehlgriff meinerseits der Empfehlung des kellners zu folgen ABER ICH wollte ja einen lokalen Wein (der schrecklich schmeckte) Espressi und netten Konversationen über die Fussballer Spaniens und Deutschland mit dem Kellner und schottischen Gästen für nur 82 € sehr übersichtlich!!! Danke dem perfekten OK.
Zusammenfassung: Ich komme gerne wieder und das bald!

46,"If you can, choose another option in Barcelona, this is not a 5 star hotel!!!","+Alba y Laia, las únicas del personal de recepción que se salvan, unos encantos. -Productos de baño.

-El proceso de check in es lo peor que he visto en mi vida (20 minutos y sin apenas dirigirnos la palabra). -Te hacen una preautorización en tu tarjeta de crédito del importe de tu habitación. -Me hicieron sentir como una delincuente cuando, además, me bloqueaban otros 50€ como ""fianza"". -Desayuno 28€. -En la habitación ni siquiera hay agua para beber. -La habitación que reservamos no corresponde ni con la descripción ni con las fotos de booking.com (un engaño). -Clarisse, la chica de recepción carece de modales mofándose con su superior a nuestra cara sobre lo que ocurría con la habitación (""pasa siempre, nos dijo""). -La mujer de la limpieza entró en la habitación por la mañana con nosotras dentro,aún estando puesto el cartel de no molestar (habíamos pedido un late check out a las 13.00). -Este hotel no es un 5 estrellas gl, ni siquiera un 5 estrellas, mirad otras opciones si no queréis perder vuestro dinero. -Las instalaciones de la habitación están con manchas, moho, moqueta y tapiceria sucia, ducha a punto de caerse... Una auténtica verguenza. ¿Lo mejor? Poder advertiros de todo ello",1,2015,08,21
46,Hotel Excelente para desconectar muy bien comunicado con la Ciudad,"Merece mucho la pena este hotel, zonas comunes del hotel son increibles y las habitaciones espectaculares, ideal para ir con tu pareja una noche de locura!!! os recomiendo mucho este hotel es una autentica pasada!!!! La piscina es una pasada!!!! tiene dos una exterior y una interior que estan de muerte!!",5,2015,08,14
46,Increible habitacion,"Fuimos por san valentin i la habitacion era increible, lo unico que la comida en la habitacion no era de un hotel 5 estrellas, pero simplemente la habitacion era increible!! Vamos a volver seguro!!!!!!! Tambien cojimos el parking para guardar cotxe",5,2015,08,04
46,Fin de semana ,"Debería ser de 4 estrellas y no mas. No puede en un hotel de este precio que no tenga una persona a la llegada de los pasajeros y sus maletas, el tv no funciona bien sobre todo los canales HD, que la capacidad del restaurante sea de unas pocas mesas o que el primer día el agua de la ducha este fría! ",3,2015,08,02
46,Traumhaftes Hotel,"Wunderbares Hotel an einer tollen Lage mit traumhaftem Ausblick. Unser Zimmer war sehr geräumig, sauber und ruhig gelegen (leider keinen Blick auf's Meer). Der Pool war herrlich, leider waren die Liegestühle immer schon besetzt. Wir würden sofort wieder hierher kommen. Die etwas abgelegene Lage ist perfekt nach einem Tag im Gewühl der Stadt.",5,2015,07,30
46,Fantastischer Ausblick!,"Da wir einige Stunden zu früh im Hotel eingetroffen sind, durften wir dann unsere grossen Koffer, bei der Rezeption abgeben! Mussten aber für das einchecken, das Zimmer beziehen, bis 15:00 Uhr warten! Das war aber das einzige Negative, das wir im Hotel Miramar erfahren haben! 
Die Lage vom Hotel Miramar ist einmalig, das Hotel liegt inmitten von einem schön angelegten Park, oberhalb von Barcelona auf dem Berg Montjuïc. 

Wir haben für eine Nacht, ein Premium-Doppelzimmer, mit Terrasse gebucht! 
Inklusive kostenlosem WLAN. Bad mit separater Badewanne, Dusche. 

Für das Frühstück haben wir den Zimmerservice beansprucht. Das Frühstück wurde uns auf den grossen schönen Balkon gebracht, herrlich mit der tollen Panoramasicht zu frühstücken!
Beim Betreten, des sehr schönen, modernen Zimmers und der grossen Terrasse,
bestückt mit 2 Liegen und einer Lounch-gruppe, haben wir über den fantastischen, einmaligen Ausblick gestaunt! Wunderschön, einfach Grandios, Blick, auf Stadt und Hafen.
Wir haben auf der Terrasse, vom Restaurant Forestier, das Abendessen eingenommen. Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und das Essen war gut. 
Schade, dass wir nur eine Nacht im Hotel MIRAMAR bleiben konnten, wir wären lieber viel länger geblieben. Nächstes Mal wenn wir in Barcelona sind, werden wir mindestens eine Woche im schönen Hotel MIRAMAR wohnen wollen!",5,2015,07,26
46,simplemente espectacular,"Es difícil encontrar un lugar en donde se pueda descansar en un verano en Barcelona, con los ríos de turistas por las calles y la barceloneta hecha un tapete de pareos parece increíble escapar del caos y el incesante calor. Este hotel lo tiene todo para un fin de semana de descanso, un personal completamente multicultural que están a tu total disposición. Una piscina justo al final de mont juic con unas vistas privilegiadas y su exclusividad permite que justo en la temporada más alta del año , no te encuentres nadando junto a mas de 6 personas, a las que probablemente nisiquiera escucharas por que es un ambiente que invita a la relajación así que el único ruido que se escucha es la música chill out de fondo. Habitaciones espectaculares con unas vistas preciosas, un spa que realmente vale la pena. Un hotel cuyo precio elevando se justifica por completo con su inigualable ubicación e impecable servicio.",5,2015,07,20
46,Esperaba mucho más de un hotel de esta categoría.,"Parece que la categoría de Gran Lujo sólo la tienen por los espacios en las habitaciones.
Los espacios comunes no están cuidados y el servicio es flojo, sin embargo es personal es amable y se esfuerza para ofrecer un buen servicio.",3,2015,07,13
46,Super Alternative für Ruhesuchende in Barcelona!,"Wir haben unseren Kurzurlaub zum einen mitten in der Altstadt im Trubel als auch in der Ruhe auf dem Berg Montjuïc verbracht. Das Hotel hat eine tolle Aussicht auf den Hafen, die Zimmer sind großzügig und man braucht nicht viel Aufwand, um doch wieder mitten in die Stadt zu gelangen. Der Service ist nett, aber manchmal etwas gestresst, es ist halt ein größeres hotel. Der Poolbereich ist sehr schön, war aber leider während unseres Besuchs under construction, so dass wir ihn nicht nutzen konnten. Aber sehr schön und hält nicht nur eine größere Badewanne, wie ihn die meisten Hotels in der Innenstadt auf dem Dach haben. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder hier buchen!",4,2015,07,12
46,MiraTodo,"Abbiamo avuto una camera angolare stupenda,il mare di fronte e tutta la città a sinistra; la notte spettacolo assicurato. Se piace un posto riservato e tranquillo  dopo le escursioni in città Miramar fa per voi Ma il meglio dell'hotel è l'accoglienza: staff gentile e disponibile e il Concierge è di categoria. La piscina è poco profonda: occhio! A mio avviso i bagni sarebbero da rifare. Se prendete il Barcelona City Tour c'è una fermata proprio davanti l'hotel.",4,2015,07,07
46,las vistas del bar son buenisimas,"vivo cerca de la ciudad y no acostumbro a dormir en hoteles de la ciudad pero si me gusta ir a tomar algo o a cenar a ellos en esta ocasion simplemente fui a tomar una copa a la terraza y tengo que decir que me encanto, primero era un poco reticente porque a cien metros hay otra terraza parecida en la que la experiencia fue lamentable pero tengo que decir que solventaron todas mis dudas con un servicio excelente.

ya tengo ganas de volver, esta vez espero poder usar el restaurante que estava cerrado.

46,"Sólo probé el ""Spa"" y no volveré","Me regalaron un bono para spa + masaje en el Hotel Miramar. Es un hotel de 5 estrellas en Montjuic, muy bonito por fuera y con muy buenas vistas. Lo que pasa es que el spa no es ningún spa: es un jacuzzi, una sauna y unos baños de vapor dentro de un vestuario. Los baños de vapor olían tanto a humedad que era imposible entrar. El masaje está bien, pero tampoco es nada del otro mundo. Lo único bueno es que te dejan acceder a la piscina descubierta del hotel y disfrutar de las vistas. Pero poco más.",2,2015,06,29
46,Maravilloso!!,"Volveré encantada!
La arquitectura me enamoró, su personal es muy amable, la habitaciones con todo lo necesario.
El jardín es perfecto para enamorarse....
Este hotel,  tiene el esplendor que lo hace sobresalir.",5,2015,06,24
46,Buen sitio para escaparse dentro mismo de Barcelona y más si vas al St. Jordi,"Un buen hotel, al que fuimos con motivo de un concierto en el Palau Sant Jordi. Está al lado y a la vez alejado de la ciudad, por lo que es muy, muy agradable para estar tranquilo (si no fuese por el jardinero que se dedicó a cortar el césped de la piscina toda la mañana, en horario ya de apertura y fastidiando la calma de los que prendíamos descansar junto al agua).
Buenas instalacions, personal muy amable y hotel recomendable, a excepción de lo del jardin, que uno espera una organizaciôn que no moleste al cliente en esta categoría de hoteles.",5,2015,06,23
46,Luxus in Barcelona,"Ein wunderschön gelegenes Hotel auf einem Berg mit der Sicht auf das Meer und die Altstadt von Barcelona. Sehr stilvoll eingerichtet, modern, mit toller Poolanlage in einem gepflegten Garten. Man hat das Gefühl, auf dem Land zu sein, ist aber mitten drin, nur wenige Gehminuten vom Zentrum und Ramblas.
Zum Kreuzfahrthafen sind es max. 19 Minuten mit dem Taxi, eine optimale Unterkunft vor- oder nach der Kreuzfahrt.
Das Ein- und Auschecken an der Rezeption ist sehr persönlich und streßfrei, mit einem Glas Sekt. Hier ist der Gast noch König, wir werden ganz sicher wieder können und dann wohl auch ein paar Tage länger bleiben und die Annehmlichkeiten nutzen.",5,2015,06,10
46,Boda,"Cuando decidimos que el Hotel Miramar sería el lugar de celebración de nuestra boda acertamos de pleno. Todo salió perfecto. Es de destacar la absoluta profesionalidad de todas las personas que trabajaron aquel día para hacer que nuestra celebración fuera inolvidable. El servicio fue excelente y siempre coordinado de una forma extraordinaria por Víctor. Y Rosa, cuya capacidad de organización es digna de elogio, hizo un trabajo espectacular haciendo posible todas nuestras peticiones.
Recomendamos sinceramente el Hotel Miramar como un lugar ideal para celebrar este tipo de acontecimientos.",5,2015,06,04
46,Excelente hotel decepcionante spa,"Ubicación: Lejos del centro pero vistas espectaculares, rodeado de parques.
Habitación: Muy amplia y limpia, baño impresionante, gran terraza con vistas sobre la ciudad.
Desayuno: Magnífico, variado y de calidad, servicio muy atento. Bonitas vistas.
Zonas comunes: Hall y terraza muy agradable para tomar una copa o comer con vistas sobre el mar.
Hay que pagar aparcamiento, teniendo en cuenta lo que vale la habitación deberia ser gratuito.
SPA: Muy decepcionante, para nada digno de un hotel 5*. Simplemente hay una piscina (correcta) y un pequeño jacuzzi en el vestuario (capacidad para 2 personas)... eso no es un SPA.",4,2015,05,09
46,Super Alternative,"Wir waren drei Nächte hier und es ist ein super Haus, für alle, die nicht direkt im Trubel der Stadt wohnen wollen (Taxi von der Ramblas ins Hotel 6 Euro). 
Die Zimmer sind riesig, das Personal super freundlich und auch fix. Das Frühstück war klasse, der Blick einmalig. Man kann Morgens direkt vom Haus aus loslaufen und ein wenig joggen, rund um das alte Olympiastadion, auch da gibt es schlechtere Strecken. 
Der Ausblick auf den Hafen ist grandios. 
Fitness muss noch ein wenig an der Qualität arbeiten und für einen Münchner ist es natürlich schade, dass es kein frisches Bier gibt. Ansonsten ist das Haus top, Vielen Dank für Alles",5,2015,05,05
46,Wellness ~ Spa & Masaje Ritual de la India,"Contrariamente a algunas opiniones que leí en TripAdvisor, adquirí el servicio a través de LetsBonus para un masaje y una tarde de relax con mi madre el día de su cumpleaños y no pudo sorprenderme más. Con el descuento del e-commerce nos salió por 72€, incluyendo circuito de spa y masaje de 60 minutos Ritual de la India. Todo el personal fue muy amable y servicial desde que pisamos la entrada; nos acompañaron con gusto a la zona Wellness y nos recibió la terapeuta con una sonrisa. En ningún momento sentimos que bajaran el nivel de atención por haber adquirido el servicio con el suculoso descuento que ofrece LetBonus, al contrario, personalmente me sorprendió lo atenta que fue Luisa, la terapeuta, y la calidad del masaje fue un 8 alto. 
Con respecto al hotel, instalaciones y decoración merece las 5* GL, de esos que mires donde mires todo es belleza y armonía, quizás lo único que podría mejorar es el exterior del edificio de habitaciones, desde la piscina exterior se ve un poco simple si lo comparas con el resto del hotel, pero tampoco es trascendente, todo lo demás compensa con creces.

Buena localización, cerca de Las Ramblas, del Puerto y de zonas turísticas, pero retirado del bullicio de la City. 

Volveremos sin duda, pasamos una tarde maravillosa :)",4,2015,04,30
46,Fantastico posto per lavoro e relax,"Dovendo passare 4 giorni a Barcellona ho scelto questo hotel con vista mare ...
Situato all'arrivo della funivia del porto è un hotel dotato di camere meravigliose vista mare....
Una buona Spa, con un ottimo servizio massaggio,  una piscina interna e una esterna.
Anche il ristorante dell'hotel è ottimo .....
Sicuramente ritornerò ....",5,2015,04,15
46,Regalo,"El hotel esta situado en un lugar muy tranquilo, con vistas al mar y delante de una zona ajardinada.

La habitacion donde nos alojamos era muy amplia, con una bañera grande y una cama de 2mx2m

El trato recibido fue muy bueno.

El desayuno, muy variado y abundante, con posibilidad de pedir cosas hechas al momento.

A mejorar, el ruido fuera de la habitación. A partir de las 16, el servicio de limpieza, al abrir y cerrar las puertas, hacia mucho ruido y restaba tranquilidad. Faltaba gel de baño y sales, que podian haberse previsto en la habitacion y no tener que solicitarlas",4,2015,04,13
46,Tolle Lage,"Wir waren zum Teil geschäftlich als auch privat im Miramar. Die Lage ist toll, zwar nicht direkt in der City, dafür aber mit tollem Blick über die Stadt in einem wunderschönen Park gelegen.

Das Hotel selber ist sehr schön und modern eingerichtet. Das Zimmer (Premium) war groß, modern, das Bett sehr bequem, eine große Dusche und eine frei stehende Badewanne. Ebenfalls war das Zimmer mit einem großen Balkon ausgestattet. 

Im Hotel gibt es eine kostenfreie Sauna und einen Indoorpool. Die Sauna darf man nicht mit deutschem Standard messen und der Whirl- und Indoorpool waren zu stark mit Chlor versetzt. Deshalb haben wir es nur einmal genutzt. 
Der Saunabereich ist für Männer und Frauen getrennt.

Ebenfalls gibt es einen Spa Bereich. Wir haben eine Massage gebucht, die auch ok war und entspannend. Die gebuchte Kosmetikanwendung war allerdings unprofessionell und wir können dies nicht weiter empfehlen. Insgesamt sind die Anwendungen zu teuer und wir empfehlen sich bei Bedarf etwas in der City zu suchen.

Das Frühstück war ausreichend und mit schönem Blick auf den Park mit seinen herrlichen Orangenbäumen. Beim Frühstück hat es fast an nichts gefehlt. Man konnte Kaffeespezialitäten bestellen und frisches Ei je nach Geschmack zubereitet. Einzig ein frisches Müsli hat uns gefehlt. Es gab nur abgepackte Cornflakes.  Aber sonst fehlte es an nichts.

Insgesamt ein schönes, modernes Hotel in wunderschöner Lage. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption und beim Frühstück waren freundlich und zuvorkommend. 
Allerdings finden wir das Hotel insgesamt zu teuer und es fehlt irgendwie das gewisse Etwas / an Herz.

Ein Tipp: Ein Ticket für die Seilbahn an der Rezeption kaufen und dann gleich mit der ersten Bahn von oben bis runter zum Strand fahren (anstatt mit einem Taxi) Man hat einen tollen Blick über die Stadt. An der Rezeption kann man die Fahrzeiten erfragen, bei uns startete die erste ab 11:00 Uhr vormittag.

46,Ottimo hotel,Vi ho soggiornato per lavoro e devo dire che la struttura all'interno è davvero bella. Spazi arredati in modo moderno. Atmosfera piacevole. La posizione è bella se si intende soggiornare fuori dalla città e godendo di una buona vista. Unica nota stonata il servizio al bar è un pó troppo lento (il personale sta spesso nel ristorante dimenticandosi dei tavolini all'esterno). Sala fitness bene attrezzata. Non fatevi mancare l'esperienza della teleferica a soli 5 minuti dall'albergo: vi porterà alla Barcelloneta sospesi tra la collina ed il mare.,4,2015,03,25
46,Tienen que mejorar para llegar 5*,"Mi experiencia :

Trato correcto en recepción, mientras realizas checkin te alumbran con una cubitera con cava baratito el cual ni te ofrecen.

Habitaciones muy correctas ,amplias con muy buena calidad de sueño, desayuno muy justo no de 5* si llegas pasado las 10 de la mañana el personal te presiona para que desayunes rápido , entiendo que son personal extra 

Rte con buen servicio, carta limitada, materia prima nada sorprendente y  factura elevada  ,pocos comensales en rte 

Jardines y piscina ejemplares,en  lobby bar  te obsequian con todo tipo de gominolas, ojo sin coste

Curiosidad en un htl de esta categoría 5*, cerca de recepción tienen unas vitrinas de souvenirs que puedes comprar relojes por 20 euros , no cuadra verdad.

Resumiendo , es un correcto hotel y caro ,debería ser gestionado por cadena hotelera internacional para posicionarlo, lamentablemente no ofrece valor al huésped, bueno si el valor es la facturas que pagas en el checkout

46,Lo mejor el equipo humano,"Hemos pasado el fin de semana de nuestro aniversario toda la familia en la suite Miramar, separada en 2ambientes mucho mejor para estar con la peque...
El trato recibido por el personal del hotel ha sido fabuloso, Laia de recepción muy amable y precisa, el jefe de recepción muy próximo nos mostró diferentes zonas del hotel.
El sábado por la noche tuvimos concierto de piano en el bar del hotel.
Volveremos",5,2015,02,23
46,La tranquilidad!!!,"No se si será la época en la que estuvimos, pero había mucha paz.

He estado de convención con mis compañeros y ha sido muy agradable la estancia.  Las habitaciones bien equipadas. El servicio muy atento, amable y personal.

Como no, he dejado lo mejor para el final.  LAS VISTAS. Desde la habitación se veia tooooda la ciudad. Simplemente MARAVILLOSAS.",4,2015,02,07
46,lujo sin cuidado,"Estuvimos solo una noche en el hotel (31/1/15) y no estuvimos disfrutando de las instalaciones porque no era el objetivo, pero si de la habitacion. Nos alojamos en la habitacion 407, nos gustó mucho la decoración y los muebles y toda ella en general pero sinceramente, por el precio que se paga para una noche creo que no estaria de más regalar una triste botella de agua (en otro hotel de bcn de la misma categoria y similar precio nos regalaron cava, agua y snacks y nos pareció un detallazo) hacia mucho viento justo esa noche y por la puerta de la terraza pasaba aire. La puerta del wc de cristal estaba medio despegada, nos preocupaba que se caiera y cuando salimos a cenar lo dijimos a recepción (muy serviciales), lo arreglarian en seguida... no fue asi.
No valoro mal el hotel, para mi fue normal, pero para el precio que pagas y el gran lujo que quieren ofrecerte con estos detalles no lo consiguen. 
Una cosa más, reitero los comentarios negtivos sobre el campo de tiro y su ruido, se oye, y a les nueve de la mañana te diesperta. No se puede decir que no, porque es cierto, no estaria mal insonorizar un poco...

46,Interessnte,"Un muy interesante hotel dentro de esta maravillosa ciudad que es Barcelona. Hotel con mucho encanto, lleno de atenciones, con un entorno muy cuidado y exquisito. Tuve un problema con la climatización de la habitación y en 20' me cambiaron a una que funcionase sin ninguna pega. Se preocuparon por solucionar muy rápido el incidente algo que agradezco. Como digo un gran hotel. ",4,2015,01,22
46,Simplemente excelente hotel. ,"Primero que nada... Muchas gracias en especial a Laia quien nos atendió en la recepción. 

Hemos pasado ahí 4 días, atendidos excelentemente bien por todo el personal del hotel.  
Las habitaciones son un lujo, de muy calidad en todos los detalles, una decoración moderna y muy bien cuidada. 
En nuestro caso íbamos con una persona discapacitada y las habitaciones adaptadas a sillas de ruedas están perfectas. 

No se pierdan los desayunos buffet, o un café en la terraza disfrutando de las vistas.

",5,2015,01,05
46,Tranquilidad asegurada,"Hotel de lujo en Montjuic. De mi visita puedo destacar la atención y la tranquilidad. No sé si fué por la época del año en que lo he visitado o por que siempre es así pero es tan tranquilo que un Sábado por la tarde estuvimos mi pareja y yo solos tanto en la piscina como en el jacuzzi. El lujo es normal cuando visitas un hotel de estas características, por tanto, no es destacable. Si lo es la amabilidad del personal. En todo momento fueron muy amables sin llegar a cansar. La habitación con terraza donde dormimos era muy bonita y moderna. El buffet del desayuno un poco escaso (en cuanto a variedad) pero bueno en cuanto a calidad. Parece enfocado al turismo ya que la totalidad de los huéspedes que encontramos eran extranjeros. Muy recomendable.",4,2014,12,21
46,No esta a la altura de la calificación que tiene este establecimiento,"Por mi 42 cumpleaños mi pareja me regalo una estancia en el Hotel Miramar (5* GL) el pasado fin de semana. 
Me hizo muchísima ilusión ya que era un lugar que tenia muchas ganas de visitar. 

Pues bien, no creo que vuelva. 

La primera gran decepción se produjo cuando al llegar a la magnifica habitación 603, predominaba un fuerte olor de ambientador. Hasta aquí nada raro, la sorpresa vino al pedir que por favor no echaran más ambientador. Por la mañana el olor a desagüe era insoportable y nos tuvieron que cambiar de habitación, algo mas pequeña, pero eso si sin olores. 

Decir también que seria interesante que revisaran algún protocolo en el servicio de desayunos, es totalmente comprensible que el horario de desayunos tenga un limite, de otro modo seria difícil de organizar los diferentes servicios, ahora bien con el precio que se paga por la habitación es bastante desagradable estar desayunando y que te den un toque diciendo que en diez minutos cierran el buffet. Esto lo podría entender en un hotel de categoría inferior, pero en un 5 estrellas Gran Lujo, me parece justamente de muy poca categoría. 

Por otro lado quiero agradecer la atención y el servicio de restaurante “Forestier” del viernes por la noche, donde principalmente, Alberto  y Jonathan nos propiciaron un viaje por los sentidos con el “menú Maridaje” y felicitarles y especialmente a Alberto por su elección del “Lariveau” rosado para maridar con el arroz. 

Me repito, pero es una verdadera lastima, un hotel que podría ser un referente en la ciudad Condal se queda lejos de otros establecimientos que hemos visitado, como el Hotel Wela o el Me Barcelona, donde pagando precios similares la estancia ha sido perfecta.",2,2014,12,09
46,"Un dia de spa , sin na","Hola , me  regalaron  60 min de spa y 30 de masaje balines
Una hora antes estaba tomando café en la terraza del hotel, el café bueno, la terraza genial, el personal eran automatas.
El  spa  , tan normal que no resaltaba nada , un sitio que no recordare, me olvidare,
La señora de recepcion del spa que tambien hacia los masajes, yo creia que era un robot.
Como todo el personal  que vi del hotel.
Y el masaje , ya no me acuerdo, 
Me encantan los spa , los hoteles como este , pero no hay ni alma ni personalidad ni nada.
Simplemente  hay una inversion de dinero ingreible,

46,Sehr schönes Hotel,"Schönes Hotel, sehr schöne Aussicht. Schönes, sehr großes Zimmer mit ebenso schönem und großem Bad. Toller Balkon. Leider ein paar Ameisen im Bad, die aber nicht wirklich gestört haben, weil sie entlang ihrer Straße gelaufen sind und sonst nicht bemerkbar waren. Großes angenehmes Bett.
Die Lage des Hotels ist etwas abseits auf einer Anhöhe, daher ist es Abends empfehlenswert  ein Taxi zu nehmen (ca. 6-7 € aus dem Zentrum). Dafür hat man aber einen tollen Ausblick.
Die Frühstücksterasse ist wunderschön, das Buffet nur durchschnittlich. 
Freundliches und sehr bemühtes Personal.",5,2014,11,08
46,"Habitaciones correctas, servicio pésimo","Reservamos este hotel para la noche de bodas. Como íbamos a llegar muy tarde, solicité desde el primer momento si era posible hacer el check out un poco más tarde, tanto por mail como por teléfono me dijeron que no podían confirmarme hasta el mismo día de la reserva. El mismo día llamé por la mañana y me dijeron que no podían confirmarme. Incluso cuando llegamos de la boda, nos volvieron a decir que tendríamos que preguntarlo por la mañana, (¿como es posible que no sepas a las 5:00pm si vas a poder dejar esa habitación más tarde? la ocupación ya está cerrada de ese día), al final, como no hubo manera de confirmar esto, solo pudimos estar unas horas en el hotel y salir enfadados por la mañana temprano, después de desayunar (el buffet no tiene nada de especial si lo comparas con uno de un hotel de tres estrellas.)",1,2014,11,04
46,Relax-Oase in Stadtnähe,"Auf der Suche nach einem Hotel in Barcelona, das zentral liegt und trotzdem die Möglichkeit bietet zu entspannen, sind wir auf das Miramar gestoßen. Vom Miramar aus sind wir 10 Minuten zur nächsten Metro-Station gelaufen und von dort aus ist man in 5 Mintuen Fahrzeit am Placa Catalunya.  Gebucht haben wir ein Deluxe-Zimmer inklusive Frühstück, direkt über die Hotelwebsite. Insgesamt haben wir fünf Nächte im Miramar verbracht und seit langem haben wir uns in keinem Hotel von der ersten Minute an so wohl gefühlt. Schon der Check-Inn läuft sehr entspannend ab, man kann sich hinsetzen und bekommt einen Tee oder Sekt angeboten. Wir waren früher als geplant vor Ort und unser Zimmer wurde kurzer Hand direkt fertig gemacht und wir durften zwei Stunden früher einchecken. Leider hat es am ersten Tag in Strömen geregnet, doch dank des Wellness-Bereichs und der wunderschönen Zimmer war das überhaupt kein Problem. Die Terasse mit Baranschluss bietet einen wunderschönen Blick auf den Hafen und überzeugt mit einer großen Auswahl an Cocktails und Getränken, die immer mit einem Knabbersnack gereicht werden. Das Frühstück ist umfangreich und für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei: Eierspeisen, Aufstrich, Gebäck, Gemüse, Obst, sowie frisch gepresste Säfte, Heißgetränke und vieles mehr. Das Restaurant und der Roomservice wurden von uns auch genutzt und alles in allem stimmt das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, sehr gute Qualität zu gehobenem Preis. Nachmittags haben wir den Außenpool genutzt um zu entspannen und die Seele baumeln zu lassen (perfekt zum etwas hektischen Alltag in Barcelona). Im Wellnessbereich befinden sich zwei Saunen, Whirlpool, Dampfbad und ein Indoorpool. Außerdem werden verschiedene Spa-Anwendungen angeboten. Wir haben eine 60-minütige Massage gebucht, die uns beiden sehr gut gefallen hat.   

Die ersten beiden Nächste haben wir in einem Zimmer mit Blick auf den Berg verbracht, was uns nicht so gut gefallen hat und wir haben uns kurzer Hand für ein Upgrade in eine Privileg-Zimmer entschieden. Dies ist auch in jedem Fall empfehlenswert, da man in diesen Zimmern einen Balkon erhält, der einen atemberaubenden Blick über ganz Barcelona inklusive Hafen bietet. 

Ein letzter Satz zum Service, denn der war wirklich super! Das Team besticht durch Freundlichkeit und ist sehr bemüht, seinen Gästen einen perfekten Aufenthalt zu bieten. Egal, was wir gebraucht oder angemerkt haben, es wurde uns stets geholfen und das innerhalb kürzester Zeit (Restaurantempfehlungen, Reservierungen, Wegbeschreibungen, Strandhandtücher, etc.).",5,2014,10,06
46,Tolles 5 Sterne Hotel mit super Aussicht (und kleinen Mängeln),"Ein wunderschönes Hotel oberhalb von Barcelona, mit toller Innenausstattung , einem schönen SPA Bereich und einem kleinen, aber feinen Aussenpool.  Wir empfehlen die Privilegzimmer mit Blick Richtung Hafen (leider abends mit Geräuschen vom Hafenbetrieb). Das Frühstück ist nicht auf Masse, sonder eher auf Klasse ausgelegt und zu empfehlen(wenn auch 28 € p.P.) Am letzten Tag mussten wir leider das Zimmer um 12 Uhr verlassen(um 15 Uhr wurden neue Gäste erwartet). Unser Flieger ging aber erst um 20,25 Uhr. Das Hotel nahm unsere Koffer unter pers. Aufsicht in Ihr Büro und gab uns einen Spindschlüssel für das SPA. Dort fanden wir eine Bademanntel, 2 große Handtücher, Frotteeslippers, eine Zahnbürste, Rasierutensilien und diverse Shampoos, Dusch- und Bodylotion(alles von l'occitane). So weit so toll.
Negativ: Schminkspiegel Gelenk ausgeleiert und ohne Licht, Fußschalter einer Stehlampe defekt, Terrassenbeleuchtung defekt( wurde aber alles nach Reklamation repariert).

46,EXCELENTE TRATO,"Fuimos a celebrar nuestro aniversario de boda el fin de semana del 19 al 20 de julio. El Hotel es magnífico, con unas vistas privilegiadas aunque lo que más sobresale es el trato del personal. La habitación era espectacular y contaba con una gran terraza para poder disfrutar de las vistas de Barcelona. El hotel cuenta con una zona de spa pequeñita, pero muy agradable y relajante. Quisiera agradecer la atención prestada a Jonathan, Adam, Manuel y Jairo. Mi única queja es que se celebraba una boda por la tarde y no pudimos disfrutar de la piscina, aunque fuimos al spa. Sin duda volveremos.",5,2014,09,11
46,Buen hotel,"Muy buen hotel, personal muy amable, especialmente Oriol en el Bar, muy muy bar tender, amable y buen conversador.   Habitaciones muy buenas, cerca de estación de metro y bus. Problemas: tienen un restaurante cerca que hace fiestas ocasionales y son ruidosos, en la piscina del hotel también también hacen eventos ruidosos. Es un poco lejos por lo que sí sales tarde tu regreso debe ser en taxi. A pesar de esto un hotel recomendable.   No dejen de tomarse un gin tónic con Oriol.  Vale la pena ",4,2014,09,03
46,Un 10,"Todo fue perfecto, las vistas son maravillas y se respira tranquilidad y buen servicio por todos los rincones. Utilizamos el spa y el masaje Lomi-Lomi fue toda una experiencia increible.

46,Hotel con una  buena vista abierta ....,"Hotel grande, de buen diseño , con una linda pileta  y parque alrededores.
Algo alejado de todo pero resulta ideal para época de verano, para días calurosos, porque esun lugar aireado  y con una buena vista hacia el puerto, mar y el Montjuic mismo.",4,2014,08,28
46,Ottima posizione,"L'hotel Miramar può essere un'ottima soluzione per chi viaggiando in auto, non volesse entrare nei meandri delle strade del centro di barcellona, dove nella maggior parte dei casi è scomodo parcheggiare. 
Situato nella collina di Montjuic, proprio sopra il porto, questo hotel gode di una posione perfetta per ammirare il panorama su Barcellona. La vista è forse uno degli aspetti che colpisce di più.
Per il resto e camere sono spazione così come i bagni, il design però non molto ricercato. 
La zona SPA dispone di una piscina interna, bagno turco e sauna e piscina esterna, ma attenzione alle api. Sono più o meno ovunque sul prato e a i bordi della piscina. 
Il personale del ricevimento funge anche da concierge, questo provoca a volte code, sarebbe meglio se i due servizi fosser separati...
Dall'hotel è possibile raggiungere la fondazione Juan Mirò a piedi.
Nel complesso il giudizio è comunque positivo.",4,2014,08,22
46,Vacaciones sin salir de la ciudad,"Un hotel en Barcelona que te traslada a un espacio perfecto para descansar. Buenas vistas, las habitaciones estàn bien, el baño es muy bonito y las instalaciones estàn genial. El personal es muy servicial y simpático lo que se agradece. El desayuno nos gustó mucho. A mejorar, la antena de la tele que se veía muy mal, algo que no entendimos que un hotel así no pusiesen solución y las pocas hamacas de la piscina. Por el resto, ha sido una buena experiencia.",4,2014,07,22

Unas vistas impresionantes y una piscina muy coqueta y tranquila, aunque has de ir pronto para pilllar hamaca en pleno verano. Las vistas de las habitaciones con terraza son mágicas, de dia y de noche, quizá las mejores de Barcelona. Buen desayuno aunque en un hotel de 5* gran lujo quizá esperaba un poco más de variedad, pero lo que hay es de muy buena calidad.
Lugar ideal para bodas, suelen verse bastantes. Lugar muy romántico.",5,2014,07,15
46,Trato exquisito,"Fuimos una mañana a desayunar en su terraza.
Nos trataron tan amablemente que es una gozada desayunar cualquier cosa en la terraza. Y tienes la piscina al lado. Sales del agua, te pones el albornoz y a disfrutar que son dos días.",5,2014,07,10
46,Virtudes y defectos,"Virtudes: Buen servicio del personal. Vistas. Zonas ajardinadas. Piscina. Habitaciones amplias y modernas. Esperábamos poco de los tratamientos del SPA pero nos sorprendieron. Buen Room Service. 

Defectos: El hotel esta alejado del centro. No esta a 5 minutos ni a 10. Es decir, hay que coger taxi para todo. En nuestro caso ya lo sabíamos, lo escogimos porque buscábamos algo mas tranquilo que los hoteles del centro y sobre todo por la piscina y el spa. Estos, que deberían ser los puntos fuertes del hotel, no lo son. Estuvimos 3 días en Julio y la piscina estaba sucia todos los días. Tanto la interior como la exterior. No era algo escandaloso pero un hotel de 5 estrellas debe vigilar esos detalles. El primer día no pudimos usar la piscina porque no había tumbonas suficientes. La gente se levantaba temprano, desayunaba y dejaba algo en las tumbonas para guardarlas... En la piscina interior, mas de lo mismo, apenas hay 4 tumbonas. En la piscina hay música permanente, esto es subjetivo, pero a mí me cansa, la verdad. A la piscina del Spa pueden entrar los niños... así que ya se sabe, cuando hace mal tiempo o no hay espacio arriba monopolizan el lugar. Un spa debe ser un lugar de descanso y tranquilidad, algo complicado de conseguir si hay niños gritando y tirándose desde el bordillo. 
El primer día que llegamos había una boda así que la piscina se cerraba a las 5. Nadie nos informó antes de esta limitación y desde luego no me hicieron ningún descuento en el precio por no poder utilizarla. 
La habitación en la que estábamos tenía ruidos por un bajante de agua. No era especialmente molesto pero desde luego no era un remanso de paz. Por último, una de las noches, el ruido del bar cuando eran mas de las 12 si que fue molesto. El servicio de limpieza entro en la habitación dos veces con el cartel de STOP. Los camareros del desayuno nos dijeron a las 10 y 15 que debíamos desayunar a prisa porque cerraban a las 10 30. En fin, son detalles, nada especialmente importante, pero en conjunto nuestra experiencia no fue del todo satisfactoria. 

Conclusión: Es un buen hotel, con vistas bastante bonitas, y zonas ajardinadas. El personal se esfuerza en que estés a gusto. Los tratamientos del Spa fueron bastante buenos y el servicio de habitaciones ha mejorado respecto de la última vez que estuvimos. No obstante un hotel de cinco estrellas debe cuidar todos los detalles. Por cuestiones de trabajo viajamos mucho y tenemos la suerte de ir a hoteles de alto nivel. En este sentido el Miramar es un quiero y no puedo. Es el cuarto hotel de 5 estrellas de la ciudad en el que nos alojamos y, aunque no es el peor, tampoco esta entre los mejores.",3,2014,07,10
46,Un oasis de paz a 5 minutos de Barcelona,"Gran hotel de 5* a tan solo 5 minutos de Barcelona, la junior suite que fue la habitación que estuvimos inmejorable, buenas vistas amplia y espaciosa.

El spa pequeño pero correcto e impecable. 

La piscina genial sobretodo por la cantidad de espacio y tumbonas que hacen que no te sientas ""agobiado"" por la ocupación.

Las vistas del hotel son inmejorables. 

En líneas generales un hotel de 10. Único inconveniente es que la movilidad tiene que ser con coche o taxi no hay transporte público próximo. ",5,2014,06,15
46,Bello ma attenti alle valigie,"Veramente bell'albergo, camere spaziosissime ed elganti, quasi da boutique hotel, personale cortese, ottimo bar, mangiato bene negli spuntini dell'evento.

Mezzo punto lo togliamo per la posizione, o si scende col taxi o si fanno 30/40 minuti a piedi per arrivare alla vera Barcelona.
Altro mezzo punto in meno per il bagno, bello, moderno, stilish, ma vasca e lavandino vicino al letto non sono il massimo e soprattutto la cabina water in vetro, anch'essa vicina al letto, con la porta che non sta chiusa e che anche se stesse chiusa lascia due dita di spazio ai bordi proprio non la si può tollerare a meno di non essere da solo.

Punto finale in meno per la valigia che è sparita mentre ero in fila al checkout. Da un albergo di questa classe ci si aspetterebbe un minimo di controllo su chi gira per l'atrio. Nessuan assicurazione per i bagagli ""non custoditi"", scarso supporto nella gestione, giusto una cartina con l'indirizzo della stazione di polizia a cui recarmi, e pure la richiesta finale se pagavo in contanti o con la carta 4.5 euro di minerale in camera. Almeno il gesto di offrirla avrebbero potuto farlo.",3,2014,06,13
46,BRAVI. OSPITALITA' SUPER,"Abbiamo trascorso due giorni meravigliosi in questo bell'hotel di Barcellona.
La posizione è incantevole, perchè vi permette di raggiungere il centro della città con 10 euro di taxi in 10 minuti, ma anche di esere in cima al Montyuc e poter fare attività sportiva nel polmone verde di barcellona.
Con la funicolare sarete anche, in una mezzoretta con una vista mozzafiato, sulla spiaggia della città (unica pecca: chiude alle 19....quindi dopo cena si torna in taxi).
Hotel molto curato, camere davvero ben arredate e con una vista strepitosa. Tutte o quasi tutte con terrazzino per prendere il sole o rilassarsi.
Ottima prima colazione, servita anche all'aperto.
Ottimo servizio lounge bar, personale disponibile e molto cortese.

46,"Experiencia fantástica, magnifico trato!","Mi mujer y yo no solemos viajar a Barcelona muy frecuentemente, y es la primera vez que nos alojamos en el hotel Miramar, pero no será la última.

Está ubicado en una de las zonas más tranquilas, lo que es de agradecer, puesto que en el hotel sólo pasamos las horas de descanso, y por la noche da la sensación de estar en un palacio,  alejado del gran bullicio de gente que suele frecuentar la noche.

Fácil acceso al centro de la ciudad, a 10 minutos a pie  del Paralelo, y desde allí es muy sencillo llegar a cualquier punto de la ciudad, ya sea a pie para ir al centro o con la línea verde de Metro.

En cuanto a las habitaciones, no les falta de nada, gran variedad de amenties de categoría, decoración sobria y elegante, y con acceso a internet gratuito, lo cuál nos ha sorprendido gratamente.

Es de destacar el gran trabajo que están realizando en el hotel ya que tienen un personal muy cualificado y profesional. 

La atención recibida por parte de Ainhoa de recepción fue insuperable, siempre amable y sonriente, dispuesta a resolver cualquier tipo de duda y nos recomendó un restaurante japonés buenísimo, Koyuki.

Estamos deseando repetir lo antes posible.",5,2014,03,08
46,Espectacular para una estancia romántica,"Una de las mejores experiencias que hemos vivido mi novia y yo desde que estamos juntos, cuando llegamos al hotel tanto mi novia como yo no estábamos acostumbrados a hoteles de lujo como este pero en cuanto llegamos nos dimos cuenta de que el lujo no estaba solo en las habitaciones, nos atendió Ainhoa y gracias a ella nuestra estancia fue inolvidable. Ainhoa viendo que éramos una pareja joven nos aconsejo un pack romántico y dio en el clavo, fue perfecto algo que nunca olvidaremos. Además, éramos novatos en Barcelona y Ainhoa sencillamente fue nuestra guía, nos hizo un recorrido para conocer todo en los días que estuvimos en Barcelona, tanto de visita como para comer y tomar algo tranquilamente. En cuanto a las habitaciones son impresionantes, autentico lujo pero sencillo sin nada recargado ni ostentoso. Pero vuelvo remarcar que me quedo con el trato del hotel y en especial de Ainhoa ya que sin ella estoy seguro que la estancia se hubiera quedado en un 8 y no en un 10.",5,2014,03,06
46,Lujo de verdad,"El lujo está muchas veces por encima de las estrellas, está en los pequeños detalles, y en este hotel los cuidan hasta el extremo!

Por infinidad de razones siempre ha sido un hotel de referencia para tomar un cafe o comer algo rápido enmedio de la rutina diaria y era como entrar en un oasis, la comida rápida resulta más productiva que un masaje y esos cafes rápidos te dan oxigeno para seguir...

Teníamos la espinita de conocer sólo su maginifica cocina y decidimos ponerle remedio y no nos pudo gustar más!

Recomendable 100%",5,2014,02,21
46,David Vazquez Ocasio,"Ya he tenido la oportunidad de quedarme en este hotel en enero 7 del 2014,  es excelentîsimo, el trato es A+ las atenciones, limpieza, son excelente, definitivamente, cuando vuelva a Barcelona si no es ahí, prefiero no volver, no puedo dejar de mencionar el trato exclusivo del gerente del restaurante, Javier, nos tratô como reyes y los de recepciòn, bueno, en fîn, todos!!! Y mi amigo del bar, el de colombia",5,2014,01,13
46,Sono già tornato ...,"Ci sono stato 4 giorni tra Natale e Capodanno 2013 e già ci sono tornato una notte nel 2014. Il Direttore Simone (Italiano) è gentilissimo e fa di tutto per accontentare i suoi clienti. Tutto il personale è disponibile e sorridente. Belle stanze e (a volta bella vista). L'unico neo (ma non per me che lo considero un pregio) è che l'hotel sta su una collina (che domina il porto e la città) isolato in mezzo a giardini esotici (cactus) e botanici (con orario). Se cercate la folla e lo shopping, il Miramar non fa per voi (anche se poi in 10 minuti a piedi siete in città alle Ramblas). Se invece cercato il lusso del silenzio, della vista e del verde allora siete arrivati!",5,2014,01,12
46,Inmejorable experiencia lúdica,"Aterrizamos en el bar del hotel para tomar unas copas y el presonal nos atendión tan extremadamente bien , y con tal pasión por el establecimiento que acabamos visitando todas la sinstalaciones , el spa, jardines.......y nos impresionó el hotel...pero sobretodo el servicio recibido por el personal de tarde noche.",5,2014,01,02
46,Hotel impecable y restaurante gastronomico espectacular,"Estuve con mi pareja para celebrar mi cumpleaños y la eleccion de este hotel no pudo ser mas acertada. Habitacion muy amplia con preciosas vistas al mar, una bañera super romantica dentro de la habitacion y un servicio excelente.

El restaurante es espectacular, cojimos el menu degustacion con vinos y fue una excelente opcion, muy buenas cantidades, todo sabroso y el servicio ejemplar.

Sin duda lo recomendamos y volveremos pronto!!!",5,2013,11,23
46,"Buena atención sobre todo en recepción (Oscar), pero hay detalles que mejorar en infraestructura","Fui un fin de semana con mi mujer a pasar unos días a Barcelona y decidí pasarlo en este hotel y cual fue mi decepción que las instalaciones eran deprimentes Dentro de la habitación había una gotera, solo me atendió de muy bien el recepcionista.",2,2013,11,22
46,"un precioso gran hotel, con las mejores vistas","Estuvimos un fin de semana de Septiembre, mi mujer y yo, y fue una muy agradable experiencia, tanto por la amabilidad de sus empleados, empezando por recepción y la profesionalidad  a la noche de Oscar, tanto por su excelente bufet de desayuno, como los excelentes gin tonic del bar.Las habitaciones  son una preciosidad, las vistas impresionantes, la piscina maravillosa. Recomiendo a todo el mundo que pruebe este hotel, no se arrepentirá.",5,2013,11,07
46,"Excelente elección, sitio muy tranquilo, lindisima vista, spa excelente!","Fuimos de luna de miel con mi esposo, llegamos sin reserva y afortunadamente encontramos habitación. Es un hotel 5 estrellas, con un ambiente maravilloso, habitaciones grandes con mas de lo necesario, amplias terrazas, un spa con una bella piscina, turco, sauna, jacuzzi... Es realmente una inversión al placer, y sin embargo no es tan caro comparado con la oferta en el centro de Barcelona. El transporte parece difícil pero no lo es, nosotros no tomamos ni un solo taxi, usamos nuestra tarjeta de transporte de turista multidias que sirve para todos los medios, justo a la puerta del hotel pasa una ruta de bus (150) que te pasea por todo el cerro montjuic donde hay mucho que conocer, y te deja en la plaza España de donde te puedes conectar con todo Barcelona.",5,2013,11,05
46,las ofertas no se cumplen,"Una amiga me regaló para mi cumpleaños una oferta por letsbonus para 40 minutos de masaje y 2 horas de circuito. La primera cita era para agosto pero nos avisaron en menos de 24 horas que tenían que cancelar nuestra cita ya que tenían una inspección y no nos dieron ninguna alternativa. Por fin pudimos disfrutar de nuestra experiencia pero fueron 25 minutos de masaje y el circuito por el spa se redujo a un jacuzzi y una sauna puesto que ni el hammam ni la ducha de sensaciones funcionaba. El trato fue correcto pero cuando reclamamos el masaje de 40 minutos nos dijeron que dejan 2 minutos y medio para desvestirnos, cuando ya estábamos desnudas y ni con 5 minutos más sumaba los 40 minutos de la oferta. Yo entiendo que son ofertas baratas pero si se lanzan hay que cumplirlas sino mejor quedarse con una clientela más selecta y dispuesto a pagar por el servicio que imagino que es más bueno si pagas el precio que ellos marcan. Me quedó muy mal sabor de boca y no lo recomendaría.",2,2013,10,28
46,Eccellente!,"Davvero molto bello questo hotel: camere spaziose con doccia gigante e vasca molto confortevole, grande terrazzo. SPA ben organizzata ed ottima vista su tutta Barcellona. La cucina mi è sembrata meno lodevole ma comunque resta x me un ottimo hotel da consigliare",5,2013,10,24
46,Rundum Wohlfühlpaket im Miramar-Barcelona,"Nach freundlichem Empfang direkt am Taxi haben wir ein Upgrade gebucht und hatten dann ein Zimmer im 5. OG mit Blick auf den Hafen rechts und Barcelona lag uns links zu Füssen. Sehr beeindruckend mit grosser Terrasse, bequemen Betten und tollem Badezimmer. Selbst vom Aussenpool mit Holzdeck und Barservice hat man noch einen schönen Blick auf die Stadt. Dennoch erreicht man den Hafen / die Rambla zu Fuss in 10 Minuten und ist mit dem Taxi schnell überall. Auf dem Montjuic kann man selbst auch viel ansehen und hält der Touri-Bus keine 200m vom Hotel. Sauna und Swimming-Pool gibts auch noch indoor wie auch einen Fitness-Raum. Bar und Frühstück sind gut, herauszuheben ist noch der erstklassige Concierge-Service mit Restaurant- und Ausflugsempfehlungen sowie -buchungen. Sogar eine Umbuchung, weil uns das Restaurant nicht gefiel, wurde telefonisch entgegengenommen, dem Taxifahrer erklärt und ein neues Restaurant gebucht, was wunderbar war. Der Aufenthalt im Miramar war einfach nur Klasse in jeder Hinsicht!",5,2013,10,06
46,Muy buena experiencia y un marco incomparable,"El hotel esta en monjuic, lo que le permite tener unas vistas espectaculares, mi habitación era muy grande pero sin vistas aunque otro colegas tenían habitaciones más pequeños con vistas a la ciudad y al mar. En general la habitación correcta y muy cómoda, aunque el milibar tienes un precios de disparate. El desayuno defraudo un poco en cuanto a bollería, había muy poca variedad y no había tartas, como pasaba con la fruta preparada, pero el resto de cosas bastante bien y los camareros muy atentos. La cama era nueva, por lo que entiendo que esto ya no es un problema y de 2 metros de ancho

Me gusto mucho el trato y la limpieza, al igual que el spa y la piscina cubierta, no así el gimnasio donde hacia muchísimo calor

El problema que para moverte siempre en taxi por que esta algo apartado",5,2013,09,27
46,SENSATIONELL,"Das Hotel liegt wunderbar in einem Hang oberhalb vom Hafen von Barcelona in einer wunderschönen Gartenanlage! Früstücksbuffet super, Lage des Hotel einmalig in Barcelona. Der Pool ist eine Wucht, sehr cooles Designteil!. Die Bar ist gut bestückt und der Barkeeper (Danny) äusserst zuvorkommend.
Ich hatte das Zimmer 516, SUPER Aussicht!!!",5,2013,09,23
46,Magnifico boutique resort hotel,"Una opción perfecta para alojarse en Barcelona. Se encuentra muy cercano al centro de la ciudad pero con las ventajas de estar en Montjuic en cuento a calma y tranquilidad. El hotel tiene unas vistas impresionantes de la ciudad y las habitaciones son muy confortables. Aspectos a mejorar serían las televisiones y los colchones, ambos demasiado viejos para un hotel de esta categoría. Muy recomendable disfrutar de la cena en el Martinez, restaurante que han habierto junto al hotel con vistas increhibles al puerto de la ciudad",5,2013,09,07
46,"Gut, aber mit Schönheitsfehlern","Das Hotel ist ohne Frage schön - die Zimmer sind groß, fast riesig und sehr sauber. Man muss mögen, dass das sehr schöne Bad mit freistehender Wanne nur durch einen Vorhang,(Regen)Dusche und Toilette zusätzlich mit einer Milchglasscheibe abgetrennt sind. Schwimmingpool und Gartenanlage sind einfach nur perfekt, da gibt es keine Kritikpunkte. Frühstück (20€/Person im Hotel dazu gebucht) ist das Geld wert. Auch die Lage ist toll - nicht direkt im Trubel der Stadt, sonderm auf dem Berg Montjuïc gelegen. Von der Terrasse der Hotelbar hat man einen wunderbaren Blick auf den Hafen. Tipp für den Apéritif: Die Bar Martinez nur ein paar Schritt entfernt mit direktem Meerblick! Mit der Zahnradbahn (5min Fußweg) ist das Hotel gut zu erreichen. Über die Treppen erreicht man den Hafen in 10-15min. Nun die negativen Punkte, die mich zu einer nicht uneingeschränkt positiven Bewertung kommen lassen: Unsere Terrasse war eine Katastrophe - es gab Aussicht, allerdings nur auf Unkraut und Plastikfolie, nicht wie angekündigt auf Meer, Pool oder Garten. Der Blick auf den Garten war mit Folie verhängt und auf den Stühlen fehlten die Polster. Außerdem blätterte die Wandfarbe der Mauer ab. Man kam sich vor wie bei einem Freigang im Gefängnis. So schlimm wäre das nun alles nicht, da man ohnehin die meiste Zeit in der Stadt verbringt, aber in einem Luxushotel dieser Preisklasse ist das doch ein erheblicher Mangel. Da Bilder mehr als Worte sagen, anbei zwei Fotos der Terrasse mit dem ""schönen Blick"". Um positiv abzuschließen: Wir würden wahrscheinlich wiederkommen, da der Pool unschlagbar gut war. Service war ok, allerdings wurde auf unsere Beschwerde über den schlechten Zustand der Terrasse nicht reagiert. Ein anderes Zimmer zu erhalten war nicht möglich (im August verständlich), der Hotelmanager wollte sich kümmern, hat sich aber dann nicht mehr gemeldet. Es wäre schön gewesen, zumindest nochmals Feedback zu erhalten.",3,2013,08,19
46,Elitismo total,"Llegamos al hotel, toda la familia, habiendo pagado los cuartos tres meses antes.
Al llegar, lo primero que nos dicen es que estan llenos y que por eso no podiamos quedarnos.
A pesar que exigimos nuestro dinero de vuelta, nos dijeron que no seria posible y que en lugar nos mandarian a otro hotel (mucho mas barato)
A pesar del hecho que nos decian que no habia lugar, si recibian a otras personas que tambien acababan de llegar, sin ninguna aparente eleccion, excepto el hecho que ""pagaban"" un upgrade.
Fue una experiencia muy desagradable y recomiendo que si consideraban este hotel, no lo hagan.",1,2013,07,05
46,super recomendable,"estuvimos invitados a pasar una noche,quedamos maravillados x el servicio y las instalaciones,el cuarto q nos asignaron,una suite de lujo con vista al Mediterraneo.Partiamos a Paris al dia siguiente muy temprano y nos trajeron un super desayuno al cuarto.
Gracias Simone x tanta calidez,siempre te recordaremos,y Cañete???lo mejor de lo mejor!!!!
Volveremos...a Barcelona,A Cañete Bar,a Casa Calvet y al Miramar sin lugar a dudas!!!!!!!!
Francisco Jose,millones de gracias!!!!!",5,2013,06,10
46,TE GUSTARA!!,"Gran hotel!!, si buscas tranquilidad, sentirte bien, disfrutar de las vistas, de buena comida y de un entorno acojedor esta es la eleccion, habitaciones mejor premium amplia gran terraza grandes vistas al mar y ciudad, desayuno de gran nivel no falta de nada, piscina interior y gimnasio, sin aglomeracion de gente, spa un poco justo, lo recomiendo.",5,2013,05,16
46,Un lujo diferente,"La situación del Hotel es magnifica en pleno montaña de Montjuic, a cinco minutos caminando del funicular que te deja en el Paralel y las Ramblas, y a un paso de toda la zona olímpica y el Palau San Jordi. Las vistas inmejorables. Y el hotel una verdadera sorpresa.
Ocupa las instalaciones de los antiguos estudios de TVE en Cataluña y ha sido remodelado completamente creando un ambiente de calidad, calidez y lujo al alcance de muy pocos establecimientos. Las habitaciones muy espaciosas, la nuestra con una gran bañera exenta en mitad del baño, un espacio de ducha independiente enorme y todo tipo de amenities para un baño relajante, un masaje, etc. En definitiva muy bien.
Además las instalaciones son espectaculares. Una piscina en los jardines,preciosa, resguarda y con numerosas tumbonas. También cuenta con gimnasio y zona de spa, con piscina cubierta con cascada y saunas y jacuzzis en la zona de los vestuarios diferenciadas. Todo incluido en el precio y de uso libre para todos los alojados.
El desayuno buffet servido en el terraza o en la zona del restaurante muy completo, con un buen zumo natural, cava, fruta, yogur, embutido, quesos y quizas un poco corte de bollería, pero claro es un hotel de perfil europeo.
Para completarlo wifi gratis en todo el hotel pero una wifi de verdad, potente y accesible. Servicio muy amable y como nota a favor, con la tarjeta prefer, botella de cava gratis como cortesía en la habitación además de late check out. 
Lujo tradicional, gran servicio, muy buenas instalaciones en una ciudad algunos de cuyos hoteles se han volcado en la modernidad hasta la extravagancia.
El único pero es que para ser un 5 estrellas GL no cambiaron las toallas por la tarde ni disponían de botella de agua de cortesia, pequeños detalles para una gran estancia",5,2013,05,14
46,DE LO MEJOR DE BARCELONA,"Hotel moderno, decorado con muy buen gusto. Las habitaciones nos parecieron muy confortables y los espacios comunes muy cuidados. 
Estupenda la situación, con unas vistas maravillosa de todo Barcelona, pero a sólo 2 minutos del centro si te acercas al funicular.
El desayuno correcto, no faltaba de nada y productos de bastante calidad.
El personal nos pareció de lo más amable y educado intentando ayudarnos en todo lo que pedimos, rápido y eficiente.
Francamente, estamos deseando volver y lo recomendamos a todo el que pueda estar interesado.",5,2013,05,04
46,"Tolle Location, tolles Hotel","Das Hotel ist sehr schön, alles ganz neu, das Personal extrem freundlich und hilfsbereit. Es liegt  sehr ruhig und trotzdem zentral, mit dem Taxi kostet es ca. EUR 8,- zum Hafen (mit vielen Fischrestaurants). Die Haltestelle der Busse der Stadttour liegt ungefähr 2 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt. Direkt neben dem Hotel gibt es eine Bar mit wunderbarer Terrasse mit Blick über die Stadt - wunderbar für einen Sundowner geeignet! Unbedingt empfehlenswert.",5,2013,04,01
46,Preisleistungsverhältniss stimmt nicht,"Wir, 2 Erwachsene Mitte 50 besuchten zum 2. Mal dieses Hotel. Beide male im 6. Stock mit großem Balkon,  Blick auf Stadt und Hafen. 
Diesmal waren wir enttäuscht. Eine der beiden Panoramascheiben war von Innen angelaufen, milchig weiß, keine Sicht durch die Scheibe möglich. Bad/WC ist weder durch Vorhang bzw. Türe vom Zimmer getrennt. Also vollkommen offen. 
Der Gesamteindruck des Zimmers: abgenutzt.
Der Schießstand auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite (Berghang) wird auch am Sonntag von 09Uhr bis 17Uhr benutzt. Die Beeinträchtigung dadurch ist auch auf der Südseite beträchtlich, sofern man auf dem Balkon sitzen möchte. 
Empfindliche ""Ohren"" werden die im Hafen befindlichen Fährschiffe in der Nacht, aufgrund deren stets laufenden Dieselmotoren (für Strom und Klim) als nervig empfinden.",3,2013,03,25
46,tolle aussicht sonst nix!,"wir hatten ein grosses zimmer mit geräumigem balkon und wunderbarer sicht auf die stadt. leider sind aber die zimmer mit günstigem mobiliar ausgestattet. sieht alles toll aus aber überhaupt nicht funktional. badezimmer nur mit einem vorhang zum schlafbereich getrennt. spa bereich nicht der rede wert. der service lässt auch sehr zu wünschen übrig. teils unfreundlich, nicht kompetent und überhaupt nicht gastorientiert. in allen breichen!",2,2013,03,05
46,Un regalo increible!,"La estancia en este super hotel fué un regalo. Tanto para mi como para mi novio fué un experiencia increible!! 
Estuvimos en una habitación Premium desde la cual se veía toda Barcelona y todo el puerto, las vistas eran realmente magníficas!teniamos una terraza enorme de unos 20m2 en un lado había unos sillones con su mesita y en el otro lado una mesa con sus banquetas, estaba todo impecable.
La habitación era grande, luminosa, limpia, espaciosa, bien equipada y muy bonita, la cama comodísima y enorme! la unica pega desde mi punto de vista era el armario, muy pequeño para tanta habitación!!
El baño amplio y con una bañera en forma de huevo, con una ducha enorme y un espacio separado con vater y bidet. Muy limpio también. El unico problema que tuve es que no conseguí abrir el tapón de la bañera para vaciarla de agua.
El desayuno era completo, había mucha variedad aunque no lo reponían con mucha frecuencia y hubo más de un producto que no pudimos probar, pero lo que probámos estaba buenísimo, se nota la calidad de los productos utilizados! eso si... no conozco el precio!!!
Lo que no nos gustó fué el spa y los vestuarios de mujeres, donde está el jacuzzi (que también hay en el vestuario de hombres) en el que me encontré por sorpresa una pareja dentro(mujer y hombre)!!
La atención del personal fue correcta, sobretodo la del staff que estaba por el hotel, nos escuchaban hablar francés entre nosotros y en seguida nos saludaban en francés!
El check out fue un poco largo, pero se perdona =)
Nos hubieramos quedado encantados en el hotel mucho más tiempo, que pena tener que marcharse!!!!",5,2013,03,02
46,agradable experiencia.,"bonito hotel, con buenas vistas! las habitaciones son muy buenas, bastante grandes, muy comodas. aconsejo las habitaciones vista al mar. el spa y piscina pueden mejorar. Agradable experiencia, cerca del centro pero se puede desconectar. vuelvo!",4,2013,02,03
46,Corta estancia en el Miramar,"Aprovechamos una rápida escala en Barcelona para pasar una noche en el hotel Miramar.
La moderna construcción es realmente bonita, con grandes espacios nivelados con mucho encanto. La situación es excepcional, muy cerca y a la vez a distancia conveniente de la gran ciudad. Las vistas son soberbias. El personal, preparado y educado, atiende con gran cortesía a los visitantes.
Pero fallan varias cosas. Primero, este ambiente despersonalizado, da la sensación que este hotel podría ubicarse, tal cual sin cambio alguno, en cualquier lugar del mundo. No existe la simpática historia del inmueble (Miramar, la tv de la Barcelona de los años sesenta), no existen las próximas (y legendarias) instalaciones olímpicas de Barcelona 92, no existe Montjuic, ignoran el idioma propio de Cataluña por completo (hasta TV3 aparece en la lista de emisoras como “en español”), ni la misma ciudad de Barcelona existe, es sólo un decorado frío y sin interactividad.
La habitación no es precisamente grande (sí el baño), el mantenimiento del mobiliario es correcto pero se empieza a notar el desgaste de la cama. La ducha funciona muy bien, pero se equivocaron en instalar el soporte y no hay manera de colgarla. Los impresos disponibles en el dormitorio están muy usados, en papel de mala calidad y peor impresión.
Más decepcionante es el -mediocre- desayuno, impropio de un hotel de cinco estrellas y nada que ver con el Juan Carlos I o el Palace, establecimientos hermanos del Miramar.
Esos defectos no compensan las cualidades descritas al principio, a no ser que la tarifa fuera extraordinaria, como realmente ocurrió en nuestro caso.",3,2013,01,30
46,Excelente Hotel,"Excelente hotel, decorado con muy buen gusto. Tiene unas buenas vistas sobre el puerto y Barcelona. A veces tienen un menú de degustación, que vale la pena probar.
Hotel para sibaritas, en un entorno más tranquilo.
Me encantó",5,2013,01,29

46,Gran hotel en una situación privilegiada,"He tenido la oportunidad de conocer a un gran hotel, con un servicio excelente, en una localización y con unas vistas únicas en Barcelona, y que hasta la fecha era un gran desconocido para mi, sin duda alguna repetiré la experiencia de estar alojado en uno de los hoteles de lujo más recomendables de toda Barcelona, con un servicio y un equipo excelente de personas.",5,2012,12,27
46,Barcelona a tus pies,"Hotel excelente, situado en Montjuïc, con vistas a la ciudad y el mar. Desde la terraza tienes la sensación de tener Barcelona y el mar a tus pies. Zona muy tranquila y unos jardines preciosos. Totalmente recomendable desde todos los puntos de vista. Todo el personal muy simpáticos y atentos, encantadores. Dispone de zona de spa, sauna, piscina (interior y al airelibre), ..... La comida muy buena, tienen un menú degustación muy recomendable y el desayuno fantástico. A unos minutos a pie de Colón, para regresar, después de pasear por la ciudad cogimos un taxi en Colón sólo por 5 €. Repitiremos cuando volvamos a Barcelona.",5,2012,12,16
46,Tranquilidad y lujo desde las mejores vistas de Barcelona,"Las mejores vistas de Barcelona: ciudad, mar y montaña. Situado en Montjuïc, el Hotel Miramar es una experiencia única para disfrutar de la ciudad. Alejado del bullicio del centro para gozar de la tranquilidad de la montaña, pero lo suficientemente próximo para disfrutar de la ciudad. Todos los servicios, spa, sauna, piscina... excelente comida y personal agradable. Todas las atenciones.

46,Excelente estancia en el Hotel Miramar Barcelona!!!,"Hotel excelente para visitar Barcelona!! Reúne todo lo necesario para disfrutar de Barcelona.
Esta ubicado en la montaña de Montjuic y en 10' estas aislado del ruido de la ciudad. Es como un resort urbano!! Las vistas son fantásticas, el entorno excelente donde puedes disfrutar de mucha tranquilidad, muy acogedor, las habitaciones amplias, confortables y con terraza. Tienen todo lo necesario para descansar de lujo!! Trato exquisito por parte de todo el personal del hotel.
Tiene una piscina exterior preciosa y unos jardines fantásticos para disfrutar de los dias de sol.
El Spa tiene piscina climatizada con cascada de agua, jacuzzi, sauna, fuente de hielo... y todo en un ambiento muy relajado.
La comida del restaurante buenísima, tienen un menú degustación muy recomendable y el desayuno fantástico. Lo mejor es que puedes comer en su terraza con fantásticas vistas a los jardines exteriores.
Recomiendo a todo el mundo mi experiencia e incluso a los habitantes de Barcelona hacer una visita y pasar un día en este fantástico hotel.",5,2012,12,07
46,Bonito hotel,"Habitaciones espaciosas con un baño muy comodo y limpio, de 5 estrellas. 
Magnifica terraza con vistas al puerto de barcelona, aunque con mucho ruido del puerto!!!

El menu degustación és delicioso, lástima que solo el metre habla catalan (ni en recepción, ni para el desayuno, ni en el restaurante) y cuesta encontrar alguien que nos acoja y hable con fluidez en castellano!!!

Si quereis aprovechar del Spa, aseguraros que tienen hora libre para los masajes, también es complicado cambiar la cita puesto que siempre estan completos.

El hotel esta muy bien situado, cerca del teleferic y el metro, 

La habitaciones y el servicio de limpieza es impecable.",4,2012,10,11
46,Molto bene,"Siamo stati tre giorni e abbiamo gradito tutto lo splendore di questo albergo.

Das Hotel liegt auf dem Montjuice mit prächtiger Sicht auf den hafen und über Barcelona, dabei sehr ruhig gelegen. 200 m vom Hotel entfernt liegt die Bergstation der Seilbahn in den Hafen, ist ein MUSS!, diese Fahrt zu machen.
Das Zimmer war sehr modern und geräumig mit einem seh grossen, gut eingerichteten Bad. 
Der eizige Wermutstropfen ist der Service, beim Frühstück sehr unfreundlich (und zwar alle drei Mal), die Reception nicht kompetent und die männlichen Angestellten überheblich.",4,2012,07,04

46,Un desastre de servicio. SPA,"Estoy completamente de acuerdo con la primera parte de la opinión del 17 de abril. Reservamos unos bonos Groupalia y hace meses que intentamos ponernos en contacto con ellos. No hay manera. No responden a los mails, no responden al teléfono... los chicos de recepcion, eso sí, muy amablemente dicen comprender el problema. En una de las numerosas ocasiones que llamé me comentaron que les había sorprendido el éxito de la campaña y que claro, no pueden coger el teléfono porqué estan haciendo masajes? ein? señores, se han planteado contratar a una persona para gestionar la agenda????? Es increible, he contratado vales a través de Groupalia en varias ocasiones y nunca han habido tantas complicaciones enseguida atienden las llamadas, y eso que se trata de centros de estética pequeños. Nunca me imaginé que un hotel que pretende ser de lujo funcionara tan mal. Les he dejado mi teléfono en varias veces, ""no se preocupe señora que nos ponemos en contacto con el spa para que la llamen enseguida o le respondan el correo..."" pues ni una respuesta. Total, que a día de hoy aún no tenemos hora. Y ahora sólo faltará que el dia de autos (si lo consigo) el servicio, tal y cómo comenta la opinión del día 17 de abril,  no sea lo que ofrecieron!!!!!!",1,2012,06,26
46,Sehr schönes Hotel,"Das Hotel ist wünderschön. Eine tolle Lage. Auf dem Berg man hat eine wunderschöne Ausicht. Uf das Meer, Hafen und Barcelona. Toll. Wir hatten eine Suite mit eine grosse Terasse. So schön. Die Suite war sehr gross, schön eingerichtet sehr sauber. Wir hatten Roomservice das Essen war ausgezeichnet. Das Hotel hat ein Spa und wellnes bereich traumhaft. Draussen eine Poolanlage mit einem wünderschönem Garten.Sehr schön. Das Hotel innen bereich war sehr schön richtig luxus pur. Also habe nur das beste für das Hotel. Hatte einen super Aufenthalt. Wurde wider kommen. Ausgezeichnet.",5,2012,06,18
46,Esto es lujo!!!!,"Si quereis conocer el lujo de cerca este es vuestro lugar!!!  Estuve un par de días con mi pareja y debo decir que el hotel me ha encantado!  Las habitaciones son espaciosas además de contar con una terraza lo cual para los que hayais estado en Barcelona es dificil de encontrar.  Las instalaciones del hotel perfectas y relajantes y el spa bastante correcto, la verdad es que para ser de acceso gratuito está bastante bien!
Estaba preocupado por algunos comentarios sobre un campo de tiro pero la verdad de los 4 días que estuvimos no lo sentí en lo absoluto todo era paz y tranquilidad en los alrededores del hotel.
Por ultimo decir que tienen un personal estupendo dispuestos a ayudarnos en todo momento desde la recepción hasta el restaurante.
Para no extenderme más lo resumo:  Es un hotel de lujo al que volveré y recomendaré!",5,2012,06,15
46,una estafa el spa,"Cogimos una oferta del spa, consistía en un masaje de 40 minutos y dos horas de spa. En recepción nos atendieron  fenomenal, pero en el spa................  un desastre. Primero no conseguiamos contactar para pedir hora, llamamos mas de 15 veces en horarios y dias diferentes y no habia manera de contactar, pedimos hora a traves de email, que no se diganron a contestar, y cuando consegui contactar despues de 10 dias..... se pone a la defensiva y me habla como si y fuera una cualquiera, no como una clienta y casi que me regaña y todo. Falta de educacion y de saber estar para tratar con el publico. Cuando a la gente le molesta su trabajo y los clientes tendria que quedarse en su casa, parecia que aun me hacia un favor dandome hora. 
El dia que fuimos, nos dieron una taquilla para dos. El masaje de 40  minutos se convirtio en uno de escasos 10 en los que solo nos pusieron una crema en la cara y crema en los hombros......alucinante!!!!!! 
Las dos horas de spa, era una piscina interior con agua opaca y sucia , fria y las paredes y techos llenos de moho. 
Lleno de niños saltando a lo bomba... y un jacusi en el que habia que hacer cola.....
No entiendo como llaman a eso un hotel gran lujo con spa..... la masajista lo peor!!!!!!!!",2,2012,04,17
46,"Gran hotel, lamentable servicio","Mi hija nos regaló por su cumpleaños con toda la ilusión una estancia en este hotel. Encontró una suculenta oferta por internet a través de byhours.com
Nos pareció una excepcional idea poder conocer y disfrutar de este singular hotel, pero no sabíamos la que nos esperaba.
Es evidente que un hotel de cinco estrellas gran lujo tiene unas instalaciones excepcionales...pero la experiencia ha sido más bien nefasta.
Por donde empezar?
Mucha ocupación no debían tener cuando encontramos a la recepcionista leyendo el periodico. La recepción es una mesa de despacho que más bien parece que vayas a un banco a suscribir una poliza de seguros.
El restaurante, cerrado.
Fuimos al snack-bar donde nos atendió una camarera que no entendia español (o se hacía la sueca). Pedimos unas ""tapas"": Buñuelos pequeños y aceitosos, croquetas congeladas de pésima calidad y cerveza caliente. Tuvimos que levantarnos para coger unas servilletas pues ni había en nuestra mesa ni nos las ofrecieron. No comimos apenas nada dada la nefasta calidad de la comida. Y pagamos la nada despreciable cifra de 40€. Entendible pues que nos cruzaramos con un repartidor de Telepizza en el hall.
La habitación (307) bien. Pero: ni un solo amenitie, faltaban toallas de mano, no había ni un solo detalle de bienvenida...es más, la recepcionista nos advirtió (por no decir amenazó) con que no tocaramos los bombones porque nos los cobrarían con recargo.
Evidentemente, no tratamos de disfrutar del desayuno dada la calidad de la comida de la noche anterior...y del precio: 25€ por persona. Un auténtico abuso!!
Cierto que la reserva fue echa con una oferta, pero, señores! Si lo que quieren es promocionar el hotel, atraer nueva y diferente clientela a su establecimiento, HÁGANLO DIGNAMENTE!! Aunque no tengamos un poder adquisitivo suficiente para permitirnos un gran hotel como el suyo, no tenemos porque sufrir también con ustedes los recortes.",1,2012,03,12
46,Mes que un hotel,"Splendida vista, ottimo servizio, piscina spettacolare, camere pulite, il ristorante e la prima colazioni sono forse eccessivamente care ma non può sorprendere in un hotel di questo livello. Ottimo il servizio in piscina dove é possibile fare dei veloci, quanto gustosi, spuntini. Per il ritorno serale e' quasi d'obbligo il taxi",5,2011,12,11
46,kein Preisleistungsverhältnis,"Wir 52 und 48....Ja, das Hotel hat eine tolle Lage mit super Blick auf die Stadt und den Hafen, aber das ist auch alles. Die Luxusliner und Fährschiffe haben mächtig laute Generatoren, die die ganze Zeit laufen, wenn sie anlegen...ein kontinuierliches dumpfes Dröhnen. und hinter dem Haus liegt ein Schießstand. Es wird tatsächlich den ganzen Tag auch am WE dort geschossen!! Wir hatten eine Suite und somit eine wundervolle und riesige Dachterrasse..,das Schönste am ganzen Zimmer,.aber den Vogelschiss auf den Polstern der Liege, wurde auch nach Aufforderung nicht gesäubert. Geht gar nicht. Der Wellnessbereich: die Masssage war fantastisch...der Raum, eine Oase der Ruhe ...weit gefehlt....viel zu kalt, und durch die nicht von Hand steuerbare Klimaanlage mit einem enorm lauten Getöse kaum zu ertragen. Wenn die Massage nicht so gut gewesen wäre, ware ich kein zweites Mal dahingegangen. Habe mir vorsichtshalber Ohrenstöpsel mitgenommen. War auch gut so, denn obwohl ich an der Rezeption gebeten hatte, die Klimaanlage leiser und weniger kühl zu stellen, was man mir auch zugesichert hatte, ist dies nicht geschehen. Die Rezeption reagierte mit Unverständnis, denn angeblich hätte der Service die Änderung bestätigt...fragt sich bloß wo. Der Außenpool ist nicht beheizt und war im Oktober ziemlich kalt, trotz 27 Grad Außentemperatur. Die Poolbar war in der Woche wo wir da waren 3 x geöffnet. In den Unterlagen stand...wetterabhängig...na was kann man bei 27 Grad und einer Menge Poolgäste wohl falsch machen...Service gleich null...alles sehr stylisch, aber unpraktisch. Das Bad aus dem Schlafzimmer abgehend, obwohl es auch einen Wohnbereich gab, nur mit Glasschiebetür..und somit geruchsbelästigend und tatsächlich konnte man nur von einer Seite des Bettes das Licht im Bad anmachen...Im Bad selber war kein Schalter....Hieß entweder die ganze Nacht das Licht an, bei Glas nicht so praktisch  oder einer musste sich durchs die Dunkelheit tasten...Also der gesamte Service war nicht gut...Ich habe eine Allergie und kann kein normales Brot essen...man sicherte uns glutenfreies Brot zu. Kam aber erst am 2.Tag...Es dauerte bis zu 25 Minuten bevor ich mein Brot erhielt...in der Zeit hatte mein Freund bereits zu Ende gefrühstückt- Der Service ist arrogant und  ohne  Wärme und Herzlichkeit.....Kann nur sagen nie wieder...selbst wenn man für die Übernachtung 300 EUR weniger zahlen würde!!!Sorry, aber das war wirklich schlecht und wird einem 5 Sternehotel überhaupt nicht gerecht!!",2,2011,11,29
46,Hotel de 5 estrellas pero pésimo servicio!!!!!!,"-Las sábanas estaban manchadas de sangre, increíble!!!!!!!!
Un Hotel fantástico, perfecto, pero no céntrico, según dice en su web.
Al llegar comunicamos la falta de información y no nos hicieron caso, hoy en día sigue igual. 
--  Hay que cogerTaxis si queréis ir a la Feria de Congresos o al centro de la ciudad.
-El spa esta todo apagado, no funciona nada excepto el jacuzzi.
-Reclamamos y no había un responsable en el Hotel, sólo recepcionistas.
Un Hotel de 5 estrella pero de pésimo servicio!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2,2011,10,30
46,"inmejorable hotel para escaparte de barcelona y disfrutar de la tranquilidad, las vistas y la buena compañía","Estuvimos dos días en el hotel, solo una noche, y todo fue genial
Tanto la habitación como las instalaciones eran ideales, especialmente la bañera y la terraza de la suite. Me encantó que a tan poco del centro de Bcn pudiera disfrutar de esa tranquilidad y esas vistas.
la piscina, aunque pequeña, es lo que más disfrutamos, y queremos destacar el servicio excelente recibido por el Staff, la chica que nos amenizó, atendió y sirvió se llamaba Rose y fue única en todo momento, nos encantó y nos hizo pasar una agradable mañana en la piscina. 
el restaurante también nos gustó, sobretodo el arroz con gambas,,, aunque no nos acabó de convencer el menú degustación, ya que debería haber habido más platitos aunque con menos cantidad, sino debería llamarse solo menu puesto que comimos un aperitivo, un entrante y un pescado... ni carne, ni más variedad en los entrantes o aperitivos... pero nos gustó.
El desayuno fue genial y tranquilo, excepto que algun staff, imaginamos que en prácticas, no nos entendía en español....
sin duda lo recomendaríamos y espero acepten nuestras críticas de forma positiva ;-)",4,2011,07,07
46,"Miramar, ein Blick über Barcelona","Wir hatten ein ruhiges Zimmer mit Blick auf die Stadt und den Hafen. Das Frühstücksbüffet bot eine große Auswahl. Die Stadt (placa real) ist gut zu Fuß zu erreichen, für den Rückweg haben wir ein Taxi benutzt (steil!). Ca. 100m vom Hotel ist eine Haltestelle (Miramar) des Rundfahrten-Bus. Vergünstigte Tickets gibt es im Hotel.

Die Zimmer haben keine Türen an Bad/Toilette; aufgrund der Anordnung und Lüftung ist dies jedoch kein Problem.

Hinter dem Hotel ist eine Schießanlage; auf dieser Seite kann Lärmbelästigung auftreten.

>>> Das Hotel ist eine sehr gute Adresse für alle, die die Hektik und den Lärm der Stadt meiden wollen!",5,2011,04,16
46,Un alástima el campo de tiro que hay al lado,"Pasamos mi marido y yo el fin de semana en el hotel Miramar buscando tranquilidad y relax y nos encontramos con la pesadilla de oir desde las 8.30 de la mañana los disparos del campo de tiro que hay justo detrás. Es intolerable para un 5 estrellas de lujo. Las habitaciones que dan a la parte posterior del hotel están en frente del campo de tiro y el ruido es muy molesto. Lástima porque esto fastidió completamente nuestra estancia. El personal no supo qué decirnos, estamos seguros que muchos otros clientes se habrán quejado. No volveremos. No lo recomendamos en absoluto.",1,2011,03,14
46,"Pésimo 5*, peor atención","Reservé una habitación en el hotel para celebrar el cumpleaños de mi pareja. 

Trabajo organizando eventos y me gusta probarlos a menudo para ver si puedo mandar grupos y / o organizar eventos en sus instalaciones. Decididamente, NUNCA mandaré ni recomendaré este hotel a nadie. He estado en muchos hoteles y este es una de los peores. Parece que les han regalado las 5* y el GL en algún sitio, las instalaciones son correctas pero la atención del personal y los detalles es lo que marca la diferencia y en este hotel no solo son escasos sino que brillan por su ausencia.

Cuando llegamos nos atendieron de forma muy fría y poco profesional. Nos dimos cuenta que nos habían dado la habitación de la planta baja que, además de ser la habitación adaptada para gente con minusvalías, no tenía vistas. Lo único bueno de la habitación era el yacuzzi que había en la terraza que, sin haberlo avisado, no funcionaba en invierno y estaba tapado con una horrible cobertura verde. El hotel estaba practicamente vacío y pedimos el cambio a una habitación con vistas pero la persona de recepción nos contestó de mala manera que no tenían ninguna (repito, el hotel estaba vacío).
Al entrar en la habitación hacía un fío horrible y la calefacción no se podía graduar desde dentro.
Para tratar de relajarnos y quitarnos la mala sensación que teníamos decidimos ir a visitar el spa. Hacía un frío horrible y nos llevamos una sorpresa al ver que las luces de la piscina estaban apagadas. Pregunté a una persona del servicio y nos comentó que la piscina estaba siempre así con lo que si queríamos nadar teníamos que hacerlo medio a oscuras. Decidimos ir al yacuzzi y nos explicaron que estaban separados en los vestuarios de hombres y de mujeres. Aún así, el de mujeres estaba estropeado y tuvimos que ir los dos al de hombres. Al llegar estaba todo inundado y lleno de toallas en el suelo. Nos metimos en el agua y estaba helada. Quisimos usar la sauna y el hammam pero estaban apagados. Había un botón con una nota que decía que para usarlos había que apretar el botón y esperar 20minutos!!! hasta que se encendiera.
Volvimos, decepcionados, a la habitación y decidimos contentarnos mirando la televisión. Sorpresa! La televisión se veía mal y tenía muy pocos canales sintonizados. 
El baño tenía solo una botellita de champú y una de gel a compartir entre 2 personas y ningún otro tipo de complemento de aseo (ni acondicionador para el pelo).

Lo único que salvó la estancia en el hotel fue el desayuno por la mañana, que fue correcto. Aún así, los he visto mejores en hoteles de 4 estrellas.

Entiendo que los hoteles tengan poca ocupación y ofrezcan tarifas reducidas para llenar sus habitaciones pero esto no justifica que disminuya la calidad del establecimiento ni la atención del personal.",1,2011,02,24
46,Toller Blick - spitzen Zimmer,"Habe dort 2 Tage anläßlich einer Management Konferenz verbracht.
Das Zimmer war absolute Spitzenklasse: blick aufs Meer, die Stadt und den Hafen; tolle und hochwertige Ausstattung insbesondere das Bad; ausgesprochen gepflegt und sauber. Das Frühstück war ebenfalls ausgezeichnet und der Service war in Ordnung.
Einzig die Rezeption scheint bei starken Andrang etwas überfordert. Die Meetingräume sind ebenfalls OK, wobei auf die Einstellung der Klmaanlage geachtet werden sollte.
Die Außen-Poolanlage ist schön angelegt und gepflegt.",5,2010,10,21
46,Elegant über Barcelona,"Die Lage des Miramar ist einzigartig in Barcelona. Hierher kommen i.d.R. nur Touristen, die mit dem Cable Car über den Hafen schweben. Hier zu übernachten ist gerade in den Sommermonaten die richtige Wahl. Man ist mit dem Taxi in 6 Minuten an den Ramblas oder kann zu Für eine netten Spaziergang dorhin machen. Das Hotel hat einen guten 5-Sterne Komfort. Die Zimmer sind groß und stylisch, teilweise mit freistehender Badewanne eingerichtet. Einige Zimmer haben den Blick direk zum Meer über den Hafen hinweg. Im Garten befindet sich ein gepflegter Swimmingpool, der nach einem Sighseeintag die notwendige Entspannung und Abkühlung bietet. Der Service am Pool ist genau so professionell wie im ganzen Haus. Zusätzlich steht noch ein Indoor Pool für die kühlere Jahreszeit zur Verfügung. Das Hotel berechnet keine Parkgebühren, was ein riesen Vorteil in Barcelona ist.",5,2010,09,21
46,Erhohlung ud Städtereise,"Für uns das ideale Hotel, um Barcelona zu entdecken. Das Miramar liegt, für eine Stadt ungewöhnlich, in einem grünen Park auf dem Mont Juic und ist daher trotzdem noch sehr zentral, zu Fuß etwa 15 Minuten zu La Rambla. Zurück sind wir mit dem Taxi gefahren 6€ - es geht schon sehr steil den Berg rauf, wenn man zurück möchte. Die Sightseeing Busse halten fast direkt vor dem Hotel, so dass man auch damit die Stadt erkunden kann. Die Zimmer waren sehr geräumig. Abends bietet es sich an, auf der Terasse noch ein Glas Wein zu trinken und die Aussicht auf den Park und über die Stadt zu genießen. Die Nähe zur den Sehenswürdigkeiten und ein toller Pool ermöglichen es, Entspannung und Stadterkundung zu kombinieren.",5,2010,08,12
46,Spitzenhotel in Barcelona,"Das Hotel Miramara in Barcelona gehört der Hotelvereinigung Small Luxury Hotels an und dies ganz zurecht. Das Hotel war sehr durchgestylt und sehr luxuriös. Schon der Empfang ist sehr professionell, indem man nicht an einem Tresen steht, sondern an einen Schreibtisch gebeten wird. Nach den kurzen Formalitäten wird man persönlich auf sein Zimmer begleitet, das Gepäck wird nahezu zeitgleich auf das Zimmer gebracht. Das Zimmer bestand aus mehreren Räumen, einem Flur, einem Schlafzimmer mit großer Couch und Schreibtisch, einem großen Bad mit freistehender Badewanne und großer Regendusche und einem separatem WC. Die Minibar war bereits im Zimmerpreis inkludiert. Ein weiteres Highlight war die große Terrasse mit 2 gemütlichen Sesseln. Die öffentlichen Bereiche des Hotels waren sehr gepflegt, insb. erwähnen möchte ich hier den Wellness-Bereich mit einem Innen- als auch Außenpool, mehreren Saunen, einem Dampfbad, einem Wirlpool und einem Fitnessraum. Die Gartenanlage um das Hotel war ebenfalls sehr großzügig und man hatte einen tollen Blick über ganz Barcelona einschl. Hafen, da das Hotel sich auf dem Montjuis, dem Hausberg von Barcelona befindet. Wir waren von dem Hotel wirklich sehr begeistert, so dass man sich fast überwinden musste das Hotel zu verlassen, um die Stadt zu erkunden.",5,2010,08,08
46,"Eigentlich nett, aber laut","Das schöne Hotel mit einem netten kleinen Spa-Bereich, netter Pool-Anlage, schöner Terrasse mit wunderbarem Blick in den Hafen von Barcelona hätte eigentlich mehr verdient. Aber es liegt nun mal genau zwischen (oberhalb) dem Hafen und einem Schießplatz(?). Das heißt: den day-off am Pool kann man bestenfalls mit Kopfhörer oder sonstiger Beschallung verbringen, denn die unregelmäßigen - aber konstanten - Schüsse vom 50 Meter entfernten Schießplatz sind nervtötend. Und ist mal 20 Minuten Ruhe und man ist gerade schön eingedöst, erschrickt man umso mehr.

Der Service ist als eher rudimentär zu bezeichenen und wird der Hotel-Anlage nicht gerecht.

Schade eigentlich.",3,2010,07,05
46,Wen das Gewusel der Ramblas nervt...,"Bewusst haben wir dieses Hotel quasi ""über den Dächern"" von Barcelona gewählt. Nicht, dass wir den Trubel rund um die Ramblas nicht mögen, aber wenn man den ganzen Tag auf Entdeckungstour ist, mögen wir's zum Relaxen gerne ruhig. Der Blick ist phantastisch, das Ambiente des Hotels und der Zimmer ansprechend modern und der Service zuvorkommend. Nur die Nebenkosten (wie 25,- € für das Frühstück und 5.- € für ein Miniglas Weisswein am Pool) sind sehr üppig bemessen. Das aber ist in ganz Barcelona so. Die Küche des Restaurants ist lecker.
Einziger Punkt, den man bemängeln könnte: Die Toilette ist in einer milchverglasten ""Zelle"" (ebenso die Dusche), was ein sehr vertrautes Verhältnis der Bewohner voraussetzt :)",5,2010,06,08
46,5 Serne-Bewertungen übertrieben,"Das Hotel sieht architektonisch auf den ersten Bick nett aus, beim zweiten Blick fallen aber erstaunliche Mängel auf - auch bem Service. 

Im Bad des erst 2006 fertiggestellten Hotels roch es deutlich nach Muff und Schimmel. Der Abluftkanal war lose in die Deckenverkleidung gesteckt, er ragte halb heraus und um den Kanal herum war die Deckenverkleidung angefault und aufgebläht und war offensichtlich an dieser Stelle erbeits mehrfach überpinselt worden. Den Muff- ud Fälnisgeruch wurde wir während des gesamten Afenthlates nicht los Wir zogen den Kanal eines Tages ganz heraus, so daß er frei in der Luft baumelte. Trotz Zimmerservice wurde das nicht repariert.

An der Deckenverkledung des Flurs war ebenfalls eine deutlich sichtbare, überpinselte Stelle, die angefault war. Die Verkleidung hing zudem an einer Ecke deutlich sichtbar herunter. Auch im Bad und an einer anderen Stelle des Flurs hing sie herunter.

Es war keine Toilettenbürste vorhanden, und auch der Zimmerservice hat wohl keine ....

Im Bad waren die Abschlüsse der Fliesen nicht fachgerecht ausgebildet. Man konnte teilweise hinter die Fliesen und auf den Klebemörtelblicken, weil keine Abschlussleiste oder Silikon angebracht waren. Dadurch hatte sich offensichtlich hinter den Fliesen ein Biotop von ""Silberfischen"" gebildet.

Der Holztisch in unserem Zimmer hatte deutliche Kratzer, wie auch viele Zimmertüren und Wände. In der Nähe des Serviceraums des Zimmerservice sahen Wände und Tür schäbig aus.

Am letzten Abend wollten wir unseren Aufenthalt in Ruhe an der Bar ausklingen lassen. Mit ""Ruhe"" wurde es aber nichts, da der Barraum kurze Zeit später von den Teilnehmern der Vertriebsveranstaltung eines Kosmetikunternehmens geradezu überflutet wurde. Es war kein Gespräch mehr möglich, man konnte sich kaum bewegen und das Personal hatte plötzlich keine Zeit mehr für uns. Wir konnten nichts mehr bestellen, auch keine Rechnung. Es war offensichtlich zu wenig Personal da, denn dieses hetzte um uns herum im Dauerlauf, um die Teilnehmer der Veranstaltung zu versorgen.

Das Frühstücksbuffet war sehr übersichtlich. Man hat zwar einen schönen Blick, aber die Auswahl war gering, der Frühstücksspeck lederartig und lauwarm, mit Messer und Gabel kaum zu ""verarbeiten"".

Unser Balkon war nicht zum Meer ausgerichtet, das war so gebucht. Aber der Boden des Balkons über uns bestand nur aus Holzdelen, in in eine Abstand von etwa 2 cm verlegt waren. An zwei Tagen tropfte durch diese Dielen Wasser hindurch,so daß wir unseren Balkon nicht nutzen konnten.

Die Tür zum Bakon war nur mit Kraftaufwand zu öffnen, weil diese sich gesetzt hatte. Das war für das Personal mit Sicherheit schon lange zu erkennen, aber beseitigt wurde es nicht.

Das Personal war jung, freundlich und engagiert, machte aber nicht den Eindruck, als wenn es in der Fünf-Sterne-Hotellerie Erfahrung hätte.

Quintessenz: Hier werden die gute Sicht und ein schöner Schein verkauft.",1,2010,03,22

46,Me destrozaron la celebración de mi aniversario,"Reservé hace 3 semanas una habitación ""Deluxe"" en éste hotel, que supone es un 5* Gran Lujo, la habitación a parte de otras comodidades contaba con un Jacuzzi en la terraza, motivo principal de mi reserva. Llegamos al hotel a las 6 de la tarde y aún nos hicieron esperar xq nuestra habitación no estaba lista (se supone q podiamos entrar a las 3), cuando subimos a la habitación, acompañados de un botones, nos explica un poco como funciona todo y se marcha. Salimos a la terraza dispuestos a darnos nuestro primer baño en el jacuzzi disfrutando de las vistas al mar y cual es nuestra sorpresa cuando no había manera de encenderlo...... llamamos a la recepción para que suba alguien a explicarnos como funciona y la señorita de recpción nos dice :Q lo siente, pero el jacuzzi no funciona y que lo siente. Es lo único que conseguimos que nos dijera; en ningún momento se ofreció a compensarnos por ésto, ni a cambiar la reserva de día (ya q especifiqué en la reserva que tenía especial interes en el jacuzzi), ni a nada de nada..... de echo es que si no hubieramos intentado encenderlo, no pensaban informarnos. ¿¿¿ésto es un hotel de 5*??? Perdón, pero me he alojado en 2* en los que el personal ha sido 1000 veces más profesional de los que hay en éste hotel cutre.......
Resultado: Me marché del hotel 20 minutos después de entrar, después de poner una queja en el libro de reclamaciones POR SUPUESTO, me quedé sin aniversario y la señorita de recepción ""lo siente""......¡¡INCREIBLE!!!",1,2009,06,08

El hotel nos parecio maravilloso, con unas habitaciones perfectamente equipadas, una cama impresionante y buenas vistas, con terraza incluida. La atención al cliente de ""Gran Lujo"". La situación perfecta para quien huya del centro, con posibilidad de dar unos largos paseos por Montjuic, ver la fundacion Miró, el museo nacional de cataluña, estacio olimpico, castillo, etc. 
Para ir al centro, utilizamos el coche. La ventaja es que si vas o vienes del aeropuerto, por ejemplo,  no tienes que cruzar Bna.
